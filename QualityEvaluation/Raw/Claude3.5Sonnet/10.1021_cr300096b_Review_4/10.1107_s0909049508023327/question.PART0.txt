It has previously been shown that there are many benefits to be obtained in
combining several techniques in one in situ set-up to study chemical processes in
action. Many of these combined set-ups make use of two techniques, but in some
cases it is possible and useful to combine even more. A set-up has recently been
developed that combines three X-ray-based techniques, small- and wide-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and quick-scanning EXAFS (QEXAFS), for
the study of dynamical chemical processes. The set-up is able to probe the same
part of the sample during the synthesis process and is thus able to follow changes
at the nanometre to micrometre scale during, for example, materials self-
assembly, with a time resolution of the order of a few minutes. The practicality of
this kind of experiment has been illustrated by studying zeotype crystallization
processes and revealed important new insights into the interplay of the various
stages of ZnAPO-34 formation. The flexibility of this set-up for studying other
processes and for incorporating other additional non-X-ray-based experimental
techniques has also been explored and demonstrated for studying the stability/
activity of iron molybdate catalysts for the anaerobic decomposition of
methanol.
Keywords: XAFS; SAXS; WAXS.
1. Introduction
There are distinct advantages to be found in combining
several independent analytical techniques to study chemical
processes as they occur. This is well illustrated in situations
where either the time resolution is so high that the results
of independent experiments are difficult to synchronize or
in cases where the sample environment is complicated and
the experiments might be difficult to reproduce exactly. In
addition, simultaneously performed experiments often enable
a more detailed understanding of the temporal behaviour
and interplay of, for instance, chemical species present
during solid formation, catalytic reactions etc. If one is
therefore interested in a sequence of events such as phase
transitions, changes in local chemical environments, crystal-
lization etc., the simultaneous acquisition of data from
combined multiple techniques can be rather useful and in
some cases crucial.
In synchrotron radiation research the above principles have
been implemented by, for instance, using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAFS) and diffraction (Sankar et al., 1993) or
the combination of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS and WAXS) (Bark et al., 1992; Bras et al., 1993).
Obviously this principle can be extended to the combination
of synchrotron radiation techniques with non-X-ray-based
techniques such as differential scattering calorimetry (DSC)
and SAXS/WAXS (Bras, Derbyshire, Devine et al., 1995), light
scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Zachmann & Wutz, 1993), Raman
scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Bryant et al., 1998), SAXS/FTIR
(Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) (Bras, Derbyshire,
Bogg et al., 1995), XAFS/FTIR (Newton et al., 2004), UVVis/
Raman/XAFS for both gas and liquid phase heterogeneous
catalysis (Beale et al., 2005; Briois et al., 2005) etc (Bras &
Ryan, 1998).
The choice of when it is sensible to use a combination of
simultaneous techniques is something that has to be carefully
weighed up since in most cases this approach results in the loss
of some data quality in at least one of the techniques. There
has to be a serious advantage in collecting the data simulta-
neously instead of utilizing optimized independent techniques.
An example of the loss of data quality is, for instance, in the
over- and under-focus of the X-ray beam in a combined
SAXS/WAXS experiment in the SAXS and WAXS detectors,
respectively. Also, the combination of, for instance, DSC with
EXAFS suffers from this since the requirement that the
sample should be accessible by X-rays is contradictory to the
requirement that the thermal environment of the sample
should be completely isolated. Notwithstanding these limita-
tions, there are cases where the synergy between the techni-
ques is obvious and which go beyond the simple circumvention
of the need to repeat identical experimental conditions for
separate measurements, which is, although seemingly a trivial
point, far from easy to achieve experimentally.
The wish to be able to follow crystallization and chemical
processes from the very early stage (where the structures have
not yet developed into sizes that can be studied with diffrac-
tion and scattering techniques) to the later stage where crys-
talline morphologies have formed and the subsequent growth
process could be characterized with respect to growth kinetics
have influenced the design of the XAFS beamline placed in
BM26A at the ESRF. We have developed equipment that
makes use of the QEXAFS (quick-scanning EXAFS) tech-
nique (Frahm, 1989, 1988) and have combined this with both
SAXS as well as WAXS. The equipment is designed to be able
to follow processes for which a time resolution of approxi-
mately 10 frames min1 is sufficient. If one wants to study
faster processes with spectroscopic techniques, this equipment
is not suitable and one should use either fast sequential
energy-scanning QEXAFS monochromators (Frahm et al.,
2004) or energy-dispersive techniques,
even though this means that, for the
latter, the samples are exposed to a
rather high temporal X-ray dose and
might suffer from radiation damage or,
for instance, chemical reactions might
be influenced by the X-rays (Mesu et al.,
2005).
In order to completely describe the
whole process it will be clear that one
has to start from a well characterized
sample and that the final product again
should be well characterized, maybe not
only with the techniques used in the
experiment
but
also
by
additional
techniques that can render extra infor-
mation such as microscopy (scanning
and transmission electron microscopy
etc.). There are numerous research
fields where the application of the
above-mentioned techniques could be rather useful. For
instance, in glass ceramics (Bras, 1998; Bras et al., 2005),
porous
materials
like
heteroatom-substituted
alumino-
phosphates (MeAPO) (Sankar et al., 1995), cement setting
(Scheidegger et al., 2000, 2001) and bone mineralization
(Savarino et al., 1998) are just some of the examples for which
the experimental techniques that are combined in our set-up
can render useful information.
As an example of the usefulness of the applied method we
show data on the crystallization of CoAPO. This system was
studied previously by in situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
and electron spin resonance (Weckhuysen et al., 2000), and
more recently by independent in situ XAFS and SAXS/WAXS
techniques (Grandjean et al., 2005), but since these results
were not obtained during one combined measurement it was
difficult to understand exactly how changes in each technique
corresponded to each other, so the finer details of the crys-
tallization process could not be understood.
2. Beamline and experimental set-up
The experiments were carried out on the Dutch Belgian
beamline BM26A at the ESRF (Borsboom et al., 1998). The
optical layout of the beamline is represented in Fig. 1. The
radiation source is the 0.4 T ESRF bending magnet. The
beamline receives 2 mrad of the radiation fan. The optics set-
up contains two mirrors: an (optional) upward-cooled colli-
mation mirror (1200  150  50 mm) with horizontal surface
grooves filled with a GaIn alloy on the surface parallel to the
X-ray beam, and a second focusing mirror which has the same
dimensions and specifications as the first although there are no
cooling grooves on the surface. For the collimation mirror
a cooling blade can be inserted into the grooves so that
side-cooling is achieved without unnecessary mechanical
constraint, which could affect the required bending accuracy.
The mirror has, besides the bare Si surface, a Pt-coated strip
along the length of the mirror. Depending on the energy, a

Figure 1
Optical layout of the BM26A beamline at ESRF. The optical elements are an (optional) collimating
mirror, a double-crystal sagittal focusing monochromator and a vertically focusing mirror. Both
mirrors have a strip with a bare silicon surface as well as a strip with a Pt coating. Depending on the
energy range and the requirement for higher harmonic rejection, one of the strips can be brought
into the beam by a sideways translation.
sideways translation can bring into the beam the appropriate
surface for higher harmonic rejection without needing to
change the mirror inclination. The determined factor of the
higher harmonic suppression is better than 105 using two
mirrors. The surface roughness is 1.5 A
 (r.m.s.) and the slope
error is less than 1.5 mrad over the whole surface. A Si(111)
monochromator was used for these experiments which has
the option of sagittal focusing, although for time-resolved
measurements this was not employed owing to the length of
time taken to bend the second crystal with respect to the time
resolution needed to perform QEXAFS measurements. The
second, focusing, mirror has the same dimensions and speci-
fications as the collimating mirror, apart from the cooling
grooves on the surface.
The layout of the experimental hutch for combined SAXS/
WAXS/EXAFS experiments is shown in Fig. 2. For the spec-
troscopy experiments we have the choice between a trans-
mission and a fluorescence configuration. The ionization
chambers used in the transmission geometry are low-noise
Oxford (Oxford-Danfysik) chambers designed specially for
XAS measurements and are read out by low-noise current
preamplifiers (manufactured by NOVELEC SA) having
voltage/frequency converters (operating from 0 to 1 MHz) on
the output connected to the scaler. The amplifiers have a
dynamical range for the input current from 0.1 mA to 10 nA
with six decades of magnitude. For fluorescence experiments
we utilize a nine-element monolithic Ge fluoresence detector
with digital XPRESS-XRay signal-processing electronics
(Derbyshire et al., 1999; Farrow et al., 1995).
The addition of SAXS to the already existing combined
XAFS/diffraction set-up is somewhat complicated since a long
kapton-windowed (two windows both 40 mm thick) vacuum
chamber has to be inserted between the sample and the SAXS
detector. However, the transmitted intensity also has to be
measured to a high accuracy and the presence of the SAXS
flight tube and the requirement to preserve the SAXS data
quality prevents the use of a conventionally used ion chamber.
Still, an ion chamber can be used by mounting it on a trans-
lation stage parallel to a He-filled flight tube and driving it into
position when the spectroscopy data is collected. Unfortu-
nately this adds several moving components to the system. The
alternative is to mount an accurate photodiode on the position
of the SAXS beam stop. The latter option is only possible with
a somewhat larger beam stop and a very stable beam.
All the data discussed in this work have been obtained by
using a photodiode ODD-15W (15 mm2 active area) from
Opto Diode.
The SAXS/WAXS data were recorded simultaneously using
a combination of two detectors. For the SAXS data a gas-filled
quadrant detector positioned at a distance of 1.8 m from the
sample was used. This detector has the advantage of a larger
active area that a two dimensional detector offers, but avoids
the requirement of post-processing the data via a radial inte-
gration (Gabriel & Dauvergne, 1982).
For the WAXS data a position-sensitive curved gaseous
INEL CPS 590 detector was used (Bras et al., 1993). Both
these detectors are intrinsically count-rate limited. However,
this does not pose a problem with the time resolution that can
be achieved with this method/set-up since the largest part of
the duty cycle is taken up by the scanning of the mono-
chromator which is mechanically limited (with a maximum
scanning speed of 1 s1). In a data collection period of 24 s
acceptable scattering data can be obtained.

(minimum entire spectrum collection time of 60 s and a
typical energy resolution of 1.7 eV point1) in combination
with (quasi-)simultaneous WAXS and SAXS data collection at
a fixed energy (typical data collection time 20 s frame1). In
Fig. 3 we show the timephoton-energy profile that we have
used in these experiments. As can be seen from the figure, the
X-ray diffraction/scattering data is acquired while the mono-
chromator is kept in a fixed position from a minimum of 2 s
(depending on the required sampling data statistics) before a
subsequent energy scan is started, during which the XAFS
data are collected.
Depending on the required energy scan range this can last
from 10 to 60 s, though the photon flux on the sample is
sufficient to achieve even higher time resolutions. After the
XAFS scan is complete, the monochromator is rotated back to
the starting energy and the whole process is started again. In
principle, this method is straightforward; however, complica-
tions can arise owing to the fact that one prefers to acquire the
scattering data at energies between 8 and 15 keV while the
X-ray absorption edge of interest falls outside this range. The
reason for the preferred energy range for scattering data
collection is that the extent of the parasitic scattering cone
is photon-energy-independent, but the scattering pattern
becomes rather compressed with regard to scattering vector
range at higher photon energies. In this case the low angle
resolution, and therefore the advantage of performing this
technique combination, is lost.
In theory one could also collect scattering data during the
energy scan, making use of the rapid change in X-ray scat-
tering cross section to perform anomalous SAXS and WAXS
measurements. Thus far we have not attempted this seriously
since the issues regarding detector calibrations and the data
quality are not simple to solve.
The data acquisition software was developed at the SRS
Daresbury Laboratory and adapted to be able to control the
motor and detector systems of the BM26A beamline.
Depending on the design of the sample cell, it is feasible to
also collect data using non-X-ray-based techniques; in the case
where optical methods are employed, the implementation is
fairly straightforward.
The advantage of using energy-dispersive schemes is a
better time-resolution up to the millisecond scale, but the
disadvantage is a high risk of the beam influence on the
processes in the sample because of extremely high photon
density in the beam spot. For example, the polychromatic
photon density at an energy-dispersive beamline at ESRF is
1012 photons s1 in a 20 mm beam spot and there are some
indications that the beam actually induces damage to the
liquid samples we have used in our measurements (Mesu et al.,
2005). In a comparison of the XAFS data obtained with an
energy-dispersive beamline we found indications that the
X-ray beam influences the reaction mixture in the cuvette
whereas some previous measurements on BM26A using a
standard scanning set-up with the same samples demonstrate
that the radiation damage was negligible. Also, the compli-
cation would arise that from the pink beam we would obtain a
quasi-Laue pattern while the SAXS data would have to be de-
smeared. These problems do not inhibit all experiments, but if
not required on the basis of time-resolution it is evident that
one is better off using the QEXAFS scheme.
In our set-up we used a beam spot of 0.5 mm  0.5 mm
and the photon flux was 109 photons s1; then the photon
density was less by a factor 105106 in comparison with the
energy-dispersive set-up at ESRF.
2.1. Experimental conditions
Illustrating the possibilities and the usefulness of the
combined approach, we discuss here the results obtained from
two different types of experiment: a study of the crystallization
of a microporous Zn2+-doped aluminium phosphate and an
iron molybdate catalyst during anaerobic decomposition of
methanol. In a typical synthesis of ZnAPO with 2.5 wt% Zn,
the following chemicals were used: 0.131 g Zn(NO3)3.4H2O
(Acros Organics 99%), 69 ml H3PO4 (Acros Organics 85 wt%
in water), 1.04 ml triethylamine (Acros Organics 99%) and
0.658 g pseudobohemite alumina CATAPAL B 73.6 wt%
Al2O3 (Sasol North America Inc.). The white amorphous
precursor gel used in the experiments possessed the stoi-
chiometry
ZnxAl1xPO4
where
x
=
0.05
(zinc
content
2.5 wt%) and a pH of 3.5 (Christensen et al., 1998). The
preparation of an iron molybdate catalyst is described else-
where (Beale et al., 2008). Since such processes normally take
place over a number of hours, the time resolution was
accordingly adapted to the process and set to 5 min frame1.
Thus a total cycle time of 5 min was employed for both sets of
experiments to collect this data (3 min for XAS and 2 min for
SAXS/WAXS which includes a 10 s dead-time to move the
monochromator back to the start position and a further 10 s to
move the It photodiode into/out of the beam). The in situ
zeotype formation study was performed using a hydrothermal
reactor cell which allows for the measurement of X-ray data in
transmission mode. XAFS data were recorded at the Zn K-
edge (9.66 keV), while the corresponding SAXS/WAXS data

were collected below this energy at 9.465 keV (1.3098 A
 )
during temperature ramping at 1 K min1 to a temperature of
448 K. Using this set-up, analysable EXAFS data were
obtainable up to 12 A
 , along with WAXS data over a 2 range
of 45 using the INEL detector (although useable data
extended from 12 to 27 owing to the need to avoid the
contaminant Bragg peaks from the mica windows) whereas
the SAXS data covered a q-range 0.3 < q < 2 nm1.
In the catalytic study the potential of a novel one-dimen-
sional iron molybdate type catalyst [Mo:Fe (3:1)] normally
used for the production of formaldehyde (Soares & Portela,
2005) was studied during temperature ramping to 523 K in a
methanol/helium flow using a classical heated capillary as a
simulation of a packed bed reactor (Clausen et al., 1991). A
0.7 mm-diameter quartz capillary was used to contain the
sample (sieved to 3040 mesh size) whilst MeOH/He mix was
supplied to the sample using a bubbler (based on the vapour
pressure of methanol at 294 K the methanol saturation in the
gas stream was estimated to be 15%) whilst air grade zero
was used in an attempt to perform oxidative regeneration. The
rate of both gases was controlled using mass flow devices,
triggered by 5 V TTL pulses from outside the experimental
hutch. Online product analysis was also performed using a
European Spectrometry Systems ecoSys-P Man-Portable mass
spectrometer with a capillary inlet and heated inlet tube in
order to understand further possible structure/function rela-
tionships. XAFS studies were performed at the Mo K-edge
(20000 eV)
whilst
SAXS/WAXS
measurements
were
performed below the Mo K-edge at 17658.98 eV ( =
0.702104 A
 ).
3. Results
3.1. In situ study of microporous aluminophosphate
crystallization
Previously it has been shown through the use of both
scattering and spectroscopic techniques that the formation
process of pure and metal-substituted (Co)AlPOs can be
described as a three-step process, consisting of an initial
reaction between the reactants to form a gel followed by
gradual aggregation and then crystallization (Scheidegger et
al., 2000). The salient points from this previous work were (i)
the formation of initial aggregates of size 8 nm which
already contained a majority of tetrahedral Al3+/P5+ species
(as observed by XAFS and Raman spectroscopy); (ii) heating
of these gels (from 303433 K) caused the aggregates to grow
until a size of 40 nm was reached before crystallization (as
determined by the emergence of Bragg peaks seen in both the
SAXS and WAXS detectors) of the final microporous alumi-
nophosphate phase began at temperatures of 433 K; (iii)
transition metals such as Co2+ changed their coordination
state from octahedral to tetrahedral during the aggregation
(slowly) and crystallization steps (fast); (iv) the last measur-
able aggregates observed by SAXS possessed a similar size to
that of the first crystallites as determined from peak profiling;
(v) analysis of the growth of the peaks revealed that the
mechanisms of crystallization were similar and indicated that
the materials crystallized via either (i) a one-dimensional
growth with a constant nucleation rate or (ii) a one-dimen-
sional
growth
phase-boundary-controlled
crystallization
process (Hulbert, 1969). Despite the amount of detailed
insight gleaned from such a multiple technique approach there
remained questions regarding the interplay between the steps
and how this leads to the formation of the final crystalline
sample.
The XAFS and WAXS data indicated that the initial
synthesis gel contains predominantly tetrahedral Zn2+ (XAFS
edge position 9.666 keV) and appears diffraction amor-
phous. This behaviour contrasted with that of Co2+ and
suggested that the initial Zn2+ species formed interactions with
the AlOP species before heating began. The SAXS scat-
tering profile did not appear to contain any marked features,
which could be associated with the presence of clear primary
units. However, the intensity I(q) closely follows a power-law
decay qn (where n  2), which is slower than the asymptotic
behaviour of I(q) with n  4 predicted by the Porod law for
compact particles with sharp interfaces, indicating that this
system was more complex. However, by focusing on the q
range from 0.025 to 0.1 nm1 and after removing the leading
q2 decay, the I(q)  q2 dependence, the plots exhibit a broad
maximum (q max) which can be fitted with a Gaussian func-
tion and approximated to the inverse of the typical size of
possible gel aggregates/precursors leading to AlPO crystal-
lites. This analysis revealed that the Zn2+-containing gel
contained slightly larger particles (11.5 nm) than those seen in
AlPO-5 crystallization which were observed to grow to
12 nm before the onset of crystallization [determined
through both the appearance of a number of reflections
consistent with ZnAPO-34 as well as small changes in the first
EXAFS oscillation and the presence of a multiple-scattering
feature at 9.685 keV in the XANES (feature A in Fig. 4(a)] at
the comparatively low temperature of 369 K. The Avrami
Erofeev analysis of the ZnAPO-34 crystallization appears
consistent with a phase-boundary-controlled three-dimen-
sional growth process with a decreasing nucleation rate.
Interestingly the Avrami exponents obtained from profiling
reflect the dimensionality of the final microporous material
(Beale et al., 2006). As with the crystallization of the AlPO-5
phase, the initial crystallite sizes were very similar to the size
of the average aggregates seen in the gel immediately before
the crystalline material began to form.
In Fig. 4 we show the raw XAFS, SAXS and WAXS data
collected during the heating (at a rate of 1 K min1 up to a
temperature of 453 K) of the zinc-doped aluminophosphate
gel.
The implication for the similarity of the average SAXS
aggregate size to that of the first crystallite is that a type of gel
reorganization precedes the formation of crystalline AlPO-5
and ZnAPO-34 phases. Further support for this notion can be
found from a further analysis of the SAXS data. An initial
observation that can be made here is that in the SAXS I(q)
versus q data there are only small changes visible. However,
the most sensitive parameter to changes in the sample

in which hnei2 is the electron density difference between two
phases, and i are the volume fractions for the two compo-
nents. This equation can be generalized to a multi-component
system (Goodisman & Brumberger, 1971). In Fig. 5 we plot
the development of the invariant versus time during the
crystallization process. The striking observation is that there
is hardly any change in the invariant whilst the WAXS
data clearly indicate that crystallization occurs on reaching
369 K. It has been shown that the invariant is a more
sensitive parameter to the occurrence of crystallization than
the WAXS peak intensities are (Bras et al., 2003). Therefore
the lack of change in the invariant can be interpreted in two
ways: either the change in electron density contrast between
the two phases is offset by the changes in the respective
volume fractions, or both the electron density contrast and the
volume fractions remain unchanged. The latter option would
entail that large amorphous domains are already present. The
physical process that takes place during the crystallization is
therefore a rearrangement of the components from an amor-
phous state to a crystalline state. The surrounding matrix is not
influenced by this, neither is the density of the newly formed
crystalline state changed.

movement. The feature highlighted A in (a) illustrates the appearance of a feature at 9.685 keV, appearing at the onset of crystallization. Although the
variations in the SAXS data are not very large, the change in the shape of the curves is evident.
3.2. Catalytic investigation of the behaviour of iron
molybdate catalyst for methanol dehydrogenation
As mentioned previously, combined SAXS/WAXS/XAFS
experiments have also been performed to study hetero-
geneous catalytic reactions in the gas phase. As can be seen in
Fig. 6, the initial starting FeMo phase contained only a few
weak reflections and a broad hump between 11 and 15 2, but
has been previously identified as possessing a structure similar
to that of poorly crystalline Mo5O14 (Beale et al., 2008).
However, as heating began, dramatic changes in all three
techniques (SAXS/WAXS/XAFS) occurred, which suggested
that the initial FeMoO phase was unstable up to a certain
temperature. More specifically, the peaks and broad hump
ascribable to the initial Mo5O14-type phase were observed to
disappear with time resulting in an essentially featureless

pattern

(60 min). On switch over to air, in order to regenerate the
catalyst, new Bragg reflections appeared in the X-ray

which can be ascribed to the (

Combined Mo K-edge XANES (a) with combined temperature/time profile (b), raw SAXS data (c) with analysis of gradient versus time (d), WAXS (e)
and mass spectrometry data (f) recorded during the heating of a FeMo catalyst under MeOH/He and in air conditions. Feature B in (a) highlights the 1s
4d peak at the Mo K-edge.
20001.74 eV, which is known to be sensitive to both the
oxidation and coordination state of Mo (Beale & Sankar,
2003), was observed to first decrease in intensity as the
temperature approached 623 K (60 min), before disap-
pearing entirely after 130 min of reaction. Such changes would
be consistent with the reduction of the initial octahedral
Mo5/6+ species to a lower oxidation state. On regeneration with
air (after 130 min) the 1s4d transition reappeared, although
this time was much more intense and appeared at a slightly
lower position in energy (20000.5 eV). Most likely the
increased intensity of this feature originates from a pinhole
effect in the sample and subsequent detector saturation. In the
SAXS data a feature at q = 0.12 A
 was also observed to begin
to form after 2328 min of reaction (427451 K) and
continue to increase in intensity for a further 40 min. Such a
feature would be consistent with the formation and growth
(proposed from an analysis of the change in slope) of parti-
culate species although it is not clear whether this was related
to the phase changes observed in the WAXS or maybe the
formation of something on the catalyst surface, e.g. coke.
Interestingly, no evidence could be observed for the formation
of formaldehyde (m/z = 31) from the mass spectrometer trace
during reaction (Fig. 6f), although the catalyst proved active
for CO production (and, although not shown here, H2); initi-
ally in small(er) amounts as the temperature approached
623 K (65 min) although later (after 110 min) in much larger
quantities. The sudden increase in CO production after
110 min is difficult to explain, although it may be related to the
formation of a particularly active reduced phase for methanol
breakdown. Further studies and analysis of the data is in
progress. In summary, from this initial study it is possible to
propose that the initial Mo5O14-type phase undergoes a
number of significant changes during heating in methanol,
including both reduction and a phase change, eventually
leading to a catalyst which is active for methanol breakdown.
Such observations have important implications when deter-
mining the stability and activity of this catalyst under reaction
conditions. However, it is worth emphasizing at this point that
the instrumentation that has been developed is sufficiently
versatile that not only X-ray-based data can be collected
but also that the system is flexible enough to incorporate
complicated sample environments as well as additional non-
X-ray-based spectroscopic techniques.
4. Conclusions
The experiments carried out demonstrate the feasibility of a
three-technique set-up to obtain in situ correlated data at the
nanometre to micrometre scale, enabling new insight into
materials self-assembly and catalytic processes. Further
geometrical and optical optimization is possible, which will
result in improved SAXS/WAXS data quality, and the planned
software development will result in better time resolution.
These future developments will make the set-up suitable for
performing experiments which show changes at the 2030 s
time scale. This sort of time resolution will mean that the
set-up will be applicable for studying many chemical/physical
processes in the chemical industries, but there are also many
examples (e.g. formation of nanoparticles, polymers etc.)
where more fundamental research can benefit from the
availability of such experimental equipment. The equipment
is unlikely to be applicable yet for the study of very fast
processes (with subsecond changes). This obviously remains
the preserve of energy-dispersive techniques or fast sequential
energy-scanning EXAFS set-ups (Frahm et al., 2004). On the
other hand, the method that we have developed has the big
advantage that the instantaneous radiation dose received by
the sample is much lower than compared with energy-
dispersive techniques which means that the sample has a
chance of surviving much longer.
