[1] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[3] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different strengths and limitations:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, while H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, but CO chemisorption is more commonly used.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used and allows for normalization of reaction rates. H2 chemisorption can provide complementary information.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 M/CO ratio in CO chemisorption is an oversimplification. For H2 chemisorption, hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, affecting accuracy.

6. Data interpretation: Care must be taken when interpreting results, especially for H2 chemisorption due to potential desorption issues.

7. Normalization: Reaction rates should be normalized by CO uptake values for proper comparison between different catalysts.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability and ability to normalize reaction rates, but H2 chemisorption can provide valuable complementary information when used carefully.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂，但它们各有优缺点：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及在还原的催化剂上脉冲CO并测量吸附量，而H2化学吸附使用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量，但CO化学吸附更常用。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以通过假设1:1的M/CO化学计量比来估计金属分散度，尽管这是一个过度简化。

4. 优点：CO化学吸附被广泛使用，并允许反应速率的标准化。H2化学吸附可以提供补充信息。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1的M/CO比例是一个过度简化。对于H2化学吸附，氢可能在室温下从某些双金属表面脱附，影响准确性。

6. 数据解释：解释结果时必须小心，特别是对于H2化学吸附，因为可能存在脱附问题。

7. 标准化：为了在不同催化剂之间进行适当比较，反应速率应该通过CO吸附值进行标准化。

总的来说，CO化学吸附由于其可靠性和能够标准化反应速率而更常用，但H2化学吸附在谨慎使用时可以提供有价值的补充信息。
