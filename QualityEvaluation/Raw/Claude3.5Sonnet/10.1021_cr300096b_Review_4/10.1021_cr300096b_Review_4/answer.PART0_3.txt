[1] "One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption."

[2] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[3] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[4] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different strengths and limitations:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, while H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, with CO chemisorption being more commonly used.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion, assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used and provides reliable data for normalizing reaction rates. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate. H2 chemisorption faces challenges with hydrogen desorption from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

6. Data interpretation: Care must be taken when interpreting results, especially for H2 chemisorption due to potential desorption issues.

7. Normalization: Reaction rates should be normalized by CO uptake values for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability, but H2 chemisorption can provide complementary information when used carefully.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂，但它们具有不同的优势和局限性：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及将CO脉冲通过还原后的催化剂并测量吸附量，而H2化学吸附使用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量，其中CO化学吸附更常用。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以估算金属分散度，假设1:1的M/CO化学计量比，尽管这是一个过于简化的假设。

4. 优势：CO化学吸附被广泛使用，并提供可靠的数据用于归一化反应速率。H2化学吸附为确定活性位点提供了另一种方法。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1比例的假设并不总是准确的。H2化学吸附面临着在室温下某些双金属表面氢气解吸的挑战。

6. 数据解释：在解释结果时必须小心，特别是对于H2化学吸附，因为可能存在解吸问题。

7. 归一化：为了正确比较不同催化剂之间的催化活性，反应速率应该通过CO吸附值进行归一化。

总的来说，由于CO化学吸附的可靠性，它更常被使用，但H2化学吸附在谨慎使用时可以提供补充信息。
