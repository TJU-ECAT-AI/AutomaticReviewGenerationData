[1] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[3] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different strengths and limitations:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over the catalyst and measuring the amount of effluent CO using a thermal conductivity detector. H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites. CO chemisorption is more commonly used for this purpose.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between metal and CO, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used and provides a basis for normalizing reaction rates. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate. For H2 chemisorption, hydrogen can start to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, affecting results.

6. Data interpretation: Care must be taken when interpreting results, especially for H2 chemisorption due to potential desorption issues.

7. Normalization: Reaction rates should be normalized by CO uptake values for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability and ability to normalize reaction rates, but H2 chemisorption can provide complementary information when used carefully.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂，但它们各有优缺点：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及将CO脉冲通过催化剂并使用热导检测器测量流出CO的量。H2化学吸附使用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量。CO化学吸附更常用于此目的。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以通过假设金属与CO之间1:1的化学计量比来估计金属分散度，尽管这是一个过于简化的假设。

4. 优点：CO化学吸附被广泛使用，并为反应速率的标准化提供了基础。H2化学吸附为确定活性位点提供了另一种方法。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1比例的假设并不总是准确的。对于H2化学吸附，氢气可能在室温下从某些双金属表面开始脱附，影响结果。

6. 数据解释：在解释结果时必须谨慎，特别是对于H2化学吸附，因为可能存在脱附问题。

7. 标准化：为了正确比较不同催化剂的催化活性，反应速率应该通过CO吸附值进行标准化。

总的来说，CO化学吸附由于其可靠性和能够标准化反应速率而更常用，但H2化学吸附在谨慎使用时可以提供补充信息。
