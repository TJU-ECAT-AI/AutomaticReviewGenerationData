[1] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[3] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different strengths and limitations:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake. H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites. CO chemisorption is more commonly used for this purpose.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used and provides a basis for normalizing reaction rates. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 M/CO ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate. For H2 chemisorption, hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, requiring careful interpretation.

6. Data interpretation: Results from both techniques should be interpreted cautiously, considering the limitations mentioned.

7. Normalization of reaction rates: CO uptake values are used to normalize reaction rates for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts.

In summary, while both techniques are valuable, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its versatility in determining active sites, estimating dispersion, and providing a basis for rate normalization. However, researchers should be aware of the limitations of both methods when interpreting results.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂，但它们各有优缺点：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及在还原的催化剂上脉冲通入CO并测量吸附量。H2化学吸附利用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量。CO化学吸附更常用于此目的。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以通过假设1:1的M/CO化学计量比来估算金属分散度，尽管这是一个过于简化的假设。

4. 优点：CO化学吸附被广泛使用，并为反应速率标准化提供了基础。H2化学吸附为确定活性位点提供了另一种方法。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1 M/CO比例的假设并不总是准确。对于H2化学吸附，氢可能在室温下从某些双金属表面脱附，需要谨慎解释。

6. 数据解释：解释两种技术的结果时应谨慎，考虑到上述限制。

7. 反应速率标准化：CO吸附值用于标准化反应速率，以便正确比较不同催化剂的催化活性。

总之，虽然两种技术都很有价值，但CO化学吸附更常用，因为它在确定活性位点、估算分散度和提供速率标准化基础方面更加通用。然而，研究人员在解释结果时应该意识到这两种方法的局限性。
