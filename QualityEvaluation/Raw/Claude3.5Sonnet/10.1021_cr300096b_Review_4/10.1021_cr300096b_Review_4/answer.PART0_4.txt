[1] "One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption."

[2] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[3] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[4] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different strengths and limitations:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, while H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, with CO chemisorption being more commonly used.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion, assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used and provides a basis for normalizing reaction rates. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 M/CO ratio in CO chemisorption is an oversimplification. For H2 chemisorption, hydrogen can desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, requiring careful interpretation.

6. Data interpretation: Results from both techniques should be interpreted cautiously, considering the assumptions and limitations of each method.

7. Normalization: Reaction rates should be normalized by CO uptake values for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability in determining active sites and providing a basis for rate normalization, while H2 chemisorption serves as a complementary technique with its own set of considerations.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂，但它们各有优缺点：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及在还原的催化剂上脉冲CO并测量吸收量，而H2化学吸附使用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量，其中CO化学吸附更常用。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以估算金属分散度，假设1:1的M/CO化学计量比，尽管这是一个过于简化的假设。

4. 优点：CO化学吸附广泛使用，并为反应速率的归一化提供基础。H2化学吸附为确定活性位点提供了另一种方法。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1的M/CO比例是一个过于简化的假设。对于H2化学吸附，氢可能在室温下从某些双金属表面脱附，需要谨慎解释。

6. 数据解释：解释两种技术的结果时应谨慎，考虑每种方法的假设和局限性。

7. 归一化：为了正确比较不同催化剂的催化活性，反应速率应该通过CO吸收值进行归一化。

总的来说，CO化学吸附更常用，因为它在确定活性位点和提供速率归一化基础方面更可靠，而H2化学吸附作为一种互补技术，有其自身的考虑因素。
