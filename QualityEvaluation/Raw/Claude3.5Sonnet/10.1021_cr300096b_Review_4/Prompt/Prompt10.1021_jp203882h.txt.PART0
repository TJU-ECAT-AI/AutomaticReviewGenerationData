Abstract
We have studied the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts during reduction/oxidation cycles using H2 and O2 as chemical probes. Time-resolved in situ characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). We have found that both types of nanocatalysts reduce to a Cu/CeO2 biphase system with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Important variations are seen in the Cu particle size and metal dispersion depending on the initial state of the copper oxideceria systems. During subsequent in situ oxygen annealing, the Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidized to form CuO through a Cu2O intermediate phase as expected. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaved rather differently under oxidizing conditions, and neither oxidized to form CuO nor fully returned to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase in solid solution. We found that 50% of the Cu returned to a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution, while the remainder was observed by in situ ETEM to form an amorphous copper oxide phase with a Cu oxidation state similar to Ce1xCuxO2, but with a local bonding environment similar to CuO. The behavior of the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 reflects strong interactions between Cu and the ceria matrix and illustrates the advantages of working with solid solutions of mixed oxides.

Introduction
The rarity of noble metal catalysts presents serious hurdles to the implementation of clean energy technologies on a global scale. (1) However, catalytic materials based on the copper oxide framework are promising as more economical alternatives. (1-3) Copper oxide is used as a catalyst or catalyst precursor in many chemical reactions that involve hydrogen as a reactant or a product: methanol synthesis from CO (CO + 2H2  CH3OH) or CO2 (CO2 + 3H2  CH3OH + H2O), (2, 4) the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O  CO2 + H2), (2, 5, 6) methanol steam reforming (CH3OH + H2O  CO2 + 3H2), (2, 7) oxidative methanol reforming (CH3OH + 1/4O2 + 1/2H2O  CO2 + 5/2H2), (8) NO reduction (NO + H2  1/2N2 + H2O), (2, 9) etc. It has been proposed that in several of these catalytic processes the CuO precursor undergoes reduction and Cu1+ or Cu0 (i.e., metallic copper) is the real active phase. (2, 5, 6, 10) CuO, Cu4O3, and Cu2O are well-known copper oxides with monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic crystal structures, respectively. (11-14) Thermodynamically, the oxidation state of copper changes among CuO, Cu2O, and Cu as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure. (15, 16) The relative stability of the Cu2+, Cu1+, and Cu0 species can change when one has mixtures of copper oxide and another oxide. (2, 10, 17, 18) In spite of the tremendous amount of work carried out to explore the nature of the active sites of copper-oxide based catalysts (CuO, CuO/ZnO, CuO/CeO2, CuO/ZrCeO4, CuAl2O4, and CuCr2O4 spinels, etc.) under reducing environments, (19-27) the morphological and structural changes in the presence of H2 have not been correlated through in situ studies.
In this work, we investigate the reduction and reoxidation of two different precursors of CuOCeO2 catalysts: Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solutions with the copper dopant fully incorporated into the fluorite structure (28) and CuO/CeO2 blends in which copper oxide is just impregnated on a ceria substrate. Both types of CuOCeO2 catalysts have shown very good activity for water-gas shift and oxidation of CO. (23, 27) While it has been established that CuO/CeO2 blends yield significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone, the nature of this enhancement is complex due to the flexible valence of both Cu and Ce, leading to a variable oxygen storage capacity within their native and mixed oxides. (29-32) Consequently, catalytic activity for a given reaction depends strongly upon the precursor and its activation, with Ce1xCuxO2 exhibiting superior performance for CO oxidation (33) and CuO/CeO2 blends yielding a somewhat higher activity for the water-gas shift reaction. (28) In the past, the structural and electronic properties of Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts have been studied using a combination of synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. (34) These studies showed that the Ce1xCuxO2 systems are indeed solid solutions. (34) The copper atoms embedded in ceria had an oxidation state higher than those of the cations in Cu2O or CuO. The lattice of the Ce1xCuxO2 systems still adopted a fluorite-type structure but was highly distorted with multiple cationoxygen distances with respect to the single cationoxygen bond length seen in pure ceria. (34) There was a cell dimension decrease when the Cu went into the ceria and a cell dimension increase when the Cu came out. The doping of CeO2 with copper introduced a large strain into the oxide lattice and favored the formation of O vacancies. Cu approached the planar geometry characteristic of Cu2+ oxides but with a strongly perturbed local order. (34) The chemical activities of the Ce1xCuxO2 nanoparticles were tested using the reactions with H2, CO, and O2 as probes. (34) During the reduction in hydrogen, an induction time was observed and became shorter after raising the reaction temperature. The fraction of copper that could be reduced in the Ce1xCuxO2 solid solutions also depended strongly on the reaction temperature. (34) A comparison with data for the reduction of pure copper oxides indicated that the copper embedded in ceria was much more difficult to reduce.
Here, the structural and electronic properties of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and CuO/CeO2 under an atmosphere of H2 were studied in detail using synchrotron-based time-resolved in situ XRD and XAS to assess the ensemble average properties. Aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) was also used to elucidate single particle behavior at the atomic scale and to identify morphological changes in the surface of the catalysts. Important differences are observed in the structural/morphological properties of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and CuO/CeO2 during reduction/reoxidation processes. In the case of the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution, the strong interaction between copper and the ceria matrix produced a distinctive behavior not seen for a simple blend of the oxides (CuO/CeO2).
Methods
Sample Preparation
The reference CuO, Cu2O, and Cu bulk samples used in this work were obtained from commercial sources (>99.99% purity). Cu-doped ceria, labeled as Ce0.8Cu0.2O2, was prepared with a modified reverse microemulsion method. (23, 35-37) Briefly, the precursors were introduced in a reverse microemulsion (water in oil) using n-heptane as the organic phase, Triton X-100 (Aldrich) as surfactant, and hexanol as cosurfactant. Then, this suspension was mixed with another similar suspension containing as aqueous phase in alkali solution (trimethylanilinium hydroxide (TMAH), Aldrich). All cations were coprecipitated, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h, centrifuged, decanted, and rinsed with methanol. Finally, the solid portion was dried overnight at 100 C, and the resulting powder was calcined under air at 500 C for 2 h. ICP-AES chemical analysis of this type of sample confirmed quantitative precipitation of both Cu and Ce cations.
The sample of copper oxide supported on CeO2 (Cu wt % of 5, denoted hereafter as CuO/CeO2) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a CeO2 support synthesized by microemulsion (in a similar manner as described above) with copper nitrate aqueous solutions. Following impregnation, the sample was dried overnight at 100 C and finally calcined under air at 500 C for 2 h.
Time-Resolved X-ray Diffraction
The time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on beamline X7B (λ = 0.3184 Å) of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The powder sample (3 mg) was loaded into a glass capillary cell (i.D. = 0.8 mm) which was attached to a flow system. (38) A small resistance heating wire was installed right below the capillary, and the temperature was monitored with a 0.5 mm chromelalumel thermocouple that was placed in the capillary near the sample. In situ diffraction patterns were collected during reduction (5% H2/He) and reoxidation (5% O2/He) under a ramping mode with a heating rate of 4 C/min at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. A Perkin-Elmer detector was used to record X-ray patterns. Two-dimensional powder patterns were collected with an image-plate detector, and the powder rings were integrated using the FIT2D code. (39) Phase diagrams for CuO, Cu2O, Cu, and CeO2 and the lattice constants of ceria were calculated through Rietveld refinement. (40) The molar fraction was equal to Mn/(MCuO + MCu2O + MCu + MCuinceria + MCeinceria), and the Mn is the amount (unit: moles) of each metal/metal oxide species and was determined by Rietveld refinement.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Cu K absorption edge (E0 = 8979 eV) XAFS spectra were collected in situ at beamline X18B of the NSLS at BNL during the reduction and reoxidation of the catalysts under similar conditions as the XRD experiments with the exception of the gas mixture used for the reoxidation (20% O2/He). A commercially available Kapton cell (o.d. = 1/8 in.) was used for mounting the sample (50 mg). An air-flow heating gun with temperature controller was used to heat the powder samples with a ramping rate of 2 C/min for reduction and 5 C/min for reoxidation. The X-ray absorption spectra were taken repeatedly in the fluorescence-yield mode using a Pips (passivated-implanted planar silicon) detector cooled with circulating water. The energy was calibrated for each scan with the first inflection point of the Cu K edge in Cu metal foil. The EXAFS data have been analyzed using the Athena and Artimis programs. (41)
Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy
ETEM measurements were carried out on the FEI Titan 80-300 microscope at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory. This instrument is equipped with a differentially pumped environmental cell capable of 10 Torr gas injection and a CEOS postobjective geometric image aberration corrector. HRTEM imaging was carried out at 300 kV with the aberration corrector tuned to a flat phase region of >20 mrad (third-order aberration correction and <0.1 nm information transfer), with residual spherical aberration <1.5 μm. Transmission electron diffraction (TED) data were collected using a parallel 100 nm beam without selected area aperture. The as-prepared ETEM samples were supported on a porous amorphous SiN grids (PELCO 200 nm SiN with 2.5 μm pores). The samples were heated to 400 at 20 C/min in 1.5 Torr of either H2 or O2 using a Gatan 652 heating holder with an Inconel furnace.
Results and Discussion
In Situ Environmental TEM Studies
We performed in situ time-resolved ETEM experiments for the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and CuO/CeO2 samples under both reducing and oxidizing environments to elucidate their behavior at the single particle level and to follow variations in the surface morphology of these nanocatalysts. The as-prepared Ce1xCuxO2 particles had an average size of 4.64  0.95 nm and often exhibited faceted terminations without amorphous edges (Figure 1a). Electron diffraction (ED) data were collected (Figure 1b) and showed nearly pure CeO2-type reflections, with a minor amount of a CuO or Cu2O phase present (Figure 1c). Results of XRD, to be discussed below, also indicated that the amount of CuOx present in the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 sample was small (0.04 molar fraction). In Figure 1, there is no indication of an ordered Cu sublattice in the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 from either HREM imaging or diffraction. All the features seen point to a typical fluorite lattice for the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 sample. The copper embedded inside the ceria does induce a change in the cell parameter, introduces stress in the lattice, and produces O vacancies, (27, 33) but the main surface morphological features of the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution are similar to those of pure CeO2.

The Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 was exposed to 1.5 Torr of H2 to induce the reduction of copper. (27, 33) Upon heating the sample rapidly to 400 C, CuOx reflections briefly became more pronounced (not shown) before disappearing entirely after 10 min, leaving only CeO2 and Cu reflections in the ED pattern (Figure 2a). After 60 min of reduction, Cu reflections increased in intensity, while the average CeO2 particle size dropped from 4.64  0.95 to 4.36  0.46 nm, indicating an 18% loss of volume due to Cu diffusion from the bulk. The size of the Cu particles observed in TEM was 10 nm, larger than anticipated, and indicative of Ostwald ripening. The existence of smaller Cu particles (<1 nm) dispersed on the ceria support cannot be ruled out, as these poorly crystalline particles would not be detected during an ETEM experiment at these pressures. The CeO2 particles remained highly crystalline under these conditions with an absence of amorphous material at the edge as displayed in Figure 3a. From measurements of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (see below), one can conclude that at 400 C all the copper has been reduced by hydrogen and removed from the oxide matrix, and there is also some reduction of the cerium cations (Ce4+ Ce3+). These important changes do not seem to affect the main structural and morphological features of the ceria. After reduction of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 in H2, the system contains Cu nanoparticles dispersed on a well-defined ceria substrate that mostly exhibits {111} facets.

The sample in Figure 3a was then cooled to room temperature under 1.5 Torr of H2, pumped to vacuum, and heated in situ to 400 C under 1.5 Torr of O2. After 15 min of oxidation, Cu reflections were no longer detected by electron diffraction leaving only CeO2-type rings. However, an amorphous phase had grown on the CeO2 particle surface, reaching 10 nm thick in some regions (Figure 3b) while other regions exhibited minimal amorphous growth. This phase was confirmed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) to be a carbon-free amorphous oxide. We propose that after Ostwald ripening of the precipitated Cu phase, oxidation causes the smaller residual Cu particles to be reincorporated into the CeO2 matrix, while the larger 10 nm Cu particles form an amorphous oxide. In any case, strong interactions between the Cu and oxide phases produced by the reduction of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 apparently prevent the formation of a simple CuO/CeO2 blend in which the reoxidized copper adopts the normal properties of a copper oxide. In the next section, we will use XRD to determine the amount of copper that returns into the ceria host upon reaction of O2 with reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2.
Figure 4a shows a TEM image for a 5% CuO/CeO2 system prepared by standard impregnation of ceria with copper nitrate and subsequent calcination in air at elevated temperature (see Methods section). In this material, the crystalline CuO phase is less evenly distributed compared to the residual CuO in Ce0.8Cu0.2O2. By repeating the full in situ ETEM study, we found that this CuO/CeO2 blend could undergo cycles of reduction and oxidation without the deposition of an amorphous copper oxide on the ceria support. However, full reduction to metallic copper was only achieved for this sample after 60 min at 400 C. The copper oxide produced by in situ reoxidation in O2 of the reduced CuO/CeO2 was crystalline (Figure 4b), indicating that amorphous copper oxide is a unique product of the oxidation of reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2. This may be of great importance in catalytic applications where amorphous CuO is expected to be more active than crystalline CuO. (2, 5, 16)

In Situ XRD Studies
In situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction patterns were collected for the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and 5% CuO/CeO2 samples during reduction and oxidation experiments. Figure 5 displays XRD data for the reduction of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2. In agreement with the electron diffraction data in Figure 1, the XRD measurements show that initially the system exhibits the fluorite features with a small peak for CuO. In the bottom of Figure 5, we can see the results of a Rietveld refinement of the XRD data for the heating of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 in 5% H2/He. At room temperature, the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase has a Cu:Ce molar ratio of 0.25 (0.19:0.77, calculated on the basis of the data in Figure 5b), with 25% of the available Cu in a CuO impurity phase. At 160 C, the Cu dopant is rapidly and entirely expelled from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution and reduced to metallic Cu. This is accompanied by a discontinuous increase (0.03 Å) in the CeO2 lattice parameter indicative of rapid vacancy generation. This increase could reflect the removal of copper from the oxide matrix or the partial reduction of ceria (Ce3+ has a larger atomic size than Ce4+). (27, 33) Simultaneously, the CuO impurity phase is reduced to form Cu2O, which becomes difficult to refine in powder diffraction due to peak overlap with Cu at 8.7 2θ and is dropped from the refinement above 160 C. In Figure 5, all the chemical transformations occur between 130 and 170 C, which is consistent with prior results indicating more facile reduction of Cu in Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 than in CuO. (33)

The Ce1xCuxO2 sample was then cooled to room temperature in the 5% H2/He mixture and subsequently oxidized in a 5% O2/He mixture as shown in the top of Figure 6 (25  400 C, with a heating ramp of 4 C/min). The corresponding Rietveld refinement results are shown in Figure 6b. At 90 C, metallic Cu returned to the CeO2 matrix to form a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution while passing through an intermediate Cu2O phase. The kinetics of oxidation is much slower than that for reduction, with metallic Cu present until 230 C when all Cu revealed by the Rietveld refinement has returned to the Ce1xCuxO2 phase. However, the Cu:Ce ratio has reduced from 0.25 in the as-prepared material to 0.12 (0.11:0.89, obtained from Figure 6b) after the complete redox cycle. The remaining Cu, nearly 50% of the original content, has not crystallized into Cu, CuO, Cu2O, or Ce1xCuxO2 phases, suggesting either sublimation (unlikely at these experimental temperatures) or the presence of an amorphous phase (confirmed by ETEM). The absence of a discontinuity in the CeO2 lattice parameter during heating suggests that oxygen vacancies are filled at room temperature with Ce returning to its full 4+ oxidation state long before the Cu is fully oxidized.

Figure 6. (a) In situ X-ray diffraction patterns collected during the reoxidation of reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 in 5% O2/He from 25 to 400 C at a heating rate of 4 C/min. (b) Results of a Reitveld refinement for the in situ time-resolved XRD data. Cu content is plotted as the molar fraction of the Cu + Ce total.
The full in situ redox cycle was identically repeated for the 5% CuO/CeO2 sample. The XRD data for reduction in hydrogen are shown in Figure 7 together with the results of the Rietveld refinement. At room temperature, the as-prepared material contains no Cu dopant inside the CeO2 phase. Upon heating to 160 C, one sees a direct CuO  Cu transformation (i.e., no formation of a Cu2O intermediate) with a partial reduction of ceria (some Ce4+  Ce3+) that produces an abrupt expansion of the lattice by 0.015 Å. This expansion is 50% smaller than that seen in the experiments for the reduction of the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution, but the absence of Cu dopants for the CuO/CeO2 case could explain this difference. During oxidation in 5% O2/He, Figure 8, metallic Cu returns to the initial CuO phase through a Cu2O intermediate not detected during reduction. The change in lattice parameter during oxidation is again continuous, suggesting that reduced CeO2 is largely reoxidized at room temperature. In the process of reoxidation for the reduced CuO/CeO2 system, there was no incorporation of the copper into the ceria substrate and the formed CuO was crystalline. A comparison of the XRD results in Figures 6 and 8 points to the special properties of the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution and its strong copper  oxide interactions.

In Situ XANES Studies
To investigate the electronic structure of Cu-CeO2 catalysts during a full redox cycle, in situ time-resolved Cu K-edge XANES were collected for the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and 5% CuO/CeO2 materials. A previous study has discussed in detail the electronic transitions involved in the features present in the Cu K-edges of these samples. (34) The data for the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 nanocatalyst is displayed in Figures 9 and 10. The time-resolved reduction series displayed in Figure 9a indicates an onset of copper reduction at 150 C, consistent with the depletion of copper seen for Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 in the Reitveld refinement of the XRD data (Figure 5). By fitting the Cu XANES as a linear combination of native Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 and metallic Cu, we note that the reduction is >90% complete at 175 C. The corresponding reoxidation time series is displayed in Figure 9b and indicates that the Cu in reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 is 40% oxidized at room temperature but does not reach 90% until 225 C. Rapid oxidation at room temperature agrees with the observation of an amorphous CuOx phase by in situ ETEM which is presumed to be metastable. The XRD refinement shown in Figure 6b indicates that the reincorporation of Cu into the Ce1xCuxO2 lattice occurs through a Cu2O intermediate phase in the same temperature range of 100225 C where the remainder of Cu oxidation is observed by XANES. Figure 10 compares XANES spectra of the initial and final states of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 after one redox cycle. The remarkable similarity of the initial and final states of Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 indicates that the oxidation state of Cu in the amorphous CuOx seen in TEM is close to that of copper in Ce0.8Cu0.2O2.

The time-resolved XANES reduction series from 5% CuO/CeO2 is displayed in Figure 11a and indicates an onset of copper reduction at 150 C, consistent with the depletion of CuO seen in the Reitveld refinement of the XRD measurements (Figure 7). Fitting the Cu XANES as a linear combination of native CuO/CeO2 and metallic Cu reveals that the reduction is >90% complete at 200 C, 25 deg hotter than required for Ce0.8Cu0.2O2. This is consistent with the slower kinetics observed for reduction of the CuO/CeO2 sample during in situ ETEM. The reoxidation time series is displayed in Figure 11b and indicates that the Cu in the reduced CuO/CeO2 is 18% oxidized at room temperature but does not reach 90% until 325 C, 100 deg hotter than required for Ce0.8Cu0.2O2. Figure 12 compares XANES spectra of the initial and final states of CuO/CeO2 after one redox cycle. As with Ce0.8Cu0.2O2, the initial and final states are remarkably similar in their electronic properties.

Summary and Conclusions
Aberration-corrected environmental TEM, time-resolved XRD, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were used to study in situ the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of CuCeO2 nanocatalysts during reduction (using H2) and oxidation processes (using O2). We have found that both a Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution and a CuO/CeO2 blended system reduced to form a Cu/CeO2 biphase with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. In the case of the reduction of the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution, the formed Cu particles were smaller and better dispersed than those obtained upon reduction of the CuO/CeO2 blended system. The smaller agglomeration of the Cu particles in reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 probably reflected stronger or more intimate copper  ceria interactions. During subsequent in situ oxygen annealing, Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 blend reoxidized to form crystalline CuO through a Cu2O intermediate, as expected. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaved rather differently under oxidizing conditions and neither oxidized to form crystalline CuO nor fully returned to yield the bulk phase of a Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution. Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data showed that 50% of the Cu returned to a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution, while the remainder was observed by in situ ETEM to form an amorphous CuOx phase with a copper oxidation state similar to that of Ce1xCuxO2, but with a local bonding environment similar to crystalline CuO. The behavior seen for the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 points to strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix and illustrates the advantages of utilizing solid solutions of mixed oxides.
