Combining in situ characterization methods in one set-up: looking with more eyes into the intricate chemistry of the synthesis and working of heterogeneous catalysts
Several in situ techniques are known which allow investigations of catalysts and catalytic reactions under real reaction conditions using different spectroscopic and X-ray methods. In recent years, specific set-ups have been established which combine two or more in situ methods in order to get a more detailed understanding of catalytic systems. This tutorial review will give a summary of currently available set-ups equipped with multiple techniques for in situ catalyst characterization, catalyst preparation, and reaction monitoring. Besides experimental and technical aspects of method coupling including X-ray techniques, spectroscopic methods (Raman, UV-vis, FTIR), and magnetic resonance spectroscopies (NMR, EPR), essential results will be presented to demonstrate the added value of multitechnique in situ approaches. A special section is focussed on selected examples of use which show new developments and application fields.

1. Introduction
Detailed insight in the working principles of catalysts under real working conditions are of great importance for improving the catalyst performance and design. Solid catalysts are very complex and posses many different potential active sites depending on their composition, structure, and morphology. The determination of the nature of these sites and information concerning their role in the specific catalytic reaction is of main importance for a rational catalyst design. Otherwise knowledge about reaction mechanism is fundamental for the optimization of the catalytic reaction. For both, studying of the working catalyst and elucidation of the reaction mechanism, respective methods, which allow a monitoring realtime and in situ, are necessary. Thus, different in situ techniques were developed by catalyst researchers in the past which allow investigations of catalysts and catalytic reactions under real reaction conditions, including the development of special catalytic reaction cells that can satisfactorily meet both the requirements of the applied techniques and those of the required reaction conditions.1 In order to gain a realistic picture of the working catalyst it is advantageous to combine the in situ techniques with simultaneous analysis of product composition (operando techniques).2,3 A survey of selected techniques, which are most commonly applied for in situ and operando studies, and the available method-specific information is presented in Table 1. The denoted references give more detailed information about the respective techniques and their application.

It has to be mentioned that each of these methods has its own potentials, limitations and special requirements. In order to achieve a high time resolution needed for in situ studies, both X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy require a high spectral brilliance source, such as available at a synchrotron. Analysis and interpretation of EXAFS and XANES data are complicated. Furthermore, it has to be considered that the local structure from X-ray absorption is always an information about the average structure, which is also the case for WAXS/XRD with an additional caveat that a certain domain size is required for these structures to be visible using WAXS/XRD and SAXS.
Raman and FTIR spectroscopy are complementary methods. The high sensitivity of FTIR spectroscopy allows probing of adsorbed species also at low concentration, however, transition metal oxide vibrations are difficult to observe. Raman spectroscopy is rather advantageous for characterization in the low spectral range. This enables the detection oftransition metal oxide vibrations, however, because of the low sensitivity it is difficult to study low metal oxide loadings on supported catalysts. Furthermore, the catalyst material can undergo transformation when irradiated by the Raman laser light.
In the case of UV-vis spectroscopy, broad and overlapping absorption bands can complicate the spectrum interpretation and quantitative measurements are only possible at low metal oxide loading of supported catalysts.
The utilization of NMR is restricted because it is not applicable to all nuclei and quenching problems may occur in the presence of paramagnetic metal ions. Only paramagnetic transition metal ions are accessible by EPR, however, catalytically relevant species such as radical intermediates formed from hydrocarbon reactants can also be detected.
Looking at the specific information available from the different techniques (Table 1) it is evident that only a combination or coupling of different methods enables a comprehensive picture of the working catalysts in the particular reaction. Bringing all information together leads to a more detailed understanding of the catalytic system and therefore a better assessment on what is happening in the respective catalytic reaction.
In recent decades several examples for such multiple characterization technique approaches were published in the literature illustrating the advantage of looking on catalytic systems from different perspectives.
An instructive overview in relation to combining operando techniques and resulting new opportunities was given by Tinnemans et al.11 presenting new instrumental developments combining two or three spectroscopic techniques in one spectroscopic-reaction cell. It was shown on the basis of several examples which prospects are offered for reaching a more detailed understanding of some relevant catalytic systems.
Taking the mentioned overview into account this review will give a summary of the currently available set-ups equipped with multiple techniques for catalyst characterization, catalyst preparation, and reaction monitoring. Besides experimental and technical aspects of method coupling essential results contributing to a better understanding of the relevant catalytic reactions will be presented. At first multitechnique set-ups comprising X-ray techniques will be discussed, then the coupling of different spectroscopies. Set-ups which allow the investigation of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions in liquid phase will be described separately. Finally, a special section is focussed on selected examples of use which show new developments and insights including own activities in the field of development and application of multitechnique in situ approaches for characterization of working catalysts and catalyst preparation.
It should be mentioned at this point that knowledge of spatiotemporal gradients in heterogeneous catalysts is of essential importance for the rational design of catalysts and catalytic processes, too. Several techniques have been developed and applied enabling the imaging of spatial heterogeneities in catalytic solids under in situ conditions, however, this field is not the topic of the present paper. Referring to this the reader is pointed to an excellent review published last year.12
2. Overview of combined characterization methods in one set-up
An overview of currently practised set-ups equipped with several combined techniques is given in Table 2, together with the investigated relevant catalytic reactions and references. Only such set-ups were considered in Table 2, in which the respective techniques are simultaneously used. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the combined set-ups including X-ray techniques are more and more implemented on synchrotron beamlines all around the world.

The crucial point in relation to the realisation of a multiple technique approach for studying catalysts at work is an appropriate set-up which allows the monitoring of the catalytic system under realistic conditions. This means an analytic reaction cell has to be designed working like a catalytic reactor with implemented analytical tools. Otherwise, the analytical tools can be inserted into the catalytic reactor itself. Many operando set-ups have been developed for this purpose in several laboratories in the last decade a selection of which is described in the following.
2.1 Coupled methods including X-ray techniques
The pioneer work in method coupling was done in the 1990s by the groups of Thomas13 (Cambridge, UK) and Topse (Lyngby, Denmark),14 who combined XRD and EXAFS. Because of the complementary of these methods information are obtained in terms of both the long-range and short-range ordering of the catalytic solid under investigation. Later, this set-up was combined with product analysis, too.1517
In recent years, several groups have focussed their activities on the combination of X-ray techniques with spectroscopic methods like DRIFTS, UV-vis and Raman (cf.Table 2).1835
For combining EXAFS with DRIFTS and mass spectrometric analysis (MS) a respective set-up was developed and tested in different reactions.2127 The primary version of this set-up21,22 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. An improved version of this experimental cell is currently installed at the ESRF (Grenoble) and can be utilised as a mobile experiment at different beamlines.24 In the original set-up (Fig. 1) a commercially available DRIFTS cell (Spectratech) was modified by implementation of a boron nitride sample holder and respective windows facilitating the X-ray transmission measurements. This arrangement allows that both, X-rays and IR beam, are able to contact nearly the same area of the catalyst bed (loosely packed powder in the boron nitride sample holder) which is streamed by the reaction gas mixture. The use of a plane IR window minimises the dead volume of the cell enabling relative fast change of gas atmospheres.
Fig. 1 Scheme of the experimental cell used for simultaneous EXAFS/DRIFTS/MS measurements (reproduced from ref. 21).
Using the example of NO interaction with supported Rhcatalysts the oxidation and reduction of alumina supported Rh with NO and H2 was studied.22,23 Following the synchronously measured temporal variations of Rh K edge XANES along with those observed for Rh(NO+) species in DRIFTS during oxidation and reduction of Rh comparable trends were found.
Thus, the specific role of the linear NO+ species in both oxidation and reduction of Rh was evaluated. Additionally, new information was obtained concerning the nature of the Rh phase/sites which interact with NO+. Similar investigations were performed on supported Rh/Al2O3catalysts studying the interaction with NO/CO.
Recently, Newton et al.27 reported a novel combination of time-resolved hard X-ray diffraction (HXRD) with DRIFTS and MS by example of CO/NO cycling over supported Pdnanoparticles. It could be shown that unresolved issues in the behaviour of the system observed using parallel time-resolved EXAFS were due to the dissociation of adsorbed CO species and transient storage of atomic carbon within the Pdnanoparticles, forming PdCx which is then rapidly removed during the oxidising (NO) part of the cycle. Furthermore it was found that PdCx promotes the formation of linear CO species and has a drastic effect on the linear to bridge ratio of CO species observed in the DRIFTS spectra.
The variability of the above described EXAFS/DRIFTS/MS set-up is demonstrated in a recently published work26 dealing with in situ spectroscopic investigation of the low-temperature methaneoxidation over Pt/Al2O3. It is illustrated that this experimental set-up can be utilized for elements with much softer absorption edges (Pt LIII-edge: 11.564 keV) than has previously been demonstrated for Rh (23.22 keV) and Pd (24.35 keV).
In the group of Weckhuysen (Utrecht, The Netherlands) the combination of X-ray methods with UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy is preferred.11,3134 However, they have also combined three different X-ray-based techniques, SAXS/WAXS and quick-scanning EXAFS to study changes across the nano-to-micrometre size range in inorganic solid crystallization processes.28,29
At this point also a special set-up has to be mentioned which combines high resolution powder diffraction (HRPD) with XAS and Raman spectroscopy.30 It was used to study the formation and structural changes of γ-Bi2MoO6 under hydrothermal conditions.
For coupling X-ray and several spectroscopic methods a universal set-up was developed by the group of Weckhuysen.3234 This set-up allows a high flexibility in terms of method combinations and catalytic reactions which can be investigated and is shown in Fig. 2. In this case the solid catalyst is placed in a capillary which operates vertically or horizontally as a plug-flow catalytic reactor. The capillary is heated via a heat gun which delivers a stream of hot gas over a definite region of the capillary. Insofar, an open architecture is realized enabling the implementation of UV-visprobe (Avantes) and Raman optics (Kaiser Optical Systems) focussed from outside onto the catalyst sample in the capillary. The relative simplicity of this set-up renders the easy transfer to other beamlines possible and allows for the performing complementary measurements.
Fig. 2 Scheme of the experimental set-up used for simultaneous WAXS(XAFS,XANES)/Raman/UV-vis/MS measurements (reproduced from ref. 32).
This operando set-up was applied for probing the stability of iron molybdate and MoO3catalysts during methanol oxidation.32,33 It was also successfully applied for the monitoring of spatiotemporal changes in MoO3reduction by methanol using high energy beamlines.34
A similar multitechnique approach was applied for the monitoring of catalyst preparation processes in liquid phase combining WAXS/SAXS and Raman/ATR/UV-vis measurements35 which is described in detail in Section 3.2.
For the sake of completeness the set-ups combining XAFS and UV-vis spectroscopy used for investigations in homogeneous liquid phase systems should be mentioned.1820 Thus, the influence of X-rays in terms of inducing chemical changes of copper complexes in solution could be demonstrated by simultaneously monitoring with UV-vis.19,20 Besides a temperature effect of the X-ray beam a reducing influence on the sample was observed, too.
Such damaging effects of X-rays have also to be taken into account during investigations of solid catalyst samples when the material is irradiated for elongated time periods.
Although in situsynchrotron-based X-ray techniques are routinely used to investigate the chemistry of dynamically changing systems, their application for studying catalyst preparation and operation is relatively rare. Respective investigations are practised only by a few groups because the access to synchrotron time is a necessary requirement. Furthermore, the complexity and expense associated with building the appropriate apparatus as well as the problems related to data analysis have to be considered.
2.2 Coupling of spectroscopic methods
Nowadays the availability of fibre-optical systems offers several possibilities for practising in situ characterization of catalytic systems. Because quartz glass is transparent for Raman Laser and UV-vis rays the application of these spectroscopies is very versatile. Thus, the respective UV-visprobe and the Raman Laser optics can be focussed from the outside onto the catalyst bed in the quartz reactor and allows a contactless analysis of the catalyst as practised for the investigation of several reactions.36,4850
Interestingly, coupling of UV-vis and/or Raman spectroscopy with infrared spectroscopiesFTIR, DRIFTS, or ATR is not widely used. This might be caused by some difficulties associated with infrared transparency and the necessary requirements concerning appropriate materials.
Quasi simultaneous in situ Raman and FTIR measurements were carried out on a single bench-top instrument (combined dispersive Raman and FTIRmicroscope) using a dedicated cell with infrared transparent ZnSe windows.43 This equipment was used to study the DeNOx reaction over Pd/γ-Al2O3 and the catalyticoxidation of methanol on Mo/Al2O3catalysts.43,44 For the first reaction it could be shown that IR spectroscopy gives information about the adsorbed NOx species while Raman spectroscopy is highly sensitive to molecular structure modification of the active phase. Thus, both, the adsorbed species and their bonds with the support could be characterised.
The combination of surface-sensitive DRIFTS and bulk-sensitive Raman was reported by the group of Baiker (Zurich, Switzerland) enabling the space- and time-resolved investigation of catalytic reactions.45 For this purpose a special reaction cell was developed by means of which the NOxstorage and reduction on PtBa/CeO2 was monitored. However, a detailed description of the cell design is missing. Insofar it is not really clear whether genuinely simultaneous or separate measurements were carried out.
Whereas the coupling of ATR with UV-vis spectroscopy was developed and applied by Brgi39 for heterogeneously catalysed reactions in liquid phase (cf. Section 2.4), papers concerning the coupling of FTIR or DRIFTS with UV-vis for studying gassolid reactions are very scarce.
Sobalk et al.40 reported a set-up permitting simultaneous FTIR/UV-vis investigations applied for the study of NH3 adsorption on CoNa-FER as well as the SCR of NO by NH3 and N2O decomposition over Fe-FER. This equipment comprises a commercial IRcell (ISRI) operating in transmission mode using self-supporting wafers of the solid catalyst and a UV-vis reflection probe (Avantes). The latter was implemented near the wafer in the cell so that the probe contacts the wafer outside the course of the IR beam. Unfortunately, no UV-vis spectra were shown and discussed in the above mentioned paper so that it is difficult to evaluate the specific contribution and benefit of the simultaneous UV-vis spectroscopic measurements. Quantitative information on the transport, adsorption/desorption phenomena, and surface species transformation under transient conditions were mainly obtained by analysing the FTIR data.
A similar set-up facilitating simultaneous operando DRIFTS/UV-vis/MS investigations of gassolid reactions was developed and tested in our group41 and is described in detail in Section 3.1.
2.3 Coupled methods including magnetic resonance spectroscopies
Compared with vibrational and optical spectroscopy, NMR and EPR spectroscopy are not widely spread, not least, because of the relatively high original costs and more sophisticated data analysis. Therefore, only few groups are able to develop suitable set-ups for the in situ characterisation of solid catalysts.
Leading activities in the field of combining different spectroscopic methods comprising EPR were carried out by Brckner48 who established the first threefold coupling of operando techniques (EPR/Raman/UV-vis) with gas chromatographic product analysis. A more detailed description of the benefit of such set-up is exemplarily described in Section 3.3.
Experimental limitations given by the necessary rotation of the sample for solid state NMR measurements (MAS NMR) allow only a restricted coupling with other methods. However, an in situMAS NMR/UV-vis set-up was developed and tested by Hunger and Wang51 studying the formation of cyclic compounds and carbenium ions by conversion of methanol on weakly dealuminated zeolite H-ZSM-5. The advantage of method coupling was proved by the following facts: (i) the more detailed separation and assignment of signals of adsorbates on the surface of the solid catalyst by MAS NMR, and (ii) the high sensitivity for all compounds absorbing radiation in the UV-vis region, such as allylic compounds, aromatics, and carbenium ions, by UV-vis spectroscopy. For other examples of use the reader is pointed to ref. 10.
2.4 Method coupling for investigations of heterogeneously catalysed reactions in liquid phase
Heterogeneously catalysed reactions in liquid phase (sometimes under participation of an additional gas phase) gain increasing importance, in particular, in terms of the immobilisation of homogeneous catalysts. Hence, the mode of action of the catalyst as well as the reaction progress needs to be studied.
For this purpose an universal set-up based on an ATR flow-through cell was developed and applied for the study of alcohol oxidation over Pd/Al2O3 by combined ATR and UV-vis spectroscopic measurements.39 A schematic representation of the experimental set-up is given in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 Scheme of the experimental flow-through cell used for simultaneous ATR/UV-vis measurements (reproduced from ref. 39).
The ATR flow-through cell comprises the ZnSe internal reflection element on which the solid catalyst is deposited as thin film and a fused silica window for implementation of the UV-visprobe. The latter was positioned in front of the window perpendicular to the coated ATR crystal approximately 4 mm above the catalyst layer. Alternatively, the UV-vis spectrometer can also be used to analyse the ATR cell effluent. For studying the catalyst behaviour under oxidative and reductive conditions the solvent was saturated with gases in separate glass bubble tanks and was passed through the cell and over the catalyst sample using a peristaltic pump. Using this equipment dissolved reaction products and species adsorbed to catalyst and support could be studied by ATR whereas by means of UV-vis changes of the catalyst were sensitively detected.
An interesting experiment combining FTIR (transmission mode) and ATR measurements for the investigation of benzyl alcohol oxidation in supercritical carbon dioxide over Pd/Al2O3 was described by the Baiker group.42 A custom-made stainless steel high-pressure view cell stable up to 200 bar at 200 C was covered with a sapphire window for the digital imaging of the bulk phase behaviour. Additionally, the cell is equipped with IR windows (ZnSe) allowing transmission IR measurements in the upper part of the reactor and an internal reflection element (ZnSe) mounted at the bottom of the hollow cylinder facilitating ATR measurements. The simultaneous investigation by transmission and ATR infrared spectroscopy at two positions of the reaction cell showed that the sharp increase in activity is correlated to a transition from a biphasic to a monophasic reaction mixture. This phase transition could be monitored by both spectroscopies despite the small concentration of the dense liquid-like phase. Deposition of the Pd/Al2O3catalyst on the ATR crystal allowed gaining insight into the chemical changes and mass transfer processes occurring in the solid/liquid interface region during reaction. Additionally, it could be concluded that the reactant benzyl alcohol was observed on the catalyst during reaction while the product benzaldehyde was only found in the supercritical phase. The fast adsorption of the reactant and the fast desorption of the product seem to be the reason for the high selectivity of the oxidation reaction, even at high turnover rates.
Another concept for the reaction monitoring of heterogeneously catalysed reaction in liquid phase under pressure and temperatures up to 80 C was realised by Knpke et al.46 combining ATR, UV-vis, and Raman spectroscopy in one set-up (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4 Scheme of a modified autoclave with fibre optical probes implemented in the top cover for simultaneous Raman, ATR, and UV-vis (reflection/transmission) spectroscopic measurements used for investigations of heterogeneously catalysed reactions in liquid phase under pressures up to 20 bar (reproduced from ref. 46).
It comprises a modified autoclave (Parr) with fibre optical probes implemented in the top cover for simultaneous Raman, ATR, and UV-vis spectroscopic measurements under pressures up to 20 bar.
To avoid compositional inhomogeneity and to ensure that all probes see the same temporal point in the reaction the reaction mixture was rapidly stirred.
The diamond ATR probe (infrared fiber sensors) is working in the mid infrared range. For UV-vis measurements reflection or transmission probes (Avantes) can be used, for Raman spectroscopic measurements an immersion probe from Kaiser Optical Systems was applied. The equipment was applied for investigation of imine hydrogenation reaction with hydrogen using Pt/Al2O3 as catalyst modified with a chiral phosphoric acid ester for hydrogenactivation. Whereas the conversion of the imines was analysed by Raman spectroscopy, the product formation was monitored by ATR spectroscopic measurements. For studying the changes of the solid catalyst a UV-visprobe working in reflection mode was primarily used. However, the concentration of the catalyst in the reaction mixture was evidently too low.
Otherwise it could be shown that the UV-vis measurements in transmission mode give interesting information concerning the specific interactions between reactants and modifier and offer the possibility for quantitative in situ analysis of the reaction progress. In view of monitoring the interactions between substrate/product and catalyst as well as chiral modifier and catalyst the technique described above using deposited catalyst film on an ATR crystal42 seems to be the more appropriated method.
For the sake of completeness it has to be mentioned that a combination of ATR, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy was already applied for mechanistic investigations of the homogeneously catalysed oxidation of veratryl alcohol with Co(salen) and oxygen in aqueous solution at 80 C.47 In this case the Raman laser was focussed from the outside of the glass flask onto the reaction mixture. The ATR spectra were recorded with a DiComp probe coupled to a Mettler Toledo ReactIR1000 spectrometer.
3. Selected examples of use
In the following section selected examples of use are discussed which show new developments and applications of multitechnique in situ approaches and should demonstrate the advantage of method coupling in terms of getting a deeper insight into catalyst acting and reaction mechanism.
3.1 Oxidative carbonylation of methanol over CuY zeolites studied by operando DRIFTS/UV-vis/MS
Cu-containing zeolites, in particular CuY zeolites, have been found to be appropriate catalysts for the oxidative carbonylation of methanol (MeOH) to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in the gas phase. Such a process would be an attractive, and environmentally benign, alternative to the traditional synthetic route for DMC: the conventional synthesis process having to use highly hazardous and toxic phosgene as a reagent. However, knowledge about the catalytically active species, reaction mechanism, and kinetics is needed to improve the catalytic performance of suitable catalysts. Most of the studies published in literature are based upon in situFTIR observations using Cu-exchanged zeolites. As such conclusions regarding the reaction mechanism are drawn solely on the basis of adsorbed species and their dynamic change. The nature of the catalytically active Cu species, and the role of oxygen within the catalytic cycle, cannot be satisfactorily elucidated on this basis.
To learn more about the species adsorbed at the catalyst surface and their changes during reaction progress associated with changes of oxidation state and coordination sphere of the catalytically active Cu species we established a new operando approach combining DRIFTS and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS) with mass spectrometric product analysis.41 For this purpose a commercial DRIFTS reaction cell (Harrick) was modified using the quartz observation window in the dome to implement a custom-built high-temperature reflection probe (Avantes). The latter contacts the solid catalyst sample directly without disturbing the optical path of the IR beam. For analysing the products the gas outlet of the reaction cell was connected to an OmniStar quadrupole mass-spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum).
The reaction of MeOH/CO/O2 at 130 C was investigated on CuY catalysts with 4, 8 and 16 wt% Cu. The latter system is exemplarily described in the following. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst (50 mg) was pre-treated in flowing He at 400 C and exposed to the reactants after cooling down to 130 C. The composition of the reactant gas mixture was 6.6 vol.% MeOH, 2.2 vol.% CO, and 10.7 vol.% O2 balanced with He/Ar. The in situ DRIFTS and UV-vis-DRSspectra measured simultaneously during 60 min exposure of the catalyst to the reactants are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The DRIFTspectra, showing only the region between 2200 and 1300 cm1 for more clarity, are difference spectra obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the pre-treated catalyst sample from the respective adsorbate spectra at different times.
Fig. 5 In situ DRIFTS spectra of 16CuY measured during exposure to MeOH/CO/O2 reaction mixture at 130 C.
Fig. 6 In situUV-vis-DRSspectra of 16CuY measured during exposure to MeOH/CO/O2 reaction mixture at 130 C.
Already after 1 min contact time adsorbate bands at 1459, 1583, 1634 and 1713 cm1 appear (Fig. 5). The band at 1459 cm1 indicates the CH deformation vibration of adsorbed methoxy species, the respective CH valence vibrations were observed at 2956/2847 cm1 (not shown). Bands at 1583 and 1380 cm1 are typical for formate species (asymmetrical/symmetrical COO stretching modes). While the band at 1634 cm1 can be assigned to adsorbed monomethyl carbonate species, the band at 1713 cm1 points to the formation of carbonyl-containing species. A more detailed band assignment is given in ref. 52.
It is clearly seen that distinct changes of the spectra proceed especially during the first 10 minutes. The intensities of bands belonging to formate species (1583/1380 cm1) increase, the carbonyl band at 1713 cm1 vanishes, and a Cu+CO band appears at 2129/2120 cm1. The intensity of the latter is dramatically increased after 10 min reaction time.
After 20 min exposure time new carbonyl bands at 1738 and 1778 cm1 appear besides the typical bands of CO adsorbed on Cu+ ions (2120 cm1), formate (1591/1380 cm1), and monomethyl carbonate species. These carbonyl bands result from formed dimethyl carbonate which partly remains adsorbed at the catalyst surface.
The UV-vis-DRSspectra of the 16CuYcatalyst (Fig. 6) simultaneously measured with DRIFTspectra during exposure to MeOH/CO/O2 at 130 C show pronounced changes only within the first 5 minutes of reaction. Three characteristic regions can be observed in the spectra. The most intensive band around 270 and 253 nm is assigned to a ligand to metal charge transfer transition (LMCT) resulting from the interaction of O2zeolite with Cu2+ ions.
For the also existing Cu+ ions a 3d103d94s1 transition is expected giving a band around 245 nm. However, this band is superimposed by the strong LMCT band of Cu2+. Insofar it is difficult to identify Cu+ besides Cu2+ properly in these samples. The bands in the region around 500 nm can be explained by CT transitions in Cu2+O2Cu2+ chain-like structures formed in the zeolite channels or intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions between neighboured Cu2+ and Cu+ ions preferably occurring in such CuOx agglomerates. The broad band observed around 800 nm results from dd transitions of Cu2+.
Looking at the temporal changes in the UV-vis-DRSspectra (Fig. 6) it is clearly seen that the intensity of the band around 500 nm decreases in the first 5 min of reaction whereas the band intensity of the dd transitions increases. Simultaneously the LMCT band becomes slightly more intense and shifts to lower wavelength.
The corresponding results from simultaneous mass spectrometric analysis of the gas phase are displayed in Fig. 7 showing the signal intensity changes of the reactants and main products during the reaction of 16CuY with MeOH/CO/O2 at 130 C.
Fig. 7 Temporal changes of mass spectrometric signals of reactants and products during exposure of 16CuY with MeOH/CO/O2 at 130 C.
It is interesting to see that at the beginning of reaction MeOH mainly remains adsorbed at the catalyst surface and only CO2 and H2O are produced. The formation of DMC, dimethoxy methane (DMM), and methyl formiate (MF) starts significantly later.
These observations are in good agreement with the DRIFTS and UV-vis results. Obviously, at the beginning of reaction the oxidation of CO and methanol to CO2 is preferred. Because of the observable changes of the UV-vis band around 500 nm it seems that CuOx agglomerates are involved in this reaction. This finding is in line with DRIFTS results showing also the formation of formate and carbonyl-containing species as oxidation products adsorbed at the catalyst surface. Additionally, the formation of gaseous CO2 could be observed (bands around 2360/2330 cm1; not shown in Fig. 5). While in the DRIFTS and UV-vis spectra no further distinct changes are observed after 10 min reaction time MS data reveal the beginning formation of the desired product DMC reaching a constant value after 30 min. It seems that the catalyst oxidises not selectively at the beginning of reaction and needs some time to reach a constant working state. Both, the preceding changes in this starting phase and the nearly steady state of the working catalysts can nicely be monitored by DRIFTS and UV-vis-DRS (cf.Fig. 5 and 6).
The observed formation of DMM by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 7) can be explained by the reaction of intermediately formed formaldehyde with MeOH, while the consecutive oxidation of formaldehyde leads to formic acid that preferably adsorbs as formate at the catalyst surface or reacts with MeOH to MF.52 The latter is detected in the gas phase whereas the extent of formate adsorption can nicely be followed by DRIFTS. Thus, the slight decrease of formate band intensities with beginning DMC formation implicates their possible participation in the reaction cycle.
For the sake of completeness it has to be mentioned that the additional changes in the UV-vis bands described above are mainly attributed to adsorbate formation. Thus, the slight increase of the LMCT band intensity and its blue shift from 270 to 253 nm as well as the rising band intensities for dd transitions of Cu2+ ions around 800 nm (Fig. 6) are associated with successive adsorbate formation indicating changes in the coordination sphere of the Cu cations.
In conclusion, simultaneous monitoring of the reaction by DRIFTS and UV-vis-DRS gives information about formation and changes of adsorbates as well as changes of the coordination sphere of the Cu cations involved in the onward catalytic reaction. However, from this information alone the catalytic performance and mechanistic considerations cannot be completely evaluated as all the products, which are not adsorbed at the surface, cannot be observed spectroscopically (e.g. DRIFTS, UV-vis). This illustrates the necessary combination of different spectroscopic methods with product analysis (e.g.mass spectrometry or gas chromatography) to get a realistic picture and enable a confident interpretation.
3.2 Synthesis of molybdatecatalysts precursors monitored by simultaneous WAXS/SAXS/Raman/ATR/UV-vis
Heterogeneous Mo-based mixed oxides are versatile catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes and olefins to the corresponding aldehydes, anhydrides or acids. In particular, iron molybdates are widely used for the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In general, such mixed oxides must have a dedicated phase composition and structure to provide optimum catalytic performance for a desired reaction. Their synthesis frequently comprises a series of subsequent steps such as precipitation of precursors, isolation of the precipitate, drying and final calcination. Tailoring such multi-step synthesis protocols for the reproducible and preferential formation of target phases is a true challenge, since a variety of parameters can play a role. Careful control of the different synthesis steps is necessary, which may be facilitated by spectroscopic on-line monitoring.
Recently, simultaneous X-ray scattering (WAXS/SAXS) together with Raman spectroscopic investigations were applied to observe structural changes during the synthesis of Mo-based mixed oxide catalyst precursors.35 Separately, the same procedure was monitored by simultaneous ATR/UV-vis/Raman spectroscopy whereby Raman spectroscopy, showing the same results in both experiments, ensured proper comparability of the conditions in both set-ups. Inspired by the promising results of this preliminary study, in the following the simultaneous coupling of five complementary methods (WAXS/SAXS/Raman/ATR/UV-vis) for on-line monitoring of molybdate catalyst precursor synthesis was realised. To demonstrate the added value of this novel fivefold coupling of different techniques, the synthesis of a phosphate-containing ammonium iron molybdate is exemplarily described. The experimental setup which is showing schematically in Fig. 8 was installed at the μSpot Beamline (BESSY, Berlin).
Fig. 8 Scheme of the experimental setup with fiber optical probes for ATR and UV-vis immersed into the reaction solution and the flow-cell implemented at the micro focus beamline for SAXS/WAXS and Raman. The reaction slurry was continuously pumped within a closed circuit. The flow cell was permanently observed via a turnable microscope.
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that UV-vis and ATR measurements on the one hand and Raman and X-ray scattering measurements on the other hand were performed at different locations in the set-up. However, the distance was relatively short and the pumping rate high, so that the slurry phase reached the capillary within ca. 5 seconds. Thus, one can be certain to enter the same temporal point in the reaction at the different positions. But, for very fast reactions, the utilization of this experimental set-up with separated measuring points seems to be problematic.
The synthesis procedure comprises three subsequent stages: mixing of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) and Fe nitrate solution at 20 C under stirring for 60 min (I), addition of diammonium hydrogenphosphate (DAHP) solution followed by further stirring for 30 min (II), and finally heating and stirring of the slurry for 60 min at 50 C (III). The molar ratio MoFeP was 1211.
The scattering patterns recorded during synthesis procedure show sharp Bragg reflections indicating the formation of crystalline phases already from the very beginning (Fig. 9). In stage I, the slope of the SAXS curve increases linearly with decreasing q. This is characteristic for particles with a high contrast in electron density. Since no typical form of the curve was recorded, particles have to be assumed as polymorphic and polydisperse with dimensions larger than 5 nm. With increasing reaction time, the slope of the SAXS curves decreases continuously, which can be explained by ongoing crystallization giving rise to the WAXS pattern, the Bragg reflections of which can be assigned to a so-called Anderson phase A isotypic with (NH4)3H6RhMo6O24·6H2O (PDF 81-1301), but most likely contains Fe instead of Rh in the middle of the hexamolybdate ring. Starting from this structural model the lattice constants for the respective Fe compound were refined to a = 11.517 Å, b = 7.2434 Å, c = 11.904 Å, β = 100.06, and V = 1497 Å3. Besides this phase, additional reflections arise after a few minutes suggesting the formation of an additional phase B (Fig. 9b) which could not be identified by WAXS but by Raman spectroscopy (see below).
Fig. 9 X-Ray scattering curves obtained every 2 min (a) and selected XRD pattern (b) after mixing the AHM with the Fe nitrate solution (I), adding of DAHP solution (II) and heating at 50 C (III).
In stage II, the SAXS curves show an arced shape and rising intensity while the Bragg reflections of phase B vanish, leaving behind only the WAXS pattern of the initial Anderson phase A observed in stage I. The diminishing rise of the scattering curve with smaller q indicates solid particles again, but with smaller dimensions compared to stage I. Based on the shape and size of the Anderson anion, the SAXS curves can be fitted by a scattering model of cylinders/spheres. This fit suggests the presence of cylindrical particles of about 1 nm radius and 4 nm length. During stage III, decreasing intensity in the SAXS region points again to particle growth while in the WAXS pattern additional reflections of another unknown phase C (Fig. 9b) are detected, besides those of phase A.
Raman spectra recorded during stage I show besides the nitrate band several other bands which are characteristic for the Anderson-type phase A containing [H6FeMo6O24]3 species (Fig. 10).
Fig. 10 Raman spectra of AHM + Fe nitrate (I), subsequent DAHP admixture at 25 C (II), and at 50 C (III).
The additional band at 967 cm1, the intensity of which increases with time, might stem from the new molybdate phase B which was observed, too, in the WAXS pattern (Fig. 9b). Considering the fact that, depending on the condensation degree of the molybdate ions, the position of the characteristic νs(MoOt) band shifts to higher wavenumbers, phase B should consist of [Mo8O26]4 species, which possibly contain Fe cations. After adding DAHP in stage II, this band vanishes since phase B dissolves (detected by WAXS) due to the increase of pH. During treatment at 50 C the band intensities strongly increase with time (Fig. 10, stage III) and the bands at 957 and 898 cm1 shift to 964 and 893 cm1, respectively. This suggests that the nature of molybdate species does not change much and the observed band shift may be caused by the incorporation of phosphate.
ATR spectra provide additional information on the nature of phosphate species (Fig. 11). After adding DAHP in stage II, a phosphate band appears at 1052 cm1 superimposed on the initial bands at 1057 cm1 which arise from FeOH deformation vibrations. With increasing time at 50 C in stage III, a new phosphate band appears at 1013 cm1 while the other shifts to lower wavenumbers. Taking account of the Raman results, the 1013 cm1 band might arise from a new mixed molybdatophosphate reflected by phase C in the WAXS pattern (Fig. 9b) that coexists with the Anderson phase A in stage III.

The UV-vis spectra (Fig. 12) were measured in reflectance mode. Because the precipitate itself acts as a reflecting element during these measurements, the UV-vis spectra provide exclusive information on the nature of the precipitate.
Fig. 12 UV-vis-DRSspectra of AHM + Fe nitrate (I), subsequent DAHP admixture at 25 C (II), and at 50 C (III).
The spectra recorded during stage I are dominated by the Mo(vi)O charge transfer (CT) band whereas the band around 380 nm can be assigned to a Fe(iii)O CT transition of [Fe(H2O)6]3+ species.
With reaction progress in stage I the absorption edge of the Mo(vi)O CT band shifts slightly to lower wavelength. Simultaneously, the Fe(iii)O CT band looses intensity. Both findings are obviously related to the incorporation of Fe into the initial heptamolybdate as suggested, too, by the Raman results. The addition of DAHP in stage II followed by thermal treatment in stage III leads to a strong red shift of the Mo(vi)O CT absorption edge. This might be caused by incorporation of phosphate into the molybdate structure as also indicated by ATR and Raman spectroscopy.
The integrated evaluation of all the results readily reveals the added value of the novel fivefold coupling: SAXS data provide information about changes of particle size and shape in all three stages and WAXS revealed three different crystalline phases. However, only the structure of the Anderson phase A was identified by WAXS while phases B and C remained unknown. This drawback is compensated by the vibrational techniques which indicate the formation of higher condensed [Mo8O26]4 anions in phase B and probably Fe-containing [PMoxOy]nphosphomolybdate anions in phase C. Thus, the new coupling technique is a unique tool for monitoring the influence of various parameters on the formation of synthesis intermediates and products and offers attractive opportunities for process control. Clearly, the precipitation of a catalyst precursor is only the first step within the whole catalyst preparation process. For tailoring specific properties of the final catalyst (phase composition, crystallinity, morphology), it will be equally important to explore how the properties of the precipitate are influenced by further steps such as drying and calcination.
3.3 Isobutaneoxidation over H4PVMo11O40·xH2O studied by operandoEPR/Raman/UV-vis/GC
Methacrylic acid (MAA) as an important intermediate in chemical industry is currently manufactured via the acetonehydrine route which comprises the reaction between acetone and hydrogen cyanide to give acetonehydrine and the subsequent reaction with excess of concentrated sulfuric acid to form methacrylamide acid sulfate. The latter is then hydrolysed and esterified by the addition of excess methanol forming a mixture of methylmethacrylate and MAA. Apart from the utilisation of highly toxic and caustic educts, high amounts of by-products are produced. Therefore, the one-step selective oxidation of isobutane to MAA could be an attractive alternative to the traditional process because of its simplicity, inexpensive raw materials and negligible environmental impact. So far, Keggin-type polyoxometalates, among those containing [PVMo11O40]4 units, are known to be promising catalysts. However, they suffer from long conditioning and fast deactivation. The conditioning process as well as the structural evolution of V species being most likely part of the active sites in such catalysts is not well understood. Amongst others, simultaneous EPR/Raman/UV-vis/GC technique48 was applied to get information on structural changes of the catalyst during the selective oxidation of isobutane.50
For this operando investigation a calcined sample (350 C, N2) of H4PVMo11O40·xH2O (H4PVMo-c) was used which was exposed to the reactant mixture containing 11 vol.% isobutane and 17.7 vol.% O2 balanced with N2. The catalyst was heated up to 350 C reaction temperature under reactant flow and then exposed to the gas mixture at 350 C for 120 min.
The recorded EPR, Raman, and UV-vis spectra as well as the conversion of isobutane calculated from GC analysis data are shown in Fig. 13. The H4PVMo-c catalyst shows an EPR signal which is characteristic for isolated VO2+ species while no evidence for Mo5+ is obtained. During heating in reactant flow, the EPR signal does not change, however its total intensity (normalised to the reference temperature of 20 C) increases up to 350 C and then remains constant during time on stream. This indicates a further reduction of vanadyl species obviously expelled from the Keggin units during thermal treatment. It agrees nicely with the increase of UV-vis absorbance above 600 nm arising from dd transitions of reduced V species and Mo6+V4+ IVCT transitions. After 120 min feed exposure at reaction temperature of 350 C, a threefold increase of the total EPR intensity is observed but no Mo5+ is detected.
Fig. 13 Simultaneous EPR, UV-vis, and Raman spectra recorded during heating the H4PVMo-c catalyst sample in 11 vol.% isobutane/17.7 vol.% O2/N2 flow and analysed isobutane conversion at 350 C (reproduced from ref. 50).
The Raman spectrum of H4PVMo-c at 20 C reveals characteristic ν(MoO) bands at 1008/997 cm1 and bands at 243/252 cm1 assigned to ν(MoOMo). Additionally, a small band can be seen at 1033 cm1 originating from ν(VO) vibrations of pentavalent V5+O species. With rising temperature an increasing reduction of vanadium goes along with the total disappearance of this band in the Raman spectra (Fig. 13). VO2+ species as evidenced by EPR are hardly visible in Raman spectra. Moreover, an overall decrease of the Raman intensity is observed caused by the darkening of the sample in consequence of reduction.
At 350 C a 2% isobutane conversion is measured which passes a maximum after 30 min time on stream and then slightly decreases again (Fig. 13). After 120 min at 350 C the feed mixture was replaced by a flow of oxygen. This leads to a partial decrease of UV-vis absorbance above 600 nm (not shown). However, the EPR signal did not change at all. Interestingly, also the Raman band at 1033 cm1 characteristic for pentavalent V5+O species hardly reappears. This suggests in agreement with in situFTIR spectroscopic results,53 showing the formation of adsorbed methacrylate and cyclic anhydride species, that during reaction carbon containing deposits might have accumulated on the catalyst surface which contribute to the UV-vis absorbance above 600 nm. Probably, the formation of those deposits is a reason for the decreasing isobutane conversion above 40 min time on stream. Obviously, only these deposits can be removed by treatment in oxygen flow at 330 C, while the VO2+ species are not re-oxidable by this treatment.
Considering all these results from simultaneous EPR/Raman/UV-vis/GC experiments, and taking into account that polyoxometalate catalysts without vanadium showed always markedly lower catalytic performance, it appears that the active sites in the H4PVMo-c catalyst might comprise a VO2+ species being linked viaoxygen bridges to the Mo6+ ions of neighbouring Keggin units from which it has been expelled. This active state of the catalyst is formed by a dynamic restructuring process during initial reaction period.
4. Conclusions
Looking at catalyst acting and catalytic reaction from different perspectives using a combination of several in situ characterization methods is a substantial progress in terms of elucidating the chemistry of catalyst materials, the mechanism of catalytic reaction and the identification of active sites.
While continuing technological developments and wide availability of more flexible fibre optical systems for the different spectroscopies offer new possibilities for realising multitechnique in situ approaches in catalytic research, the essential accessibility of beamlines (synchrotrons) is still restricted. Thus, respective set-ups including X-rays for in situ characterization of catalytic systems were developed and used by only few groups. A possible way for broader usage in the catalysis community might be a more intensive cooperation.
Generally, teamwork is needed when combining methods since it is almost impossible to be an expert in all the techniques to be combined. Furthermore, it has to be considered that combining several methods in one experiment, in particular, when space and time resolved aspects will be included, produces huge databases which have to be analyzed and then correctly cross-correlated to make the experimental procedure worthwhile. This implicates that respective interfaces and methodologies have to be developed.
It has to be realised that no universal multitechnique set-up exists solving all problems because each applied in situ method has specific technical requirements (e.g. usable cell materials), advantages and disadvantages (e.g. beam damage problems, laser heating effects) and provides definite information. Consequently, for getting comprehensive and proper information, it is necessary to design a unique multi-technique approach adapted for the specific catalytic problem. There are different examples illustrating the creation of respective reaction cells with implemented in situ characterization methods and coupled analytics. The latter is of particular importance for the correlation of characterization and catalytic results and to discriminate between genuine active species and spectator species. Only in this way a realistic picture of the catalyst performance is obtained.
Generally, gas phase reactions have already been well studied whereas reactions in liquid phase are much less investigated with the exception of some studies involving synthesis and homogeneously catalysed reactions. In relation to biomass conversion processes which will become more and more important, the interface liquidsolid will therefore be of relevance and needs attention.
Finally, it can be stated that the coupling of complementary operando techniques in one set-up results in more and comprehensive information and allows in the majority of cases a better understanding of the catalytic problem. It opens new perspectives for studying the solid catalyst as well as the reaction itself whereas the development of efficient catalysts and of sustainable commercial processes is among the ultimate aims.
Although developing of such set-ups combining several in situ techniques needs specific knowledge of the operators, catalyst scientists should be motivated to apply such integrated approaches. In principle, no boundaries are set with respect to applicability of such set-ups in different fields of catalytic research comprising heterogeneously and homogeneously catalysed reactions as well as catalyst preparation processes.
