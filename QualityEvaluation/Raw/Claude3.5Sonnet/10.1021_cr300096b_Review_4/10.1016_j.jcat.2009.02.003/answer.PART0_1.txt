[1] "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards."

[2] "The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

The literature only discusses hydrogen chemisorption, not CO chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. For H2 chemisorption:

Methodology: Samples are dried, reduced in H2, degassed to remove chemisorbed H2 and water, then H2 isotherms are measured.

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, which indicate the number of accessible platinum sites.

Data interpretation: H/Pt ratios are calculated based on H2 adsorbed at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm.

Advantages: Can determine accessible metal sites and indirectly measure metal dispersion.

Limitations: Only provides information on accessible metal sites, not the full nature of bimetallic interactions.

Key considerations: Proper sample preparation, including drying and reduction, is crucial. Care must be taken in isotherm measurement and extrapolation.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates using chemisorption data.

文献只讨论了氢气化学吸附,没有讨论CO化学吸附,所以无法进行完整的比较。对于H2化学吸附:

方法:样品先干燥,在H2中还原,脱气以除去化学吸附的H2和水,然后测量H2等温线。

应用:用于测定H/Pt比率,表示可接触的铂位点数量。

数据解释:H/Pt比率基于零压下吸附的H2量计算,从等温线的线性部分外推得出。

优点:可以确定可接触的金属位点,间接测量金属分散度。

局限性:只提供可接触金属位点的信息,不能完全反映双金属相互作用的本质。

关键考虑因素:适当的样品制备(包括干燥和还原)至关重要。等温线测量和外推时需要特别小心。

文献没有提供使用化学吸附数据来标准化反应速率的信息。
