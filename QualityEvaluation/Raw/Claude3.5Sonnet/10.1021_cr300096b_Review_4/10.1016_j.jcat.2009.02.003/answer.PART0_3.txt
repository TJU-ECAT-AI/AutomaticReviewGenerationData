[1] "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards."

[2] "The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

The literature only discusses hydrogen chemisorption, not CO chemisorption, so a direct comparison cannot be made. For hydrogen chemisorption:

Methodology: Samples are dried, reduced in hydrogen, degassed to remove chemisorbed hydrogen/water, then hydrogen isotherms are measured at 313 K. 

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, which indicate the number of accessible platinum sites.

Key considerations: H/Pt ratios are calculated based on hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure by extrapolating the linear part of the isotherm.

Advantages/Limitations: Can measure accessible metal sites, but the literature does not provide enough information to discuss advantages or limitations compared to CO chemisorption.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding CO chemisorption or normalizing reaction rates.

文献只讨论了氢气化学吸附,没有提到CO化学吸附,因此无法直接比较。关于氢气化学吸附:

方法:样品先干燥,在氢气中还原,脱气以去除化学吸附的氢气和水,然后在313 K下测量氢气等温线。

应用:用于测定H/Pt比率,表示可接触到的铂位点数量。

关键考虑因素:H/Pt比率是根据零压下吸附的氢气量计算的,通过外推等温线的线性部分得出。

优势/局限性:可以测量可接触的金属位点,但文献没有提供足够的信息来讨论与CO化学吸附相比的优势或局限性。

文档没有提供足够的信息来全面解答问题的所有方面,特别是关于CO化学吸附或反应速率标准化的部分。
