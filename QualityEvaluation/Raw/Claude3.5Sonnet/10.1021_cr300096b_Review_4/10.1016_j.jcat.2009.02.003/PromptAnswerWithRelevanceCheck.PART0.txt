[1] "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water."

[2] "The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

[3] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio. The highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973. In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples. This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."

The literature only discusses hydrogen chemisorption, not CO chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, some key points about hydrogen chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts can be noted:

Methodology: Hydrogen chemisorption is performed using specialized equipment (e.g. Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The process involves drying samples, re-reducing them in hydrogen, degassing to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water, and then measuring hydrogen adsorption at zero pressure.

Applications: It is used to determine the number of accessible platinum sites, expressed as an H/Pt ratio. This provides information on metal dispersion and available active sites.

Data interpretation: Lower H/Pt ratios with increasing promoter loading suggest fewer available hydrogenation sites, likely due to increased coverage of platinum by the promoter (e.g. tin). This indicates good dispersion of the promoter over the platinum surface.

Limitations: The technique may not directly distinguish between adsorption on different metals in bimetallic catalysts.

Key considerations: Results are typically normalized to the amount of platinum in the sample. Proper sample preparation, including reduction and degassing, is crucial for accurate measurements.

The literature does not provide information to compare this technique with CO chemisorption or discuss its specific advantages over other methods.

文献只讨论了氢气化学吸附,没有涉及CO化学吸附,因此无法进行完整的比较。但是,关于双金属催化剂的氢气化学吸附,可以指出以下几个要点:

方法:氢气化学吸附使用专门的设备(如Micromeritics ASAP 2020)进行。该过程包括样品干燥、在氢气中再还原、脱气以去除化学吸附的氢气和水,然后在零压下测量氢气吸附。

应用:用于确定可接近的铂位点数量,以H/Pt比表示。这提供了关于金属分散度和可用活性位点的信息。

数据解释:随着助剂负载量的增加,H/Pt比降低,表明可用的氢化位点减少,这可能是由于助剂(如锡)对铂的覆盖增加。这表明助剂在铂表面上分散良好。

局限性:该技术可能无法直接区分双金属催化剂中不同金属上的吸附。

关键考虑因素:结果通常归一化到样品中的铂含量。适当的样品制备,包括还原和脱气,对于准确测量至关重要。

文献没有提供信息来比较这种技术与CO化学吸附,也没有讨论它相对于其他方法的具体优势。

The literature only discusses hydrogen chemisorption, not CO chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. For H2 chemisorption:

Methodology: Samples are dried, reduced in H2, degassed to remove chemisorbed H2 and water, then H2 isotherms are measured.

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, which indicate the number of accessible platinum sites.

Data interpretation: H/Pt ratios are calculated based on H2 adsorbed at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm.

Advantages: Can determine accessible metal sites and indirectly measure metal dispersion.

Limitations: Only provides information on accessible metal sites, not the full nature of bimetallic interactions.

Key considerations: Proper sample preparation, including drying and reduction, is crucial. Care must be taken in isotherm measurement and extrapolation.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates using chemisorption data.

The literature primarily discusses hydrogen chemisorption rather than CO chemisorption for characterizing the bimetallic catalysts. Based on the information provided:

Methodology: Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The process involved drying samples, re-reducing them in hydrogen, degassing to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water, and then measuring isotherms at 313 K.

Applications: Hydrogen chemisorption was used to determine the number of accessible platinum sites, expressed as an H/Pt ratio. This ratio provides information on metal dispersion and the availability of active sites.

Advantages: The technique allowed for the observation of changes in the number of available hydrogenation sites with increasing promoter concentration.

Limitations: The method may not directly distinguish between mono- and bimetallic surface sites.

Key considerations: H/Pt ratios were calculated based on hydrogen adsorption at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm. The amount of platinum in the sample was also considered in these calculations.

Data interpretation: Lower H/Pt ratios with increasing tin loading were interpreted as indicating increased coverage of platinum by tin, suggesting good contact between platinum and tin for RDP prepared samples.

The literature does not provide information on CO chemisorption or compare it to hydrogen chemisorption. It also doesn't discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.
