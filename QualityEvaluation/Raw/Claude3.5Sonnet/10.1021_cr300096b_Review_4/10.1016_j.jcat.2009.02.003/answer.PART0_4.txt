[1] "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards."

[2] "The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

[3] "The highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973. In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples. This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."

The literature primarily discusses hydrogen chemisorption rather than CO chemisorption for characterizing the bimetallic catalysts. Based on the information provided:

Methodology: Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The process involved drying samples, re-reducing them in hydrogen, degassing to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water, and then measuring isotherms at 313 K.

Applications: Hydrogen chemisorption was used to determine the number of accessible platinum sites, expressed as an H/Pt ratio. This ratio provides information on metal dispersion and the availability of active sites.

Advantages: The technique allowed for the observation of changes in the number of available hydrogenation sites with increasing promoter concentration.

Limitations: The method may not directly distinguish between mono- and bimetallic surface sites.

Key considerations: H/Pt ratios were calculated based on hydrogen adsorption at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm. The amount of platinum in the sample was also considered in these calculations.

Data interpretation: Lower H/Pt ratios with increasing tin loading were interpreted as indicating increased coverage of platinum by tin, suggesting good contact between platinum and tin for RDP prepared samples.

The literature does not provide information on CO chemisorption or compare it to hydrogen chemisorption. It also doesn't discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

该文献主要讨论了氢气化学吸附而非CO化学吸附来表征双金属催化剂。基于所提供的信息：

方法：使用Micromeritics ASAP 2020进行氢气化学吸附测量。该过程包括干燥样品、在氢气中重新还原、脱气以去除化学吸附的氢气和水，然后在313 K下测量等温线。

应用：氢气化学吸附用于确定可接触的铂位点数量，以H/Pt比表示。这个比率提供了金属分散度和活性位点可用性的信息。

优点：该技术允许观察随着助剂浓度增加而导致的可用氢化位点数量的变化。

局限性：该方法可能无法直接区分单金属和双金属表面位点。

关键考虑因素：H/Pt比率是根据零压下的氢气吸附量计算的，这是通过等温线的线性部分外推得出的。样品中的铂含量也被考虑在这些计算中。

数据解释：随着锡负载量的增加，H/Pt比率降低被解释为铂被锡覆盖程度增加的迹象，这表明RDP制备的样品中铂和锡之间有良好的接触。

该文献没有提供关于CO化学吸附的信息，也没有将其与氢气化学吸附进行比较。它也没有讨论基于化学吸附数据的反应速率标准化。
