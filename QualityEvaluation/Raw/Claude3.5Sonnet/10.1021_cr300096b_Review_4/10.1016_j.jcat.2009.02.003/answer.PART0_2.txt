[1] "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards. The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

The literature only discusses hydrogen chemisorption, not CO chemisorption, so a direct comparison cannot be made. For hydrogen chemisorption:

Methodology: Samples are dried, reduced in hydrogen, degassed to remove chemisorbed hydrogen/water, then hydrogen isotherms are measured at 313 K. 

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, which indicate the number of accessible platinum sites.

Key considerations: Results are based on hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm. The amount of platinum in the sample is also considered.

Limitations: The document does not discuss limitations of this technique.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about comparing CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for bimetallic catalysts. More information would be needed on CO chemisorption and specific applications to bimetallic systems.

这篇文献只讨论了氢气化学吸附,没有提到CO化学吸附,因此无法直接比较。对于氢气化学吸附:

方法:样品先干燥,在氢气中还原,脱气以去除化学吸附的氢气和水,然后在313 K下测量氢气等温线。

应用:用于确定H/Pt比率,表示可接触的铂位点数量。

关键考虑因素:结果基于零压下吸附的氢气量,从等温线的线性部分外推得到。同时也考虑了样品中的铂含量。

局限性:文献没有讨论这种技术的局限性。

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在双金属催化剂上的应用问题。需要更多关于CO化学吸附以及在双金属系统中具体应用的信息。
