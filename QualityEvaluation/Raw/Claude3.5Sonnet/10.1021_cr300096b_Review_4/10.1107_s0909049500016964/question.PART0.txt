IFEFFIT, an interactive program and scriptable library of XAFS al-
gorithms is presented. The core algorithms of AUTOBK and FEFFIT
have been combined with general data manipulation and interactive
graphics into a single package. IFEFFIT comes with a command-line
program that can be run either interactively or in batch-mode. It also
provides a library of functions that can be used easily from C or For-
tran, as well as high level scripting languages such as Tcl, Perl and
Python. Using this library, a Graphical User Interface for rapid on-
line data analysis is demonstrated. IFEFFIT is freely available with
an Open Source license. Outside use, development, and contribu-
tions are encouraged.
Keywords: XAFS Analysis.
1. Introduction
The availability of high-quality and easy-to-use programs for data
analysis is of primary importance for beamlines and practition-
ers of XAFS. As Dimakis and Bunker wrote in 1999(Dimakis &
Bunker, 1999), describing their APEX program:
There has long been a need for a basic set of x-ray
absorption fine-structure analysis (XAFS) programs
that are freely available, including source code; that
runs on all major operating systems; is readily exten-
sible; is easy to use for beginners; and is a useful tool
for experts.
This is an ambitious set of requirements, but certainly achievable,
as Dimakis and Bunker have shown with their wrapper for the
freely available batch-processing UW/NRL Fortran programs.
In addition to the requirements that Dimakis and Bunker set,
I would also add: the use of robust EXAFS analysis procedures,
and a facility for users to write macros, scripts, or even programs
of varying levels of sophistication for repetitious analysis tasks.
The need for form-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to oth-
erwise complex EXAFS analysis procedures is probably obvious
to the reader, as is the need for predictability, uniformity, and cor-
rectness of the analysis procedures used. With the gravity of all
of these lofty analytic, social, and programming goals in mind, I
describe IFEFFIT, an attempt to bring interactivity, flexibility, and
scripting capabilities to the AUTOBK(Newville et al., 1993) and
FEFFIT(Newville et al., 1995) algorithms, and demonstrate its pro-
grammability with a fledgling Graphical Interface, G.I.FEFFIT.
2. Command Line Interface and Data Handling
IFEFFIT is implemented as a programming library that provides an
interactive session which is available either from within a calling
program or directly to the user through a command-line interface.
The session takes commands to read, write, and manipulate data as
input as processes the data as requested. Though IFEFFIT is imple-
mented as a program library, not as an executable program per se,
a simple command-line-interface (CLI) is easily implemented and
comes installed with the library. This CLI (simply called ifef-
fit) serves as the most basic interface to the IFEFFIT library.
The data manipulation capabilities of IFEFFIT include XAFS
analysis procedures that implement the AUTOBK background-
removal scheme, XAFS Fourier transforms, and modeling and fit-
ting of XAFS data with FEFF(Zabinsky et al., 1995; Ankudinov
& Rehr, 1997) calculations, based on the algorithms that make up
FEFFIT. IFEFFIT also supports the plotting and simple algebraic ma-
nipulation of data ( +,
,
,
=, sin, cos, exp, etc.). This is a very
different philosophy of data analysis than in the stand-alone AU-
TOBK and FEFFIT programs which, when packaged as part of the
UWXAFS Project(Stern et al., 1995), created a rigid and fixed for-
mat of procedures and user-interaction for XAFS analysis.
IFEFFIT provides the user with the ability to create, read, and
write data into named program variables in the IFEFFIT session.
Data for XAFS analysis is generally stored as one-dimensional
arrays, and IFEFFIT supports and distinguishes data for arrays,
scalars, and text strings. General mathematical manipulation of
data is supported for arrays and scalars, so that it is trivial to do
common tasks such as adding two arrays element-by-element or
scaling every element of an array by a constant factor. Currently,
input data is expected to be in simple ASCII text files with columns
of data corresponding to one-dimensional arrays. IFEFFIT makes
the reading and writing of data files to and from program variables
very easy.
The commands that IFEFFIT supports are a mixture of fairly
high-level XAFS analysis commands and basic mathematical
data processing. A complete listing is available on-line(Newville,
2000b), and a partial listing of commands is given in table 1.

Because many commands are repeated for analysis of XAFS
data, and because it is desirable to be able to apply identical pro-
cedures for different sets of data, IFEFFIT has a simple facility for
writing and saving macros of commands: multiple commands
that are executed with a single user-defined macro name. A prim-
itive method exists for substituting parameters in the macros, and
for more sophisticated processing batch files or scripts written in
high-level languages can be used.
IFEFFIT uses the PGPLOT(Pearson, 1997) graphics library for
plotting data. Currently, this library works well to produce plots
for X Windows, in Postscript, and in GIF. This library has been
ported to native Win32 systems, and IFEFFIT has had some success

using this port. IFEFFIT can also be built without built-in graphics
from PGPLOT.
3. Programmers Interface
The IFEFFIT library is written in Fortran, and can be used from
Fortran or C programs. Special attention has been given to ensure
that this library can also be used from high-level scripting lan-
guages such as Tcl(Ousterhout, 1994), Perl(Wall et al., 1997), and
Python(von Rossum, 1995; Lutz & Ascher, 1999). All of these lan-
guages execute directly from source code without an intermediate
compilation step, run on Unix, Windows, and Macintosh systems,
and are freely available. Scripts written for one operating system
can usually be ported to other systems with minimal work. Such
scripting languages are ideal for rapidly developing small scien-
tific programs. As will be demonstrated in the next section, they
can also be used for writing cross-platform GUIs.
The application programmers interface to the
IFEFFIT li-
brary is very simple, and extensive programming experience
is not required to use it. The IFEFFIT library provides 7 ba-
sic functions, which give full access to an underlying IFEF-
FIT session and its data from the calling program or script.
The principle function in the library is ifeffit(), which ex-
ecutes IFEFFIT command strings as if they were typed at the
command-line. The remaining 6 functions provide mechanisms
to move IFEFFITs three principle data types (scalar, array, and
text string) from the IFEFFIT session directly to and from the
calling program. These are get scalar(), get array(),
get string(),
put scalar(),
put array(),
and
put string(). More detailed descriptions are available in the
on-line documentation(Newville, 2000b).
A simple example of using the IFEFFIT library from within an-
other program would be to add AUTOBK background capabilities
for data already existing in a program, such as a beam-line data
acquisition program. Such a program might look like this (this ex-
ample is in Python, as it is the most like pseudo-code of all the
available languages), assuming that data for
(E
) exists in the ar-
rays energy and mu data):
#!/usr/bin/python
##
load the ifeffit library
from Ifeffit import *
##
## process mu(E) --> energy and mu_data arrays
ret1 =
put_array(energy,
dat.energy)
ret2 =
put_array(mu_data, dat.mu)
## execute ifeffits spline command
ifeffit(spline(dat.energy,dat.mu, rbkg=1.1
find_e0, kweight=1))
## create k*chi(k) inside
ifeffit
ifeffit(set dat.chik =
dat.k * dat.chi)
## retrieve chi(k) and k*chi(k) from ifeffit
k
=
get_array(dat.k)
chi
=
get_array(dat.chi)
chik =
get_array(dat.chik)
e0
=
get_scalar(e0)
step =
get_scalar(edge_step)
## print out data retrieved from ifeffit
print "e0 = ", e0, " edge step = ", step
print " chi(k) data has ", len(chi), " points."

tion of IFEFFITs commands spline and set and also the passing
back and forth of data from the script to the underlying IFEFFIT session
with the put array, get array, and get scalar functions.
4. G.I.FEFFIT: Graphical Interactive FEFFIT
One of the most important aspects of the IFEFFIT programming li-
brary is its ability to be called from high-level scripting languages.
Such languages are excellent for rapid development of small to
medium scientific applications, and often suitable for full appli-
cations, especially when used as a wrapper or front-end to an un-
derlying library. Moreover, such languages typically include sup-
port for building graphical user interfaces. All three of the script-
ing languages (Tcl, Perl, and Python) for which IFEFFIT currently
has wrappers provide GUI toolkits for Windows and Unix systems.
Both Tcl and Python also support GUIs on the Macintosh.
Therefore, although IFEFFIT is not a GUI program itself, graph-
ical form-based applications can be built fairly easily by combin-
ing it with a high-level scripting language. As a demonstration of
this ability, as a teaching tool, and as a quick on-line data anal-
ysis system, G.I.FEFFIT has been written. While essentially an
enhanced command-line program, G.I.FEFFIT provides graphical
forms to assist common analysis tasks such as reading and writ-
ing data files, plotting arrays, and simple XAFS analysis tasks
like pre-edge subtraction, normalization, post-edge background re-
moval and Fourier transforms. G.I.FEFFIT is still in development.
At this writing it does not have a complete form-based interface to
FEFFIT-type fitting of XAFS data, but it is an easy-to-use, flexible
program for simple data processing, plotting, background subtrac-
tion, and Fourier transforms. G.I.FEFFIT is written in Python, and
has been written and tested on linux and other Unix systems using
X Windows. A port to Windows is in progress. Figs 2, 3, and 4
show example forms from G.I.FEFFIT, and Fig. 5 shows an exam-
ple plot of data resulting from the background removal window.

terface, and notebook selections for different types of data in IFEFFIT.

5. Conclusions
IFEFFIT is free software, distributed under an Open Source license.
It is still in a relatively early stage of development, though most of
the algorithms needed for XAFS analysis are supported. In com-
parison to the advanced fitting capabilities of FEFFIT(Newville,
2000a), IFEFFIT is missing a few important features, most notably
simultaneous fitting of multiple data sets and improved background
refinement. Such advanced features as well as other algorithms
such as principle component analysis, and anomalous scattering
factors are planned or partially implemented at this writing. IFEF-
FIT already has many capabilities not found in most XAFS analysis
packages, and has the potential for much larger command set and
more complete analysis tools.
I thank Bruce Ravel, Julie O. Cross and John Rehr for helpful
discussions on the structure of IFEFFIT, and the many users of AU-
TOBK and FEFFIT for providing kind and encouraging feedback.
