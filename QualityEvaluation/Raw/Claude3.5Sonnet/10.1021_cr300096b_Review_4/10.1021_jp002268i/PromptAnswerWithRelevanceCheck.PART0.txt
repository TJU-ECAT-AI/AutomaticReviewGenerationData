<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically comparing CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The document focuses on the preparation and characterization of Pt and Pt/Al2O3 thin films using ATR-IR spectroscopy, STM, and XPS. It does not discuss methodologies, applications, advantages, or limitations of CO and H2 chemisorption for determining active metal sites or metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts. The literature also does not address considerations for data interpretation or normalization of reaction rates in this context. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based on the provided text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically comparing CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The document focuses on using CO adsorption to probe platinum thin films, but does not discuss H2 chemisorption or bimetallic catalysts in the context requested by the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information directly comparing CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The document focuses on ATR-IR spectroscopy of Pt and Pt/Al2O3 thin films, and does not discuss chemisorption methodologies for determining active metal sites or metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

This literature does not contain information directly comparing CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The paper focuses on using CO adsorption to study Pt and Pt/Al2O3 thin films via ATR-IR spectroscopy, but does not discuss H2 chemisorption or bimetallic catalysts in detail. The document lacks comparative information on methodologies, applications, advantages, limitations, and considerations for data interpretation related to CO vs H2 chemisorption for bimetallic catalyst characterization.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

这篇文献并未直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的异同。该论文主要聚焦于使用CO吸附通过ATR-IR光谱研究Pt和Pt/Al2O3薄膜,但并未详细讨论H2化学吸附或双金属催化剂。文中缺乏关于CO与H2化学吸附在双金属催化剂表征中的方法学、应用、优势、局限性以及数据解释注意事项等方面的比较信息。
