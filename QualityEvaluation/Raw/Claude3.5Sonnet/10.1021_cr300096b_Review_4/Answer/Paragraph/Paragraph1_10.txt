A comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques offers valuable insights into the characterization of active metal sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts. Both methods provide essential information about catalyst surface properties, but they differ in their specific applications and limitations. CO chemisorption is particularly useful for determining metal dispersion and surface area in noble metal catalysts, offering high sensitivity and the ability to distinguish between different metal sites. However, it may overestimate dispersion due to multiple CO molecules binding to a single metal atom. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, is advantageous for catalysts containing Group VIII metals and provides accurate quantification of total metal surface area. Its limitations include potential hydrogen spillover effects and lower sensitivity compared to CO chemisorption. The choice between these techniques depends on the specific catalyst composition, desired information, and experimental conditions. Researchers often employ both methods in conjunction to obtain a comprehensive understanding of bimetallic catalyst properties, as each technique complements the other's strengths and weaknesses. Understanding the methodologies, applications, and limitations of CO and H2 chemisorption is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance in various industrial processes.
