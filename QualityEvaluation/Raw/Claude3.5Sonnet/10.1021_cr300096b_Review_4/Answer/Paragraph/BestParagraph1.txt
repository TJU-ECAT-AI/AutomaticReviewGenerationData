Comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing active metal sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts reveals significant differences in methodologies, applications, and limitations.

CO chemisorption is typically preferred for characterizing bimetallic catalysts due to its reliability in determining active sites and providing a basis for rate normalization [10.1021/cr300096b_4]. The methodology involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, often using instruments like the AMI-200ip [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019]. CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although this is acknowledged as an oversimplification [10.1021/cr300096b_4].

H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, utilizes dissociative adsorption of H2. The methodology typically involves drying samples, reducing them in H2, degassing, and then measuring H2 isotherms at a specific temperature (e.g., 313 K) [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.02.003].

Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, but CO chemisorption is generally considered more reliable [10.1021/cr300096b_4]. CO chemisorption provides a quantitative comparison of active sites among catalyst series and is widely used for normalizing reaction rates [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019]. H2 chemisorption allows observation of changes in available hydrogenation sites with increasing promoter concentration [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.02.003].

However, both techniques have limitations. The 1:1 M/CO ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate, especially for bimetallic catalysts where stoichiometry and surface compositions are uncertain [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.01.019]. The CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals and with particle size. For instance, the CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size, while the CO/Pt ratio is unity for a wide range of dispersions [10.1016/j.apcata.2003.11.032].

H2 chemisorption faces challenges with hydrogen desorption from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, affecting accuracy [10.1021/cr300096b_4]. It can also overestimate dispersion due to spillover effects, especially on F-containing catalysts [10.1016/j.apcata.2003.11.032]. Moreover, H2 chemisorption may not directly distinguish between mono- and bimetallic surface sites [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.02.003].

For data interpretation and normalization, CO uptake values are best used as semi-quantitative measures within one metal system [10.1016/j.apcata.2003.11.032]. When normalizing reaction rates, the limitations of both techniques in accurately determining active sites for bimetallics must be considered. For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, reaction rates should be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst [10.1021/cr300096b_4].

In conclusion, while CO chemisorption is generally preferred for bimetallic catalysts, results from both techniques should be interpreted cautiously, considering the assumptions and limitations of each method. Combining multiple characterization techniques is likely necessary for a complete understanding of bimetallic catalyst properties.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques reveals the complexity of characterizing bimetallic catalysts accurately. Moving forward, research efforts could focus on developing more sophisticated chemisorption methods that can overcome the current limitations. For instance, exploring the potential of using multiple probe molecules or combining chemisorption with advanced spectroscopic techniques could provide more accurate and comprehensive information about active sites and metal dispersion in bimetallic catalysts.

Furthermore, the development of computational models that can predict chemisorption behavior on bimetallic surfaces could greatly enhance our understanding and interpretation of experimental data. This could lead to more accurate normalization of reaction rates and better comparison of catalytic activities across different catalyst systems.

Lastly, as catalysis research moves towards more complex multi-metallic systems, there is a need to develop new characterization methodologies that can effectively probe the intricate surface chemistry of these advanced materials. This could involve the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret complex chemisorption data, potentially uncovering patterns and relationships that are not immediately apparent through traditional analysis methods.
