          [1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[5] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

          CO and H2 chemisorption techniques differ in their effectiveness for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology:
- CO chemisorption is preferred as it avoids complications from hydrogen spillover that occur with H2 chemisorption.
- H2 chemisorption can be affected by spillover, especially on fluorine-containing supports.

2. Determining active metal sites and metal dispersion:
- CO uptake increases with exposed metal fraction but doesn't allow direct quantification of dispersion due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry.
- CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size, while CO/Pt ratio is unity for a wide range of dispersions.
- H2 uptake can overestimate dispersion due to spillover effects, especially on F-containing catalysts.

3. Advantages:
- CO chemisorption avoids hydrogen spillover complications.
- CO chemisorption provides more reliable estimates of exposed metal fraction.

4. Limitations:
- Neither technique can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics due to varying stoichiometry.
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals and with particle size.
- H2 chemisorption may not reflect true metal dispersions due to spillover.

5. Data interpretation and normalization:
- CO uptake values are best used as semi-quantitative measures within one metal system.
- Care must be taken in interpreting results due to varying stoichiometries.
- When normalizing reaction rates, the limitations of both techniques in accurately determining active sites for bimetallics must be considered.

Overall, CO chemisorption is generally preferred for bimetallic catalysts, but results must be carefully interpreted. Combining multiple characterization techniques is likely necessary for a complete understanding.

          CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的有效性存在差异:

1. 方法学:
- 首选CO化学吸附,因为它避免了H2化学吸附中出现的氢溢流复杂性。
- H2化学吸附可能受到溢流影响,特别是在含氟载体上。

2. 确定活性金属位点和金属分散度:
- CO吸附量随暴露金属比例增加而增加,但由于CO/金属化学计量比变化,无法直接量化分散度。
- CO/Pd比例随粒径在0.5-0.8之间变化,而CO/Pt比例在很宽的分散度范围内为1。
- H2吸附可能因溢流效应高估分散度,特别是在含F催化剂上。

3. 优点:
- CO化学吸附避免了氢溢流的复杂性。
- CO化学吸附提供了更可靠的暴露金属比例估计。

4. 局限性:
- 由于化学计量比不同,两种技术都无法直接量化双金属的分散度。
- CO/金属化学计量比在不同金属间和不同粒径下存在差异。
- 由于溢流,H2化学吸附可能无法反映真实的金属分散度。

5. 数据解释和标准化:
- CO吸附值最好作为同一金属体系内的半定量测量。
- 解释结果时需谨慎,因为化学计量比有所不同。
- 在标准化反应速率时,必须考虑两种技术在准确确定双金属活性位点方面的局限性。

总的来说,CO化学吸附通常更适合双金属催化剂,但结果必须谨慎解释。可能需要结合多种表征技术才能获得全面的理解。
