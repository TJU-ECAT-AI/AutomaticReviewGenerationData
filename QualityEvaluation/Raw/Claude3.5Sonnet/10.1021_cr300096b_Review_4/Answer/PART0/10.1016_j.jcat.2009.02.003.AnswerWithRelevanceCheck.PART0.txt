          "Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards."

"The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

"The highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973. In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples. This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."

          The literature primarily discusses hydrogen chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, without comparing it to CO chemisorption. Key points about H2 chemisorption include:

Methodology: Performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples are dried, reduced in H2, degassed, and then H2 isotherms are measured at 313 K.

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, indicating the number of accessible platinum sites and providing information on metal dispersion and available active sites.

Advantages: Allows observation of changes in available hydrogenation sites with increasing promoter concentration.

Limitations: May not directly distinguish between mono- and bimetallic surface sites.

Key considerations: H/Pt ratios are calculated based on H2 adsorbed at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm. The amount of platinum in the sample is also considered.

Data interpretation: Lower H/Pt ratios with increasing tin loading suggest increased coverage of platinum by tin, indicating good contact between platinum and tin for RDP prepared samples.

The literature does not provide information on CO chemisorption, its comparison with H2 chemisorption, or normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

          该文献主要讨论了氢气化学吸附用于表征双金属催化剂，但没有与CO化学吸附进行比较。关于H2化学吸附的要点包括：

方法：使用Micromeritics ASAP 2020进行。样品先干燥，在H2中还原，脱气，然后在313 K下测量H2等温线。

应用：用于测定H/Pt比率，表示可接触的铂位点数量，提供金属分散度和可用活性位点的信息。

优点：允许观察随助剂浓度增加而导致的可用氢化位点数量的变化。

局限性：可能无法直接区分单金属和双金属表面位点。

关键考虑因素：H/Pt比率基于零压下吸附的H2量计算，从等温线的线性部分外推得出。同时也考虑了样品中的铂含量。

数据解释：随着锡负载量的增加，H/Pt比率降低，表明铂被锡覆盖程度增加，这表明RDP制备的样品中铂和锡之间有良好的接触。

文献没有提供关于CO化学吸附的信息，也没有将其与H2化学吸附进行比较，或基于化学吸附数据的反应速率标准化。
