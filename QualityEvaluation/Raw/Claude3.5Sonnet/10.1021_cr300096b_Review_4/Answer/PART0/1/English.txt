CO and H2 chemisorption techniques compare as follows in characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, while H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, with CO chemisorption being more commonly used and typically considered more reliable.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used, provides reliable data for normalizing reaction rates, and is the primary method for determining active sites. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites and can provide complementary information.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 M/CO ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate and is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption faces challenges with hydrogen desorption from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, affecting accuracy and requiring careful interpretation.

6. Data interpretation: Results from both techniques should be interpreted cautiously, considering the assumptions and limitations of each method. Special care must be taken when interpreting H2 chemisorption results due to potential desorption issues.

7. Normalization of reaction rates: CO uptake values are used to normalize reaction rates for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts. This is a key advantage of CO chemisorption.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability in determining active sites and providing a basis for rate normalization, while H2 chemisorption serves as a complementary technique with its own set of considerations.

The literature only discusses CO chemisorption and does not mention H2 chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

Methodology: Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip instrument was used to measure CO uptake and metal dispersion.

Applications: CO chemisorption was used to determine metal dispersion and quantify active sites. It provides a quantitative comparison of active sites among catalyst series.

Advantages: Provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites between different catalyst series.

Limitations: For bimetallic catalysts, there is uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions, making dispersion values potentially less meaningful or unreliable.

Key considerations: 
1. Dispersion calculations assumed 1:1 M:CO stoichiometry (M = Pt, Ni). 
2. For bimetallic catalysts, dispersion values should be interpreted cautiously as relative rankings rather than absolute measures.
3. The amount of adsorbed CO may be more reliable for comparisons than dispersion values.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates based on chemisorption data or compare CO chemisorption to H2 chemisorption.

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques differ in their effectiveness for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology:
- CO chemisorption is preferred as it avoids complications from hydrogen spillover that occur with H2 chemisorption.
- H2 chemisorption can be affected by spillover, especially on fluorine-containing supports.

2. Determining active metal sites and metal dispersion:
- CO uptake increases with exposed metal fraction but doesn't allow direct quantification of dispersion due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry.
- CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size, while CO/Pt ratio is unity for a wide range of dispersions.
- H2 uptake can overestimate dispersion due to spillover effects, especially on F-containing catalysts.

3. Advantages:
- CO chemisorption avoids hydrogen spillover complications.
- CO chemisorption provides more reliable estimates of exposed metal fraction.

4. Limitations:
- Neither technique can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics due to varying stoichiometry.
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals and with particle size.
- H2 chemisorption may not reflect true metal dispersions due to spillover.

5. Data interpretation and normalization:
- CO uptake values are best used as semi-quantitative measures within one metal system.
- Care must be taken in interpreting results due to varying stoichiometries.
- When normalizing reaction rates, the limitations of both techniques in accurately determining active sites for bimetallics must be considered.

Overall, CO chemisorption is generally preferred for bimetallic catalysts, but results must be carefully interpreted. Combining multiple characterization techniques is likely necessary for a complete understanding.

The literature primarily discusses hydrogen chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, without comparing it to CO chemisorption. Key points about H2 chemisorption include:

Methodology: Performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples are dried, reduced in H2, degassed, and then H2 isotherms are measured at 313 K.

Applications: Used to determine H/Pt ratios, indicating the number of accessible platinum sites and providing information on metal dispersion and available active sites.

Advantages: Allows observation of changes in available hydrogenation sites with increasing promoter concentration.

Limitations: May not directly distinguish between mono- and bimetallic surface sites.

Key considerations: H/Pt ratios are calculated based on H2 adsorbed at zero pressure, extrapolated from the linear part of the isotherm. The amount of platinum in the sample is also considered.

Data interpretation: Lower H/Pt ratios with increasing tin loading suggest increased coverage of platinum by tin, indicating good contact between platinum and tin for RDP prepared samples.

The literature does not provide information on CO chemisorption, its comparison with H2 chemisorption, or normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.
