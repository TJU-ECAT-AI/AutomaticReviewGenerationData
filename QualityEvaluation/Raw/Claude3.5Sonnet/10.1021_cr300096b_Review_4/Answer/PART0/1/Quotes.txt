[1] "One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption."

[2] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[3] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[4] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

"Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

"Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

"Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

"However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[5] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

"Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Samples were dried at 373 K in vacuum followed by cooling to room temperature. Next, the samples were re-reduced in flowing hydrogen at 473 K for 60 min (heating rate 5 K/min). Afterwards, the samples were degassed for at least 30 min at a pressure of <13.3 Pa at 473 K to remove chemisorbed hydrogen and water. The isotherms were measured at 313 K and the mass was determined afterwards."

"The presented H/Pt ratios are based on the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at zero pressure, which are calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of the isotherm and the amount of platinum in the sample."

"The highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973. In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples. This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."
