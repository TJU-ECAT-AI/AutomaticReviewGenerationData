          [1] "One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption."

[2] "CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification."

[3] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."

[4] "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."

          CO and H2 chemisorption techniques compare as follows in characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption involves pulsing CO over a reduced catalyst and measuring the uptake, while H2 chemisorption uses dissociative adsorption of H2.

2. Active metal sites: Both techniques can determine the number of active metal sites, with CO chemisorption being more commonly used and typically considered more reliable.

3. Metal dispersion: CO chemisorption can estimate metal dispersion by assuming a 1:1 M/CO stoichiometry, though this is an oversimplification.

4. Advantages: CO chemisorption is widely used, provides reliable data for normalizing reaction rates, and is the primary method for determining active sites. H2 chemisorption offers an alternative method for determining active sites and can provide complementary information.

5. Limitations: The 1:1 M/CO ratio assumption in CO chemisorption is not always accurate and is an oversimplification. H2 chemisorption faces challenges with hydrogen desorption from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature, affecting accuracy and requiring careful interpretation.

6. Data interpretation: Results from both techniques should be interpreted cautiously, considering the assumptions and limitations of each method. Special care must be taken when interpreting H2 chemisorption results due to potential desorption issues.

7. Normalization of reaction rates: CO uptake values are used to normalize reaction rates for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts. This is a key advantage of CO chemisorption.

Overall, CO chemisorption is more commonly used due to its reliability in determining active sites and providing a basis for rate normalization, while H2 chemisorption serves as a complementary technique with its own set of considerations.

          CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的比较如下：

1. 方法：CO化学吸附涉及在还原的催化剂上脉冲CO并测量吸附量，而H2化学吸附使用H2的解离吸附。

2. 活性金属位点：两种技术都可以确定活性金属位点的数量，其中CO化学吸附更常用且通常被认为更可靠。

3. 金属分散度：CO化学吸附可以通过假设1:1的M/CO化学计量比来估算金属分散度，尽管这是一个过于简化的假设。

4. 优点：CO化学吸附被广泛使用，提供可靠的数据用于归一化反应速率，并且是确定活性位点的主要方法。H2化学吸附为确定活性位点提供了另一种方法，可以提供补充信息。

5. 局限性：CO化学吸附中1:1 M/CO比例的假设并不总是准确的，且是一个过于简化的假设。H2化学吸附面临着在室温下某些双金属表面氢气解吸的挑战，影响准确性并需要谨慎解释。

6. 数据解释：解释两种技术的结果时应谨慎，考虑每种方法的假设和局限性。在解释H2化学吸附结果时需要特别小心，因为可能存在解吸问题。

7. 反应速率归一化：CO吸附值用于归一化反应速率，以便正确比较不同催化剂之间的催化活性。这是CO化学吸附的一个关键优势。

总的来说，CO化学吸附更常用，因为它在确定活性位点和提供速率归一化基础方面更可靠，而H2化学吸附作为一种互补技术，有其自身的考虑因素。
