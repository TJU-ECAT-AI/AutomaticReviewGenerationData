[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni)."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

[4] "However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

The literature primarily discusses CO chemisorption rather than H2 chemisorption for characterizing the bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption was used to determine CO uptake and metal dispersion. For bimetallic catalysts, there is uncertainty in the stoichiometry and surface compositions, making the dispersion values potentially less meaningful. However, the amount of adsorbed CO still provides a quantitative comparison of active sites between catalyst series. The methodology involved pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip instrument. A key consideration for data interpretation is the assumption of a 1:1 stoichiometry between the metal and CO for calculating dispersion. The literature does not provide information on H2 chemisorption or compare it to CO chemisorption for these catalysts. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of the two techniques cannot be made based solely on this document. More information would be needed to fully address the advantages, limitations, and applications of both techniques for bimetallic catalysts.

该文献主要讨论了CO化学吸附而非H2化学吸附来表征双金属催化剂。CO化学吸附用于测定CO吸附量和金属分散度。对于双金属催化剂，化学计量比和表面组成存在不确定性，使得分散度值可能不太有意义。然而，吸附CO的量仍然提供了催化剂系列之间活性位点数量的定量比较。该方法使用AMI-200ip仪器进行脉冲化学吸附。数据解释的一个关键考虑因素是假设金属与CO之间的化学计量比为1:1来计算分散度。文献没有提供关于H2化学吸附的信息，也没有将其与这些催化剂的CO化学吸附进行比较。因此，仅基于本文档无法对这两种技术进行全面比较。需要更多信息才能全面阐述这两种技术在双金属催化剂上的优势、局限性和应用。
