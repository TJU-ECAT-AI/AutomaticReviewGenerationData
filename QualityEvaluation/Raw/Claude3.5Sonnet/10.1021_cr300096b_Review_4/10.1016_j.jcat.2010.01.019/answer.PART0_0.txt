[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

[4] "However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

The literature only discusses CO chemisorption, not H2 chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

Methodology: Pulse chemisorption was used to measure CO uptake. 

Applications: CO chemisorption was used to determine metal dispersion and number of active sites.

Advantages: Provides quantitative comparison of active sites between catalyst series.

Limitations: Uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface composition for bimetallic catalysts limits the meaning of dispersion values.

Key considerations: Dispersion calculations assumed 1:1 M:CO stoichiometry. For bimetallic catalysts, dispersion values should be interpreted cautiously as relative rankings rather than absolute measures.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

该文献只讨论了CO化学吸附,没有涉及H2化学吸附,因此无法进行全面比较。但是,关于双金属催化剂的CO化学吸附可以得出一些见解:

方法:使用脉冲化学吸附测量CO吸附量。

应用:CO化学吸附用于测定金属分散度和活性位点数量。

优点:可以对不同催化剂系列的活性位点进行定量比较。

局限性:对于双金属催化剂,化学计量和表面组成的不确定性限制了分散度值的意义。

关键考虑因素:分散度计算假设M:CO化学计量比为1:1。对于双金属催化剂,分散度值应谨慎解释为相对排序,而非绝对测量值。

文献没有提供基于化学吸附数据归一化反应速率的信息。
