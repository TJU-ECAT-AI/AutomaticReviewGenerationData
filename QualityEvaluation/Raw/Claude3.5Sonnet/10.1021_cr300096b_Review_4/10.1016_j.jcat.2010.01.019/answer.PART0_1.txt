[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion. However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

CO chemisorption is discussed in the literature as a technique for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The methodology involves using pulse chemisorption to measure CO uptake. This can be used to determine metal dispersion, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between the metal and CO. 

For bimetallic catalysts, there are some limitations with CO chemisorption. The dispersion values obtained may not be very meaningful due to uncertainty in the stoichiometry and surface compositions. However, the amount of CO adsorbed can still provide a quantitative comparison of active sites between catalysts.

The literature does not discuss H2 chemisorption or compare it to CO chemisorption. There is also no information provided on normalizing reaction rates. Overall, CO chemisorption appears to be useful for comparing relative numbers of active sites on bimetallic catalysts, but has limitations in determining absolute metal dispersion values. More careful interpretation is needed for bimetallic systems compared to monometallic catalysts.

文献中讨论了CO化学吸附作为表征双金属催化剂的一种技术。该方法涉及使用脉冲化学吸附来测量CO吸收量。假设金属与CO之间的化学计量比为1:1，可以用来确定金属分散度。

对于双金属催化剂，CO化学吸附存在一些局限性。由于化学计量比和表面组成的不确定性，获得的分散度值可能并不十分有意义。然而，吸附的CO量仍然可以提供催化剂之间活性位点数量的定量比较。

文献没有讨论H2化学吸附或将其与CO化学吸附进行比较。也没有提供关于反应速率标准化的信息。总的来说，CO化学吸附似乎对于比较双金属催化剂上相对活性位点数量很有用，但在确定绝对金属分散度值方面存在局限性。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属体系需要更谨慎的解释。
