[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion. However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

CO chemisorption is discussed in the literature for characterizing the bimetallic catalysts, while H2 chemisorption is not mentioned. The methodology involves pulse chemisorption to determine CO uptake and metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is applied to calculate metal dispersion and quantify active sites. 

An advantage of CO chemisorption is that it provides a quantitative comparison of active sites among catalyst series. However, a key limitation for bimetallic catalysts is the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions, making dispersion values potentially less meaningful. The data should be interpreted cautiously, using CO uptake as a relative measure of active sites rather than an absolute dispersion value. 

The literature does not discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data. Overall, while CO chemisorption provides useful information on active sites for bimetallic catalysts, care must be taken in interpreting the results due to uncertainties with mixed metal systems.

文献中讨论了CO化学吸附用于表征双金属催化剂,但没有提到H2化学吸附。其方法包括使用脉冲化学吸附来测定CO吸附量和金属分散度。CO化学吸附被用来计算金属分散度和量化活性位点。

CO化学吸附的一个优点是可以在催化剂系列之间对活性位点进行定量比较。然而,对于双金属催化剂,一个主要限制是化学计量比和表面组成的不确定性,使分散度值可能不太有意义。数据解释应该谨慎,使用CO吸附量作为活性位点的相对测量,而不是绝对分散度值。

文献没有讨论基于化学吸附数据的反应速率标准化。总的来说,虽然CO化学吸附为双金属催化剂的活性位点提供了有用信息,但由于混合金属体系的不确定性,在解释结果时必须小心谨慎。
