[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

[4] "However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

The literature only discusses CO chemisorption, not H2 chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

Methodology: Pulse chemisorption was used to measure CO uptake. 

Applications: CO chemisorption was used to determine metal dispersion and number of active sites.

Advantages: Provides quantitative comparison of active sites between catalyst series.

Limitations: Uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface composition for bimetallic catalysts limits the meaning of dispersion values.

Key considerations: Dispersion calculations assumed 1:1 M:CO stoichiometry. For bimetallic catalysts, dispersion values should be interpreted cautiously as relative rankings rather than absolute measures.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

该文献只讨论了CO化学吸附,没有涉及H2化学吸附,因此无法进行全面比较。但是,关于双金属催化剂的CO化学吸附可以得出一些见解:

方法:使用脉冲化学吸附测量CO吸附量。

应用:CO化学吸附用于测定金属分散度和活性位点数量。

优点:可以对不同催化剂系列的活性位点进行定量比较。

局限性:对于双金属催化剂,化学计量和表面组成的不确定性限制了分散度值的意义。

关键考虑因素:分散度计算假设M:CO化学计量比为1:1。对于双金属催化剂,分散度值应谨慎解释为相对排序,而非绝对测量值。

文献没有提供基于化学吸附数据归一化反应速率的信息。

CO chemisorption is discussed in the literature as a technique for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The methodology involves using pulse chemisorption to measure CO uptake. This can be used to determine metal dispersion, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between the metal and CO. 

For bimetallic catalysts, there are some limitations with CO chemisorption. The dispersion values obtained may not be very meaningful due to uncertainty in the stoichiometry and surface compositions. However, the amount of CO adsorbed can still provide a quantitative comparison of active sites between catalysts.

The literature does not discuss H2 chemisorption or compare it to CO chemisorption. There is also no information provided on normalizing reaction rates. Overall, CO chemisorption appears to be useful for comparing relative numbers of active sites on bimetallic catalysts, but has limitations in determining absolute metal dispersion values. More careful interpretation is needed for bimetallic systems compared to monometallic catalysts.

文献中讨论了CO化学吸附作为表征双金属催化剂的一种技术。该方法涉及使用脉冲化学吸附来测量CO吸收量。假设金属与CO之间的化学计量比为1:1，可以用来确定金属分散度。

对于双金属催化剂，CO化学吸附存在一些局限性。由于化学计量比和表面组成的不确定性，获得的分散度值可能并不十分有意义。然而，吸附的CO量仍然可以提供催化剂之间活性位点数量的定量比较。

文献没有讨论H2化学吸附或将其与CO化学吸附进行比较。也没有提供关于反应速率标准化的信息。总的来说，CO化学吸附似乎对于比较双金属催化剂上相对活性位点数量很有用，但在确定绝对金属分散度值方面存在局限性。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属体系需要更谨慎的解释。

CO chemisorption is discussed in the literature for characterizing the bimetallic catalysts, while H2 chemisorption is not mentioned. The methodology involves pulse chemisorption to determine CO uptake and metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is applied to calculate metal dispersion and quantify active sites. 

An advantage of CO chemisorption is that it provides a quantitative comparison of active sites among catalyst series. However, a key limitation for bimetallic catalysts is the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions, making dispersion values potentially less meaningful. The data should be interpreted cautiously, using CO uptake as a relative measure of active sites rather than an absolute dispersion value. 

The literature does not discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data. Overall, while CO chemisorption provides useful information on active sites for bimetallic catalysts, care must be taken in interpreting the results due to uncertainties with mixed metal systems.

The literature only discusses CO chemisorption and does not mention H2 chemisorption, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

CO chemisorption was used to determine CO uptake and metal dispersion. The methodology involved pulse chemisorption using specialized equipment. For calculating metal dispersion, a 1:1 stoichiometry between the metal and CO was assumed.

A key limitation noted is the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions for bimetallic catalysts, making the dispersion values potentially unreliable. However, the amount of adsorbed CO was still useful for comparing the number of active sites between different catalysts.

The main application highlighted was determining the number of active metal sites. The technique provided a quantitative comparison of active sites across different catalyst series.

For data interpretation, caution is needed when considering dispersion values for bimetallic catalysts due to uncertainties. The CO uptake data may be more reliable for comparisons.

The literature does not discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

Overall, while CO chemisorption provides useful information on active sites for bimetallic catalysts, there are important limitations to consider in data interpretation, particularly for metal dispersion calculations.

突出的主要应用是确定活性金属位点的数量。该技术为不同催化剂系列之间的活性位点提供了定量比较。

在数据解释方面,由于存在不确定性,在考虑双金属催化剂的分散度值时需要谨慎。CO吸附量数据可能更适合进行比较。

文献没有讨论基于化学吸附数据对反应速率进行标准化。

总的来说,虽然CO化学吸附为双金属催化剂的活性位点提供了有用信息,但在数据解释方面存在重要局限性,特别是对于金属分散度计算。
