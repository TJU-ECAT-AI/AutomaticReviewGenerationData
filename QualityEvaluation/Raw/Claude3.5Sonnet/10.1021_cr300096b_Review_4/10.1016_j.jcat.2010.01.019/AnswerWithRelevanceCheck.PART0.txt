          "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

"Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni). Both the metal dispersion and CO uptake results are shown in Table 2."

"Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

"However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

          The literature only discusses CO chemisorption and does not mention H2 chemisorption, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

Methodology: Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip instrument was used to measure CO uptake and metal dispersion.

Applications: CO chemisorption was used to determine metal dispersion and quantify active sites. It provides a quantitative comparison of active sites among catalyst series.

Advantages: Provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites between different catalyst series.

Limitations: For bimetallic catalysts, there is uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions, making dispersion values potentially less meaningful or unreliable.

Key considerations: 
1. Dispersion calculations assumed 1:1 M:CO stoichiometry (M = Pt, Ni). 
2. For bimetallic catalysts, dispersion values should be interpreted cautiously as relative rankings rather than absolute measures.
3. The amount of adsorbed CO may be more reliable for comparisons than dispersion values.

The literature does not provide information on normalizing reaction rates based on chemisorption data or compare CO chemisorption to H2 chemisorption.

          该文献只讨论了CO化学吸附,没有涉及H2化学吸附,因此无法进行全面比较。但是,关于双金属催化剂的CO化学吸附可以得出一些见解:

方法:使用AMI-200ip仪器进行脉冲化学吸附来测量CO吸附量和金属分散度。

应用:CO化学吸附用于测定金属分散度和量化活性位点。它为催化剂系列之间的活性位点提供了定量比较。

优点:可以对不同催化剂系列的活性位点数量进行定量比较。

局限性:对于双金属催化剂,化学计量比和表面组成存在不确定性,使分散度值可能不太有意义或不可靠。

关键考虑因素:
1. 分散度计算假设M:CO化学计量比为1:1(M = Pt, Ni)。
2. 对于双金属催化剂,分散度值应谨慎解释为相对排序,而非绝对测量值。
3. 吸附CO的量可能比分散度值更适合进行比较。

文献没有提供基于化学吸附数据归一化反应速率的信息,也没有将CO化学吸附与H2化学吸附进行比较。
