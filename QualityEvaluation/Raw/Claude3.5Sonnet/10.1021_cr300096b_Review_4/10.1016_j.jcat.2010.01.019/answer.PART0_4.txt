[1] "Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion."

[2] "Metal dispersion was calculated from the CO chemisorption measurements assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni)."

[3] "Due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values in Table 2 might not be very meaningful, but are listed to provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion."

[4] "However, the amount of adsorbed CO provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the two series of catalysts."

The literature only discusses CO chemisorption and does not mention H2 chemisorption, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, some insights can be drawn about CO chemisorption for bimetallic catalysts:

CO chemisorption was used to determine CO uptake and metal dispersion. The methodology involved pulse chemisorption using specialized equipment. For calculating metal dispersion, a 1:1 stoichiometry between the metal and CO was assumed.

A key limitation noted is the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions for bimetallic catalysts, making the dispersion values potentially unreliable. However, the amount of adsorbed CO was still useful for comparing the number of active sites between different catalysts.

The main application highlighted was determining the number of active metal sites. The technique provided a quantitative comparison of active sites across different catalyst series.

For data interpretation, caution is needed when considering dispersion values for bimetallic catalysts due to uncertainties. The CO uptake data may be more reliable for comparisons.

The literature does not discuss normalization of reaction rates based on chemisorption data.

Overall, while CO chemisorption provides useful information on active sites for bimetallic catalysts, there are important limitations to consider in data interpretation, particularly for metal dispersion calculations.

文献仅讨论了CO化学吸附,没有提到H2化学吸附,因此无法直接比较。然而,关于双金属催化剂的CO化学吸附,可以得出一些见解:

CO化学吸附用于测定CO吸附量和金属分散度。方法涉及使用专门设备进行脉冲化学吸附。在计算金属分散度时,假设金属与CO的化学计量比为1:1。

一个主要限制是双金属催化剂的化学计量比和表面组成存在不确定性,可能导致分散度值不可靠。但是,吸附CO的量仍然可用于比较不同催化剂之间的活性位点数量。

突出的主要应用是确定活性金属位点的数量。该技术为不同催化剂系列之间的活性位点提供了定量比较。

在数据解释方面,由于存在不确定性,在考虑双金属催化剂的分散度值时需要谨慎。CO吸附量数据可能更适合进行比较。

文献没有讨论基于化学吸附数据对反应速率进行标准化。

总的来说,虽然CO化学吸附为双金属催化剂的活性位点提供了有用信息,但在数据解释方面存在重要局限性,特别是对于金属分散度计算。
