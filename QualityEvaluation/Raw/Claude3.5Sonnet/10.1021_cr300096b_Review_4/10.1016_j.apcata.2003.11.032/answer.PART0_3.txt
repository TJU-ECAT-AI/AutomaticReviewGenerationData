[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[5] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts due to several factors:

1. CO chemisorption avoids complications from hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption, especially on fluorine-promoted catalysts. This makes CO uptake a more reliable measure of exposed metal fraction.

2. However, CO chemisorption has limitations for directly quantifying dispersion, as the CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals like Pt and Pd, and can also vary with particle size for a given metal. 

3. For Pd catalysts, the CO/Pd surface ratio ranges from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size. For Pt catalysts, the CO/Pt surface ratio is closer to 1 across a range of dispersions.

4. Due to these stoichiometry variations, CO uptake values are best used as a semi-quantitative comparison within a single metal system, rather than for absolute dispersion measurements.

5. H2 chemisorption can overestimate dispersion, especially on fluorine-containing catalysts, due to enhanced hydrogen spillover. This makes H2 uptake less reflective of true metal dispersion.

6. When normalizing reaction rates, care must be taken in interpreting chemisorption data, as neither technique provides a perfect measure of active sites for bimetallic catalysts. Complementary characterization techniques are often needed for a full picture.

CO化学吸附通常比H2化学吸附更适合表征双金属催化剂,原因如下:

1. CO化学吸附避免了H2化学吸附可能出现的氢溢流问题,特别是在含氟催化剂上。这使得CO吸附量成为测量暴露金属比例的更可靠方法。

2. 然而,CO化学吸附在直接量化分散度方面也有局限性,因为CO/金属计量比在Pt和Pd等不同金属间存在差异,甚至对于同一金属,随粒径变化也会有所不同。

3. 对于Pd催化剂,CO/Pd表面比例随粒径变化在0.5-0.8之间。对于Pt催化剂,CO/Pt表面比例在不同分散度下更接近1。

4. 由于这些计量比变化,CO吸附值最好用作单一金属体系内的半定量比较,而非用于绝对分散度测量。

5. H2化学吸附可能会高估分散度,特别是在含氟催化剂上,这是由于氢溢流增强所致。这使得H2吸附量不能很好地反映真实的金属分散度。

6. 在标准化反应速率时,需谨慎解释化学吸附数据,因为这两种技术都不能完美测量双金属催化剂的活性位点。通常需要互补的表征技术来获得全面的认识。
