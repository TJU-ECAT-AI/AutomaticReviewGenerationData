[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption avoids complications like hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption. 

2. Active metal sites: CO uptake increases with exposed metal fraction, but direct quantification of dispersion is challenging due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry.

3. Metal dispersion: CO/Pt stoichiometry is unity for a wide range of dispersions, while CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size.

4. Limitations: For bimetallics, varying CO/metal stoichiometry makes direct dispersion quantification difficult. H2 chemisorption can overestimate dispersion due to spillover effects, especially on F-containing catalysts.

5. Data interpretation: Care must be taken in interpreting results due to varying stoichiometries. Results are most useful for comparing catalysts within the same metal system.

6. Rate normalization: CO uptake values can be used as a semi-quantitative measure for normalizing reaction rates, but exact dispersion calculations are challenging for bimetallics.

Key considerations include accounting for varying CO/metal stoichiometries and avoiding overestimation of dispersion from H2 spillover effects.

CO化学吸附通常比H2化学吸附更适合表征双金属催化剂:

1. 方法学:CO化学吸附避免了H2化学吸附可能出现的氢溢流等复杂情况。

2. 活性金属位点:CO吸附量随暴露的金属比例增加而增加,但由于CO/金属计量比不同,难以直接定量分散度。

3. 金属分散度:在很宽的分散度范围内,CO/Pt计量比为1,而CO/Pd比例随颗粒大小从0.5到0.8变化。

4. 局限性:对于双金属,不同的CO/金属计量比使直接分散度量化困难。H2化学吸附可能由于溢流效应而高估分散度,尤其是在含F催化剂上。

5. 数据解释:由于计量比不同,解释结果时需谨慎。结果最适用于比较同一金属体系内的催化剂。

6. 速率归一化:CO吸附值可用作归一化反应速率的半定量措施,但对双金属催化剂很难进行精确的分散度计算。

关键考虑因素包括考虑不同的CO/金属计量比,并避免H2溢流效应导致的分散度高估。
