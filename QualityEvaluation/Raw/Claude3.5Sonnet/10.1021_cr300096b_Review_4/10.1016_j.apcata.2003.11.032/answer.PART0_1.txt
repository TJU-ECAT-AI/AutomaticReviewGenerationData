[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts due to fewer complications. The main advantage of CO chemisorption is that it avoids issues with hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption, especially on supports containing fluorine. This allows for a more accurate estimate of the exposed metal fraction.

However, CO chemisorption also has limitations. The CO/metal stoichiometry can vary between different metals (e.g. Pt vs Pd) and even for the same metal depending on particle size. For Pd catalysts, the CO/Pd ratio can range from 0.5-0.8, while for Pt it is typically 1 across a wide range of dispersions. This variation makes direct quantification of dispersion challenging from CO uptake values alone, especially for bimetallic catalysts.

When using either technique to determine active metal sites and dispersion, care must be taken in data interpretation. For H2 chemisorption, enhanced spillover effects need to be considered, particularly on fluorine-containing supports. For CO chemisorption, the varying stoichiometries between metals must be accounted for. Proper normalization of reaction rates requires accurate knowledge of the number of exposed metal atoms, which can be difficult to determine precisely with either method for bimetallic systems.

Overall, while CO chemisorption avoids some issues with H2 spillover, neither technique is perfect for bimetallic catalysts. A combination of characterization methods is likely needed for the most accurate analysis of these complex systems.

CO化学吸附通常比H2化学吸附更适合表征双金属催化剂,因为它涉及的复杂性更少。CO化学吸附的主要优势是避免了H2化学吸附中可能出现的氢溢出问题,特别是在含氟支撑剂上。这使得对暴露金属比例的估计更加准确。

然而,CO化学吸附也存在局限性。CO/金属化学计量比在不同金属之间(如Pt与Pd)甚至同一金属的不同粒径下都可能有所不同。对于Pd催化剂,CO/Pd比可以在0.5-0.8之间变化,而对于Pt,这个比值在很宽的分散度范围内通常保持在1。这种变化使得仅从CO吸附量值直接量化分散度变得具有挑战性,尤其是对于双金属催化剂。

在使用这两种技术确定活性金属位点和分散度时,需要谨慎解释数据。对于H2化学吸附,需要考虑增强的溢出效应,特别是在含氟支撑剂上。对于CO化学吸附,必须考虑金属间不同的化学计量比。准确归一化反应速率需要精确了解暴露金属原子的数量,而对于双金属体系,用任一方法都难以精确确定。

总的来说,虽然CO化学吸附避免了一些H2溢出问题,但对双金属催化剂而言,两种技术都不完美。对这些复杂体系进行最准确的分析可能需要结合多种表征方法。
