[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[5] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques have different strengths and limitations for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

CO chemisorption:
- Avoids complications from hydrogen spillover 
- Provides a semi-quantitative measure of exposed metal fraction
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals (e.g. Pt vs Pd) and with particle size
- Cannot directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics due to varying stoichiometry

H2 chemisorption:
- Can be affected by hydrogen spillover, especially on certain supports
- May overestimate metal dispersion due to spillover effects
- Uptake values may not reflect true metal dispersion

Key considerations:
- CO is preferred to avoid spillover effects
- Stoichiometry differences between metals must be accounted for
- Results are semi-quantitative for comparing within one metal system
- Neither technique can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics
- Particle size effects on stoichiometry should be considered
- Support effects (e.g. fluorine promotion) can enhance spillover for H2

Overall, CO chemisorption appears to be preferred for bimetallics, but results must be carefully interpreted. Combining multiple characterization techniques is likely necessary for a complete understanding of bimetallic catalysts.

CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面有不同的优缺点:

CO化学吸附:
- 避免了氢溢出带来的复杂性
- 提供了暴露金属分数的半定量测量
- CO/金属化学计量比在不同金属间(如Pt vs Pd)和不同粒径下有所不同
- 由于化学计量比的变化,无法直接量化双金属的分散度

H2化学吸附:
- 可能受到氢溢出的影响,尤其是在某些载体上
- 由于溢出效应可能高估金属分散度
- 吸附值可能无法反映真实的金属分散度

关键考虑因素:
- 首选CO以避免溢出效应
- 必须考虑金属间化学计量比的差异
- 结果对于同一金属体系内的比较是半定量的
- 两种技术都无法直接量化双金属的分散度
- 应考虑粒径对化学计量比的影响
- 载体效应(如氟促进)可增强H2的溢出

总的来说,CO化学吸附似乎更适合双金属催化剂,但结果必须谨慎解释。可能需要结合多种表征技术才能全面了解双金属催化剂。
