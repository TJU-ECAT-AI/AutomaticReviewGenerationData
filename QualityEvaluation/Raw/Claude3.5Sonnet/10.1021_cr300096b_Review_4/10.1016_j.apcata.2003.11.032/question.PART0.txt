Competitive hydrogenation of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons on sulfur-resistant bimetallic Pt-Pd catalysts
Abstract
The hydrogenation of tetralin, naphthalene, and phenanthrene as individual feed components and in diesel model feeds has been studied over a series of mono- and bimetallic Pt and Pd supported on γ-alumina at 300 C and 500 psig in excess of H2. The influence of fluorine on activity level and sulfur resistance was evaluated in the presence of controlled concentrations (01000 ppm) of dibenzothiophene (DBT).
Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed. Reversible drops in tetralin conversion of almost two orders of magnitude were observed when the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were present in the reactor, even in minute concentrations. That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted.
The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S. Interestingly, the inhibition by sulfur compounds strongly depended on the space velocity. At high space velocities and low DBT conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible. At low space velocities and high DBT conversions, the poisoning was irreversible. Under those conditions of low space velocity, EXAFS analysis showed further evidence of the beneficial role of F. No PtS bonds were formed on the F-containing catalyst, contrasting with the unpromoted catalysts, on which PtS bonds were clearly observed.
1. Introduction
Recent clean-fuel environmental legislation has generated increased interest in the hydrogenation of polyaromatics present in diesel fuel (e.g. phenanthrene, naphthalene, tetralin). In fact, strict regulations limiting the aromatic content in diesel fuels are soon expected. These compounds are precursors of particulates in diesel engine exhausts and degrade the quality of the fuel. Since cetane number, smoke point, and coloring are all adversely affected by the presence of polyaromatics, deep hydrogenation could be the solution for all these issues.
The saturation of aromatics has been extensively studied on metal sulfide and noble metal catalysts. The latter exhibits the important advantage of being active at significantly lower temperatures, minimizing the severe thermodynamic limitations found at higher temperature for any exothermic hydrogenation reaction. The drawback of noble metal catalysts is their extremely low tolerance to sulfur. Some companies are contemplating a two-stage processing strategy in which the first stage employs a base-metal catalyst for hydrodesulfurization, while the second stage uses a high-activity noble metal catalyst
[1]
. Recent investigations have shown some sulfur tolerance when acidic supports, such as β-and Y-zeolites were employed

[7]
. It has been proposed that the electron withdrawing ability of acidic supports can modify the metal particles, making them electron-deficient and, consequently, disfavoring the formation of metalS bonds. At the same time, the addition of a second metal (e.g. Pt-Pd or Pt-Ge) was found to enhance the sulfur tolerance, and this promotion has also been ascribed to changes in electronic properties
[8]

. The combination of the bimetallic Pt-Pd and acidic supports has resulted in promising catalysts. However, excessive acidity of the support may cause undesired cracking products and coke. Coke formation significantly lowers reactivity, particularly, in zeolite supports on which pore plugging may become a serious obstacle
[17]

[11]
. In this contribution, we have incorporated the acidic function by the addition of controlled amounts of fluorine. It has long been known that the incorporation of fluorine to oxide supports enhances their activity for acid-catalyzed reactions such as cracking, isomerization, alkylation, and disproportionation
[23]
. Since F is very electronegative, as it replaces O or OH groups, it increases the acidity of both protonic (Brnsted) and non-protonic (Lewis) sites on the surface. Early studies
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
have reported the use of F to promote aromatic hydrogenation activity in the presence of sulfur.
Most of the reports found in the literature have either employed feeds of individual aromatic compounds or, less commonly, real diesel feeds. The studies employing individual compounds have used tetralin, naphthalene, or phenanthrene to represent the 1-, 2-, and 3-ring aromatics, respectively. The limitation of those studies is that they do not consider reactant competition, which, as we show in this contribution, greatly affects the hydrogenation conversion. For example, a recent report
[28]
has indicated that the hydrogenation of tetralin is greatly inhibited by the presence of naphthalene. At the other extreme, the studies that use real diesel feeds face the complication of dealing with almost a hundred compounds, making it impossible to follow the evolution of each individual component. In this contribution, we compare reactions including individual aromatic feeds and a synthetic diesel-model feed containing norminally 25 wt.% tetralin, 10 wt.% naphthalene, and 5 wt.% phenanthrene balanced in dodecane.
Another interesting aspect of the present study is the analysis of the trans/cis selectivity in the decalin product. Weitkamp
[29]
explained the formation of cis- and trans-decalins in terms of a gas-phase intermediate 1,9-octalin (octa-hydro-naphthalene), which according to the author, is the most reactive octalin and, therefore, responsible for the formation of both decalin isomers. When the hydrogen atom in position 10 of this intermediate is oriented facing the surface, the hydrogenation of the double bond results in the formation of cis-decalin, because hydrogen addition to a double bond is always syn (both H atoms are added on the same side). By contrast, when the hydrogen atom in position 10 is oriented facing away from the surface, the syn hydrogenation addition results in the formation of trans-decalin. Accordingly, the trans/cis ratio would be determined by the preference of the intermediate to re-adsorb with the H in position 10 facing up or down, respectively. Alternatively, desorption of the 1,9-octalin may not be necessary for the formation of trans if it is considered that it may rollover on the surface and get hydrogenated on the opposite site
[4]
,
[29]
.
One complication in analyzing the cis/trans selectivity is the decalin isomerization reaction, which greatly favors the formation of trans and also occurs on metals
[4]
,
[30]
,
[31]
. To completely eliminate the isomerization contribution, comparison of the true trans/cis selectivity can only be made at conversions approaching zero. However, in most studies addressing the cis/trans selectivity from hydrogenation reactions, the differences in conversion level were not properly considered. As we show here, depending on the conversion level, the cistrans isomerization can greatly affect the observed selectivity. Here again, active site competition in which the more aromatic compounds prevail over the hydrogenated compound, is critical in determining the selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A list of the catalysts investigated is presented in
Table 1
. The metal weight loadings were adjusted in order to have the same total metal molar fraction in all catalysts. 1.6 wt.% Pt/Al2O3, 0.8 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 and 0.4 wt.% Pt-0.6 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine (3 wt.% F) were prepared by typical incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using two different solvents, ethylene glycol or deionized water. Hydrogen chloroplatinate hexahydrate (Acros) and palladium chloride (Sigma) were used as the metal precursors. Gamma-alumina (surface area=252 m2/g, pore diameter=10.8 nm) was provided by Saint-Gobian NorPro Corp. The γ-alumina was first ground and sieved for 2035 mesh size particles.

Ethylene glycol preparation, %C residual before reaction is 1.8%.
For the impregnation procedure, a Pt and Pd stock solutions were prepared. For the catalyst containing Pd, the appropriate amount of palladium chloride was first dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid while heating and stirring on a magnetic plate. Weighted Pt and/or Pd solutions were gradually added to ethylene glycol or deionized water until it reached a total volume to support mass ratio of 1.3 ml/g. After impregnation and thorough mixing, the sample that had ethylene glycol as a solvent was directly calcined at 300 C for 2 h while the catalysts prepared by aqueous solution were dried at room temperature for 4 h before drying in an oven at 110 C overnight and calcination at 300 C for 2 h. The addition of ammonium fluoride was conducted in the same manner as the metals, using deionized water as a solvent. The order of fluorine and metal addition was varied in some catalysts. In some of them, F was added before the metals, over the bare alumina (indicated as Pt/F-Al2O3 or Pd/F-Al2O3), in others, F was added over the previously prepared catalyst (indicated as F-Pt/Al2O3 or F-Pd/Al2O3). The BET analysis of the nitrogen adsorption measurements indicated that the surface areas for Al2O3 and F-Al2O3 are 198 and 179 m2/g, respectively. Depending on the preparation, i.e. composition and order of impregnation, the calcined catalysts gave different colors. In particular, all Pt catalysts had a yellowish color, similar to the color of Pt impregnating solution. Likewise, Pd/Al2O3 and Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were orange and similar to the color of the precursor solutions. By contrast, the Pd/F-Al2O3 and Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3 became grey after calcinations. Moreover, they were not homogeneous, but exhibited different degrees of darkness, even within the same pellet. In addition, the F-Pd/Al2O3 and F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, in which F was added last were darker in color than the ones prepared by adding F before the metals.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. CO chemisorption
The CO uptake measurements were performed in a 1/4 in. quartz reactor containing 0.100 g catalyst after reduction in a 50 ml/min flow of H2 at 300 C for 1 h. Before adding CO, the samples were purged in He at 300 C for 30 min and then cooled down in He to room temperature. The effluent stream was monitored online by a mass spectrometer. Injections of 250 μl of 4.1% CO in He were pulsed continuously to the catalyst bed every 5 min until identical m/e=28 peaks were observed. The exact amount of adsorbed CO was calculated by calibration with 250 μl of 4.1% CO in He.
2.2.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The atomic surface composition of the calcined catalysts was analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Physical Electronics PHI 5800 ESCA System with monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV)). The binding energies were corrected by reference to the C (1s) line at 284.5 eV. The fitting of the XPS spectra was carried out with GaussLorentz peaks, using the MultiPak software from Physical Electronics, which uses the following sensitivity factors O 1s (0.733), F 1s (1.000), Al 2p (0.256), Cl 2p (0.954), and Pd 3d (5.637).
2.2.3. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of isopropylamine
The acidity of Al2O3 and F-Al2O3 supports was tested by the amine TPD technique developed by Gorte and co-workers
[32]
. The test was conducted in the same system as the CO chemisorption. First, 50 mg of sample was pretreated at 500 C in a flow of He for 1 h. After the pretreatment, the sample was cooled in He to room temperature and then 2.0 ml of isopropylamine was injected over the sample. After removing the excess of isopropylamine by flowing He overnight, the sample was linearly heated to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. Masses 44, 41, and 17 were monitored to determine the evolution of isopropylamine, propylene, and ammonia, respectively. The amount of desorbed propylene was calibrated with 250 μl pulses of 1.2% propylene in He.
2.2.4. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)
TPO was employed to determine the amount and characteristics of the coke deposits left over the spent catalysts after 4 h on stream. Prior to each experiment, 20 mg of dry spent catalyst was pretreated in He flow at 340 C for 1 h to remove condensed compounds. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature in He, a continuous flow of 5% O2/He was passed over the sample, while the temperature was linearly increased at a heating rate of 12 C/min. The CO2 produced by the oxidation of coke species was monitored by a mass spectrometer (m/e=44). The exact amount of oxidized coke was calibrated with 250 μl pulses of pure CO2.
2.2.5. Extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS)
The spectra at Pt LIII-edge (11564 eV) for fresh and spent Pt-, Pt-Pd-, and Pt-Pd-F-catalysts were measured at line X-18B, the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS; 2.5 GeV and 80220 mA) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY. A Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator was used and the radiation was detuned at high energy end to minimize harmonic contamination. Energies were calibrated using an internal corresponding metal foil standard. The measurements were conducted in a stainless steel sample cell that allowed in situ pretreatments at temperature ranging from liquid nitrogen to 500 C. Prior to each measurement, the fresh catalysts were re-reduced in situ at 400 C (heating rate of 10 C/min) for 30 min in flowing hydrogen. After the reduction step, the sample was cooled down in flowing hydrogen. The EXAFS spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures under hydrogen flow. Three scans were recorded for each sample and the average spectrum was used for the analysis. For spent catalysts, 0.6 g of each catalyst was exposed to the model feed containing 1000 ppm sulfur at 500 psig and 300 C for 5 h. Then, the sample was re-reduced ex situ at 300 C for 1 h, transferred to a glove bag filled with flowing He, where they were placed in the EXAFS sample holder and sealed with Kapton tape. The samples were kept under He until the EXAFS analysis. No indication of oxidation during the handling was observed by XANES.
For the data analysis, the pre-edge background was subtracted by using power series curves; the post-edge background was then removed using a cubic spline routine; the spectra were normalized by dividing by the height of the adsorption edge; to avoid overemphasizing the low-energy region, the χ data were k3-weighted. The k-space range used for the analysis was 216 Å1.
To determine structural parameters, i.e. nearest neighbor distances and coordination numbers, curve fitting of the k-space EXAFS function and R-space Fourier transform spectra was done with EXAFSPAK suite (available from
http://ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html
).
2.3. Catalytic activity testing
The catalytic activity testing was conducted in a 3/4 in. stainless steel reactor equipped with a thermowell to insert the thermocouple inserted in the center of the bed. The catalytic activity was measured in the temperature of 300 C and pressure of 500 psig, at a LSV of 2100 h1, and H2/aromatics molar ratio of 11. Prior to each run, a 0.04 g catalyst sample was physically mixed with 5 ml of inert alumina and placed in the center of the reactor, between layers of 3 mm glass beads. The catalyst was first reduced under flowing H2 at 500 psig and 300 C for 1.5 h. After the pretreatment, 10 ml/min of liquid feed was introduced to the reactor using a high-pressure D-500 Isco Pump. Several different feeds were used in this work. A diesel surrogate model feed was prepared by blending 25 wt.% of tetralin (TL; Acros, +98%), 10 wt.% of naphthalene (NP; Aldrich, +99%), and 5 wt.% of phenanthrene (PHE; Aldrich, 98%), in 60 wt.% of dodecane (DO; Aldrich, 99%). Individual aromatic feeds were also prepared using dodecane as a diluent. In the case of sulfur-containing feed, calculated amounts of dibenzothiophene (DBT; Aldrich, 99%) were added to the feed mixture. The products were trapped by cooling water and analyzed online by a HP6890 gas chromatograph with FID detector using HP-5 column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of fresh catalysts and supports
3.1.1. TPD of isopropylamine
The evolution profiles of the m/e=41 signal obtained from the TPD of adsorbed isopropylamine on alumina and fluorinated-alumina are shown in
Fig. 1a and b
, respectively. As Gorte and co-workers have pointed out
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
, isopropylamine decomposes on Brnsted sites by the Hoffman elimination reaction producing propylene and ammonia. Therefore, quantifying the evolution of propylene as a function of temperature, allows for a reliable determination of the density of strong Brnsted sites. Although the m/e=41 signal arises from either desorbing unreacted isopropylamine or propylene, the fraction related to isopropylamine can be easily identified because it is paralleled by the m/e=44 signal
[35]
. By this comparison and in agreement with previous studies
[34]
, the peak appearing in the temperature range of 395403 C represents the strong Brnsted acid sites. Accordingly, as shown in
Fig. 1a and b
, the density of weaker sites, represented by the desorption peaks at lower temperatures, was about the same in both supports. However, the density of strong Brnsted acid sites was much higher on the fluorinated alumina than on the standard alumina, as previously reported

3.1.2. Chemisorption of CO
Both CO chemisorption and EXAFS data indicate that in this series of catalysts, the addition of F to the alumina support is detrimental to the metal dispersion. This does not seem to be the typical trend. A previous FTIR study
[37]
has reported improved Pt dispersions on fluorinated alumina compared to those that on unfluorinated supports. Similarly, Ali et al.
[38]
have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions. To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts.
The CO uptakes of all the catalysts investigated are shown in
Table 1
. Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size. For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size
[39]
. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions
[40]
. Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. For example, it is clear that the addition of F causes a decrease in exposed metal fraction for all the catalysts (Pt, Pd, and Pt-Pd). This decrease was observed for both series, those catalysts in which F was added before and those in which it was added after the incorporation of the metals. These losses in metal dispersion can be related to the increased color inhomogeneities observed after calcinations of the fluorinated catalysts. As noted in previous reports
[23]
,
[37]
, fluorinated aluminas are more hydrophobic and tend to lose surface area more easily than the parent alumina supports. These changes seem to adversely affect the dispersion of metals during the calcinations conducted in this work. The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown).
The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol.
3.1.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The atomic surface compositions of calcined Pd and Pt-Pd catalysts are illustrated in
Table 2
. It can be seen that the oxygen concentration decreased with addition of F. This is because the incorporation of F replaces O or OH of oxide catalysts
[23]
. In agreement with the lower dispersions obtained by chemisorption of CO, the F-catalysts showed lower Pd/Al ratio on the surface. Noticeably, the concentration of residual Cl on the surface, from the metal precursors, was reduced when F was added.

3.1.4. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
Fresh Pt/Al2O3, Pt-Pd/Al2O3, and Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3 catalysts, reduced in situ at 300 C were analyzed by EXAFS under hydrogen flow at liquid nitrogen temperature. The structural parameters obtained by curve fitting using FEFF-FIT program are listed in
Table 3
. These fitting parameters evidence the formation of PtPd bonds on the two bimetallic catalysts. The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.

3.2. Catalytic activity measurements
3.2.1. Hydrogenation of TL
A sulfur-free feed containing 30 wt.% TL in DO was used to compare the activity of all the different catalysts in the series. The conversions of TL at 4 h on stream are illustrated in
Table 1
. Overall, the observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion. That is, the unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed very high activity while the F-promoted catalysts exhibited much lower activity. The only difference to this behavior was exhibited by the unpromoted Pd catalyst, which despite a higher dispersion, had a lower activity than the promoted Pd/F-Al2O3 catalyst.
A more interesting trend was observed for the trans/cis ratio in the decalin product as a function of conversion on the three catalysts. As shown in
Fig. 2
, the trans/cis ratio depended on the catalyst and was practically constant up to about 70% TL conversion. Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from this result. In the first place, it is seen that the intrinsic selectivity of Pd towards trans is clearly higher than that of Pt, in good agreement with previous observations
[29]
,
[31]
. However, the importance of the present analysis is that the comparison can be made in the absence of the decalin isomerization. That is, the fact that the trans/cis ratio remains constant indicates that the cistrans isomerization does not take place when TL is present in significant concentration. In fact, it is seen that only after the TL conversion is very high the cistrans conversion is clearly observed. Clearly, as in several of the observations made throughout this paper, active site competition is an important phenomenon in PNA reactions that governs selectivity and relative activities. A similar analysis was made by Huang and Kang
[41]
, who have previously proposed that the cis/trans isomerization is greatly inhibited by the presence of NP or TL.

Another interesting result is that the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst has a trans/cis selectivity almost identical to that of pure Pd, which would be an indirect confirmation of previous reports that propose a Pd enrichment on the surface of the alloyed PtPd particles

3.2.2. Hydrogenation of TL, NP, and PHE in model feed
A sulfur-free diesel model feed containing 25 wt.% TL, 10 wt.% NP, and 5 wt.% PHE in dodecane was used to monitor the simultaneous conversion of 1-, 2-, and 3-ring aromatics at varying space velocities and catalyst activities. In this study, the product distribution was compared at different overall conversions by using two F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3catalysts of varying metal dispersions and by varying the space velocity.
The product compositions after 4 h on stream for the two different runs are summarized in
Table 4
, together with the feed composition. The hydrogenated products contain the hydrophenanthrenes with different degrees of hydrogenation (di-, tetra-, octa-, and tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene). We have grouped those compounds in terms of the number of aromatic rings left in the product, i.e., 2-ring (di-hydro), 1-ring (tetra- and octa-hydro) and 0-ring (tetra-deca-hydro). Since TL is a product of the hydrogenation of NP, the amount of TL in the products was higher than that in the feed.

At the same space velocity (100 h1), the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution, with a higher metal dispersion, exhibited higher hydrogenation activity than the one prepared by ethylene glycol. On the less active catalyst, at a PHE conversion of 60, there is very low concentration of the totally hydrogenated tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene, as well as of the totally hydrogenated decalin. By contrast, on the more active catalyst, the concentration of the more deeply hydrogenated compounds (1-ring) increased. When the space velocity was greatly reduced and the PHE conversion was almost 100%, the quantity of totally hydrogenated compounds (0-ring and decalin) greatly increased. As it will be made more evident in
Section 3.2.4
below, the hydrogenation of these polyaromatics compounds is sequential.
3.2.3. Inhibition of hydrogenation activity by sulfur compounds
The effect of sulfur on the catalytic activity of the Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was tested using the diesel model feed, either free of sulfur or containing 1000 ppm S, at high space velocity (LHSV 100 h1). The conversions of NP and PHE in two different runs are compared in
Fig. 3
as a function of time on stream. Since the drops in activity as a function of TOS can be due to different factors, to make the effect of sulfur more apparent a sulfur free feed was used during the first 10 h of reaction. At that time, the feed was switched to the S-containing model diesel. This switch was done by using two independent pumps and a three-way valve, so the flow was not disturbed and the only change in composition was the incorporation of 1000 ppm S. A drastic drop in conversion was observed. After the subsequent 19 h under sulfur, the feed was switched back to the sulfur-free model diesel. At that point, there was an important regain in conversion. For comparison, another run was conducted without sulfur for the whole period. It is worth noting that as shown in
Fig. 3
, the two runs exactly coincide after the sulfur exposure period. Therefore, it appears that the inhibition by sulfur under these conditions is a reversible blocking of sites.

A similar set of experiments was conducted over the rest of the catalyst compositions. The results are summarized in
Fig. 4a and b
, for the conversions of PHE and NP, respectively. Overall, similar reversibility was observed for the three catalysts after removal of DBT. However, interesting differences must be pointed out. It is clear that the F-containing catalyst kept a higher conversion in the presence of DBT, while the monometallic Pt catalyst was most affected. On the other hand, the monometallic Pt catalyst resulted with the highest activity after removal of DBT from the feed. The corresponding product distributions after 9 h on stream without S and after a subsequent 2 h with 1000 ppm S are shown in
Table 5
. It is worth noting that the product distributions with or without S in the feed are essentially the same, and the minor changes are simply due to changes in the conversion level.

It is important to note that under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <20%. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low. One may expect that at higher DBT conversions, the H2S generated may irreversibly poison the catalyst by forming surface sulfides. To test this possibility, we have conducted a direct comparison of the effect of DBT conversion on the reversibility of inhibition by sulfur using the hydrogenation of tetralin as a test reaction. In this series of experiments, 0.04 g of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst were tested at 300 C and a space velocity of 100 h1 before and after exposure to 1000 ppm of S in a feed of DBT in dodecane for 2 h. This exposure was conducted at two different temperatures, 230 and 300 C, in order to vary the conversion of DBT. As depicted in
Fig. 5a
, in the first experiment, when the DBT conversion was of only 20%, the inhibition by sulfur was practically reversible, and the tetralin conversion only slightly dropped. By contrast, as shown in
Fig. 5b
, a severe permanent deactivation was observed when the DBT conversion during the sulfur exposure period was 70%.

Conversion of tetralin on Pt/Al2O3 at 500 psig, 300 C, LSV=100 h1, H2:hydrocarbon molar ratio=11 before and after exposure to 1000 ppm S-containing feed at different temperatures: (a) 230 C and (b) 300 C. Reaction conditions: feeds from 0 to 2 h, 30% TL in DO; from 2 to 4 h, 1000 ppm S of DBT in DO; from 4 to 7 h, 30% TL in DO.
These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H2S formed from its hydrogenation. Reports in the literature claiming reversible sulfur inhibition without indicating the level of sulfur-compound conversion cannot be conclusive since this reversibility may greatly change at lower space velocities

3.2.4. Competitive hydrogenation of aromatics in model feed
It can be seen in
Fig. 3
,
Fig. 4
that the conversion of PHE was always higher than that of NP. This result is in line with several other reports, in which the rate of hydrogenation of polynuclear aromatics has been found to increase with the number of rings
[29]
,
[42]
,
[43]
. It has been argued that this trend may be related to lower resonance energy per ring as the number of rings in the compounds increases
[44]
. However, in the simultaneous hydrogenation of different polynuclear aromatics there is another much more important effect. The great inhibition observed in the conversion of the compounds with lower number of rings is mainly due to a competition with the heavier compounds containing more rings.
As illustrated in
Table 6
, there were no significant differences in the conversion of PHE and NP when they were hydrogenated as individual feeds on the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Even the conversion of TL under the same conditions was within the same order of magnitude. However, when they were hydrogenated simultaneously the differences were substantial. The conversion of PHE only dropped by about 25% when compared to the individual conversion. But that of NP dropped by a factor of 2.5 and TL by more than a factor of 50. The differences in concentration could not account for this huge disparity in conversion, even for the case of zeroth order. The obvious explanation is competitive adsorption of the different polyaromatics. Accordingly, the presence of PHE greatly affects the adsorption of NP, and particularly that of TL. Based on this differences one may expect that TL can only start being hydrogenated when essentially all the PHE has been removed from the feed. In line with this conclusion, the inhibition of TL hydrogenation in the presence of NP has recently been reported for the case of gas phase hydrogenation over on Pt/TiO2
[28]
and liquid phase hydrogenation over Ni/Al2O3
[45]
. In both cases, the strong inhibition of hydrogenation of lighter aromatics by the presence of heavier aromatics was ascribed to inhibited adsorption due to site competition.

Fig. 6
illustrates this concept unquestionably. Taking data from
Table 3
,
Table 4
and from
Fig. 4
, we have plotted the conversions of NP and TL as a function of PHE conversion. It is remarkable that disparate data like these, taken from different catalysts, with or without S, the conversions of NP and TL are closely related to the conversion of PHE and all lie on the same curve. In all cases, becomes significant only after the elimination of 3040% of PHE, while conversion of TL can only start after the PHE conversion is almost complete.

Fig. 6. Conversions of NP and TL as a function PHE conversion.
Interestingly, if one observes the activity drop in
Fig. 4
for PHE and NP as a function of time, one may be inclined to conclude that the deactivation for NP production is more pronounced than that for PHE production. However, seeing that all the data points lie on the same line in
Fig. 6
clearly indicates that the pronounced decrease in NP production is not only due to deactivation, but due to an increasing site inhibition by PHE whose concentration in the gas phase increases as the conversion drops.
Another trend that becomes clearly apparent when plotted as a function of conversion is the concentration of the various hydrophenanthrenes. In
Fig. 7
, we have compiled data from different runs (
Table 3
,
Table 4
) and it is again suggestive that all the data follow a common pattern. At PHE conversions lower than about 30%, the only hydrogenation products were the 2-ring aromatics di-hydro-phenanthrene and tetra-hydro-phenanthrene. As the PHE conversion increased, the 1-ring aromatics (octa-hydro-phenanthrenes) started appearing, while the concentration of 2-rings stopped increasing and then started to decrease. The saturated 0-ring aromatics (tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrenes) were only observed at PHE conversion higher than about 80%, while both the 2-ring and 1-ring drastically decreased. The observed trend indicates that the hydrogenation of PHE is sequential and involves desorption and readsorption of the partially hydrogenated products. The derivatives of the curves at zero conversion indicate that the only primary products from the PHE hydrogenation are the 2-ring compounds. That is, PHE is first hydrogenated to the 2-ring aromatics, these in turn are readsorbed and hydrogenated to the 1-ring aromatics, which also readsorb and react to 0-ring aromatics.

3.3. Characterization of spent catalysts
3.3.1. TPO of coke deposits
The TPO profiles of monometallic Pt and bimetallic Pt/Pd catalysts after being exposed to different feeds for 4 h are shown in
Fig. 8
. First, for the sulfur-free feeds (
Fig. 8a
), it can be seen that a feed of 30 wt.% TL causes much lower coke formation than that obtained on the same catalyst (Pt-Pd/Al2O3) with the model feed. This difference indicates that the 2- and 3- ring aromatics produce more coke than TL. However, it is interesting to note that most of this excess coke can be removed at significantly lower temperatures than that produced by TL. Second, the presence of sulfur has a profound effect on coke formation. It can be observed in
Fig. 8b
that coke formation is greatly accelerated by sulfur. It is found that in the presence of S, the amount of coke formation on the fluorinated catalysts was lower than on the unpromoted catalysts. A contrasting behavior was obtained in the absence of sulfur. As shown in
Table 1
, the reaction of TL on F-promoted catalysts resulted in more coke formation than on the unpromoted catalyst. This enhanced coke formation is not unusual when the acidity increases, what appears unique is the decreased coking on F-promoted catalysts in the presence of S.

for short reaction times; also, in this case, the amounts of coke produced on catalysts with and without F were not different.

3.3.2. X-ray absorption (EXAFS)
The same Pt/Al2O3, Pt-Pd/Al2O3, and Pt/F-Al2O3 catalysts described above, were analyzed by EXAFS after 5 h reaction at 300 C, 500 psig using a model feed containing 1000 ppm S. The Fourier transforms for the different fresh and spent catalysts are shown in
Fig. 10
while the structural parameters obtained by curve fitting using the FEFF-FIT program
[46]
are listed in
Table 3
. It is interesting to note that although the FT of the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst show very little change after reaction under sulfur, the other two were greatly affected. The fitting of the data clearly demonstrates that on the spent monometallic Pt/Al2O3 and unfluorinated Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts PtS bonds are formed, while no significant contribution of PtS bonds is apparent for the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst.

For the most part, the total coordination numbers were conserved, which indicates that the formation of PtS bonds arises at the expense of the PtPt and PtPd bonds. Interestingly, on the unfluorided Pt-Pd/Al2O3 the PtPd interaction was broken during reaction since the PtPd bonds disappeared, while the PtPt interaction only exhibited a slight decrease. By contrast, no PtS bonds were observed on the fluorinated bimetallic Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3 catalyst and the PtPd interaction remained almost unchanged. In a similar EXAFS study, Guillon et al.
[13]
have observed that when treating the sample at 100 C in dimethyl disulfide, PtS bonds were formed on the monometallic Pt catalyst, but they were not formed on the bimetallic Pd-Pt catalyst. It may be that these conditions are not as severe as those used by us, so the PtPd alloy was not disrupted in their case. These differences would indicate that the enhancement in sulfur tolerance gained by the addition of Pd can be easily lost under the rather severe conditions of the hydrogenation of polynuclear aromatics. In fact, Rousset et al.
[21]
have shown that, when the role of the support is eliminated, the addition of Pd does not alter the deactivation caused by H2S at 300 C. In a separate study, the same authors have compared the activity of Pt and Pd for the hydrogenation of tetralin in the presence of variable amounts of H2S
[47]
. They found that Pt was more active than Pd at low sulfur concentrations, but Pd became more active at high S concentrations. Contrary to what is claimed in the literature, no synergism was observed on alloys of the two metals. Therefore, if Pd is more resistant to sulfur at high concentrations and it is enriched on the surface of the alloy, the bimetallic particle may keep the sulfur-tolerance of Pd.
A more complex situation may develop when support acidity is incorporated. Yasuda et al.
[6]
has observed that the highest sulfur-tolerance was achieved when Pd-Pt was supported on the highest acidity USY zeolite. Other authors have also seen varying degrees of sulfur toxicity when the support acidity was modified
[9]
,
[48]
,
[49]
. In line with those observations, our EXAFS data demonstrate that the addition of F to the alumina support helped keep the PtPd alloy and prevented the formation of PtS bonds.
4. Conclusions
The main conclusions of this study are the following:
(a)
Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used. For example, the conversion of tetralin to decalin can only occur when most of the higher aromatics (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been removed. Similarly, the conversion of cis- to trans-decalin is also affected by site competition with tetralin. Likewise, the sequential hydrogenation of the hydrophenanthrenes also shows the effects of site competition, with preferential reaction of the higher aromatic compounds.
(b)
In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst. The inhibition by sulfur strongly depended on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At low conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible, but at high conversions, the poisoning was irreversible.
(c)
EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions. By contrast, when F was present on the catalyst, the PdPt alloy was not disrupted and PtS bonds were not formed.
