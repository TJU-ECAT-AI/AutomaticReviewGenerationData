[1] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size."

[2] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[3] "Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

[4] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different advantages and limitations:

CO chemisorption:
- More reliable for determining metal dispersion, especially for bimetallic catalysts
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals and with particle size
- For Pt, CO/Pt ratio is typically 1:1 across a wide range of dispersions
- For Pd, CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size
- Avoids complications of hydrogen spillover

H2 chemisorption:
- Can overestimate metal dispersion due to hydrogen spillover effects
- May not reflect true metal dispersion, especially on supports that enhance spillover
- Uptake can be increased on fluorine-containing catalysts

Key considerations:
- CO chemisorption is generally preferred for bimetallic catalysts to avoid spillover effects
- Stoichiometry must be carefully considered when interpreting results, especially for Pd
- Results should be used semi-quantitatively to compare catalysts within a metal system
- Neither method can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallic catalysts due to varying stoichiometry
- Data should be normalized when comparing reaction rates between different catalysts

Overall, CO chemisorption tends to be more reliable for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, but both techniques have limitations that must be considered when interpreting data and normalizing reaction rates.

CO和H2化学吸附都用于表征双金属催化剂,但它们各有优缺点:

CO化学吸附:
- 更可靠地确定金属分散度,尤其适用于双金属催化剂
- CO/金属化学计量比因金属和粒径而异
- 对于Pt,CO/Pt比在广泛的分散度范围内通常为1:1
- 对于Pd,CO/Pd比根据粒径在0.5-0.8之间变化
- 避免了氢溢流的复杂性

H2化学吸附:
- 由于氢溢流效应可能高估金属分散度
- 可能无法反映真实的金属分散度,尤其是在增强溢流的载体上
- 在含氟催化剂上吸附量可能增加

主要考虑因素:
- 对于双金属催化剂,通常首选CO化学吸附以避免溢流效应
- 解释结果时必须仔细考虑化学计量比,尤其是对于Pd
- 结果应半定量地用于比较同一金属体系内的催化剂
- 由于化学计量比不同,两种方法都无法直接量化双金属催化剂的分散度
- 比较不同催化剂的反应速率时,应对数据进行标准化处理

总的来说,CO化学吸附在表征双金属催化剂方面往往更可靠,但在解释数据和标准化反应速率时,两种技术都有必须考虑的局限性。
