[1] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."

[2] "Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."

[3] "For instance, on palladium catalysts, the CO/Pd(surf) ratio has been found to vary from 0.5 to 0.8 depending on particle size. However, on platinum catalysts, the CO/Pt(surf) has been found to be unity for a wide range of dispersions."

[4] "Therefore, these CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system."

[5] "Similarly, Ali et al. have observed increased hydrogen uptakes on F-containing catalysts as compared to those without F. However, they have also proposed that enhancement of hydrogen spillover over the support may occur due to the presence of fluorine. Then, hydrogen uptakes measurements may not necessarily reflect true metal dispersions."

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques have different strengths and limitations for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

CO chemisorption:
- Avoids complications from hydrogen spillover 
- Provides a semi-quantitative measure of exposed metal fraction
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals (e.g. Pt vs Pd) and with particle size
- Cannot directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics due to varying stoichiometry

H2 chemisorption:
- Can be affected by hydrogen spillover, especially on certain supports
- May overestimate metal dispersion due to spillover effects
- Uptake values may not reflect true metal dispersion

Key considerations:
- CO is preferred to avoid spillover effects
- Stoichiometry differences between metals must be accounted for
- Results are semi-quantitative for comparing within one metal system
- Neither technique can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallics
- Particle size effects on stoichiometry should be considered
- Support effects (e.g. fluorine promotion) can enhance spillover for H2

Overall, CO chemisorption appears to be preferred for bimetallics, but results must be carefully interpreted. Combining multiple characterization techniques is likely necessary for a complete understanding of bimetallic catalysts.

CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面有不同的优缺点:

CO化学吸附:
- 避免了氢溢出带来的复杂性
- 提供了暴露金属分数的半定量测量
- CO/金属化学计量比在不同金属间(如Pt vs Pd)和不同粒径下有所不同
- 由于化学计量比的变化,无法直接量化双金属的分散度

H2化学吸附:
- 可能受到氢溢出的影响,尤其是在某些载体上
- 由于溢出效应可能高估金属分散度
- 吸附值可能无法反映真实的金属分散度

关键考虑因素:
- 首选CO以避免溢出效应
- 必须考虑金属间化学计量比的差异
- 结果对于同一金属体系内的比较是半定量的
- 两种技术都无法直接量化双金属的分散度
- 应考虑粒径对化学计量比的影响
- 载体效应(如氟促进)可增强H2的溢出

总的来说,CO化学吸附似乎更适合双金属催化剂,但结果必须谨慎解释。可能需要结合多种表征技术才能全面了解双金属催化剂。

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts due to fewer complications. The main advantage of CO chemisorption is that it avoids issues with hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption, especially on supports containing fluorine. This allows for a more accurate estimate of the exposed metal fraction.

However, CO chemisorption also has limitations. The CO/metal stoichiometry can vary between different metals (e.g. Pt vs Pd) and even for the same metal depending on particle size. For Pd catalysts, the CO/Pd ratio can range from 0.5-0.8, while for Pt it is typically 1 across a wide range of dispersions. This variation makes direct quantification of dispersion challenging from CO uptake values alone, especially for bimetallic catalysts.

When using either technique to determine active metal sites and dispersion, care must be taken in data interpretation. For H2 chemisorption, enhanced spillover effects need to be considered, particularly on fluorine-containing supports. For CO chemisorption, the varying stoichiometries between metals must be accounted for. Proper normalization of reaction rates requires accurate knowledge of the number of exposed metal atoms, which can be difficult to determine precisely with either method for bimetallic systems.

Overall, while CO chemisorption avoids some issues with H2 spillover, neither technique is perfect for bimetallic catalysts. A combination of characterization methods is likely needed for the most accurate analysis of these complex systems.

CO化学吸附通常比H2化学吸附更适合表征双金属催化剂,因为它涉及的复杂性更少。CO化学吸附的主要优势是避免了H2化学吸附中可能出现的氢溢出问题,特别是在含氟支撑剂上。这使得对暴露金属比例的估计更加准确。

然而,CO化学吸附也存在局限性。CO/金属化学计量比在不同金属之间(如Pt与Pd)甚至同一金属的不同粒径下都可能有所不同。对于Pd催化剂,CO/Pd比可以在0.5-0.8之间变化,而对于Pt,这个比值在很宽的分散度范围内通常保持在1。这种变化使得仅从CO吸附量值直接量化分散度变得具有挑战性,尤其是对于双金属催化剂。

在使用这两种技术确定活性金属位点和分散度时,需要谨慎解释数据。对于H2化学吸附,需要考虑增强的溢出效应,特别是在含氟支撑剂上。对于CO化学吸附,必须考虑金属间不同的化学计量比。准确归一化反应速率需要精确了解暴露金属原子的数量,而对于双金属体系,用任一方法都难以精确确定。

总的来说,虽然CO化学吸附避免了一些H2溢出问题,但对双金属催化剂而言,两种技术都不完美。对这些复杂体系进行最准确的分析可能需要结合多种表征方法。

CO and H2 chemisorption are both used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, but they have different advantages and limitations:

CO chemisorption:
- More reliable for determining metal dispersion, especially for bimetallic catalysts
- CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals and with particle size
- For Pt, CO/Pt ratio is typically 1:1 across a wide range of dispersions
- For Pd, CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size
- Avoids complications of hydrogen spillover

H2 chemisorption:
- Can overestimate metal dispersion due to hydrogen spillover effects
- May not reflect true metal dispersion, especially on supports that enhance spillover
- Uptake can be increased on fluorine-containing catalysts

Key considerations:
- CO chemisorption is generally preferred for bimetallic catalysts to avoid spillover effects
- Stoichiometry must be carefully considered when interpreting results, especially for Pd
- Results should be used semi-quantitatively to compare catalysts within a metal system
- Neither method can directly quantify dispersion for bimetallic catalysts due to varying stoichiometry
- Data should be normalized when comparing reaction rates between different catalysts

Overall, CO chemisorption tends to be more reliable for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, but both techniques have limitations that must be considered when interpreting data and normalizing reaction rates.

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts due to several factors:

1. CO chemisorption avoids complications from hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption, especially on fluorine-promoted catalysts. This makes CO uptake a more reliable measure of exposed metal fraction.

2. However, CO chemisorption has limitations for directly quantifying dispersion, as the CO/metal stoichiometry varies between metals like Pt and Pd, and can also vary with particle size for a given metal. 

3. For Pd catalysts, the CO/Pd surface ratio ranges from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size. For Pt catalysts, the CO/Pt surface ratio is closer to 1 across a range of dispersions.

4. Due to these stoichiometry variations, CO uptake values are best used as a semi-quantitative comparison within a single metal system, rather than for absolute dispersion measurements.

5. H2 chemisorption can overestimate dispersion, especially on fluorine-containing catalysts, due to enhanced hydrogen spillover. This makes H2 uptake less reflective of true metal dispersion.

6. When normalizing reaction rates, care must be taken in interpreting chemisorption data, as neither technique provides a perfect measure of active sites for bimetallic catalysts. Complementary characterization techniques are often needed for a full picture.

1. CO化学吸附避免了H2化学吸附可能出现的氢溢流问题,特别是在含氟催化剂上。这使得CO吸附量成为测量暴露金属比例的更可靠方法。

2. 然而,CO化学吸附在直接量化分散度方面也有局限性,因为CO/金属计量比在Pt和Pd等不同金属间存在差异,甚至对于同一金属,随粒径变化也会有所不同。

3. 对于Pd催化剂,CO/Pd表面比例随粒径变化在0.5-0.8之间。对于Pt催化剂,CO/Pt表面比例在不同分散度下更接近1。

4. 由于这些计量比变化,CO吸附值最好用作单一金属体系内的半定量比较,而非用于绝对分散度测量。

5. H2化学吸附可能会高估分散度,特别是在含氟催化剂上,这是由于氢溢流增强所致。这使得H2吸附量不能很好地反映真实的金属分散度。

6. 在标准化反应速率时,需谨慎解释化学吸附数据,因为这两种技术都不能完美测量双金属催化剂的活性位点。通常需要互补的表征技术来获得全面的认识。

CO chemisorption is generally preferred over H2 chemisorption for characterizing bimetallic catalysts:

1. Methodology: CO chemisorption avoids complications like hydrogen spillover that can occur with H2 chemisorption. 

2. Active metal sites: CO uptake increases with exposed metal fraction, but direct quantification of dispersion is challenging due to varying CO/metal stoichiometry.

3. Metal dispersion: CO/Pt stoichiometry is unity for a wide range of dispersions, while CO/Pd ratio varies from 0.5-0.8 depending on particle size.

4. Limitations: For bimetallics, varying CO/metal stoichiometry makes direct dispersion quantification difficult. H2 chemisorption can overestimate dispersion due to spillover effects, especially on F-containing catalysts.

5. Data interpretation: Care must be taken in interpreting results due to varying stoichiometries. Results are most useful for comparing catalysts within the same metal system.

6. Rate normalization: CO uptake values can be used as a semi-quantitative measure for normalizing reaction rates, but exact dispersion calculations are challenging for bimetallics.

Key considerations include accounting for varying CO/metal stoichiometries and avoiding overestimation of dispersion from H2 spillover effects.

1. 方法学:CO化学吸附避免了H2化学吸附可能出现的氢溢流等复杂情况。

2. 活性金属位点:CO吸附量随暴露的金属比例增加而增加,但由于CO/金属计量比不同,难以直接定量分散度。

5. 数据解释:由于计量比不同,解释结果时需谨慎。结果最适用于比较同一金属体系内的催化剂。

6. 速率归一化:CO吸附值可用作归一化反应速率的半定量措施,但对双金属催化剂很难进行精确的分散度计算。

关键考虑因素包括考虑不同的CO/金属计量比,并避免H2溢流效应导致的分散度高估。
