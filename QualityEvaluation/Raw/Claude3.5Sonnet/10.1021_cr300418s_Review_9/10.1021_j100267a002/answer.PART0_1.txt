The given literature does not contain any information about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily discusses the formation of gas-phase radicals over various oxide catalysts like bismuth oxide, lead oxide, magnesium oxide, and lithium-doped magnesium oxide during reactions with hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene. It does not address the specific catalytic systems mentioned in the question (ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene), nor does it discuss theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献中没有包含关于基于氧化镍的催化剂、它们的制备方法、掺杂浓度、空位形成,或它们对氧化脱氢反应中电子结构和催化性能的影响的任何信息。该文本主要讨论了各种氧化物催化剂(如氧化铋、氧化铅、氧化镁和锂掺杂氧化镁)在与烃类(如甲烷、乙烷、乙烯和丙烯)反应过程中气相自由基的形成。它没有涉及问题中提到的特定催化系统(乙苯制苯乙烯和乙烷制乙烯),也没有讨论这些系统中的理论建模、过程优化或平衡效率、选择性和安全性。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
