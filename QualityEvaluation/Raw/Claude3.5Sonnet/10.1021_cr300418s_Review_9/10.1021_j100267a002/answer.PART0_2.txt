<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily discusses the formation of gas-phase radicals over various oxide catalysts such as Bi2O3, PbO, MgO, and Li/MgO during reactions with methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene. It does not mention nickel oxide catalysts or the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of ethylbenzene to styrene or ethane to ethylene. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.

提供的文献中不包含任何与氧化镍基催化剂用于氧化脱氢反应相关的信息来回答这个问题。文本主要讨论了在甲烷、乙烷、乙烯和丙烯反应过程中,各种氧化物催化剂(如Bi2O3、PbO、MgO和Li/MgO)上气相自由基的形成。它没有提到氧化镍催化剂或乙苯到苯乙烯、乙烷到乙烯的特定氧化脱氢反应。因此,我无法根据给定的信息回答这个问题。
