The given scientific literature does not contain any information about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily discusses the formation of gas-phase radicals over various oxide catalysts like Bi2O3, PbO, MgO, and Li/MgO during reactions with hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene. It does not address the specific topics mentioned in the question regarding nickel oxide catalysts or the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给出的科学文献中不包含任何关于氧化镍基催化剂、其制备方法、掺杂浓度、空位形成或它们对氧化脱氢反应中电子结构和催化性能的影响的信息。该文本主要讨论了在烃类（如甲烷、乙烷、乙烯和丙烯）反应过程中，各种氧化物催化剂（如Bi2O3、PbO、MgO和Li/MgO）上气相自由基的形成。它没有涉及问题中提到的有关氧化镍催化剂的具体主题，或者这些催化系统中理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
