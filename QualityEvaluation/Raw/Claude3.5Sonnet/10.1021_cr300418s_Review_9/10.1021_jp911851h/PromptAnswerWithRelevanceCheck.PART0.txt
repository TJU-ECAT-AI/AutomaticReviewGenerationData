<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically related to nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on iron-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) and its oxygen vacancy formation. It does not discuss nickel oxide catalysts, ethylbenzene to styrene conversion, or ethane to ethylene reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided scientific literature does not contain any information about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their influence on oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily focuses on iron-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) and its oxygen vacancy formation. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts based on the given information.

To properly address this question, additional research and literature specifically related to nickel oxide-based catalysts and their applications in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions would be necessary. This would include studying the effects of different preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide catalysts in reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene conversion.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems would also require specialized studies focused on nickel oxide catalysts and the specific reactions mentioned.

提供的科学文献中没有包含任何关于氧化镍基催化剂、它们的制备方法、掺杂浓度、空位形成或它们对氧化脱氢反应的影响的信息。该文本主要集中在掺铁的二氧化钛(TiO2)及其氧空位形成上。因此，我无法根据给定的信息直接回答关于氧化镍基催化剂的问题。

要正确回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，并查阅专门与氧化镍基催化剂及其在氧化脱氢反应中的应用相关的文献。这将包括研究不同制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对氧化镍催化剂在乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯转化等反应中的电子结构和催化性能的影响。

在这些催化系统中，理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战也需要专门针对氧化镍催化剂和所提到的特定反应进行专门的研究。
