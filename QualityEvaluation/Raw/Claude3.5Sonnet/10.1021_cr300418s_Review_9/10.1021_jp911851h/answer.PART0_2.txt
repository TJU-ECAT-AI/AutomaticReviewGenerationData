The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to nickel oxide-based catalysts, oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, or the specific challenges mentioned in the question. The document focuses on iron-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) and its oxygen vacancy formation, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
