[1] "Solutions of nickel nitrate (Johnson and Matthey Specpure) to which had been added solutions containing known quantities of lithium carbonate (dissolved in acetic acid) or ammonium chromate were evaporated to dryness. The mixtures were ground and decomposed to the oxides by slowly raising the temperature to 600C over a period of 5 h, followed by a further 5 h at 600C. The samples, contained in mullite boats, were then fired in air at 1000C for 3 h."

[2] "Once these vacancies are filled, Liz0 enters into solid solution with the simultaneous formation of anion vacancies. Although their existence is ephemeral when the solid is being fired in air, there will be a period during sintering at 1000C when, at least in internal pores, the balance between the rate of entry of lithium and the filling of the anion vacancies with oxygen will not be maintained."

[3] "The kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene to C02 and water have been studied between 400" and 515C over the same catalysts, but no analogous correlation with dopent type has been found in this case."

The preparation methods for nickel oxide-based catalysts involved mixing nickel nitrate with lithium carbonate or ammonium chromate solutions, drying, grinding, and heating to form oxides. The samples were then fired at 1000°C for 3 hours. 

Dopant concentrations influenced vacancy formation. For lithium doping, initial small quantities filled existing cation vacancies in NiO. Higher lithium concentrations led to anion vacancy formation during sintering, affecting the catalyst's structure.

The study did not directly examine oxidative dehydrogenation reactions like ethylbenzene to styrene or ethane to ethylene. However, it did investigate ethylene oxidation to CO2 and water between 400-515°C. Importantly, no correlation was found between dopant type and catalytic performance for this reaction, unlike CO and H2 oxidation.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems likely include:
1. Accurately modeling the complex interplay between dopants, vacancies, and electronic structure.
2. Optimizing preparation methods to control vacancy formation and distribution.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity, especially for more complex reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation.
4. Ensuring catalyst stability and safety at high operating temperatures.

The lack of correlation between dopants and ethylene oxidation performance suggests that optimizing catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation may be challenging and require consideration of factors beyond simple electronic effects.

制备氧化镍基催化剂的方法包括将硝酸镍与碳酸锂或铬酸铵溶液混合、干燥、研磨和加热形成氧化物。然后将样品在1000°C下焙烧3小时。

掺杂剂浓度影响空位的形成。对于锂掺杂，初始少量填充了NiO中现有的阳离子空位。更高的锂浓度在烧结过程中导致阴离子空位的形成，影响催化剂的结构。

该研究没有直接考察乙苯到苯乙烯或乙烷到乙烯等氧化脱氢反应。然而，它确实研究了400-515°C之间乙烯氧化成CO2和水的反应。重要的是，对于这种反应，没有发现掺杂剂类型与催化性能之间的相关性，这与CO和H2氧化不同。

这些催化系统的主要挑战可能包括：
1. 准确模拟掺杂剂、空位和电子结构之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 优化制备方法以控制空位的形成和分布。
3. 平衡效率和选择性，特别是对于更复杂的反应如氧化脱氢。
4. 确保催化剂在高操作温度下的稳定性和安全性。

掺杂剂与乙烯氧化性能之间缺乏相关性表明，优化氧化脱氢催化剂可能具有挑战性，需要考虑简单电子效应之外的因素。
