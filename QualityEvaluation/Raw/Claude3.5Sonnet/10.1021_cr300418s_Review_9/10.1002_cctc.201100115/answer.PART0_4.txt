The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The use of appropriate supports can modulate the catalytic performance of NiO nanoparticles. For effective ammoxidation catalysts, a combination of NiO, NiNbO mixed phases, and acid sites is required. The Nano-series catalysts, which have the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase, are effective for ethane and ammonia activation and their conversion to acetonitrile.

For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, such as ethane to ethylene, the Micro-series catalysts show good performance. These catalysts are prepared by dispersing NiO nanoparticles on Nb2O5 material, demonstrating that the NiNb interaction is efficient for ethane activation.

The synthesis method dramatically affects catalyst performance. This highlights the importance of preparation techniques in determining the final properties and effectiveness of the catalyst.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between different phases and support materials.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the formation of mixed phases, acid sites, and nanoparticle dispersion to achieve optimal performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Developing catalysts that can efficiently activate reactants while maintaining high selectivity for desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring the stability and safety of nanoparticle-based catalysts under reaction conditions.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory-scale synthesis methods to industrial-scale production while maintaining catalyst performance.
