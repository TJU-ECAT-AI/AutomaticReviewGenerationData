The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The use of appropriate supports can modulate the catalytic performance of NiO nanoparticles. For effective ammoxidation catalysts, a combination of NiO, NiNbO mixed phases, and acid sites is required. The Nano-series catalysts show better performance for ethane ammoxidation due to the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase. In contrast, the Micro-series catalysts perform well for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between different phases and supports.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the formation of mixed phases and acid sites to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high conversion rates while maintaining selectivity towards desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, especially when dealing with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

The study highlights the importance of synthesis methods in determining catalyst performance, suggesting that further research into novel preparation techniques could lead to improved catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
