[1] "NiO nanoparticles that are highly active for the ethane activation have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method."

[2] "The catalysts obtained are promising catalytic materials for both, ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions."

[3] "Niobium-promoted NiO catalysts are able to activate ethane in several reactions,3,4,1215 and recently we reported that ethane ammoxidation can be efficiently performed over this catalytic system16 with a 19% yield of acetonitrile, which is close to those reported for zeolite catalysts."

[4] "The phenomenon associated with the generation of defects by the catalytic reaction in the Nb2O5 powders at low temperatures could be related to the loss of oxygen that promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy defects (Vo)s in its structure."

[5] "For NiO,NiNbO mixed phases and acid sites are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The novel dry nanodispersion method is used to prepare highly active NiO nanoparticles dispersed on different Nb2O5 materials. This preparation technique results in catalysts that are promising for both ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Niobium promotion of NiO catalysts enhances their ability to activate ethane in various reactions. The concentration of niobium dopant is crucial, as moderate concentrations have been found to be most effective.

Vacancy formation, particularly oxygen vacancy defects, occurs during the catalytic reaction at low temperatures in Nb2O5 powders. These defects influence the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts.

The formation of NiNbO mixed phases, along with the presence of acid sites, is essential for obtaining selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation reactions.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between NiO, Nb2O5, and the formation of mixed phases.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the formation of NiNbO mixed phases with the preservation of acid sites to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high activity while improving selectivity towards desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, particularly when dealing with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

5. Scalability: Translating the promising results from laboratory-scale experiments to industrial-scale processes while maintaining performance and safety.
