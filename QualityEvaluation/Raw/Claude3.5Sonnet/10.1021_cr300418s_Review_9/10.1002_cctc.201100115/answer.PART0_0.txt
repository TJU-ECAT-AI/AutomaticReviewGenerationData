The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The use of appropriate supports can modulate the catalytic performance of NiO nanoparticles. For effective ammoxidation catalysts, a combination of NiO, NiNbO mixed phases, and acid sites is required. The Nano-series catalysts show better performance for ethane ammoxidation due to the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase. In contrast, the Micro-series catalysts perform well for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between different phases and supports.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the formation of mixed phases and acid sites to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high conversion rates while maintaining selectivity towards desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, especially when dealing with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

The study highlights the importance of synthesis methods in determining catalyst performance, suggesting that further research into novel preparation techniques could lead to improved catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。使用适当的载体可以调节NiO纳米颗粒的催化性能。对于有效的氨氧化催化剂，需要NiO、NiNbO混合相和酸性位点的组合。纳米系列催化剂由于在初生NiNbO相附近具有适当的酸性位点组合，因此在乙烷氨氧化方面表现更好。相比之下，微米系列催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中表现良好。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测不同相和载体之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡混合相和酸性位点的形成，以实现最佳催化性能。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持对目标产物选择性的同时实现高转化率。

4. 安全性：确保安全的操作条件，特别是在处理潜在爆炸性的碳氢化合物和氧气混合物时。

研究强调了合成方法在决定催化剂性能方面的重要性，这表明进一步研究新型制备技术可能会导致氧化脱氢反应催化系统的改进。
