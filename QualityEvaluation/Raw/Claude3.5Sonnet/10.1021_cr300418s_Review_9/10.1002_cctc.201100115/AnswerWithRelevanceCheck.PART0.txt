          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: A novel dry nanodispersion method is used to prepare highly active NiO nanoparticles dispersed on different Nb2O5 materials. This method results in promising catalytic materials for both ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

Dopant concentrations: The incorporation of niobium as a dopant plays a crucial role. NiNbO mixed phases are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation. The Nano-series catalysts exhibit the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase for the appropriate activation of ethane and ammonia.

Vacancy formation: Oxygen vacancy defects (Vo) in the Nb2O5 structure, formed during the catalytic reaction at low temperatures, contribute to the catalyst's reactivity. These vacancies affect the electronic structure and overall catalytic behavior.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between NiO, Nb2O5, and the formation of mixed NiNbO phases.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the formation of NiNbO mixed phases, maintaining an optimal interface between NiO and Nb2O5, and preserving acidic sites to achieve the best catalytic performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high yields of desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, particularly when dealing with potentially hazardous reactants at high temperatures.

5. Scalability: Translating promising laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining performance and safety.

The study highlights that the synthesis method dramatically affects catalyst performance, suggesting that further research into novel preparation techniques could lead to improved catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：使用新型干法纳米分散方法将高活性NiO纳米粒子分散在不同的Nb2O5材料上。这种方法可制备出在乙烷氨氧化和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中都有良好表现的催化材料。

掺杂浓度：将铌作为掺杂剂掺入起着至关重要的作用。NiNbO混合相对于获得选择性和活性俱佳的氨氧化催化剂是必要的。Nano系列催化剂在新生NiNbO相附近具有适当的酸性位点组合，有利于乙烷和氨的活化。

空位形成：在低温催化反应过程中，Nb2O5结构中形成的氧空位缺陷（Vo）对催化剂的反应性有贡献。这些空位影响电子结构和整体催化行为。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测NiO、Nb2O5之间的复杂相互作用以及混合NiNbO相的形成。

2. 工艺优化：平衡NiNbO混合相的形成，保持NiO和Nb2O5之间的最佳界面，并保存酸性位点，以实现最佳催化性能。

3. 效率和选择性：在最大限度地减少不需要的副反应的同时，实现所需产品的高产率。

4. 安全性：确保安全的操作条件，特别是在高温下处理潜在危险的反应物时。

5. 可扩展性：将实验室规模的promising结果转化为工业规模的过程，同时保持性能和安全性。

研究强调，合成方法对催化剂性能有显著影响，这表明进一步研究新型制备技术可能会导致氧化脱氢反应催化系统的改进。
