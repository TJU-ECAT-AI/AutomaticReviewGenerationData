Tuning of Active Sites in NiNbO Catalysts for the Direct Conversion of Ethane to Acetonitrile or Ethylene
Graphical Abstract
Spreading the activity: The results of this study demonstrate that NiO nanoparticles are active for ethane activation and that their catalytic performance can be modulated through the use of the appropriate support. These nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method. The catalysts obtained by the proposed route are promising catalytic materials for the ethane ammoxidation.
Abstract
NiO nanoparticles that are highly active for the ethane activation have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method. This article describes the characterization and catalytic behavior of both series of catalysts as well as the nature of the active sites required for the transformation of ethane into acetonitrile and/or ethylene. It is demonstrated how such active sites present in the catalysts are obtained through this novel dry mixing method. The catalysts obtained are promising catalytic materials for both, ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions.
Introduction
Acetonitrile is widely used as a solvent and in several organic and inorganic syntheses. It is typically obtained as a byproduct during the propylene ammoxidation process to yield acrylonitrile. Acetonitrile can also be produced by using other methods, such as the dehydration of acetamide, but these are of no commercial significance. Because no appropriate commercial-scale synthesis method is available for producing this chemical and because of the global economic slowdown, there is a worldwide shortage of acetonitrile. Alkane feedstocks are currently produced by steam cracking of various petroleum fractions; thus, ethane is an easily available starting material and is also a major component in natural gas.14 Ethane is a convenient feedstock to produce acetonitrile, and the direct ammoxidation of ethane in only one step is an attractive alternative route for the production of acetonitrile. Although there is little research on the ethane ammoxidation process, a few attempts have been made. Early works confirm the relevance of group VIII elements and niobium,5,6 mainly over VMoNbO-based catalysts7 and Co-based zeolites.8,9 Catani and Centi5 investigated ethane ammoxidation by using an alumina-supported NbSb oxide catalyst; they obtained a yield of acetonitrile close to 1.2% at 500C with a contact time of 2.6s. Li and Armor8,9 reported a high activity of the Co ion-exchanged zeolites ZSM-5, beta, and NU-87 in the ammoxidation of ethane to acetonitrile. The more active zeolite supports share a common feature in topology, that is, multidimensional, intersecting channel structures with either 10- or 12-membered ring openings.
Niobium compounds are considered to be important catalytic materials that find applications as promoters, active phases, and catalytic supports.10,11 Niobium-promoted NiO catalysts are able to activate ethane in several reactions,3,4,1215 and recently we reported that ethane ammoxidation can be efficiently performed over this catalytic system16 with a 19% yield of acetonitrile, which is close to those reported for zeolite catalysts.
Recently, we have reported a new synthesis method for catalytic materials. It is a residue-free and solvent-free preparation method to prepare hierarchical nanoscaled catalysts dispersed on microscaled particles.1719 This new nanodispersion method opens up opportunities to obtain hierarchical nanoparticlemicroparticle systems with unusual properties by mixing oxides of dissimilar materials. The interfaces created after the partial reaction of two oxides exhibit new and interesting properties because of proximity and diffusion phenomena,20,21 which become relevant in the nanoscale range. In addition, we have demonstrated that interface-related properties lead to the appearance of ferromagnetism in mixtures of ZnO and Co3O4 although the constituting oxides exhibit diamagnetic and paramagnetic characteristics at room temperature, respectively.22,23 Thus, the aim of the present work was to synthesize new NiNbO catalysts by using the nanodispersion method and to study their performance during ethane ammoxidation.
Results and Discussion
Texture and morphology of the materials
The main physicochemical characteristics of both series of catalysts are presented in Table1. As expected, the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET)surface area values of the Nano series decrease when the coverage with Ni nanoparticles increases, because of a partial blockage of the pores of the support by Ni nanoparticles. The opposite behavior is observed for the Micro series; in this case, the BET surface area value increases when Ni nanoparticles are being incorporated on the Nb2O5-Micro support from 0.8m2g1 for Nb2O5-Micro to 18.6m2g1 for the 40NiNb-Micro sample. These opposing trends indicate that the interaction between the support and the Ni nanoparticles is completely different in both cases. This fact is also reflected by the particle size values as determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Table1); in the case of the Micro series, the NiO crystal size decreases from 33.1nm for 10NiNb-Micro to 26.8nm for 40NiNb-Micro, whereas a clear tendency is not observed in the case of the Nano series. Table1 summarizes the data for ammonia adsorption. Niobium-supported catalysts present a higher surface acidity with respect to unsupported NiO nanoparticles. Both series exhibit a similar acidity profile that reaches maximum ammonia adsorption per square meter at 1020wt% NiO loading.

The field-emission scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM) of supports and NiO nanoparticles are shown in Figure1. Figure1a shows the morphology of the Nb2O5-Nano support, which is characterized by small spherical particles with sizes of 1530nm (see inset in Figure1a) forming globular agglomerates ranging from 510μm. The Nb2O5-Micro support shows the typical Nb2O5 crystalline morphology (Figure1b), which mainly consists of elongated prismatic particles and nearly cubical particles with sizes of 520μm and an average particle size of 10μm (see inset of Figure1b). NiO nanoparticles (Figure1c) present spherical shapes with diameters of 2030nm (see inset of Figure1c). These particles form globular agglomerates of approximately 5.0μm.

The FE-SEM images of 10NiNb-Nano and 10NiNb-Micro are shown in Figure2. The micrographs show well-dispersed NiO nanoparticles adhering to Nb2O5 surfaces (Figures2a b). The dispersion and good adherence of nanoparticles could be an indication of the presence of NiO/Nb2O5 interfaces at room temperature between these materials because of the high initial reactivity of the NiO and especially Nb2O5-Nano catalysts. All individual nanoparticles are dispersed below 10wt% NiO, but some agglomerates become apparent at higher NiO loadings. This implies that a dispersion limit of NiO nanoparticles on both supports has been reached. The Nb2O5-Micro morphology does not change because of the low energy of the mixture process. Additionally, the agglomerates of the Nb2O5-Nano are also reduced in their size by the dry nanodispersion procedure (Figure2a). The transmission electron micrographs (TEM) in the insets of Figures2a and confirm the presence of interfaces between NiO and Nb2O5 after the dry mixing process in both cases.

Structural Characterization
The XRD patterns of the raw materials as well as the fresh and used catalysts of the Nano series are displayed in Figure3. The absence of diffraction peaks in the case of the Nb2O5-Nano support indicates that the sample exhibits an amorphous structure, and it only presents very broad bands centered at 2θ=27 and 51. The patterns of all the catalysts show the diffraction peaks corresponding to the NiO pattern (Figure3); as expected, the intensity of these peaks grows stronger with NiO loading.

In addition, JCPDS patterns corresponding to the Nb2O5 (7-61) and NiNb2O6 (76-2655) crystalline phases have been added as reference patterns.
The XRD patterns of the used catalysts are also shown in Figure3. Partial crystallization of the amorphous niobium phase is apparent after the catalytic reaction because the XRD peaks of Nb2O5 (JCPDS No. 7-61) are clearly visible in the used samples. This Nb2O5 phase formed during the catalytic reaction is the lowest-temperature phase with orthorhombic crystalline structure (a=6.17, b=29.32, c=3.94Å).24 These changes in the crystalline phase of Nb2O5 under ammoxidation conditions have been reported before,2527 and it has been demonstrated that these occur at lower temperatures during the ammoxidation reaction than during calcination in air, which indicates that the reaction environment is promoting such transformation. The used sample patterns also show diffraction peaks corresponding to NiNb2O6, which indicates that niobium and nickel interact during the ammoxidation reaction, as has been described before.28
The diffractograms obtained for fresh and used samples corresponding to the Micro series, along with those of Nb2O5 (JCPDS No. 16-0053) and NiNb2O6 (JCPDS No. 76-2655) used as the reference patterns, are depicted in Figure4. In this case, the patterns are dominated by the diffraction pattern of the Nb2O5 support, which corresponds to the most stable phase occurring at high temperatures and which has a monoclinic structure (a=21.20, b=3.82, c=19.39Å; and β=12010').24 The fact that different diffraction patterns for Nb2O5 are being detected for both series can be explained by Nb2O5 structures being strongly dependent on their heat treatment history, processing methods, and starting materials.29 In this series, the diffraction peaks of NiO become more intense after the catalytic reaction, and the formation of NiNb2O6 crystalline structures is not detected by XRD.

Raman spectra obtained for fresh and used catalysts for the Nano series and for the Micro series are shown in Figure5a and b, respectively. The Nb2O5-Nano powder (Figure1a) used as the starting material has an orthorhombic crystalline symmetry. This structure crystallized in the Pbam space group (D2h point group). It presents a strong and broad Raman band at approximately =650cm1 assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the niobia polyhedral, a band near =200cm1, and a weak band at approximately =900cm1 assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the NbO surface sites. NiO exhibits a strong band at =500cm1 attributable to the NiO stretching mode, with a shoulder at =410cm1 indicative of the nonstoichiometry of the material.16 The fresh samples present Raman spectra corresponding to Nb2O5 and NiO oxides in line with the XRD patterns. After the reaction, some changes are observed in these spectra. The intensity of the NiO band decreases, and a new Raman band is detected at approximately =850cm1 that can be assigned to the NiNb2O6 phase,16 which is in line with the XRD results that also indicated the presence of this phase in the used samples.

Raman spectra of the raw materials and the NiNb series as a function of the NiO content depending on the support type: a)Nb2O5-Nano and b)Nb2O5-Micro.
The Raman spectra for fresh and used catalysts of the Micro series are illustrated in Figure5b. For Nb2O5-Micro powder, the diffraction patterns are assigned to the monoclinic phase, which crystallizes in the P2 space group (C2 point group). Consequently, in the Raman spectra, a different set of vibrational modes is observed in comparison to the Nb2O5-Nano support because of the different crystalline symmetry of the supports used. For the fresh catalysts, the NiO oxide phase is detected only for the sample with higher Ni loading (40NiNb-Micro), whereas it is detected in used 20NiNb-Micro and 40NiNb-Micro catalysts, in which this band is stronger. Thus, in the Micro series, the band corresponding to NiO increases after the reaction, whereas in the Nano series these bands decrease; in addition, no NiNbO bands are detected in the used catalysts of the Micro series. This indicates that the interactions between Nb and Ni species under reaction conditions are totally different in both cases.
Catalytic activity of the NiO/Nb2O5 system
The catalytic results afforded by both series in the ethane ammoxidation reaction are presented in Figure6. In both cases, ethane conversion is negligible on the supports, which indicates that Ni sites are necessary to activate the ethane molecule. Clearly, the NiO nanoparticles obtained are highly active for ethane activation; thus, Ni sites are involved in the activation of ethane and are accessible in these nanoparticles. But the NiO sample is not selective for the acetonitrile formation, which does not show a direct correlation with the ammonia adsorption capacity. Although ammonia adsorption is important for ammoxidation, an additional site is required to achieve ammoxidation; thus, some interaction between Ni and Nb sites is required, which is in accordance with previous studies.16 Such an interaction would account for an efficient ethane activation. Micro- and Nano series exhibit remarkably different catalytic performances. The Micro series catalysts are not selective toward the nitrile insertion, although this series is highly active for ethylene formation, which yields approximately 70% of ethylene for 40NiNb-Micro (Figure6b), indicating that these catalytic materials are able to activate the ethane molecule and that they are selective for the ethane partial oxidation reaction. The high activity of NiNb oxide-based catalysts is consistent with the high selectivity reported for NiNb oxide-based catalysts.3032 The activity profile of the Nano series is completely different because acetonitrile yields are close to 20%, with acetonitrile being the main reaction product. Figure6c shows the selectivity versus ethane conversion graphs for both series, and it can be observed that the Nano-series catalysts are more selective to acetonitrile at any ethane conversion value. Because there is a big difference in the surface area values of both series, the activity has been calculated per Ni site. Such values are shown in Figure6d (turnover frequency (TOF) values). These values are higher for catalysts with compositions between 10 and 30% NiO and for the Nano series, which parallels the surface density of active sites.

Discussion
As a consequence of the crystalline phase nature of the supports, two factors affect the reactivity of the Nb2O5 powders during the synthesis of the NiNb catalysts: 1)the generation of the defects and 2)the reduction of the specific surface area. The phenomenon associated with the generation of defects by the catalytic reaction in the Nb2O5 powders at low temperatures could be related to the loss of oxygen that promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy defects (Vo)s in its structure.3,24,33 The resulting electron availability induces backshift of the process and gradual reduction of Nb defects. Therefore, the reactivity of Nb2O5 powders in the presence of another material will be different for the studied powders of the Nano and Micro supports. This difference in both supports is reflected by the different trends observed for the BET values (Table1). For the Nano series, the ammoxidation reaction favors the niobium diffusivity into the NiO material, and subsequently NiNbO mixed phases are detected in the used catalysts by using both Raman spectroscopy (Figure5) and XRD (Figure3). Contrarily, the reactivity of the Nb2O5-Micro support is smaller, because the previous process has already occurred during the synthesis step in addition to the surface area reduction. Thus, in the case of the Micro series, no NiNbO mixed phases that are necessary for the nitrile formation are detected. Thus, the presence of the acid sites is not enough for an efficient ammoxidation reaction. However, NiO nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of the Nb2O5 support (40NiNb-Micro, 30NiNb-Micro, and 20NiNb-Micro) afford high ethylene yield values (Figure6b). These results are in line with those previously described by Heracleous etal.15 for alumina-supported NiO catalysts. They described that the catalytic properties of NiO catalytic materials are improved upon dispersion on a support because of a more facile electron transfer; they also described that the behavior of these materials is improved upon niobium doping.
The different catalytic behavior of both catalyst series for ethane ammoxidation confirms the relevance of interaction between Nb2O5 and NiO in the active sites of the catalysts. Acidity is indeed an important feature; however, our data suggest that an appropriate arrangement of acidic and NiNbO sites is required. The sites should most likely be located in the vicinity of each other for an efficient formation of both, surface ammonia and ethane species nearby, so that nitrile formation is facilitated. In the case of the Micro series, there is no evidence of such interactions, and Ni sites are not selective to the formation of acetonitrile (Figure6). This is in line with previous studies that indicate that the formation of NiNbO phases is necessary to obtain catalytically active sites on the surface of catalysts.28 In the case of the Nano series, such interaction is evidenced by the formation of a new phase, NiNb2O6, identified in the used catalysts by using both Raman spectroscopy (Figure5) and XRD (Figure3). This NiNb interaction leads to a reduction of the nonstoichiometry in the materials and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and responsible for decreases the selectivity to nitrile insertion because of the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. Thus, Ni sites are responsible for ethane activation, and they can be present as NiO or as NiNb2O6. Figure7 shows the intensity ratio of the NiNb2O6 and NiO XRD peak versus the yield of acetonitrile. This plot illustrates a clear pattern: intermediate NiNb2O6/NiO ratios in the Nano series afford the best acetonitrile yields and TOF values (Figure6). The fact that the ammoxidation reaction passes through a maximum with the NiNb2O6 concentration indicates that this phase, per se, is not the active phase. Some interaction between NiO and NiNb2O6 directly related to the active phase must be invoked. This is consistent with the observation of some incipient interaction between Ni and Nb oxides in catalysts that exhibit high ammoxidation performance by using Raman spectroscopy.16 Thus, Figure7 indicates that an equilibrium between both Ni-containing phases with a NiNb2O6/NiO ratio close to 0.5 is required to obtain catalytically active sites. This would also be related to a maximum interface between acidic sites and mixed NiNbO sites, which are necessary to activate both reactants in close proximity. A higher amount of Nb is detrimental for ethane conversion. These results confirm the tendency described for other catalytic systems, in which the niobium-promoting effect is limited to moderate concentrations.34,35

The phenomenology described herein could be explained by a simple model based on the initial formation of NiO/Nb2O5Nano interfaces at room temperature and the formation of a new mixed phase that would evolve into NiNb2O6 during the ammoxidation reaction. The latter would be the active phase, whereas the former would be a consequence of a more extensive NiNb interaction forming NiNb2O6, which would be much less active than the interfacial structure. Figure8a shows a schematic representation of the individual NiO nanoparticles adhering to the Nb2O5 surfaces as a result of the dry nanodispersion method. The dispersion and good adherence of nanoparticles may indicate that a spontaneous reaction occurs at room temperature between these materials attributable to the high initial reactivity of the NiO and Nb2O5-Nano support. Figure8b shows a magnification of the Nb2O5-Nano support surface, which illustrates the formation of new interfaces between the Nb2O5-Nano support and NiO nanoparticles, which in turn should account for the high ammoxidation activity. These would also maximize the number of active sites on the interface. The high reactivity of the Nb2O5-Nano support may promote an increased diffusion of Nb cations into NiO nanoparticles, and thus the new phase, that is, the NiNbO mixed phase, is rapidly formed during the ammoxidation reaction (Figure8c).

For the Micro series, the behavior of the NiO/Nb2O5-Micro catalysts is completely different because of the nature of the support (Figure9). In this case, the mechanism could be explained by the formation of NiO/Nb2O5-Micro interfaces at room temperature (Figure9a). These interfaces are highly stable, and they are not modified during the ammoxidation reaction (Figure9b and 9c). As has been discussed above, two factors affect the reactivity of the Nb2O5 powders: (1)the generation of the defects and (2)the reduction of the specific surfaceboth limited to the Nb2O5-Micro support. The low reactivity of the Micro support inhibits the formation of new mixed NiNbO phases during the ammoxidation reaction. Nonetheless, the Micro series is selective toward the formation of ethylene and does not have the active sites required for the nitrile. This is probably due to a less efficient entanglement of NiNbO and acidic sites.

Conclusions
The results demonstrate that NiO nanoparticles are active for ethane activation and that their catalytic performance can be modulated through the use of the appropriate support. For NiO,NiNbO mixed phases and acid sites are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation. The Nano-series catalysts exhibit the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase for the appropriate activation of ethane and ammonia and their conversion into acetonitrile. In the case of the Micro-series catalysts, the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on the Nb2O5 material results in a catalytic material that present good performance for the oxidative dehydration (ODH) reaction, which confirms that the NiNb interaction is efficient for ethane activation. The synthesis method for a given catalyst composition has a dramatic effect on performance. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic materials prepared by using the dry dispersion method are active and selective for both ammoxidation and ODH reactions and that the catalytic behavior of the materials is determined by the nature of the support. The materials obtained by using the Nb2O5-Nano support present high surface area values and are able to form the active phases (NiNbO at the interface between NiO and Nb2O5) near the acidic sites for the bifunctional ammoxidation of ethane to acetonitrile. This leads to very promising catalytic materials for the ethane-ammoxidation reaction.
Experimental Section
Nanodispersion procedure of NiO/Nb2O5 mixtures
The compositions with 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40wt% NiO nanoparticles (labeled as 5NiNb, 10NiNb, 20NiNb, 30NiNb, and 40NiNb, respectively) were prepared by incorporating the appropriate amounts of NiO nanoparticles into the Nb2O5 support. The mixtures were synthesized by using two different Nb2O5 supports. A first series of catalysts was prepared by using niobic acid as the raw materialNb2O5nH2O (>99.99%), labeled as Nano supportto achieve a small particle size. In a second series, the niobium oxide used as the raw material was commercial Nb2O5 (>99.99%, Fluka) which is characterized by a high particle size (labeled as Micro support). The NiO/Nb2O5 mixtures were homogenized by using the previously described dry nanodispersion procedure.1719 The dry dispersion process consisted of shaking NiO/Nb2O5 mixtures and 1mm ZrO2 balls in a 60cm3 nylon container for 5min at 50rpm by using a tubular-type mixer. The two pure Nb2O5 and NiO powders were also subjected to the same mixing process to ensure that the mixing process rendered no structural disorder. Analytical grade powders were dried at 110C for 2h before dry mixing.
Morphology characterization
The particle size and morphology of the powders were evaluated by using secondary electron images of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4700) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM (Hitachi H-7100 175) with an accelerating voltage of 120kV. For TEM investigations, powders were suspended in isopropanol, and a drop of this suspension was deposited on a holey carbon-coated film supported on a 400-mesh copper grid.
Structural characterization
The crystalline structure was determined by using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, (Siemens D5000, CuKα radiation; λ=0.15418nm). The particle size values were estimated from the XRD data by using the Scherrer formula:
(1)
in which D is the domain size, θ is the angle of the Bragg peak, and FWHM is full width at half maximum. The formula was applied to peaks of (101) and (012) crystal planes.
The Raman spectra were measured insitu in dehydrated air at 200C in a Linkam cell by using the λ=514nm excitation line from an Ar+ laser operating at 10mW. The signal was collected by using a microscopic Raman spectrometer (Renishaw Micro-Raman System 1000) in the 1001100cm1 Raman shift range.
The ammonia chemisorption experiments were performed by using an ASAP-2000 apparatus. The catalysts (200mg) were pretreated at 250C for 0.5h and then cooled to 100C under He flow to remove water from the catalyst. The pretreated samples were exposed to 5% NH3/He, with subsequent flushing with helium at 100C for 1h to remove the physisorbed ammonia. These acidity values were determined from the difference between ammonia adsorption and desorption isotherms.
Catalytic reaction procedure
The kinetic measurements were performed in a microreactor system. The gases used were helium (99.999% purity), oxygen (99.999% purity), ethane (99.96% purity), and ammonia (99.999% purity). All gases were purchased from Air Liquid. Except for ethane, which was used as supplied, the other gases were passed through a molecular sieve trap. To prevent participation of the homogeneous reactivity, the reactor was designed to minimize the gas-phase activation of ethane by minimizing the void volume. The quantity of the catalyst and the total flow were determined to avoid internal and external diffusion limitations. Tests were conducted by using 0.2g of sample with particle dimensions in the 0.250.125mm range. The total flow rate was 20mLmin1 corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity of approximately 3000h1. Tests were conducted by using the following reaction feed composition (% volume): 25% O2, 9.8% ethane, and 8.6% NH3 in helium. Before performing the catalytic tests, the catalysts were activated in the reactor and then heated under reactant feed from ambient temperature up to 500C at 10Cmin1; then, the temperature was cooled down to ambient conditions. The reactor outlet was connected to an online gas chromatograph (Varian CP-3800) equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors for product analysis. The accuracy of the analytical determinations was checked for each test by verifying that the carbon balance (based on ethane converted) was within the cumulative mean error of the determinations (10%). The yield and selectivity values were determined on the basis of the moles of ethane feed and products, by considering the number of carbon atoms in each molecule. The turnover frequency (TOF) data were calculated by considering the amount of acetonitrile produced per Ni atom incorporated in the catalyst formulation.
