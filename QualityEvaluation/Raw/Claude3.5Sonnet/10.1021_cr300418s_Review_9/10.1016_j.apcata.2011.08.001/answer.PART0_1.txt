[1] "Ce1xMxO (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni, x denoted the molar ratio of M of to Ce) materials with high surface areas were synthesized via a previously established template-assisted precipitation method"

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "A catalytic mechanism via a simple surface redox cycle has been tentatively proposed based on the XPS results."

The preparation method, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The study used a template-assisted precipitation method to synthesize Ce1-xMxO materials with high surface areas, where M includes Ni and other elements. The optimal dopant concentration was found to be 10 mol% Ni, which yielded the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

The superior performance of the Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst is attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials. This improvement results from the introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure, which causes a further shrinkage of the ceria lattice.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some challenges may include:

1. Accurately modeling the complex interactions between dopants and the ceria structure.
2. Optimizing the synthesis process to consistently produce high-surface-area materials with the desired dopant concentration.
3. Balancing the improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity with the stability of the catalyst structure.
4. Ensuring the long-term stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions.
5. Developing a deeper understanding of the surface redox cycle mechanism to further improve catalyst design.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能在氧化脱氢反应中有显著影响。

该研究使用模板辅助沉淀法合成了高比表面积的Ce1-xMxO材料，其中M包括Ni和其他元素。最佳掺杂浓度被发现是10 mol%的Ni，在450°C下对乙苯氧化脱氢反应具有最高的苯乙烯产率55%，并具有长期稳定性。

Ce0.90Ni0.10O催化剂的优异性能归因于氧化铈材料的氧移动性和储存容量的显著改善。这种改善源于将Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构中，导致氧化铈晶格进一步收缩。

该文献中没有明确讨论这些催化系统在理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战。然而，根据提供的信息，一些挑战可能包括：

1. 准确建模掺杂剂与氧化铈结构之间的复杂相互作用。
2. 优化合成过程，以持续生产具有所需掺杂浓度的高比表面积材料。
3. 平衡氧移动性和储存容量的改善与催化剂结构的稳定性。
4. 确保催化剂在反应条件下的长期稳定性。
5. 深入理解表面氧化还原循环机制，以进一步改进催化剂设计。
