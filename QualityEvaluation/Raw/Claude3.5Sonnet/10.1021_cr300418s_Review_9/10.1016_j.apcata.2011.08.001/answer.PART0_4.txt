[1] "Ce1xMxO (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni, x denoted the molar ratio of M of to Ce) materials with high surface areas were synthesized via a previously established template-assisted precipitation method"

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "More recently, we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the ODH of EB at ca. 450 C"

[5] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

The preparation method, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The study used a template-assisted precipitation method to synthesize Ce1-xMxO materials with high surface areas, where M includes Ni among other elements. The optimal dopant concentration was found to be 10 mol% Ni, which demonstrated the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

The superior performance of the Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst is attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials. This improvement results from the introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure, causing a further shrinkage of the ceria lattice.

The study highlights that the increase in oxygen capacity and storage capacity after introducing an optimal amount of Ni species is crucial for an efficient ceria-based catalyst. This suggests that vacancy formation plays a significant role in enhancing catalytic performance.

Key challenges in this area likely include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and stability.
3. Ensuring safety in handling and using these catalysts, especially at high temperatures.
4. Scaling up the synthesis process while maintaining the desired structural and catalytic properties.

However, the document does not explicitly discuss these challenges or provide detailed information on theoretical modeling aspects.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

该研究使用模板辅助沉淀法合成了高比表面积的Ce1-xMxO材料，其中M包括Ni在内的多种元素。最佳掺杂浓度被发现是10 mol%的Ni，在450°C下对乙苯进行氧化脱氢反应时表现出55%的苯乙烯产率和长期稳定性。

Ce0.90Ni0.10O催化剂的优异性能归因于氧化铈材料的氧移动性和储存能力的显著提高。这种改善源于将Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构中，导致氧化铈晶格进一步收缩。

研究强调，在引入最佳数量的Ni物种后，氧气容量和储存容量的增加对于高效的氧化铈基催化剂至关重要。这表明空位形成在增强催化性能方面起着重要作用。

该领域的主要挑战可能包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 过程优化以平衡效率、选择性和稳定性。
3. 确保在处理和使用这些催化剂时的安全性，特别是在高温下。
4. 在保持所需结构和催化性能的同时扩大合成过程的规模。

然而，该文档并未明确讨论这些挑战或提供关于理论建模方面的详细信息。
