          [1] "Mesostructured doped Ce1xMxO catalysts (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior"

[5] "More recently, we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the ODH of EB at ca. 450 C"

[6] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: A template-assisted precipitation method was used to synthesize Ce1-xMxO materials with high surface areas and mesostructured properties.

2. Dopant concentrations: Various dopants (Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) were tested. The optimal dopant concentration was found to be 10 mol% Ni, which demonstrated the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

3. Vacancy formation and electronic structure: The introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure results in a shrinkage of the ceria lattice, leading to the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. This modification creates oxygen vacancies and dramatically improves oxygen mobility and storage capacity.

4. Catalytic performance: The Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst showed superior performance due to the improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity. The increase in oxygen capacity and storage capacity after introducing an optimal amount of Ni species is crucial for an efficient ceria-based catalyst.

Key challenges in this field likely include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and stability.
3. Ensuring safety in handling oxygen-rich environments at high temperatures.
4. Scaling up the synthesis process while maintaining the desired structural and catalytic properties.
5. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxygen vacancies and their impact on catalytic activity.

However, the provided information does not explicitly discuss these challenges or provide detailed information on theoretical modeling aspects.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：使用模板辅助沉淀法合成了高比表面积和介孔结构的Ce1-xMxO材料。

2. 掺杂浓度：测试了各种掺杂剂（Al、Sn、Zr、Mn和Ni）。最佳掺杂浓度被发现是10 mol%的Ni，在450°C下对乙苯进行氧化脱氢反应时表现出55%的苯乙烯产率和长期稳定性。

3. 空位形成和电子结构：将Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构导致氧化铈晶格收缩，形成缺陷萤石结构的固溶体。这种改性创造了氧空位，显著提高了氧移动性和储存能力。

4. 催化性能：Ce0.90Ni0.10O催化剂由于改善的氧移动性和储存能力而表现出优异的性能。在引入最佳数量的Ni物种后，氧气容量和储存容量的增加对于高效的氧化铈基催化剂至关重要。

该领域的主要挑战可能包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
