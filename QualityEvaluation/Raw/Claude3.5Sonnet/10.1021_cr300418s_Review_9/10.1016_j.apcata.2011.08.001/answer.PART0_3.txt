[1] "Mesostructured doped Ce1xMxO catalysts (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The template-assisted precipitation method was used to prepare mesostructured doped ceria catalysts with large surface areas. Among the various dopants tested (Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni), the Ni-doped ceria catalyst showed the best performance.

The optimal dopant concentration was found to be 10 mol% Ni, which resulted in the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

The superior performance of the Ni-doped ceria catalyst is attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity. This enhancement results from the introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure, which causes further shrinkage of the ceria lattice and creates a defective fluorite-structured solid solution.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between the dopant, the ceria lattice, and the reactants.
2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and stability.
3. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxygen vacancies and their role in the catalytic process.
4. Balancing the benefits of improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity with potential drawbacks such as reduced thermal stability.
5. Ensuring safety in the oxidative environment while maintaining high catalytic activity.

Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play and to develop even more efficient and stable catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

采用模板辅助沉淀法制备了具有大比表面积的介孔掺杂氧化铈催化剂。在测试的各种掺杂剂（Al、Sn、Zr、Mn和Ni）中，Ni掺杂的氧化铈催化剂表现最佳。

最佳掺杂浓度被发现是10 mol%的Ni，在450°C下进行乙苯氧化脱氢反应时，苯乙烯产率最高，达到55%，并具有长期稳定性。

Ni掺杂氧化铈催化剂的优异性能归因于氧移动性和储存能力的显著提高。这种增强源于Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构中，导致氧化铈晶格进一步收缩，形成缺陷萤石结构的固溶体。

该催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、氧化铈晶格和反应物之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 过程优化以平衡效率、选择性和稳定性。
3. 理解和控制氧空位的形成及其在催化过程中的作用。
4. 平衡改善的氧移动性和储存能力带来的好处与可能的缺点，如热稳定性降低。
5. 在保持高催化活性的同时确保氧化环境中的安全性。

需要进一步研究以充分理解所涉及的机理，并开发更高效、更稳定的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
