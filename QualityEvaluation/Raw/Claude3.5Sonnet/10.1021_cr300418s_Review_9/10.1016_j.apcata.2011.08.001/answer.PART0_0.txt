[1] "Mesostructured doped Ce1xMxO catalysts (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior"

The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared using a template-assisted precipitation method, which resulted in mesostructured doped ceria catalysts with large surface areas.

2. Dopant concentrations: The study tested various dopants (Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) in Ce1xMxO catalysts. The optimal performance was achieved with 10 mol% Ni doping in the CeNiO composite.

3. Vacancy formation and electronic structure: The introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure led to a shrinkage of the ceria lattice, resulting in a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. This modification improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity.

4. Catalytic performance: The Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst showed the highest styrene yield (55%) with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

The study does not directly address the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety. However, it suggests that optimizing dopant type and concentration, as well as understanding the relationship between structural modifications and oxygen storage capacity, are crucial for improving catalyst performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献提供了关于制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成如何影响氧化镍基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能的见解：

1. 制备方法：使用模板辅助沉淀法制备催化剂，得到具有大比表面积的介孔掺杂氧化铈催化剂。

2. 掺杂浓度：研究测试了Ce1xMxO催化剂中的各种掺杂剂（Al、Sn、Zr、Mn和Ni）。在CeNiO复合物中，10 mol%的Ni掺杂达到了最佳性能。

3. 空位形成和电子结构：将Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构导致氧化铈晶格收缩，形成缺陷萤石结构的固溶体。这种修饰改善了氧移动性和储存能力。

4. 催化性能：Ce0.90Ni0.10O催化剂在450°C下进行乙苯氧化脱氢反应时，显示出最高的苯乙烯产率（55%）和长期稳定性。

该研究并未直接讨论理论建模、过程优化或平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战。然而，它表明优化掺杂剂类型和浓度，以及理解结构修饰与氧储存能力之间的关系，对于改善氧化脱氢反应中的催化剂性能至关重要。
