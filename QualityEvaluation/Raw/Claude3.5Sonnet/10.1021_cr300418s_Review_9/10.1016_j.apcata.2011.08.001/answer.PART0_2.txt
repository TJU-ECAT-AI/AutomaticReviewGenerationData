[1] "Ce1xMxO (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni, x denoted the molar ratio of M of to Ce) materials with high surface areas were synthesized via a previously established template-assisted precipitation method [28,29]."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior [26]."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The template-assisted precipitation method was used to synthesize Ce1-xMxO materials with high surface areas, where M includes Ni among other elements. The optimal dopant concentration was found to be 10 mol% Ni, which demonstrated the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450°C.

The introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure results in a shrinkage of the ceria lattice, leading to dramatic improvements in oxygen mobility and storage capacity. This modification creates a defective fluorite-structured solid solution, conferring new properties such as better resistance to sintering and higher oxygen storage capacity, which are crucial for catalytic performance.

Key challenges in this field likely include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants and the ceria structure.
2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and stability.
3. Ensuring safety in handling oxygen-rich environments at high temperatures.
4. Developing catalysts that maintain high performance while minimizing rare earth element usage.
5. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxygen vacancies and their impact on catalytic activity.

Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of these catalytic systems and to develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

模板辅助沉淀法被用于合成高比表面积的Ce1-xMxO材料，其中M包括Ni在内的其他元素。最佳掺杂浓度被发现是10 mol%的Ni，在450°C下对乙苯进行氧化脱氢反应时表现出55%的苯乙烯产率和长期稳定性。

将Ni物种引入氧化铈立方结构导致氧化铈晶格收缩，显著提高了氧移动性和储存能力。这种改性创造了缺陷荧石结构的固溶体，赋予了材料新的性质，如更好的抗烧结性和更高的氧储存能力，这些对催化性能至关重要。

该领域的主要挑战可能包括：

1. 对掺杂剂与氧化铈结构之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化过程以平衡效率、选择性和稳定性。
3. 确保在高温下处理富氧环境的安全性。
4. 开发在最小化稀土元素使用的同时保持高性能的催化剂。
5. 理解和控制氧空位的形成及其对催化活性的影响。

需要进一步研究以充分阐明这些催化系统的机制，并开发出更高效、更可持续的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
