[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "Taking into consideration a basic character of electron-rich olefins including styrene, lower surface acidity of the catalyst appears to induce easier desorption of olefins from the catalyst surface."

[3] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[4] "According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al support and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10."

[5] "This result implies the stronger interaction between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation. The increased acidbase interaction might lead to the formation of magnesium vanadate(s) with the lower specific surface area, which is probably two-dimensional and un-detectable phase in XRD."

The literature primarily focuses on magnesium-modified alumina-supported vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. While it doesn't directly address all aspects of the question, it provides insights into some key factors influencing catalyst performance:

1. Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnating activated alumina with magnesium nitrate, followed by calcination and impregnation with vanadium and antimony precursors.

2. Dopant concentrations: The study examined different Mg/Al atomic ratios (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). An appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al = 0.1) led to stable catalyst activity.

3. Electronic structure: The addition of magnesia reduced the surface acidity of the catalysts, which was believed to facilitate the desorption of olefins and improve catalyst stability.

4. Catalytic performance: Mg-modified catalysts showed improved stability and resistance to carbon formation compared to unmodified catalysts.

5. Challenges: The study highlights the importance of balancing acidity reduction with maintaining an adequate amount of active vanadium-antimony oxide species on the catalyst surface.

The research doesn't specifically address theoretical modeling, process optimization, or safety concerns. It focuses on understanding the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance in the specific reaction of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene.

该文献主要关注镁改性的氧化铝负载的钒-锑氧化物催化剂，用于以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯反应。虽然它没有直接涉及问题的所有方面，但它提供了一些影响催化剂性能的关键因素的见解：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将活性氧化铝浸渍于硝酸镁溶液中，然后煅烧并浸渍钒和锑前体制备的。

2. 掺杂浓度：研究考察了不同的Mg/Al原子比（0.1、0.3、0.5）。适当量的氧化镁（Mg/Al = 0.1）导致催化剂活性稳定。

3. 电子结构：添加氧化镁降低了催化剂的表面酸度，这被认为有助于烯烃的脱附和提高催化剂的稳定性。

4. 催化性能：与未改性的催化剂相比，镁改性的催化剂表现出更好的稳定性和抗积碳能力。

5. 挑战：研究强调了在降低酸度的同时保持催化剂表面足够的活性钒-锑氧化物物种的平衡的重要性。

这项研究没有具体涉及理论建模、过程优化或安全问题。它主要集中在理解催化剂组成、结构和性能之间的关系，特别是在乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯的特定反应中。
