[1] "MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calcination at 670 C."

[2] "Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C."

[3] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[4] "It was found that XRD peaks of VSbO4like phases, which are well detectable in the VSb/Al12,13 and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts, are very weak in the VSb/Mg0:3Al and, moreover, they fully disappear in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst."

[5] "This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts, theoretical modeling, and safety considerations. However, it does provide some relevant information about vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on MgO-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with Mg(NO3)2.6H2O solutions, followed by calcination. The MgO-modified alumina supports are then impregnated with NH4VO3 and SbCl3 solutions and calcined again to produce the final catalysts.

Dopant concentrations are expressed as atomic ratios of Mg/Al (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5). The Mg content influences the acidity of the catalyst, with higher Mg content leading to lower acidity.

The electronic structure is affected by the Mg content, as evidenced by changes in the XRD patterns. VSbO4-like phases are detectable in catalysts with low Mg content but disappear as Mg content increases, suggesting stronger interactions between the acidic VSb oxide and the MgO-modified alumina support.

Catalytic performance is influenced by the balance between decreased acidity and the amount of VSb oxide species. The Mg0.1Al-supported catalyst shows the most stable and active performance in the CO2-EBDH reaction.

Key challenges include optimizing the Mg content to achieve the right balance between acidity reduction and maintaining an adequate amount of active VSb oxide species on the surface. The study also highlights the importance of considering surface area, as higher Mg content leads to reduced specific surface areas, which can negatively impact catalytic activity.

While the study doesn't directly address theoretical modeling or safety concerns, it emphasizes the importance of balancing various factors to achieve optimal catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

这篇文献并没有直接涉及所有问题的方面，特别是关于氧化镍基催化剂、理论建模和安全考虑。然而，它确实提供了一些关于以二氧化碳为氧化剂，使用MgO改性氧化铝负载的钒-锑氧化物催化剂进行苯乙烯脱氢制苯乙烯的相关信息。

制备方法包括用Mg(NO3)2.6H2O溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行煅烧。然后将MgO改性的氧化铝载体用NH4VO3和SbCl3溶液再次浸渍，并再次煅烧以生产最终的催化剂。

掺杂剂浓度以Mg/Al的原子比表示（0.1、0.3或0.5）。Mg含量影响催化剂的酸度，更高的Mg含量导致更低的酸度。

电子结构受Mg含量的影响，这从XRD图谱的变化中可以看出。在低Mg含量的催化剂中可以检测到VSbO4类相，但随着Mg含量的增加，这些相消失，这表明酸性VSb氧化物与MgO改性氧化铝载体之间的相互作用更强。

催化性能受酸度降低和VSb氧化物物种数量之间平衡的影响。Mg0.1Al负载的催化剂在CO2-EBDH反应中表现出最稳定和活跃的性能。

主要挑战包括优化Mg含量，以在降低酸度和维持表面足够的活性VSb氧化物物种数量之间达到适当的平衡。该研究还强调了考虑表面积的重要性，因为更高的Mg含量会导致比表面积减少，这可能对催化活性产生负面影响。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及理论建模或安全问题，但它强调了平衡各种因素以实现最佳催化性能（在活性、选择性和稳定性方面）的重要性。
