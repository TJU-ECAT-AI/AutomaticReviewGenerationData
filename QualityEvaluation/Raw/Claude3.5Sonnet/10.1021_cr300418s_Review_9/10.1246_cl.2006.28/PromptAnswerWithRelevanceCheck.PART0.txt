[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."

[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the supported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."

[4] "Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4 6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %), indicating that modification of alumina support with magnesia leads to the stable activity, at least partly, due to strong resistance against carbon formation."

[5] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/ MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

The literature provided does not directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts and theoretical modeling. However, it does offer insights into some aspects of catalyst preparation and performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

The study focuses on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina. The preparation method involves impregnation of activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination and impregnation with vanadium and antimony precursors.

Dopant concentration, specifically the Mg/Al ratio, significantly influences catalyst performance. An optimal Mg/Al ratio of 0.1 leads to stable catalytic activity. Higher Mg content decreases surface acidity but also reduces specific surface area, which can negatively impact catalytic performance.

The electronic structure is indirectly influenced by the Mg modification, as it reduces surface acidity. This decrease in acidity leads to easier desorption of olefins from the catalyst surface, reducing carbon formation and improving catalyst stability.

Key challenges identified include:
1. Balancing surface acidity and basicity to optimize olefin desorption and minimize coking.
2. Maintaining high specific surface area while modifying the support.
3. Ensuring proper dispersion of active species (VOx) on the support.
4. Optimizing the interaction between the active species and the support to maintain high activity and selectivity.

The study demonstrates that catalyst performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is a complex interplay between support properties, active species dispersion, and surface chemistry. While it doesn't directly address theoretical modeling or process optimization, it highlights the importance of carefully tuning catalyst composition and properties to achieve desired performance characteristics.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于氧化镍基催化剂和理论建模的部分。然而，它确实为使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙苯到苯乙烯的氧化脱氢催化剂的制备和性能提供了一些见解。

该研究主要关注supported在氧化镁改性氧化铝上的钒-锑氧化物催化剂。制备方法包括用硝酸镁溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行煅烧和钒、锑前体的浸渍。

掺杂浓度，特别是Mg/Al比率，显著影响催化剂性能。最佳的Mg/Al比率为0.1，可以导致稳定的催化活性。较高的Mg含量会降低表面酸度，但也会降低比表面积，这可能会对催化性能产生负面影响。

电子结构间接受到Mg改性的影响，因为它降低了表面酸度。这种酸度的降低导致烯烃更容易从催化剂表面脱附，减少了碳的形成并提高了催化剂的稳定性。

识别出的关键挑战包括：
1. 平衡表面酸度和碱度，以优化烯烃脱附并最小化结焦。
2. 在改性支撑体的同时保持高比表面积。
3. 确保活性物种（VOx）在支撑体上的适当分散。
4. 优化活性物种与支撑体之间的相互作用，以保持高活性和选择性。

该研究表明，氧化脱氢反应中的催化剂性能是支撑体性质、活性物种分散和表面化学之间复杂相互作用的结果。虽然它没有直接涉及理论建模或过程优化，但它强调了仔细调整催化剂组成和性质以实现所需性能特征的重要性。

[5] "This result implies the stronger interaction between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation. The increased acidbase interaction might lead to the formation of magnesium vanadate(s) with the lower specific surface area, which is probably two-dimensional and un-detectable phase in XRD."

2. Dopant concentrations: The study examined different Mg/Al atomic ratios (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). An appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al = 0.1) led to stable catalyst activity.

3. Electronic structure: The addition of magnesia reduced the surface acidity of the catalysts, which was believed to facilitate the desorption of olefins and improve catalyst stability.

4. Catalytic performance: Mg-modified catalysts showed improved stability and resistance to carbon formation compared to unmodified catalysts.

5. Challenges: The study highlights the importance of balancing acidity reduction with maintaining an adequate amount of active vanadium-antimony oxide species on the catalyst surface.

The research doesn't specifically address theoretical modeling, process optimization, or safety concerns. It focuses on understanding the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance in the specific reaction of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene.

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions mentioned in the question. However, it does provide relevant information on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination. The supported vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts are then prepared by impregnation with ammonium metavanadate and antimony trichloride solutions, followed by another calcination step.

Dopant concentrations are expressed as atomic ratios of Mg/Al (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5). The study found that an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al = 0.1) leads to stable catalyst activity.

The electronic structure is influenced by the magnesium modification, which reduces the surface acidity of the catalysts. Lower acidity is correlated with better catalyst stability and resistance to carbon formation.

Catalytic performance is affected by several factors:
1. The VOx species mainly determine the catalyst activity.
2. SbOx contributes to catalyst stability by facilitating the redox cycle.
3. Magnesium modification improves catalyst stability and reduces carbon formation.
4. Higher magnesium content decreases the specific surface area, which can negatively impact catalyst activity.

The key challenges identified in this study include:
1. Balancing surface acidity reduction with maintaining sufficient active species exposure.
2. Optimizing the magnesia content to achieve stable activity without significantly reducing the specific surface area.
3. Preventing the formation of less active phases (e.g., magnesium vanadate) at higher magnesium concentrations.

While the study does not directly address theoretical modeling or process optimization, it demonstrates the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance in developing improved catalytic systems for dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts, theoretical modeling, and safety considerations. However, it does provide some relevant information about vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on MgO-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with Mg(NO3)2.6H2O solutions, followed by calcination. The MgO-modified alumina supports are then impregnated with NH4VO3 and SbCl3 solutions and calcined again to produce the final catalysts.

Dopant concentrations are expressed as atomic ratios of Mg/Al (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5). The Mg content influences the acidity of the catalyst, with higher Mg content leading to lower acidity.

The electronic structure is affected by the Mg content, as evidenced by changes in the XRD patterns. VSbO4-like phases are detectable in catalysts with low Mg content but disappear as Mg content increases, suggesting stronger interactions between the acidic VSb oxide and the MgO-modified alumina support.

Catalytic performance is influenced by the balance between decreased acidity and the amount of VSb oxide species. The Mg0.1Al-supported catalyst shows the most stable and active performance in the CO2-EBDH reaction.

Key challenges include optimizing the Mg content to achieve the right balance between acidity reduction and maintaining an adequate amount of active VSb oxide species on the surface. The study also highlights the importance of considering surface area, as higher Mg content leads to reduced specific surface areas, which can negatively impact catalytic activity.

While the study doesn't directly address theoretical modeling or safety concerns, it emphasizes the importance of balancing various factors to achieve optimal catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

制备方法包括用Mg(NO3)2.6H2O溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行煅烧。然后将MgO改性的氧化铝载体用NH4VO3和SbCl3溶液再次浸渍，并再次煅烧以生产最终的催化剂。

掺杂剂浓度以Mg/Al的原子比表示（0.1、0.3或0.5）。Mg含量影响催化剂的酸度，更高的Mg含量导致更低的酸度。

电子结构受Mg含量的影响，这从XRD图谱的变化中可以看出。在低Mg含量的催化剂中可以检测到VSbO4类相，但随着Mg含量的增加，这些相消失，这表明酸性VSb氧化物与MgO改性氧化铝载体之间的相互作用更强。

催化性能受酸度降低和VSb氧化物物种数量之间平衡的影响。Mg0.1Al负载的催化剂在CO2-EBDH反应中表现出最稳定和活跃的性能。

主要挑战包括优化Mg含量，以在降低酸度和维持表面足够的活性VSb氧化物物种数量之间达到适当的平衡。该研究还强调了考虑表面积的重要性，因为更高的Mg含量会导致比表面积减少，这可能对催化活性产生负面影响。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及理论建模或安全问题，但它强调了平衡各种因素以实现最佳催化性能（在活性、选择性和稳定性方面）的重要性。

The literature primarily focuses on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. While it doesn't directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts, it provides insights into how dopant concentrations and preparation methods influence catalyst performance in similar oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination. The vanadium-antimony oxide is then added through impregnation with ammonium vanadate and antimony chloride solutions, followed by another calcination step.

Dopant concentrations (Mg/Al atomic ratios of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5) significantly influence the catalyst's electronic structure and performance. Lower Mg content (Mg/Al = 0.1) results in a spinel-like binary oxide phase (MgAl6O10) without free crystalline MgO, while higher Mg content leads to the formation of MgAl2O4 and free MgO.

The key challenge in this system is balancing acidity and the amount of active species. Increasing Mg content decreases surface acidity, which improves catalyst stability by reducing carbon formation. However, too much Mg can lead to decreased catalytic activity due to the formation of magnesium vanadate with lower specific surface area.

For theoretical modeling and process optimization, understanding the interplay between support modification, surface acidity, and the dispersion of active species is crucial. The study demonstrates that an optimal Mg/Al ratio of 0.1 provides the best balance between stability and activity.

While the study doesn't directly address safety concerns, it highlights the importance of catalyst stability and resistance to carbon formation, which are relevant to process safety in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献主要关注在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的条件下，以氧化镁改性氧化铝为载体的钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯。虽然它没有直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂，但它提供了关于掺杂剂浓度和制备方法如何影响类似氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解。

制备方法包括用硝酸镁溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行焙烧。随后通过浸渍偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑溶液添加钒-锑氧化物，再进行一次焙烧。

掺杂剂浓度（Mg/Al原子比为0.1、0.3或0.5）显著影响催化剂的电子结构和性能。较低的Mg含量（Mg/Al = 0.1）形成尖晶石类二元氧化物相（MgAl6O10），没有自由的结晶MgO，而较高的Mg含量会导致MgAl2O4和自由MgO的形成。

这个系统的关键挑战是平衡酸度和活性物种的数量。增加Mg含量会降低表面酸度，从而通过减少碳沉积来提高催化剂稳定性。然而，过多的Mg可能导致催化活性降低，这是由于形成了比表面积较低的钒酸镁。

对于理论建模和过程优化，理解载体改性、表面酸度和活性物种分散之间的相互作用至关重要。研究表明，最佳的Mg/Al比例为0.1，可以在稳定性和活性之间提供最佳平衡。

虽然这项研究没有直接讨论安全问题，但它强调了催化剂稳定性和抗碳沉积能力的重要性，这与氧化脱氢反应的过程安全相关。
