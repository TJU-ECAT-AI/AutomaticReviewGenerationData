[1] "MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calcination at 670 C."

[2] "Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C."

[3] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[4] "According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al support and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10."

[5] "This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH."

The literature primarily focuses on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. While it doesn't directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts, it provides insights into how dopant concentrations and preparation methods influence catalyst performance in similar oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination. The vanadium-antimony oxide is then added through impregnation with ammonium vanadate and antimony chloride solutions, followed by another calcination step.

Dopant concentrations (Mg/Al atomic ratios of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5) significantly influence the catalyst's electronic structure and performance. Lower Mg content (Mg/Al = 0.1) results in a spinel-like binary oxide phase (MgAl6O10) without free crystalline MgO, while higher Mg content leads to the formation of MgAl2O4 and free MgO.

The key challenge in this system is balancing acidity and the amount of active species. Increasing Mg content decreases surface acidity, which improves catalyst stability by reducing carbon formation. However, too much Mg can lead to decreased catalytic activity due to the formation of magnesium vanadate with lower specific surface area.

For theoretical modeling and process optimization, understanding the interplay between support modification, surface acidity, and the dispersion of active species is crucial. The study demonstrates that an optimal Mg/Al ratio of 0.1 provides the best balance between stability and activity.

While the study doesn't directly address safety concerns, it highlights the importance of catalyst stability and resistance to carbon formation, which are relevant to process safety in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献主要关注在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的条件下，以氧化镁改性氧化铝为载体的钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯。虽然它没有直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂，但它提供了关于掺杂剂浓度和制备方法如何影响类似氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解。

制备方法包括用硝酸镁溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行焙烧。随后通过浸渍偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑溶液添加钒-锑氧化物，再进行一次焙烧。

掺杂剂浓度（Mg/Al原子比为0.1、0.3或0.5）显著影响催化剂的电子结构和性能。较低的Mg含量（Mg/Al = 0.1）形成尖晶石类二元氧化物相（MgAl6O10），没有自由的结晶MgO，而较高的Mg含量会导致MgAl2O4和自由MgO的形成。

这个系统的关键挑战是平衡酸度和活性物种的数量。增加Mg含量会降低表面酸度，从而通过减少碳沉积来提高催化剂稳定性。然而，过多的Mg可能导致催化活性降低，这是由于形成了比表面积较低的钒酸镁。

对于理论建模和过程优化，理解载体改性、表面酸度和活性物种分散之间的相互作用至关重要。研究表明，最佳的Mg/Al比例为0.1，可以在稳定性和活性之间提供最佳平衡。

虽然这项研究没有直接讨论安全问题，但它强调了催化剂稳定性和抗碳沉积能力的重要性，这与氧化脱氢反应的过程安全相关。
