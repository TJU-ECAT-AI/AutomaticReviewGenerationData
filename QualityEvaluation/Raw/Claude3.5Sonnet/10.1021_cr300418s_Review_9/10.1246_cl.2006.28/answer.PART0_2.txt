[5] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions mentioned in the question. However, it does provide relevant information on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

The preparation method involves impregnating activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination. The supported vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts are then prepared by impregnation with ammonium metavanadate and antimony trichloride solutions, followed by another calcination step.

Dopant concentrations are expressed as atomic ratios of Mg/Al (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5). The study found that an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al = 0.1) leads to stable catalyst activity.

The electronic structure is influenced by the magnesium modification, which reduces the surface acidity of the catalysts. Lower acidity is correlated with better catalyst stability and resistance to carbon formation.

Catalytic performance is affected by several factors:
1. The VOx species mainly determine the catalyst activity.
2. SbOx contributes to catalyst stability by facilitating the redox cycle.
3. Magnesium modification improves catalyst stability and reduces carbon formation.
4. Higher magnesium content decreases the specific surface area, which can negatively impact catalyst activity.

The key challenges identified in this study include:
1. Balancing surface acidity reduction with maintaining sufficient active species exposure.
2. Optimizing the magnesia content to achieve stable activity without significantly reducing the specific surface area.
3. Preventing the formation of less active phases (e.g., magnesium vanadate) at higher magnesium concentrations.

While the study does not directly address theoretical modeling or process optimization, it demonstrates the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance in developing improved catalytic systems for dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或问题中提到的特定氧化脱氢反应。然而，它提供了关于以二氧化碳为氧化剂，用于乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯的镁改性氧化铝负载的钒-锑氧化物催化剂的相关信息。

制备方法包括用硝酸镁溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行煅烧。之后，通过浸渍偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑溶液制备负载的钒-锑氧化物催化剂，再进行一次煅烧。

掺杂浓度以Mg/Al的原子比表示（0.1、0.3或0.5）。研究发现，适量的氧化镁（Mg/Al = 0.1）可以使催化剂活性保持稳定。

电子结构受镁改性的影响，镁改性降低了催化剂的表面酸度。较低的酸度与更好的催化剂稳定性和抗碳沉积能力相关。

催化性能受几个因素影响：
1. VOx物种主要决定催化剂活性。
2. SbOx通过促进氧化还原循环来提高催化剂稳定性。
3. 镁改性提高了催化剂稳定性并减少了碳沉积。
4. 较高的镁含量会降低比表面积，可能对催化剂活性产生负面影响。

这项研究确定的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡表面酸度降低与维持足够的活性物种暴露。
2. 优化氧化镁含量，以实现稳定活性而不显著降低比表面积。
3. 防止在高镁浓度下形成活性较低的相（如钒酸镁）。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及理论建模或过程优化，但它展示了理解催化剂组成、结构和性能之间关系的重要性，这对开发改进的脱氢反应催化系统至关重要。
