[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."

[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the supported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."

[4] "Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4 6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %), indicating that modification of alumina support with magnesia leads to the stable activity, at least partly, due to strong resistance against carbon formation."

[5] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/ MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

The literature provided does not directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts and theoretical modeling. However, it does offer insights into some aspects of catalyst preparation and performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

The study focuses on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina. The preparation method involves impregnation of activated alumina with magnesium nitrate solutions, followed by calcination and impregnation with vanadium and antimony precursors.

Dopant concentration, specifically the Mg/Al ratio, significantly influences catalyst performance. An optimal Mg/Al ratio of 0.1 leads to stable catalytic activity. Higher Mg content decreases surface acidity but also reduces specific surface area, which can negatively impact catalytic performance.

The electronic structure is indirectly influenced by the Mg modification, as it reduces surface acidity. This decrease in acidity leads to easier desorption of olefins from the catalyst surface, reducing carbon formation and improving catalyst stability.

Key challenges identified include:
1. Balancing surface acidity and basicity to optimize olefin desorption and minimize coking.
2. Maintaining high specific surface area while modifying the support.
3. Ensuring proper dispersion of active species (VOx) on the support.
4. Optimizing the interaction between the active species and the support to maintain high activity and selectivity.

The study demonstrates that catalyst performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is a complex interplay between support properties, active species dispersion, and surface chemistry. While it doesn't directly address theoretical modeling or process optimization, it highlights the importance of carefully tuning catalyst composition and properties to achieve desired performance characteristics.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于氧化镍基催化剂和理论建模的部分。然而，它确实为使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙苯到苯乙烯的氧化脱氢催化剂的制备和性能提供了一些见解。

该研究主要关注supported在氧化镁改性氧化铝上的钒-锑氧化物催化剂。制备方法包括用硝酸镁溶液浸渍活性氧化铝，然后进行煅烧和钒、锑前体的浸渍。

掺杂浓度，特别是Mg/Al比率，显著影响催化剂性能。最佳的Mg/Al比率为0.1，可以导致稳定的催化活性。较高的Mg含量会降低表面酸度，但也会降低比表面积，这可能会对催化性能产生负面影响。

电子结构间接受到Mg改性的影响，因为它降低了表面酸度。这种酸度的降低导致烯烃更容易从催化剂表面脱附，减少了碳的形成并提高了催化剂的稳定性。

识别出的关键挑战包括：
1. 平衡表面酸度和碱度，以优化烯烃脱附并最小化结焦。
2. 在改性支撑体的同时保持高比表面积。
3. 确保活性物种（VOx）在支撑体上的适当分散。
4. 优化活性物种与支撑体之间的相互作用，以保持高活性和选择性。

该研究表明，氧化脱氢反应中的催化剂性能是支撑体性质、活性物种分散和表面化学之间复杂相互作用的结果。虽然它没有直接涉及理论建模或过程优化，但它强调了仔细调整催化剂组成和性质以实现所需性能特征的重要性。
