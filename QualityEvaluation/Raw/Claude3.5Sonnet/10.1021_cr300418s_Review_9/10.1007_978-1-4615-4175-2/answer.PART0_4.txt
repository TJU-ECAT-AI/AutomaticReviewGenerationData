Unfortunately, this document does not contain any specific information about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions like ethylbenzene to styrene or ethane to ethylene. The text appears to be a general overview of selective oxidation by heterogeneous catalysis, but does not go into the level of detail required to answer this specific question about nickel oxide catalysts. The document also does not discuss the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity and safety for these particular catalytic systems.

遗憾的是,这篇文档并未包含任何关于氧化镍基催化剂的具体信息,包括它们的制备方法、掺杂浓度、空位形成,或它们对氧化脱氢反应(如乙苯到苯乙烯或乙烷到乙烯)中电子结构和催化性能的影响。这篇文章似乎是对选择性氧化的异相催化的一个概述,但并未深入到回答这个关于氧化镍催化剂的具体问题所需的详细程度。该文档也没有讨论这些特定催化系统在理论建模、工艺优化或平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的挑战。
