[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

[3] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[4] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[5] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[6] "Such electrophilic species have been shown to be able to cleave the first CH bond of a light alkane molecule leading to a radical from whom a second hydrogen can rapidly be abstracted"

[7] "NiO presents a high surface content of Othat makes it a very active but unselective catalyst to oxidize ethane. It is thus important to reduce their concentration at the surface of the active phase in order to limit this total oxidation."

[8] "Lemonidou and coworker have proposed that the substitution of Ni by Nb cations in NiNbO catalysts reduced the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the electrophilic Ospecies concentration"

[9] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation methods: NiNbO catalysts are prepared with various Nb contents (0-19%). The use of ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduces oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition, reduce NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and affect catalytic properties.

2. Dopant concentrations: A small percentage of Nb is sufficient to induce catalytic effects, with optimal activity observed at 15% Nb content. This is related to a decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

3. Vacancy formation: NiO is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes (p+) as main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple. The substitution of Ni by Nb cations in NiNbO catalysts reduces NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the concentration of electrophilic O- species.

4. Electronic structure: The presence of electrophilic O- species at the surface of NiO is crucial for the catalytic activity. These species can cleave the first C-H bond of light alkane molecules, initiating the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

5. Catalytic performance: The efficiency of NiNbO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is related to the presence of dispersed O- species at the surface of NiO in an amount high enough to convert ethane sufficiently but low enough to avoid total oxidation.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the optimal dopant concentrations and their effects on the electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the reduction of O- species concentration to limit total oxidation while maintaining sufficient activity for ethane conversion.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high ethane conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity towards ethylene production.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with operating at high temperatures and with flammable gas mixtures.

5. Catalyst stability: Addressing the continuous deactivation of catalysts over time, which is attributed to the formation of inactive phases and reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：NiNbO催化剂的制备采用不同的Nb含量（0-19%）。使用铌酸铵草酸盐作为铌前体引入草酸根离子，其热分解会降低NiO的氧过量化学计量比，从而影响催化性能。

2. 掺杂浓度：少量的Nb就足以产生催化效果，最佳活性观察到的Nb含量为15%。这与非晶态Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

3. 空位形成：NiO是一种p型半导体氧化物，其主要载流子为正孔（p+），与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对相关。在NiNbO催化剂中用Nb阳离子替代Ni可以降低NiO的氧过量化学计量比，从而降低亲电性O-物种的浓度。

4. 电子结构：NiO表面亲电性O-物种的存在对催化活性至关重要。这些物种可以裂解轻烷烃分子的第一个C-H键，从而启动氧化脱氢过程。

5. 催化性能：NiNbO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的效率与NiO表面分散的O-物种的存在有关，其含量要足够高以充分转化乙烷，但又要足够低以避免完全氧化。

这些催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型来预测最佳掺杂浓度及其对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡O-物种浓度的降低以限制完全氧化，同时保持足够的乙烷转化活性。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持高乙烯生成选择性的同时实现高乙烷转化率。

4. 安全性：管理在高温和易燃气体混合物条件下操作的潜在风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：解决催化剂随时间持续失活的问题，这归因于非活性相的形成和NiO氧过量化学计量比的降低。
