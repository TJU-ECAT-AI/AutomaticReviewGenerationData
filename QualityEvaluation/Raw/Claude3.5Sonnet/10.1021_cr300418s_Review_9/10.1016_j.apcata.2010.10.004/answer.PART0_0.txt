[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion, which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[6] "A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For NiNbO catalysts used in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Preparation method: Using ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduces oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition reduce NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties.

2. Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb drastically increase conversion compared to pure NiO. Conversion increases with Nb content, reaching a maximum at Ni0.85Nb0.15, then decreases.

3. Vacancy formation: Nb spreads on the NiO surface, reducing accessible O- species. This decrease in strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species leads to high ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb and NiO, and how they affect oxygen vacancy formation and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing Nb content to maximize conversion and selectivity while preventing the formation of inactive NiNb2O6 phase.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high catalytic activity while ensuring high selectivity to desired products.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with operating at high temperatures and using oxygen-rich feed streams.

5. Catalyst stability: Preventing deactivation caused by the formation of NiNb2O6 and reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry over time.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

对于用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiNbO催化剂：

1. 制备方法：使用草酸铌铵作为铌前体引入草酸根离子，其热分解会降低NiO的氧过量化学计量比，从而影响催化性能。

2. 掺杂浓度：少量的Nb就能显著提高转化率。随着Nb含量的增加，转化率增加，在Ni0.85Nb0.15时达到最大值，然后下降。

3. 空位形成：Nb在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种。这种强氧化亲电氧物种的减少导致了高的乙烯选择性。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用，以及它们如何影响氧空位的形成和催化性能。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb含量以最大化转化率和选择性，同时防止形成无活性的NiNb2O6相。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高催化活性的同时确保对目标产物的高选择性。

4. 安全性：管理在高温下操作和使用富氧进料流的潜在风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：防止因NiNb2O6的形成和NiO氧过量化学计量比随时间的减少而导致的失活。

这些挑战突出了需要进一步研究，以开发更稳定和高效的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
