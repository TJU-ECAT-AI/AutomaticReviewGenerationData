[1] "Contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored"

[2] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[3] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."

[4] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[5] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. NiO is a p-type semiconductor with Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couples creating positive hole carriers. This electronic structure is crucial for its catalytic activity.

2. Adding niobium as a dopant modifies the active sites, decreasing their number but increasing their activity and selectivity for ethylene production in ethane dehydrogenation.

3. Low Nb content (up to 3-7%) spreads on the NiO surface, reducing accessible O- species and isolating the remaining ones, which become highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Higher Nb content (optimal at 15%) prevents sintering of NiO particles during preparation, increasing the catalyst's specific surface area and overall ethane conversion.

5. Oxygen vacancies play a complex role. While O- species are necessary for activating ethane, an excess of oxygen at the surface can lead to over-oxidation and decreased selectivity.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interplay between dopants, vacancies, and catalytic performance.

2. Optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, as increasing one often decreases the other.

3. Preventing catalyst deactivation, which occurs due to the formation of inactive NiNb2O6 phase and reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

4. Developing effective regeneration methods that don't compromise the catalyst's high surface area or lead to the formation of inactive phases.

5. Balancing safety concerns with efficiency, as increasing O2/C2H4 ratios to maintain catalyst activity can lead to inflammability issues.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach combining advanced characterization techniques, theoretical modeling, and process engineering to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. NiO是一种p型半导体，Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对产生正孔载流子。这种电子结构对其催化活性至关重要。

2. 添加铌作为掺杂剂可以修改活性位点，减少其数量但增加其活性和对乙烯生成的选择性（在乙烷脱氢反应中）。

3. 低浓度的Nb（高达3-7%）在NiO表面扩散，减少可接触的O-物种并隔离剩余的O-，使其对乙烷氧化脱氢具有高度选择性。

4. 较高的Nb含量（最佳为15%）可防止NiO颗粒在制备过程中烧结，增加催化剂的比表面积和总体乙烷转化率。

5. 氧空位起着复杂的作用。虽然O-物种对于活化乙烷是必要的，但表面过量的氧会导致过度氧化和选择性降低。

主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和催化性能之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化活性和选择性之间的平衡，因为增加其中一个通常会降低另一个。

3. 防止催化剂失活，这是由于形成无活性的NiNb2O6相和NiO氧过量化学计量的减少而导致的。

4. 开发有效的再生方法，不损害催化剂的高比表面积或导致无活性相的形成。

5. 平衡安全concerns和效率，因为增加O2/C2H4比以维持催化剂活性可能会导致易燃性问题。

这些挑战需要结合先进的表征技术、理论建模和过程工程的多学科方法，以开发更稳定和高效的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
