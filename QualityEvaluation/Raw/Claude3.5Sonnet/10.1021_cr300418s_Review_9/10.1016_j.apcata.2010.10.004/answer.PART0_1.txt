[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "The efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

[4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[5] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[6] "Such electrophilic species have been shown to be able to cleave the first CH bond of a light alkane molecule leading to a radical from whom a second hydrogen can rapidly be abstracted"

[7] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

NiNbO catalysts with varying Nb contents (0-19%) were studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. The catalysts' efficiency was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

The use of ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduced oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition, induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry. This reduction influenced the catalytic properties.

NiO is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes as main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple. These electrophilic species can cleave the first C-H bond of light alkane molecules, leading to radical formation and subsequent hydrogen abstraction.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between the NiO active phase, Nb dopant, and oxygen vacancies.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the Nb content to achieve optimal conversion and selectivity while preventing the formation of inactive phases like NiNb2O6.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high catalytic activity while improving selectivity towards desired products (e.g., ethylene).

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with operating at high temperatures and controlling the O2/C2H4 ratio to avoid reaching the domain of inflammability.

5. Catalyst stability: Addressing the continuous deactivation observed over time, which is attributed to the formation of NiNb2O6 and the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

6. Regeneration: Developing effective methods to regenerate the catalysts without compromising their specific surface area or promoting the formation of inactive phases.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

研究了含有不同Nb含量（0-19%）的NiNbO催化剂用于乙烷的氧化脱氢。即使少量的Nb也能导致转化率相对于纯镍氧化物大幅提高。催化剂的效率与NiO活性相和无定形Nb2O5相之间的表面相互作用有关。

使用铵草酸铌作为铌前体引入了草酸根离子，其热分解导致NiO氧过量化学计量减少。这种减少影响了催化性能。

NiO是一种p型半导体氧化物，其主要载流子为正空穴，与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原偶相关。这些亲电物种能够断裂轻烃分子的第一个C-H键，导致自由基形成和随后的氢抽提。

这些催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测NiO活性相、Nb掺杂剂和氧空位之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb含量以实现最佳转化率和选择性，同时防止形成NiNb2O6等无活性相。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高催化活性的同时提高对目标产物（如乙烯）的选择性。

4. 安全性：管理高温操作的潜在风险，控制O2/C2H4比以避免达到可燃性区域。

5. 催化剂稳定性：解决长时间运行中观察到的持续失活问题，这归因于NiNb2O6的形成和NiO氧过量化学计量的减少。

6. 再生：开发有效的催化剂再生方法，同时不影响其比表面积或促进无活性相的形成。
