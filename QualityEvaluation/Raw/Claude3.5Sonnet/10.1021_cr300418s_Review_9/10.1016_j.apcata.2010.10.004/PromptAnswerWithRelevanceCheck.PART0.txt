[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion, which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[6] "A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For NiNbO catalysts used in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Preparation method: Using ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduces oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition reduce NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, influencing catalytic properties.

2. Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb drastically increase conversion compared to pure NiO. Conversion increases with Nb content, reaching a maximum at Ni0.85Nb0.15, then decreases.

3. Vacancy formation: Nb spreads on the NiO surface, reducing accessible O- species. This decrease in strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species leads to high ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb and NiO, and how they affect oxygen vacancy formation and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing Nb content to maximize conversion and selectivity while preventing the formation of inactive NiNb2O6 phase.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high catalytic activity while ensuring high selectivity to desired products.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with operating at high temperatures and using oxygen-rich feed streams.

5. Catalyst stability: Preventing deactivation caused by the formation of NiNb2O6 and reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry over time.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

对于用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiNbO催化剂：

1. 制备方法：使用草酸铌铵作为铌前体引入草酸根离子，其热分解会降低NiO的氧过量化学计量比，从而影响催化性能。

2. 掺杂浓度：少量的Nb就能显著提高转化率。随着Nb含量的增加，转化率增加，在Ni0.85Nb0.15时达到最大值，然后下降。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用，以及它们如何影响氧空位的形成和催化性能。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb含量以最大化转化率和选择性，同时防止形成无活性的NiNb2O6相。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高催化活性的同时确保对目标产物的高选择性。

4. 安全性：管理在高温下操作和使用富氧进料流的潜在风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：防止因NiNb2O6的形成和NiO氧过量化学计量比随时间的减少而导致的失活。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

NiNbO catalysts with varying Nb contents (0-19%) were studied for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. The catalysts' efficiency was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

The use of ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduced oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition, induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry. This reduction influenced the catalytic properties.

NiO is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes as main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple. These electrophilic species can cleave the first C-H bond of light alkane molecules, leading to radical formation and subsequent hydrogen abstraction.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between the NiO active phase, Nb dopant, and oxygen vacancies.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the Nb content to achieve optimal conversion and selectivity while preventing the formation of inactive phases like NiNb2O6.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high catalytic activity while improving selectivity towards desired products (e.g., ethylene).

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with operating at high temperatures and controlling the O2/C2H4 ratio to avoid reaching the domain of inflammability.

5. Catalyst stability: Addressing the continuous deactivation observed over time, which is attributed to the formation of NiNb2O6 and the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

6. Regeneration: Developing effective methods to regenerate the catalysts without compromising their specific surface area or promoting the formation of inactive phases.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

研究了含有不同Nb含量（0-19%）的NiNbO催化剂用于乙烷的氧化脱氢。即使少量的Nb也能导致转化率相对于纯镍氧化物大幅提高。催化剂的效率与NiO活性相和无定形Nb2O5相之间的表面相互作用有关。

使用铵草酸铌作为铌前体引入了草酸根离子，其热分解导致NiO氧过量化学计量减少。这种减少影响了催化性能。

NiO是一种p型半导体氧化物，其主要载流子为正空穴，与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原偶相关。这些亲电物种能够断裂轻烃分子的第一个C-H键，导致自由基形成和随后的氢抽提。

这些催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测NiO活性相、Nb掺杂剂和氧空位之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb含量以实现最佳转化率和选择性，同时防止形成NiNb2O6等无活性相。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高催化活性的同时提高对目标产物（如乙烯）的选择性。

4. 安全性：管理高温操作的潜在风险，控制O2/C2H4比以避免达到可燃性区域。

5. 催化剂稳定性：解决长时间运行中观察到的持续失活问题，这归因于NiNb2O6的形成和NiO氧过量化学计量的减少。

6. 再生：开发有效的催化剂再生方法，同时不影响其比表面积或促进无活性相的形成。

[3] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."

[4] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. NiO is a p-type semiconductor with Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couples creating positive hole carriers. This electronic structure is crucial for its catalytic activity.

2. Adding niobium as a dopant modifies the active sites, decreasing their number but increasing their activity and selectivity for ethylene production in ethane dehydrogenation.

3. Low Nb content (up to 3-7%) spreads on the NiO surface, reducing accessible O- species and isolating the remaining ones, which become highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Higher Nb content (optimal at 15%) prevents sintering of NiO particles during preparation, increasing the catalyst's specific surface area and overall ethane conversion.

5. Oxygen vacancies play a complex role. While O- species are necessary for activating ethane, an excess of oxygen at the surface can lead to over-oxidation and decreased selectivity.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interplay between dopants, vacancies, and catalytic performance.

2. Optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, as increasing one often decreases the other.

3. Preventing catalyst deactivation, which occurs due to the formation of inactive NiNb2O6 phase and reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

4. Developing effective regeneration methods that don't compromise the catalyst's high surface area or lead to the formation of inactive phases.

5. Balancing safety concerns with efficiency, as increasing O2/C2H4 ratios to maintain catalyst activity can lead to inflammability issues.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach combining advanced characterization techniques, theoretical modeling, and process engineering to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. NiO是一种p型半导体，Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对产生正孔载流子。这种电子结构对其催化活性至关重要。

2. 添加铌作为掺杂剂可以修改活性位点，减少其数量但增加其活性和对乙烯生成的选择性（在乙烷脱氢反应中）。

3. 低浓度的Nb（高达3-7%）在NiO表面扩散，减少可接触的O-物种并隔离剩余的O-，使其对乙烷氧化脱氢具有高度选择性。

4. 较高的Nb含量（最佳为15%）可防止NiO颗粒在制备过程中烧结，增加催化剂的比表面积和总体乙烷转化率。

5. 氧空位起着复杂的作用。虽然O-物种对于活化乙烷是必要的，但表面过量的氧会导致过度氧化和选择性降低。

主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和催化性能之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化活性和选择性之间的平衡，因为增加其中一个通常会降低另一个。

3. 防止催化剂失活，这是由于形成无活性的NiNb2O6相和NiO氧过量化学计量的减少而导致的。

4. 开发有效的再生方法，不损害催化剂的高比表面积或导致无活性相的形成。

5. 平衡安全concerns和效率，因为增加O2/C2H4比以维持催化剂活性可能会导致易燃性问题。

这些挑战需要结合先进的表征技术、理论建模和过程工程的多学科方法，以开发更稳定和高效的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Small amounts of niobium (Nb) as a dopant drastically increase conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. The optimal activity was observed at 15% Nb content, which is related to a decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

Nb spreads at the surface of the NiO phase, reducing the amount of accessible O- species. This decrease in strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species leads to high selectivity to ethylene, as these species can activate C-H bonds of ethane at moderate temperatures.

The catalytic efficiency is related to the presence of dispersed O- species on the NiO surface in an amount high enough to convert ethane sufficiently but low enough to avoid total oxidation.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the NiO surface.

2. Process optimization to maintain the optimal balance of O- species for high conversion and selectivity.

3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity while ensuring safety, as the reaction involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen.

4. Preventing catalyst deactivation, which occurs due to the formation of inactive phases (e.g., NiNb2O6) and reduction of oxygen over-stoichiometry in NiO.

5. Developing effective regeneration methods for deactivated catalysts without compromising their structural properties and catalytic performance.
