[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."

[6] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Small amounts of niobium (Nb) as a dopant drastically increase conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. The optimal activity was observed at 15% Nb content, which is related to a decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

Nb spreads at the surface of the NiO phase, reducing the amount of accessible O- species. This decrease in strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species leads to high selectivity to ethylene, as these species can activate C-H bonds of ethane at moderate temperatures.

The catalytic efficiency is related to the presence of dispersed O- species on the NiO surface in an amount high enough to convert ethane sufficiently but low enough to avoid total oxidation.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the NiO surface.

2. Process optimization to maintain the optimal balance of O- species for high conversion and selectivity.

3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity while ensuring safety, as the reaction involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen.

4. Preventing catalyst deactivation, which occurs due to the formation of inactive phases (e.g., NiNb2O6) and reduction of oxygen over-stoichiometry in NiO.

5. Developing effective regeneration methods for deactivated catalysts without compromising their structural properties and catalytic performance.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

少量的铌(Nb)作为掺杂剂可以显著提高转化率，相比纯镍氧化物。最佳活性观察到在15%的Nb含量，这与非晶态Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

Nb在NiO相表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种数量。这种强氧化亲电氧物种的减少导致了对乙烯的高选择性，因为这些物种能在中等温度下活化乙烷的C-H键。

催化效率与NiO表面分散的O-物种的存在有关，其数量要足够高以充分转化乙烷，但又要足够低以避免完全氧化。

主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和NiO表面之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化过程以维持O-物种的最佳平衡，以获得高转化率和选择性。

3. 在保证安全的同时平衡效率和选择性，因为反应涉及易燃烃类和氧气。

4. 防止催化剂失活，这是由于形成无活性相（如NiNb2O6）和NiO中氧过量化学计量的降低造成的。

5. 开发有效的失活催化剂再生方法，同时不损害其结构特性和催化性能。
