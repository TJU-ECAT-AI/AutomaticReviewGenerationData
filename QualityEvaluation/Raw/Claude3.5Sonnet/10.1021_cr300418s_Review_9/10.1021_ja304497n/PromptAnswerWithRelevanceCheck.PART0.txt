Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, electronic structure, or catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be about chromium-doped magnesium oxide and molybdenum-doped calcium oxide, which are different materials and systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered using the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be about transition metal doping in MgO and CaO, which is unrelated to the specific catalytic system and reactions mentioned in the question. There is no data provided on preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, electronic structure, or catalytic performance for nickel oxide catalysts. The question cannot be answered based on the limited information in this literature excerpt.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, electronic structure, or catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be about transition metal doping in different oxides (Cr-doped MgO and Mo-doped CaO) and does not mention nickel oxide or the specific reactions asked about. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
