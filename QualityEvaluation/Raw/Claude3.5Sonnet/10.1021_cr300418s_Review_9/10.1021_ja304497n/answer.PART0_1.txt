The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be about transition metal doping in MgO and CaO, which is unrelated to the specific catalytic system and reactions mentioned in the question. There is no data provided on preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, electronic structure, or catalytic performance for nickel oxide catalysts. The question cannot be answered based on the limited information in this literature excerpt.
