[1] "This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "In all mixed oxides, with the exception of Ta, the dopants modify the NiO lattice, which contracts or expands depending on the radius of the cation, indication for the formation of solid solutions."

[3] "O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."

[4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence."

[5] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[6] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The dopants modify the NiO lattice by forming solid solutions, which affects the non-stoichiometric oxygen content and the lability of oxygen species. Higher valence dopants reduce the non-stoichiometric oxygen and decrease the lability of oxygen species, which leads to enhanced selectivity in ethane ODH reactions.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between dopants and the NiO lattice, and how these affect the electronic structure and catalytic properties.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the dopant type and concentration to achieve the desired catalytic performance.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Tuning the catalytic properties to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.

4. Safety: Ensuring the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions and minimizing the formation of potentially hazardous oxygen species.

Overall, the nature and valence of the dopant play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH reactions. By carefully selecting and optimizing the dopants, it is possible to tune the catalytic performance to achieve higher efficiency and selectivity.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

掺杂剂通过形成固溶体来修饰NiO晶格，这影响了非化学计量氧含量和氧物种的活动性。高价掺杂剂降低了非化学计量氧和氧物种的活动性，从而提高了乙烷ODH反应的选择性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用，以及这些相互作用如何影响电子结构和催化性能。

2. 过程优化：平衡掺杂剂类型和浓度，以实现所需的催化性能。

3. 效率和选择性：调节催化性能以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不希望的副反应。

4. 安全性：确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性，并最小化潜在危险氧物种的形成。

总的来说，掺杂剂的性质和价态在决定NiO在乙烷ODH反应中的催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。通过仔细选择和优化掺杂剂，可以调节催化性能以实现更高的效率和选择性。
