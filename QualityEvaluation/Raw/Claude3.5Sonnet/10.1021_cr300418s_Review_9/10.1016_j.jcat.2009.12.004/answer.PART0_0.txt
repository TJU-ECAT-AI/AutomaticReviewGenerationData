[1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."

[2] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[3] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

The preparation method, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key findings include:

1. Dopant introduction modifies both the quantity and mobility of exchanged oxygen species in NiO.

2. Catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned through doping, depending on the nature of the dopant.

3. The valence of foreign species can increase or decrease unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, affecting ethane ODH activity.

4. Solid solutions are formed when foreign metals with suitable ionic radii are introduced into the NiO structure.

5. Higher valence dopants create more positive charge in the NiO lattice, resulting in fewer oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in this area likely include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex dopant-NiO interactions and their effects on catalytic performance.

2. Optimizing process conditions to maximize efficiency and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.

3. Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Developing scalable and cost-effective methods for catalyst preparation and optimization.

5. Ensuring safe operation of oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly when dealing with flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen mixtures.
