[1] "This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "In all mixed oxides, with the exception of Ta, the dopants modify the NiO lattice, which contracts or expands depending on the radius of the cation, indication for the formation of solid solutions."

[3] "O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."

[4] "NiO is a well-known non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic deficiency. This property renders NiO a good p-type semiconductor with its conductivity being attributed to this cation deficiency"

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study focuses on ethane to ethylene conversion and examines various dopants (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, and Ta) with different valences.

The dopants modify the NiO lattice by forming solid solutions, which affects the non-stoichiometric oxygen content and the electronic structure of the catalyst. Higher valence dopants reduce the concentration of cation vacancies and non-stoichiometric oxygen, leading to improved selectivity for ethylene production.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopants on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of NiO-based catalysts.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability while considering factors such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions and carbon oxide formation.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, which involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen at elevated temperatures.

5. Dopant selection and concentration: Identifying optimal dopants and their concentrations to achieve the desired balance of catalytic properties.

6. Characterization techniques: Developing and applying advanced methods to accurately analyze the electronic structure, oxygen species, and active sites in the catalysts.

7. Scalability: Translating laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale production while maintaining catalyst performance and process efficiency.
