[1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."

[2] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[3] "Based on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced activity in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene."

[4] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[5] "NiO is a non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies which induce the formation of p+ holes, in the form of O- ions, to maintain charge neutrality conditions."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of foreign metals into the NiO structure forms solid solutions, modifying both the quantity and mobility of exchanged oxygen species. The valence of the dopant plays a crucial role, with higher valence dopants generally leading to increased selectivity towards desired products like ethylene.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of different dopants on the electronic structure and catalytic properties of NiO-based materials.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Controlling the formation of unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals to enhance the selective conversion of reactants.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with highly oxidizing species, especially in industrial-scale applications.

5. Dopant selection: Identifying optimal dopants and concentrations to achieve the desired catalytic performance while maintaining the structural integrity of the catalyst.

Further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between dopant properties, catalyst structure, and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。将外来金属引入NiO结构形成固溶体，改变了交换氧物种的数量和迁移性。掺杂剂的价态起着至关重要的作用，价态较高的掺杂剂通常会导致对所需产物（如乙烯）的选择性增加。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测不同掺杂剂对NiO基材料电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：控制非选择性亲电氧自由基的形成，以增强反应物的选择性转化。

4. 安全性：管理与高度氧化物种相关的潜在风险，特别是在工业规模应用中。

5. 掺杂剂选择：确定最佳掺杂剂和浓度，以实现所需的催化性能，同时保持催化剂的结构完整性。

需要进一步研究以充分理解氧化脱氢反应中掺杂剂性质、催化剂结构和催化性能之间的复杂关系。
