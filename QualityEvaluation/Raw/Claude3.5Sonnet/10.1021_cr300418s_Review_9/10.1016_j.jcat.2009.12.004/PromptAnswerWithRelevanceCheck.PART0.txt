The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The evaporation method is used to prepare NiMeO mixed oxides with a specific Me/Ni atomic ratio. Pure NiO is a non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic deficiency, which makes it a p-type semiconductor.

When foreign metals are introduced into the NiO structure, they form solid solutions if their ionic radii allow them to insert into the host lattice. The valence of the dopant plays a crucial role in determining the electronic structure and catalytic properties:

1. Lower valence dopants (e.g., Li+) create extra negative charge, inducing the formation of O- species to maintain neutrality.
2. Higher valence dopants (e.g., Nb5+) introduce extra positive charge, reducing surface defects and eliminating electrophilic oxygen species.

These changes in the electronic structure directly impact the catalytic performance. Higher valence dopants generally lead to higher selectivity for the desired product (e.g., ethylene in ethane ODH). For example, NiNb exhibits the highest selectivity (90%), while NiLi shows the lowest (19%).

The key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of different dopants on the electronic structure and catalytic properties.
2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts.
3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing the yield of desired products while minimizing side reactions and total oxidation.
4. Safety: Controlling the exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to prevent runaway reactions and hotspots.

To address these challenges, researchers need to develop more sophisticated models that account for the complex interactions between dopants, oxygen species, and reactants. Additionally, advanced characterization techniques and in-situ studies are crucial for understanding the dynamic nature of the catalysts under reaction conditions. Finally, reactor design and process engineering play vital roles in optimizing the overall performance and safety of these catalytic systems.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能在氧化脱氢反应中有显著影响。采用蒸发法制备具有特定Me/Ni原子比的NiMeO混合氧化物。纯NiO是一种具有阳离子缺陷的非化学计量氧化物，这使其成为p型半导体。

当将外来金属引入NiO结构时，如果它们的离子半径允许它们插入主晶格，就会形成固溶体。掺杂剂的价态在决定电子结构和催化性能方面起着关键作用：

1. 低价掺杂剂（如Li+）产生额外的负电荷，诱导形成O-物种以维持中性。
2. 高价掺杂剂（如Nb5+）引入额外的正电荷，减少表面缺陷并消除亲电氧物种。

这些电子结构的变化直接影响催化性能。高价掺杂剂通常会导致目标产物（如乙烷ODH中的乙烯）的选择性更高。例如，NiNb表现出最高的选择性（90%），而NiLi表现出最低的选择性（19%）。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测不同掺杂剂对电子结构和催化性能的影响。
2. 过程优化：平衡催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。
3. 效率和选择性：最大化目标产物的产率，同时最小化副反应和完全氧化。
4. 安全性：控制氧化脱氢反应的放热性质，防止失控反应和热点。

为了应对这些挑战，研究人员需要开发更复杂的模型，考虑掺杂剂、氧物种和反应物之间的复杂相互作用。此外，先进的表征技术和原位研究对于理解催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性至关重要。最后，反应器设计和过程工程在优化这些催化系统的整体性能和安全性方面发挥着至关重要的作用。
