[1] "NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."

[3] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[4] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[5] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[6] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[7] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The sol-gel method is used to prepare Zr-doped NiO catalysts, involving citric acid, metal nitrates, and calcination at 450°C. This method produces catalysts with high specific surface areas, which increase with Zr doping.

Dopant concentrations: Zr-doping in NiO improves catalyst performance. 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO show similar ethylene selectivities, all higher than undoped NiO. The optimal doping level appears to be around 10% Zr, balancing improved selectivity with maintained activity.

Vacancy formation: NiO prepared at 450°C contains Ni vacancies, which create hole carriers and p-type conductivity. These vacancies affect the oxide's electronic structure and oxidizing capability.

Catalytic performance: Zr-doped NiO catalysts show improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to undoped NiO. For instance, at 50% ethane conversion, 10ZrNiO shows 66% ethylene selectivity compared to 47% for undoped NiO.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting catalyst behavior without specific calculations is difficult due to the complexity of possible reaction mechanisms (e.g., Mars-van Krevelen vs. adsorbed oxygen species).

2. Process optimization: Balancing dopant concentration, preparation methods, and reaction conditions to maximize both activity and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving ethylene yield while minimizing complete oxidation to CO2.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with using oxygen in the reaction feed, particularly at higher temperatures and conversions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：采用溶胶-凝胶法制备Zr掺杂NiO催化剂，涉及柠檬酸、金属硝酸盐和450°C煅烧。这种方法制备的催化剂具有高比表面积，且随Zr掺杂量增加而增加。

掺杂浓度：NiO中的Zr掺杂改善了催化剂性能。5ZrNiO、10ZrNiO和20ZrNiO显示相似的乙烯选择性，均高于未掺杂NiO。最佳掺杂水平似乎在10%Zr左右，平衡了提高的选择性和保持的活性。

空位形成：在450°C制备的NiO含有Ni空位，这些空位产生空穴载流子和p型导电性。这些空位影响氧化物的电子结构和氧化能力。

催化性能：与未掺杂NiO相比，Zr掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出更高的乙烯选择性。例如，在50%乙烷转化率下，10ZrNiO的乙烯选择性为66%，而未掺杂NiO为47%。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：由于可能的反应机理复杂（如Mars-van Krevelen机理vs.吸附氧物种），在没有特定计算的情况下准确预测催化剂行为很困难。

2. 过程优化：平衡掺杂浓度、制备方法和反应条件，以最大化活性和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：提高乙烯产率，同时最小化完全氧化为CO2的反应。

4. 安全性：管理反应进料中使用氧气的潜在风险，特别是在较高温度和转化率下。
