[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[3] "While 5ZrNiO and 10ZrNiO consist of one phase with the NiO structure, 20ZrNiO consists of a phase with NiO structure and a second phase which is ZrO2."

[4] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: NiO prepared at different temperatures exhibits different properties. NiO prepared at 700°C is stoichiometric and green, while NiO prepared at 450°C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor. The sol-gel method produces NiO with a high specific surface area.

Dopant concentrations: Doping NiO with Zr increases the specific surface area. The structure of the catalyst depends on the Zr concentration. At lower concentrations (5-10%), a single phase with NiO structure is formed, while at higher concentrations (20%), a two-phase system of NiO structure and ZrO2 is observed.

Vacancy formation: Ni vacancies in NiO prepared at lower temperatures contribute to its p-type conductivity and affect its catalytic properties.

Catalytic performance: Zr-doping improves the selectivity to ethylene in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It makes the oxide less reducible and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which affects the reaction mechanism.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity.

2. Process optimization: Balancing conversion and selectivity by controlling dopant concentrations and preparation methods.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving catalyst stability and performance while maintaining high selectivity.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with using oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, especially at higher temperatures.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：在不同温度下制备的NiO表现出不同的性质。700°C制备的NiO化学计量比准确且呈绿色，而450°C制备的NiO呈黑色，有Ni空位，是p型导体。溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiO具有高比表面积。

掺杂浓度：用Zr掺杂NiO会增加比表面积。催化剂的结构取决于Zr的浓度。在较低浓度（5-10%）下，形成具有NiO结构的单相，而在较高浓度（20%）下，观察到NiO结构和ZrO2的两相系统。

空位形成：在较低温度下制备的NiO中的Ni空位促进了其p型导电性，并影响其催化性能。

催化性能：Zr掺杂改善了氧化脱氢反应中乙烯的选择性。它使氧化物不易还原，并使表面氧结合更紧密，从而影响反应机理。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂剂和空位对电子结构和反应活性的影响。

2. 工艺优化：通过控制掺杂浓度和制备方法来平衡转化率和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持高选择性的同时提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。

4. 安全性：管理在氧化脱氢反应中使用氧气的风险，特别是在较高温度下。
