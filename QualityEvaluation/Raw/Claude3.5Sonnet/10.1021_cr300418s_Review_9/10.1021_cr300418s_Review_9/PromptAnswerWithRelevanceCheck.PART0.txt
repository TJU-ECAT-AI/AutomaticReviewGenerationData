[1] "NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material."

[3] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[4] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[5] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[6] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[7] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The sol-gel method is used to prepare Zr-doped NiO catalysts, involving citric acid, metal nitrates, and calcination at 450°C. This method produces catalysts with high specific surface areas, which increase with Zr doping.

Dopant concentrations: Zr-doping in NiO improves catalyst performance. 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO show similar ethylene selectivities, all higher than undoped NiO. The optimal doping level appears to be around 10% Zr, balancing improved selectivity with maintained activity.

Vacancy formation: NiO prepared at 450°C contains Ni vacancies, which create hole carriers and p-type conductivity. These vacancies affect the oxide's electronic structure and oxidizing capability.

Catalytic performance: Zr-doped NiO catalysts show improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to undoped NiO. For instance, at 50% ethane conversion, 10ZrNiO shows 66% ethylene selectivity compared to 47% for undoped NiO.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting catalyst behavior without specific calculations is difficult due to the complexity of possible reaction mechanisms (e.g., Mars-van Krevelen vs. adsorbed oxygen species).

2. Process optimization: Balancing dopant concentration, preparation methods, and reaction conditions to maximize both activity and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving ethylene yield while minimizing complete oxidation to CO2.

4. Safety: Managing the potential risks associated with using oxygen in the reaction feed, particularly at higher temperatures and conversions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：采用溶胶-凝胶法制备Zr掺杂NiO催化剂，涉及柠檬酸、金属硝酸盐和450°C煅烧。这种方法制备的催化剂具有高比表面积，且随Zr掺杂量增加而增加。

掺杂浓度：NiO中的Zr掺杂改善了催化剂性能。5ZrNiO、10ZrNiO和20ZrNiO显示相似的乙烯选择性，均高于未掺杂NiO。最佳掺杂水平似乎在10%Zr左右，平衡了提高的选择性和保持的活性。

空位形成：在450°C制备的NiO含有Ni空位，这些空位产生空穴载流子和p型导电性。这些空位影响氧化物的电子结构和氧化能力。

催化性能：与未掺杂NiO相比，Zr掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出更高的乙烯选择性。例如，在50%乙烷转化率下，10ZrNiO的乙烯选择性为66%，而未掺杂NiO为47%。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：由于可能的反应机理复杂（如Mars-van Krevelen机理vs.吸附氧物种），在没有特定计算的情况下准确预测催化剂行为很困难。

2. 过程优化：平衡掺杂浓度、制备方法和反应条件，以最大化活性和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：提高乙烯产率，同时最小化完全氧化为CO2的反应。

4. 安全性：管理反应进料中使用氧气的潜在风险，特别是在较高温度和转化率下。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: NiO prepared at different temperatures exhibits different properties. NiO prepared at 700°C is stoichiometric and green, while NiO prepared at 450°C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor. The sol-gel method produces NiO with a high specific surface area.

Dopant concentrations: Doping NiO with Zr increases the specific surface area. The structure of the catalyst depends on the Zr concentration. At lower concentrations (5-10%), a single phase with NiO structure is formed, while at higher concentrations (20%), a two-phase system of NiO structure and ZrO2 is observed.

Vacancy formation: Ni vacancies in NiO prepared at lower temperatures contribute to its p-type conductivity and affect its catalytic properties.

Catalytic performance: Zr-doping improves the selectivity to ethylene in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It makes the oxide less reducible and binds surface oxygen more strongly, which affects the reaction mechanism.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and reactivity.

2. Process optimization: Balancing conversion and selectivity by controlling dopant concentrations and preparation methods.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving catalyst stability and performance while maintaining high selectivity.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with using oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, especially at higher temperatures.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The sol-gel method used to prepare Zr-doped NiO results in a high specific surface area, which increases with Zr doping. The calcination temperature affects the stoichiometry and vacancy formation in NiO, with 450°C producing a non-stoichiometric, p-conducting NiO with Ni vacancies.

Dopant concentrations: Zr-doped NiO shows improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH compared to undoped NiO. The optimal Zr concentration appears to be around 10%, as 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO show similar selectivities.

Vacancy formation: Ni vacancies in NiO prepared at 450°C contribute to its p-type conductivity and catalytic activity. Zr doping affects the vacancy formation and oxygen binding, leading to improved selectivity but potentially reduced activity.

Key challenges:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately describing NiO using DFT is challenging, with uncertainties in the results. PBE+U with specific U values is used, but only trends can be reliably interpreted.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity is crucial. While Zr doping improves selectivity, it may reduce overall activity by increasing the temperature required for hydrogen consumption.

3. Efficiency, selectivity, and safety: Achieving high ethylene yields while maintaining selectivity and preventing over-oxidation is a significant challenge. The use of oxygen as an oxidant introduces safety concerns, requiring careful control of the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratio to prevent explosion risks.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation temperature affects the stoichiometry and conductivity of NiO. NiO prepared at 450°C contains Ni vacancies and exhibits p-type conductivity, while NiO prepared at 700°C is stoichiometric. The sol-gel method produces NiO with high specific surface area, which is further increased by Zr doping.

Dopant concentration plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Zr-doped NiO (5-20% Zr) shows higher ethylene selectivity compared to undoped NiO in ethane ODH reactions. The optimal Zr concentration appears to be around 10%, balancing improved selectivity with maintained conversion rates.

Vacancy formation, particularly Ni vacancies in NiO, affects the oxide's oxidizing power. Zr doping can counteract this effect by filling these vacancies, thereby modulating the catalyst's reactivity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting catalyst behavior without specific calculations for each system is difficult, as multiple reaction mechanisms are possible.

2. Process optimization: Balancing conversion rates and selectivity is crucial. While Zr doping improves selectivity, it may decrease overall conversion rates.

3. Efficiency and safety: Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involve flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen, requiring careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosions while maintaining efficiency.

4. Catalyst stability: Ensuring long-term stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is essential for industrial applications.

5. Mechanistic understanding: Determining the exact reaction mechanism (e.g., Mars-van Krevelen vs. adsorbed oxygen species) is challenging but necessary for rational catalyst design.

These challenges highlight the need for combined experimental and theoretical approaches to develop improved catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods affect the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. NiO prepared at different temperatures exhibits distinct characteristics - stoichiometric at 700°C and non-stoichiometric with Ni vacancies at 450°C. The sol-gel method produces NiO with high specific surface area, which is further increased by Zr doping.

Dopant concentrations play a crucial role in modifying the catalyst structure and performance. For instance, Zr-doped NiO shows improved selectivity and overall performance in ethane ODH, with 10ZrNiO demonstrating the best results. The dopant concentration affects the phase composition, with higher concentrations leading to the formation of separate oxide phases.

Vacancy formation, particularly Ni vacancies in NiO, influences the electronic structure by creating p-type conductivity. These vacancies can act as active sites for catalysis, but their effects can be modulated by dopants.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately describing the electronic structure of doped oxides, especially for systems like NiO where DFT calculations face difficulties. Process optimization involves balancing various factors such as temperature, dopant concentration, and preparation method to achieve the desired catalytic performance.

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remains a significant challenge. While doping can improve selectivity, it may reduce overall conversion. Safety concerns, particularly in ODH reactions using oxygen, limit the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used, affecting process efficiency.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的物理和化学性质。在不同温度下制备的NiO表现出不同的特性 - 700°C时为化学计量比，450°C时为非化学计量比且有Ni空位。溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiO具有高比表面积，通过Zr掺杂可进一步增加。

掺杂浓度在改变催化剂结构和性能方面起着关键作用。例如，Zr掺杂的NiO在乙烷ODH中表现出改善的选择性和整体性能，其中10ZrNiO展示了最佳结果。掺杂浓度影响相组成，高浓度会导致单独氧化物相的形成。

空位形成，特别是NiO中的Ni空位，通过产生p型导电性影响电子结构。这些空位可以作为催化活性位点，但其效果可以通过掺杂剂调节。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确描述掺杂氧化物的电子结构，特别是对于NiO这样DFT计算面临困难的系统。工艺优化涉及平衡温度、掺杂浓度和制备方法等各种因素，以实现所需的催化性能。

在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性仍然是一个重大挑战。虽然掺杂可以提高选择性，但可能会降低整体转化率。安全考虑，特别是在使用氧气的ODH反应中，限制了可使用的氧气/烃比，影响了工艺效率。
