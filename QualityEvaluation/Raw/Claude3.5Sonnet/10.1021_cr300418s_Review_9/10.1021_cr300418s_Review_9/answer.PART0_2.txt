[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[3] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[4] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[6] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The sol-gel method used to prepare Zr-doped NiO results in a high specific surface area, which increases with Zr doping. The calcination temperature affects the stoichiometry and vacancy formation in NiO, with 450°C producing a non-stoichiometric, p-conducting NiO with Ni vacancies.

Dopant concentrations: Zr-doped NiO shows improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH compared to undoped NiO. The optimal Zr concentration appears to be around 10%, as 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO show similar selectivities.

Vacancy formation: Ni vacancies in NiO prepared at 450°C contribute to its p-type conductivity and catalytic activity. Zr doping affects the vacancy formation and oxygen binding, leading to improved selectivity but potentially reduced activity.

Key challenges:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately describing NiO using DFT is challenging, with uncertainties in the results. PBE+U with specific U values is used, but only trends can be reliably interpreted.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity is crucial. While Zr doping improves selectivity, it may reduce overall activity by increasing the temperature required for hydrogen consumption.

3. Efficiency, selectivity, and safety: Achieving high ethylene yields while maintaining selectivity and preventing over-oxidation is a significant challenge. The use of oxygen as an oxidant introduces safety concerns, requiring careful control of the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratio to prevent explosion risks.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能产生显著影响。

制备方法：用于制备Zr掺杂NiO的溶胶-凝胶法可产生高比表面积，随Zr掺杂而增加。煅烧温度影响NiO的化学计量比和空位形成，450°C下产生非化学计量比、p型导电的带有Ni空位的NiO。

掺杂浓度：与未掺杂NiO相比，Zr掺杂NiO在乙烷ODH反应中表现出更好的乙烯选择性。最佳Zr浓度似乎在10%左右，因为5ZrNiO、10ZrNiO和20ZrNiO显示相似的选择性。

空位形成：450°C制备的NiO中的Ni空位有助于其p型导电性和催化活性。Zr掺杂影响空位形成和氧结合，导致选择性提高但可能降低活性。

主要挑战：

1. 理论建模：使用DFT准确描述NiO具有挑战性，结果存在不确定性。使用特定U值的PBE+U方法，但只能可靠地解释趋势。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡至关重要。虽然Zr掺杂提高了选择性，但可能通过增加氢消耗所需的温度来降低整体活性。

3. 效率、选择性和安全性：在保持选择性和防止过度氧化的同时实现高乙烯产率是一个重大挑战。使用氧气作为氧化剂引入了安全隐患，需要仔细控制氧气/烃比以防止爆炸风险。
