[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[3] "XRD measurements on Ni-doped ceria show no peaks corresponding to NiO. The structure is that of the CeO2 with a smaller lattice spacing (the ionic radius of Ni is smaller than that of Ce)."

[4] "The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%."

[5] "Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods affect the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. NiO prepared at different temperatures exhibits distinct characteristics - stoichiometric at 700°C and non-stoichiometric with Ni vacancies at 450°C. The sol-gel method produces NiO with high specific surface area, which is further increased by Zr doping.

Dopant concentrations play a crucial role in modifying the catalyst structure and performance. For instance, Zr-doped NiO shows improved selectivity and overall performance in ethane ODH, with 10ZrNiO demonstrating the best results. The dopant concentration affects the phase composition, with higher concentrations leading to the formation of separate oxide phases.

Vacancy formation, particularly Ni vacancies in NiO, influences the electronic structure by creating p-type conductivity. These vacancies can act as active sites for catalysis, but their effects can be modulated by dopants.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately describing the electronic structure of doped oxides, especially for systems like NiO where DFT calculations face difficulties. Process optimization involves balancing various factors such as temperature, dopant concentration, and preparation method to achieve the desired catalytic performance.

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remains a significant challenge. While doping can improve selectivity, it may reduce overall conversion. Safety concerns, particularly in ODH reactions using oxygen, limit the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used, affecting process efficiency.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的物理和化学性质。在不同温度下制备的NiO表现出不同的特性 - 700°C时为化学计量比，450°C时为非化学计量比且有Ni空位。溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiO具有高比表面积，通过Zr掺杂可进一步增加。

掺杂浓度在改变催化剂结构和性能方面起着关键作用。例如，Zr掺杂的NiO在乙烷ODH中表现出改善的选择性和整体性能，其中10ZrNiO展示了最佳结果。掺杂浓度影响相组成，高浓度会导致单独氧化物相的形成。

空位形成，特别是NiO中的Ni空位，通过产生p型导电性影响电子结构。这些空位可以作为催化活性位点，但其效果可以通过掺杂剂调节。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确描述掺杂氧化物的电子结构，特别是对于NiO这样DFT计算面临困难的系统。工艺优化涉及平衡温度、掺杂浓度和制备方法等各种因素，以实现所需的催化性能。

在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性仍然是一个重大挑战。虽然掺杂可以提高选择性，但可能会降低整体转化率。安全考虑，特别是在使用氧气的ODH反应中，限制了可使用的氧气/烃比，影响了工艺效率。
