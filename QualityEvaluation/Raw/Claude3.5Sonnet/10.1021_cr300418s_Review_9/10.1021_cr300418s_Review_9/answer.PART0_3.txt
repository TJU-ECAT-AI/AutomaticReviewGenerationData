[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[3] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g."

[4] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[6] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation temperature affects the stoichiometry and conductivity of NiO. NiO prepared at 450°C contains Ni vacancies and exhibits p-type conductivity, while NiO prepared at 700°C is stoichiometric. The sol-gel method produces NiO with high specific surface area, which is further increased by Zr doping.

Dopant concentration plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Zr-doped NiO (5-20% Zr) shows higher ethylene selectivity compared to undoped NiO in ethane ODH reactions. The optimal Zr concentration appears to be around 10%, balancing improved selectivity with maintained conversion rates.

Vacancy formation, particularly Ni vacancies in NiO, affects the oxide's oxidizing power. Zr doping can counteract this effect by filling these vacancies, thereby modulating the catalyst's reactivity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting catalyst behavior without specific calculations for each system is difficult, as multiple reaction mechanisms are possible.

2. Process optimization: Balancing conversion rates and selectivity is crucial. While Zr doping improves selectivity, it may decrease overall conversion rates.

3. Efficiency and safety: Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involve flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen, requiring careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosions while maintaining efficiency.

4. Catalyst stability: Ensuring long-term stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is essential for industrial applications.

5. Mechanistic understanding: Determining the exact reaction mechanism (e.g., Mars-van Krevelen vs. adsorbed oxygen species) is challenging but necessary for rational catalyst design.

These challenges highlight the need for combined experimental and theoretical approaches to develop improved catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备温度影响NiO的化学计量比和导电性。450°C制备的NiO含有Ni空位并表现出p型导电性，而700°C制备的NiO则具有化学计量比。溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiO具有高比表面积，通过Zr掺杂可进一步增加。

掺杂浓度在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。在乙烷ODH反应中，Zr掺杂的NiO（5-20% Zr）比未掺杂的NiO表现出更高的乙烯选择性。最佳Zr浓度似乎在10%左右，平衡了提高的选择性和保持的转化率。

空位形成，特别是NiO中的Ni空位，影响氧化物的氧化能力。Zr掺杂可以通过填充这些空位来抵消这种效应，从而调节催化剂的反应活性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：由于可能存在多种反应机理，在没有针对每个系统进行具体计算的情况下，准确预测催化剂行为是困难的。

2. 过程优化：平衡转化率和选择性至关重要。虽然Zr掺杂提高了选择性，但可能会降低整体转化率。

3. 效率和安全性：氧化脱氢反应涉及易燃烃和氧气，需要仔细控制反应条件以防止爆炸，同时保持效率。

4. 催化剂稳定性：确保催化剂在反应条件下的长期稳定性对工业应用至关重要。

5. 机理理解：确定精确的反应机理（例如，Mars-van Krevelen机理vs吸附氧物种）具有挑战性，但对于理性催化剂设计是必要的。

这些挑战突出了结合实验和理论方法来开发改进的氧化脱氢反应催化剂的必要性。
