[1] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

[2] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

[3] "In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key aspects include:

1. Promoter intercalation: Adding promoters like V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta between nickel and the alumina support modifies the catalyst's structural and catalytic properties. This reduces the strong nickel-alumina interaction and prevents nickel from incorporating into the alumina lattice.

2. Niobium as an optimal promoter: Niobium addition was found to be particularly beneficial, increasing ethane reactivity by over 50% while maintaining high ethylene selectivity. Niobium likely improves nickel phase dispersion and facilitates C-H bond activation through electron transfer promotion.

3. Mixed oxide formation: Creating mixed oxides, such as Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox, resulted in catalysts with excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict catalyst performance based on composition and preparation methods.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions to maximize yield and selectivity while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency vs. selectivity: Finding the optimal catalyst composition and structure that provides both high efficiency and high selectivity.

4. Safety considerations: Ensuring safe operation of the ODH process, which involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen at elevated temperatures.

5. Scale-up issues: Addressing challenges in translating laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale production.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。关键方面包括：

1. 助剂插层：在镍和氧化铝支撑体之间添加V、Mo、Co、Nb和Ta等助剂可以改变催化剂的结构和催化性能。这减少了镍与氧化铝之间的强相互作用，防止镍进入氧化铝晶格。

2. 铌作为最佳助剂：添加铌特别有益，可以在保持高乙烯选择性的同时将乙烷反应活性提高50%以上。铌可能通过改善镍相的分散度并通过电子转移促进C-H键活化。

3. 混合氧化物形成：创建如Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox的混合氧化物，可以得到在丙烷ODH反应中具有优异活性和选择性的催化剂。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型，基于组成和制备方法预测催化剂性能。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件，以最大化产率和选择性，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

3. 效率与选择性：找到提供高效率和高选择性的最佳催化剂组成和结构。

4. 安全考虑：确保ODH过程的安全运行，该过程涉及在高温下使用易燃烃和氧气。

5. 规模扩大问题：解决将实验室规模结果转化为工业规模生产的挑战。
