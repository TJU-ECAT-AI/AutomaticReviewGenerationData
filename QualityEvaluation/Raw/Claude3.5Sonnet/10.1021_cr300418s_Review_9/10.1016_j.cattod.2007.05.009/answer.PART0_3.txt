[1] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

[2] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

[3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

[4] "In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane ODH, the interaction between Ni and the support (e.g., alumina) plays a crucial role. At submonolayer coverage, nickel aluminate-like species form on the surface, while NiO crystallites develop at multilayer coverages. This interaction with the support improves catalytic performance compared to unsupported NiO.

Doping with elements like V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta modifies the structural and catalytic properties. These promoters intercalate between nickel and alumina, reducing the strong nickel-alumina interaction and preventing nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice. Niobium doping was found to be particularly beneficial, increasing ethane reactivity by over 50% while maintaining high ethylene selectivity. Nb is thought to improve nickel phase dispersion and facilitate C-H bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter.

The formation of mixed oxides, such as Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox, has led to catalysts with excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions to maximize olefin yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.

3. Efficiency vs. selectivity: Improving catalyst activity without sacrificing selectivity to the desired olefin product.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with operating at high temperatures and with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

5. Scalability: Translating promising laboratory results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining performance and cost-effectiveness.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷氧化脱氢反应，镍与载体(如氧化铝)之间的相互作用起着关键作用。在亚单层覆盖度下，表面形成类镍铝酸盐物种，而在多层覆盖度下形成NiO晶体。这种与载体的相互作用比未负载的NiO改善了催化性能。

用V、Mo、Co、Nb和Ta等元素掺杂可以改变结构和催化性能。这些促进剂插入到镍和氧化铝之间，减弱了镍-氧化铝的强相互作用，防止镍掺入氧化铝晶格。铌掺杂特别有益，提高了乙烷反应活性50%以上，同时保持了高乙烯选择性。铌被认为可以改善镍相的分散性，并通过作为电子转移促进剂来促进C-H键活化。

形成混合氧化物，如Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox，已经开发出对丙烷氧化脱氢具有优异活性和选择性的催化剂。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型来预测掺杂剂和空位对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：平衡反应条件以最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化不良副反应。

3. 效率与选择性：在不牺牲目标烯烃产物选择性的情况下提高催化剂活性。

4. 安全性：管理在高温下和与潜在爆炸性的碳氢化合物和氧气混合物一起操作的风险。

5. 可扩展性：将有前景的实验室结果转化为工业规模的过程，同时保持性能和成本效益。
