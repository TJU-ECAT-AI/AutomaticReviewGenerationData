[1] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

[2] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

[3] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

The preparation methods and dopant concentrations significantly influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Adding promoters like V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta modifies the structural and catalytic properties by intercalating between nickel and alumina, reducing strong nickel-alumina interactions. Niobium addition was particularly beneficial, increasing ethane reactivity by over 50% while maintaining high ethylene selectivity. 

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex promoter interactions and their effects on electronic structure.

2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety.

3. Controlling the dispersion and interaction of nickel with the support.

4. Understanding and optimizing the role of promoters in facilitating C-H bond activation.

5. Balancing the formation of active surface species versus bulk crystallites.

6. Developing preparation methods that achieve optimal promoter intercalation and nickel dispersion.

7. Ensuring catalyst stability and longevity under reaction conditions.

8. Scaling up production while maintaining optimal catalyst structure and performance.
