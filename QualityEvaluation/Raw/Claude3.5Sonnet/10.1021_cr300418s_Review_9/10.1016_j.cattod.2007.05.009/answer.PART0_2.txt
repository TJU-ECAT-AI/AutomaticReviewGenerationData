[1] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

[2] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

[3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

[4] "In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane ODH, NiO interacts strongly with alumina support, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species at submonolayer coverage and NiO crystallites at multilayer coverage. Promoters like V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta modify the structural and catalytic properties by intercalating between nickel and alumina, reducing the strong nickel-alumina interaction.

Niobium as a promoter was particularly beneficial, increasing ethane reactivity by over 50% while maintaining high ethylene selectivity. It likely improves nickel phase dispersion and facilitates C-H bond activation through electron transfer promotion. A mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) showed excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex catalyst structures and their interactions with reactants.
2. Process optimization to balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.
3. Improving catalyst efficiency and selectivity while ensuring operational safety in highly exothermic ODH reactions.
4. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxygen vacancies and their role in catalytic activity.
5. Developing scalable and cost-effective methods for catalyst preparation and dopant incorporation.
6. Balancing the trade-off between catalyst activity and selectivity, especially at higher conversions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷ODH，NiO与氧化铝载体强烈相互作用，在亚单层覆盖时形成表面镍尖晶石类物种，在多层覆盖时形成NiO晶体。V、Mo、Co、Nb和Ta等促进剂通过在镍和氧化铝之间插入，减少强烈的镍-氧化铝相互作用，从而改变结构和催化性能。

铌作为促进剂特别有益，在保持高乙烯选择性的同时，将乙烷反应活性提高了50%以上。它可能通过改善镍相的分散性和促进电子转移来促进C-H键的活化。混合氧化物(Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox)在丙烷ODH中表现出优异的活性和选择性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 复杂催化剂结构及其与反应物相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化过程以平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性。
3. 在高度放热的ODH反应中提高催化剂效率和选择性，同时确保操作安全。
4. 理解和控制氧空位的形成及其在催化活性中的作用。
5. 开发可扩展和经济高效的催化剂制备和掺杂剂引入方法。
6. 平衡催化剂活性和选择性之间的权衡，尤其是在高转化率下。
