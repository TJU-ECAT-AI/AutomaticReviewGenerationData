[1] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

[3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane ODH, the interaction between nickel and the support (e.g., alumina) plays a crucial role. In submonolayer regimes, surface nickel aluminate-like species form, while NiO crystallites develop on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages. This interaction with the support improves catalytic performance.

Doping with elements like V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta modifies both structural and catalytic properties. These promoters intercalate between nickel and alumina, reducing the strong nickel-alumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice. Among these dopants, niobium was found to be most beneficial, increasing reactivity to ethane by over 50% while maintaining high ethylene selectivity. Nb is thought to improve nickel phase dispersion and facilitate C-H bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter.

The formation of mixed oxides, such as Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox, has led to catalysts with excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions to maximize olefin yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.

3. Efficiency vs. selectivity: Improving catalyst activity without sacrificing selectivity to the desired olefin product.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with operating at high temperatures and with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

5. Scalability: Translating promising lab-scale results to industrially viable processes.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷氧化脱氢反应，镍与载体（如氧化铝）之间的相互作用起着至关重要的作用。在亚单层区域，形成表面镍尖晶石状物种，而在多层覆盖时，NiO晶体在镍/氧化铝界面上形成。这种与载体的相互作用改善了催化性能。

用V、Mo、Co、Nb和Ta等元素掺杂可以修改结构和催化性能。这些促进剂插入镍和氧化铝之间，减少了强烈的镍-氧化铝相互作用，抑制了镍进入氧化铝晶格。在这些掺杂剂中，铌被发现是最有益的，它使乙烷的反应活性提高了50%以上，同时保持了高的乙烯选择性。铌被认为可以改善镍相的分散性，并通过作为电子转移促进剂来促进C-H键的活化。

形成混合氧化物，如Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox，已经产生了具有优异活性和选择性的丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型来预测掺杂剂和空位对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件以最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

3. 效率与选择性：提高催化剂活性而不牺牲对目标烯烃产物的选择性。

4. 安全性：管理在高温下和潜在爆炸性的碳氢化合物与氧气混合物中操作的风险。

5. 可扩展性：将有希望的实验室规模结果转化为工业可行的过程。
