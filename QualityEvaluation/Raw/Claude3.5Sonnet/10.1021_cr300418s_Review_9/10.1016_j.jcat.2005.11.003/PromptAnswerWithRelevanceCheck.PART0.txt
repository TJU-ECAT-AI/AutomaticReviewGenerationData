[1] "The study was performed on NiO, a typical total oxidation catalyst, and a bulk NiNbO mixed-oxide catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15) developed previously [...], a very efficient ethane ODH material (46% ethene yield at 400 C)."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

The preparation method and dopant concentration significantly influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The optimal Nb/Ni ratio was found to be 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), as higher concentrations led to saturation of lattice sites and phase segregation. 

Niobium doping modifies the oxygen species on the catalyst surface, primarily affecting selectivity to olefins. It fills cationic vacancies and reduces active sites for oxygen dissociation, making oxygen diffusion the fast step. This results in strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

The introduction of Nb increases the activation energy for oxygen exchange, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species compared to pure NiO. This modification of the electronic structure leads to improved catalytic performance, with the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst achieving 46% ethene yield at 400°C.

Key challenges in this catalytic system likely include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between Ni and Nb in the mixed oxide structure
2. Optimizing the preparation method to achieve uniform Nb incorporation
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity by fine-tuning the Nb concentration
4. Ensuring catalyst stability and safety under high-temperature reaction conditions

Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between dopant concentration, vacancy formation, and catalytic performance, as well as to address these challenges in process optimization.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法和掺杂浓度显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。最佳的Nb/Ni比例被发现是0.176（Ni0.85Nb0.15），因为更高的浓度会导致晶格位点饱和和相分离。

铌掺杂通过修饰催化剂表面的氧物种，主要影响烯烃的选择性。它填充阳离子空位并减少氧解离的活性位点，使氧扩散成为快速步骤。这导致了强烈结合的、较不活泼的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

铌的引入增加了氧交换的活化能，反映出与纯NiO相比，氧物种结合得更紧密。这种电子结构的修饰导致催化性能的改善，Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂在400°C下实现了46%的乙烯收率。

这个催化系统的主要挑战可能包括：
1. 对混合氧化物结构中Ni和Nb复杂相互作用的理论建模
2. 优化制备方法以实现均匀的Nb掺入
3. 通过微调Nb浓度来平衡效率和选择性
4. 确保催化剂在高温反应条件下的稳定性和安全性

需要进一步研究以充分理解掺杂浓度、空位形成和催化性能之间的关系，以及解决这些过程优化中的挑战。

[1] "Introducing niobium produces a noticeably slower decay that equilibrates 45 min after the isotopic switch, reinforcing previous results [5] demonstrating that niobium eliminates the very active nonselective Ospecies on the surface of NiO by reducing the active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation on the surface."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation method involving doping NiO with niobium significantly influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of niobium eliminates non-selective oxygen species on the NiO surface by reducing active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation. This changes the oxygen activation mechanism, making oxygen diffusion the fast step instead of dissociation.

Niobium doping fills cationic vacancies in NiO, which leads to the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene. This change in the electronic structure results in improved selectivity for the desired ODH reaction.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving multiple types of active sites. Process optimization needs to balance the activities of different active sites to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition. The presence of oxygen creates potential safety hazards, while achieving high selectivity and efficiency demands precise tuning of active site distributions and reaction parameters.

在氧化脱氢反应中，通过掺杂铌来制备氧化镍基催化剂的方法显著影响了其电子结构和催化性能。添加铌消除了NiO表面上的非选择性氧物种，减少了快速氧解离的活性位点。这改变了氧活化机制，使氧扩散成为快速步骤，而不是解离。

铌掺杂填充了NiO中的阳离子空位，导致形成强键合、不易活化的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。电子结构的这种变化提高了所需ODH反应的选择性。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确表示涉及多种活性位点的复杂氧化还原平行-连续反应网络。工艺优化需要平衡不同活性位点的活性，以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂组成。氧的存在造成潜在的安全隐患，而实现高选择性和效率需要精确调节活性位点分布和反应参数。

The preparation method and dopant concentration of nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping NiO with small amounts of niobium creates a NiNb solid solution that effectively converts NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an efficient ODH catalyst. The Nb dopant fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation and making oxygen diffusion the fast step in the process. This results in strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving multiple types of active sites. Process optimization involves balancing the concentrations and activities of type I sites (responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation) and type II sites (active for direct ethane oxidation to CO2). 

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition to maximize desired product formation while minimizing overoxidation and potential safety hazards associated with oxygen-rich environments at elevated temperatures. Further research is needed to fully optimize these catalytic systems for industrial applications.

The preparation method involving doping NiO with small amounts of Nb to form a NiNb solid solution is key to converting NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalyst. The Nb/Ni ratio is varied from 0 to 0.67.

Dopant concentration influences the catalyst by modifying oxygen species on the surface. Small amounts of Nb effectively change the catalytic behavior.

Vacancy formation is affected as Nb fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation. This changes the rate-limiting step from dissociation to diffusion.

The electronic structure is influenced as Nb doping reduces or eliminates non-stoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species, leading to more strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

Key challenges include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between Nb dopants, oxygen species, and vacancies in the NiO lattice.
2. Optimizing the Nb doping level to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Controlling the types of oxygen species formed to maximize selectivity while maintaining high activity.
4. Balancing catalyst stability, efficiency and safety at industrial operating conditions.

The literature does not directly address challenges in process optimization or safety considerations for these specific catalytic systems.

掺杂剂浓度通过改变表面氧物种影响催化剂。少量Nb可有效改变催化行为。

空位形成受到影响,因为Nb填充了NiO中的阳离子空位,减少了氧解离的活性位点。这改变了反应的速率限制步骤,从解离变为扩散。

电子结构受到影响,因为Nb掺杂减少或消除了非计量比的亲电氧物种,形成更强结合、活性较低的亲核氧物种,这些氧物种对乙烷到乙烯的转化具有选择性。

主要挑战包括:
1. 对Nb掺杂剂、氧物种和NiO晶格中空位之间复杂相互作用进行理论建模。
2. 优化Nb掺杂水平以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 控制形成的氧物种类型,以最大化选择性同时保持高活性。
