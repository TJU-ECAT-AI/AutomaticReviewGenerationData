[1] "Introducing niobium produces a noticeably slower decay that equilibrates 45 min after the isotopic switch, reinforcing previous results [5] demonstrating that niobium eliminates the very active nonselective Ospecies on the surface of NiO by reducing the active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation on the surface."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation method involving doping NiO with niobium significantly influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of niobium eliminates non-selective oxygen species on the NiO surface by reducing active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation. This changes the oxygen activation mechanism, making oxygen diffusion the fast step instead of dissociation.

Niobium doping fills cationic vacancies in NiO, which leads to the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene. This change in the electronic structure results in improved selectivity for the desired ODH reaction.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving multiple types of active sites. Process optimization needs to balance the activities of different active sites to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition. The presence of oxygen creates potential safety hazards, while achieving high selectivity and efficiency demands precise tuning of active site distributions and reaction parameters.

在氧化脱氢反应中，通过掺杂铌来制备氧化镍基催化剂的方法显著影响了其电子结构和催化性能。添加铌消除了NiO表面上的非选择性氧物种，减少了快速氧解离的活性位点。这改变了氧活化机制，使氧扩散成为快速步骤，而不是解离。

铌掺杂填充了NiO中的阳离子空位，导致形成强键合、不易活化的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。电子结构的这种变化提高了所需ODH反应的选择性。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确表示涉及多种活性位点的复杂氧化还原平行-连续反应网络。工艺优化需要平衡不同活性位点的活性，以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂组成。氧的存在造成潜在的安全隐患，而实现高选择性和效率需要精确调节活性位点分布和反应参数。
