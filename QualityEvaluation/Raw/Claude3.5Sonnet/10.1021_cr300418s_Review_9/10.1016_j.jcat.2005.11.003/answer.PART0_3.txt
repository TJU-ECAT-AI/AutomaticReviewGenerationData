[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation method and dopant concentration of nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping NiO with small amounts of niobium creates a NiNb solid solution that effectively converts NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an efficient ODH catalyst. The Nb dopant fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation and making oxygen diffusion the fast step in the process. This results in strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving multiple types of active sites. Process optimization involves balancing the concentrations and activities of type I sites (responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation) and type II sites (active for direct ethane oxidation to CO2). 

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition to maximize desired product formation while minimizing overoxidation and potential safety hazards associated with oxygen-rich environments at elevated temperatures. Further research is needed to fully optimize these catalytic systems for industrial applications.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法和掺杂浓度显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。用少量铌掺杂NiO可创建NiNb固溶体,有效地将NiO从完全氧化催化剂转变为高效的ODH催化剂。铌掺杂剂填充NiO中的阳离子空位,减少了氧气解离的活性位点,使氧气扩散成为过程中的快速步骤。这导致催化剂表面形成强结合、较不易迁移的亲核氧物种,对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确表示涉及多种类型活性位点的复杂氧化还原平行-连续反应网络。工艺优化涉及平衡I型位点(负责乙烷ODH和乙烯过度氧化)和II型位点(活跃于乙烷直接氧化成CO2)的浓度和活性。

平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细控制反应条件和催化剂组成,以最大化目标产物的生成,同时最小化过度氧化和高温富氧环境下潜在的安全隐患。还需要进一步研究以充分优化这些催化系统,使其适用于工业应用。
