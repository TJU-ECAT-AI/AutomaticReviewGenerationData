[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The key component for excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed by doping NiO with Nb. Small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material. The optimum Nb/Ni ratio was found to be 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), as higher Nb concentrations led to saturation of lattice sites and phase segregation.

Nickel sites are responsible for activating the paraffinic substrate, while niobium mainly affects selectivity to olefin by modifying oxygen species on the catalytic surface. Niobium fills cationic vacancies and reduces active sites for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step of the process. This results in strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Process optimization to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety.
3. Controlling the dopant concentration and distribution to achieve optimal catalytic performance.
4. Understanding and manipulating the formation and behavior of different oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
5. Developing preparation methods that ensure uniform dopant incorporation and prevent phase segregation at higher concentrations.

在氧化物脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

优异催化性能的关键组成部分是通过向NiO掺杂Nb形成的NiNb固溶体。少量的铌可以有效地将NiO从完全氧化催化剂转变为有效的ODH催化材料。最佳的Nb/Ni比例被发现是0.176（Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂），因为更高的Nb浓度会导致晶格位置饱和和相分离。

镍位点负责活化烷烃底物，而铌主要通过改变催化表面上的氧物种影响烯烃的选择性。铌填充阳离子空位并减少可用于解离的活性位点，使扩散成为过程的快速步骤。这导致了强烈结合的、不易活动的亲核氧物种，它们对将乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主体晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化过程以平衡效率、选择性和安全性。
3. 控制掺杂剂浓度和分布以获得最佳催化性能。
4. 理解和操控催化剂表面不同氧物种的形成和行为。
5. 开发确保均匀掺杂剂掺入并防止高浓度下相分离的制备方法。
