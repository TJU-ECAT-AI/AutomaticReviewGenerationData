          [1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[6] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[7] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation method: Doping NiO with small amounts of Nb creates a NiNb solid solution, effectively converting NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an efficient ODH catalyst. The optimal Nb/Ni ratio was found to be 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst).

Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb effectively change the catalytic behavior. Higher Nb concentrations lead to saturation of lattice sites and phase segregation.

Vacancy formation: Nb fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation and making oxygen diffusion the fast step in the process.

Electronic structure: Nb doping modifies oxygen species on the catalyst surface, reducing or eliminating non-stoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species and creating strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion. The introduction of Nb increases the activation energy for oxygen exchange, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species.

Catalytic performance: The modified catalyst shows improved selectivity for ODH reactions, with two types of active sites participating in a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network.

Key challenges include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between Nb dopants, oxygen species, and vacancies in the NiO lattice.
2. Optimizing the Nb doping level to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Controlling the types of oxygen species formed to maximize selectivity while maintaining high activity.
4. Balancing catalyst stability, efficiency, and safety at industrial operating conditions.
5. Understanding and manipulating the formation and behavior of different oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
6. Developing preparation methods that ensure uniform dopant incorporation and prevent phase segregation at higher concentrations.
7. Accurately representing the complex redox parallel-consecutive reaction network involving multiple types of active sites in kinetic models.

          在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：用少量铌掺杂NiO可创建NiNb固溶体，有效地将NiO从完全氧化催化剂转变为高效的ODH催化剂。最佳的Nb/Ni比例被发现是0.176（Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂）。

掺杂浓度：少量的铌可以有效地改变催化行为。更高的Nb浓度会导致晶格位置饱和和相分离。

空位形成：铌填充NiO中的阳离子空位，减少了氧气解离的活性位点，使氧气扩散成为过程中的快速步骤。

电子结构：铌掺杂改变了催化剂表面的氧物种，减少或消除了非计量比的亲电氧物种，形成强结合、活性较低的亲核氧物种，这些氧物种对乙烷到乙烯的转化具有选择性。铌的引入增加了氧交换的活化能，反映出氧物种结合得更紧密。

催化性能：改性后的催化剂在ODH反应中表现出improved选择性，有两种类型的活性位点参与氧化还原平行-连续反应网络。

主要挑战包括：
1. 对Nb掺杂剂、氧物种和NiO晶格中空位之间复杂相互作用进行理论建模。
2. 优化Nb掺杂水平以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 控制形成的氧物种类型，以最大化选择性同时保持高活性。
4. 在工业操作条件下平衡催化剂稳定性、效率和安全性。
5. 理解和操控催化剂表面不同氧物种的形成和行为。
6. 开发确保均匀掺杂剂掺入并防止高浓度下相分离的制备方法。
7. 在动力学模型中准确表示涉及多种类型活性位点的复杂氧化还原平行-连续反应网络。
