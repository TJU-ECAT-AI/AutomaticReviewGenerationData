[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[3] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[4] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

The preparation method involving doping NiO with small amounts of Nb to form a NiNb solid solution is key to converting NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalyst. The Nb/Ni ratio is varied from 0 to 0.67.

Dopant concentration influences the catalyst by modifying oxygen species on the surface. Small amounts of Nb effectively change the catalytic behavior.

Vacancy formation is affected as Nb fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation. This changes the rate-limiting step from dissociation to diffusion.

The electronic structure is influenced as Nb doping reduces or eliminates non-stoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species, leading to more strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

Key challenges include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between Nb dopants, oxygen species, and vacancies in the NiO lattice.
2. Optimizing the Nb doping level to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Controlling the types of oxygen species formed to maximize selectivity while maintaining high activity.
4. Balancing catalyst stability, efficiency and safety at industrial operating conditions.

The literature does not directly address challenges in process optimization or safety considerations for these specific catalytic systems.

NiO掺杂少量Nb形成NiNb固溶体的制备方法是将NiO从完全氧化催化剂转变为有效ODH催化剂的关键。Nb/Ni比例从0到0.67不等。

掺杂剂浓度通过改变表面氧物种影响催化剂。少量Nb可有效改变催化行为。

空位形成受到影响,因为Nb填充了NiO中的阳离子空位,减少了氧解离的活性位点。这改变了反应的速率限制步骤,从解离变为扩散。

电子结构受到影响,因为Nb掺杂减少或消除了非计量比的亲电氧物种,形成更强结合、活性较低的亲核氧物种,这些氧物种对乙烷到乙烯的转化具有选择性。

主要挑战包括:
1. 对Nb掺杂剂、氧物种和NiO晶格中空位之间复杂相互作用进行理论建模。
2. 优化Nb掺杂水平以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 控制形成的氧物种类型,以最大化选择性同时保持高活性。
4. 在工业操作条件下平衡催化剂稳定性、效率和安全性。

文献没有直接讨论这些特定催化系统的工艺优化或安全性考虑方面的挑战。
