[1] "The study was performed on NiO, a typical total oxidation catalyst, and a bulk NiNbO mixed-oxide catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15) developed previously [...], a very efficient ethane ODH material (46% ethene yield at 400 C)."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

The preparation method and dopant concentration significantly influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The optimal Nb/Ni ratio was found to be 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), as higher concentrations led to saturation of lattice sites and phase segregation. 

Niobium doping modifies the oxygen species on the catalyst surface, primarily affecting selectivity to olefins. It fills cationic vacancies and reduces active sites for oxygen dissociation, making oxygen diffusion the fast step. This results in strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

The introduction of Nb increases the activation energy for oxygen exchange, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species compared to pure NiO. This modification of the electronic structure leads to improved catalytic performance, with the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst achieving 46% ethene yield at 400°C.

Key challenges in this catalytic system likely include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between Ni and Nb in the mixed oxide structure
2. Optimizing the preparation method to achieve uniform Nb incorporation
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity by fine-tuning the Nb concentration
4. Ensuring catalyst stability and safety under high-temperature reaction conditions

Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between dopant concentration, vacancy formation, and catalytic performance, as well as to address these challenges in process optimization.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法和掺杂浓度显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。最佳的Nb/Ni比例被发现是0.176（Ni0.85Nb0.15），因为更高的浓度会导致晶格位点饱和和相分离。

铌掺杂通过修饰催化剂表面的氧物种，主要影响烯烃的选择性。它填充阳离子空位并减少氧解离的活性位点，使氧扩散成为快速步骤。这导致了强烈结合的、较不活泼的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

铌的引入增加了氧交换的活化能，反映出与纯NiO相比，氧物种结合得更紧密。这种电子结构的修饰导致催化性能的改善，Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂在400°C下实现了46%的乙烯收率。

这个催化系统的主要挑战可能包括：
1. 对混合氧化物结构中Ni和Nb复杂相互作用的理论建模
2. 优化制备方法以实现均匀的Nb掺入
3. 通过微调Nb浓度来平衡效率和选择性
4. 确保催化剂在高温反应条件下的稳定性和安全性

需要进一步研究以充分理解掺杂浓度、空位形成和催化性能之间的关系，以及解决这些过程优化中的挑战。
