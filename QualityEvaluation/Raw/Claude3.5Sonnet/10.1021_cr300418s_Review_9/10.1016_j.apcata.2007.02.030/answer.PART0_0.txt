[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "The reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies leads to rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, thus increasing the surface area and consequently the per weight activity of the samples in the ethane ODH reaction."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Low-temperature treatment of NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies, leading to structural defects.

2. Doping with niobium (Nb) results in two distinct structural phases: a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase.

3. The interaction of Nb with cationic vacancies reduces structural defects in NiO, which correlates with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions. This is because the vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2.

4. Nb doping also causes the rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, increasing surface area and per-weight catalytic activity.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex multi-phase systems and their interactions.
2. Optimizing the balance between dopant concentration, defect reduction, and surface area increase.
3. Achieving high efficiency and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and safety in the highly exothermic ODH reactions.
4. Understanding and controlling the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance.
5. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant distribution and defect formation.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 低温处理NiO会产生非化学计量相，导致阳离子缺陷，形成结构缺陷。

2. 掺杂铌（Nb）会形成两种不同的结构相：Nb掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体，以及高度扭曲的富Nb相。

3. Nb与阳离子空位的相互作用减少了NiO中的结构缺陷，这与NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。这是因为空位通常会导致强氧化亲电氧物种的形成，从而导致完全氧化为CO2。

4. Nb掺杂还会导致较大晶体破裂成较小晶体，增加表面积和单位重量的催化活性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 复杂多相系统及其相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化掺杂浓度、缺陷减少和表面积增加之间的平衡。
3. 在高度放热的ODH反应中实现高效率和选择性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和安全性。
4. 理解和控制富Nb相在催化性能中的作用。
5. 开发允许精确控制掺杂分布和缺陷形成的制备方法。
