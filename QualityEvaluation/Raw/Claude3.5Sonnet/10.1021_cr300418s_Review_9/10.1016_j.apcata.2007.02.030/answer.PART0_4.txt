[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology. The HRTEM image of the sample Ni0.9Nb0.1 (Nb/Ni ratio = 0.111) in Fig. 4 demonstrates a clear reduction of the crystallite size, while two relatively well-defined areas are recognized: a well-crystallized cubic phase of ordered structure (marked as I on Fig. 4) and a highly distorted phase II, which appears in small concentration throughout the sample."

[5] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. When doped with niobium, two distinct structural phases form: a NiO phase with incorporated Nb cations (NiNb solid solution) and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase. The interaction between Nb ions and structural defects in NiO reduces these defects, which is correlated with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions.

Doping NiO with niobium also causes significant changes in crystalline morphology, including a reduction in crystallite size. The elimination or reduction of vacant sites on NiO through reaction with foreign cations (like Nb) is responsible for the high selectivity to ethylene during ethane ODH. This is because non-stoichiometric NiO can accommodate large amounts of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and CO2 production.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with high-temperature oxidative processes.

5. Dopant concentration control: Determining and maintaining the optimal dopant levels for best catalytic performance.

6. Characterization techniques: Developing and applying advanced methods to fully understand the nanostructural features and their impact on catalysis.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

纯NiO的低温处理会导致形成具有阳离子缺陷的非化学计量相。当用铌掺杂时，会形成两种不同的结构相：一种是掺入Nb阳离子的NiO相（NiNb固溶体），另一种是高度扭曲的富Nb相。Nb离子与NiO中结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些缺陷，这与乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。

用铌掺杂NiO还会导致晶体形态发生显著变化，包括晶粒尺寸的减小。通过与外来阳离子（如Nb）反应消除或减少NiO上的空位位点，是乙烷ODH过程中对乙烯具有高选择性的原因。这是因为非化学计量的NiO可以容纳大量的亲电氧物种，这些物种负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂剂和空位对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2生成。

4. 安全性：管理与高温氧化过程相关的风险。

5. 掺杂浓度控制：确定并维持最佳催化性能的最优掺杂水平。

6. 表征技术：开发和应用先进方法，以充分理解纳米结构特征及其对催化的影响。
