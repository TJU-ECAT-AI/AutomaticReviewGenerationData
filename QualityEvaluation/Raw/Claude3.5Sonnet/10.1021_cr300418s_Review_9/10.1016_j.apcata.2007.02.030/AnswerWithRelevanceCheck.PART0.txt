          [1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[5] "Characterization with XRD, shown in Fig. 1, shows that the mixed NiNbO oxides with Nb content up to 15% relative to the total metal content exhibit diffraction lines corresponding to a crystalline NiO-like phase, as well as a broad band centered at 2u 278 attributed to highly disordered niobium phase."

[6] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology. The HRTEM image of the sample Ni0.9Nb0.1 (Nb/Ni ratio = 0.111) in Fig. 4 demonstrates a clear reduction of the crystallite size, while two relatively well-defined areas are recognized: a well-crystallized cubic phase of ordered structure (marked as I on Fig. 4) and a highly distorted phase II, which appears in small concentration throughout the sample."

[7] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies and structural defects.

2. Doping with niobium (Nb) results in two distinct structural phases:
   a) A NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice.
   b) A highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for NiNb2O6 formation.

3. The interaction between Nb ions and structural defects in NiO reduces these defects, correlating with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions. This is because the vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2.

4. The optimal Nb/Ni atomic ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18, with up to 15% Nb content showing a crystalline NiO-like phase and a disordered niobium phase.

5. Nb doping causes significant changes in crystalline morphology, including a reduction in crystallite size.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex multi-phase systems and their interactions.
2. Optimizing the balance between dopant concentration, defect reduction, and surface area increase.
3. Achieving high efficiency and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and safety in highly exothermic ODH reactions.
4. Understanding and controlling the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance.
5. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant distribution and defect formation.
6. Balancing the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.
7. Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and CO2 production.
8. Managing the risks associated with high-temperature oxidative processes.
9. Developing and applying advanced characterization techniques to fully understand the nanostructural features and their impact on catalysis.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 纯NiO的低温处理会产生具有阳离子缺陷和结构缺陷的非化学计量相。

2. 掺入铌（Nb）会形成两种不同的结构相：
   a) Nb掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体。
   b) 高度扭曲的富Nb相，是NiNb2O6形成的前驱体。

3. Nb离子与NiO中结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些缺陷，这与乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。这是因为空位通常会导致强氧化亲电氧物种的形成，从而导致完全氧化为CO2。

4. 最佳的Nb/Ni原子比例范围为0.11-0.18，Nb含量达到15%时，呈现出类NiO晶相和无序铌相。

5. Nb掺杂导致晶体形态发生显著变化，包括晶粒尺寸的减小。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 复杂多相系统及其相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化掺杂浓度、缺陷减少和表面积增加之间的平衡。
3. 在高度放热的ODH反应中实现高效率和选择性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和安全性。
4. 理解和控制富Nb相在催化性能中的作用。
5. 开发允许精确控制掺杂分布和缺陷形成的制备方法。
6. 平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。
7. 最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2生成。
8. 管理与高温氧化过程相关的风险。
9. 开发和应用先进的表征技术，以充分理解纳米结构特征及其对催化的影响。
