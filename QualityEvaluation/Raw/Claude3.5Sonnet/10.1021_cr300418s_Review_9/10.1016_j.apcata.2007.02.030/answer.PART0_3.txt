[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Characterization with XRD, shown in Fig. 1, shows that the mixed NiNbO oxides with Nb content up to 15% relative to the total metal content exhibit diffraction lines corresponding to a crystalline NiO-like phase, as well as a broad band centered at 2u 278 attributed to highly disordered niobium phase."

[5] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO results in a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. When doped with niobium, two distinct structural phases form: a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase. 

The concentration of Nb dopant plays a crucial role. NiNbO mixed oxides with Nb content up to 15% show a crystalline NiO-like phase and a disordered niobium phase. This doping reduces structural defects in NiO, which correlates with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions.

The key mechanism behind the improved catalytic performance is the reduction of cationic vacancies through the interaction with niobium ions. These vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2. By eliminating these vacant sites, the catalysts achieve high selectivity to ethylene.

Challenges in this field likely include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants and vacancies.
2. Optimizing the dopant concentration to balance defect reduction and phase stability.
3. Scaling up the synthesis process while maintaining nanostructural features.
4. Balancing catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability over extended periods.
5. Ensuring safety in handling and using these nanostructured materials in industrial settings.

Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance and to develop strategies for fine-tuning the electronic structure for optimal catalytic outcomes.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

纯NiO的低温处理会导致非化学计量相的形成，伴随阳离子缺陷。当掺入铌时，会形成两种不同的结构相：一种是铌掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体，另一种是高度扭曲的富铌相。

铌掺杂剂的浓度起着关键作用。含铌量高达15%的NiNbO混合氧化物显示出类NiO晶相和无序的铌相。这种掺杂减少了NiO中的结构缺陷，与乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。

改善催化性能的关键机制是通过与铌离子的相互作用来减少阳离子空位。这些空位通常会导致强氧化亲电氧物种的形成，从而导致完全氧化为CO2。通过消除这些空位，催化剂实现了对乙烯的高选择性。

这一领域的主要挑战可能包括：
1. 对掺杂剂和空位之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化掺杂浓度以平衡缺陷减少和相稳定性。
3. 在保持纳米结构特征的同时扩大合成过程的规模。
4. 平衡长期的催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
5. 确保在工业环境中安全处理和使用这些纳米结构材料。

需要进一步研究以充分理解富铌相在催化性能中的作用，并开发策略来微调电子结构以获得最佳催化效果。
