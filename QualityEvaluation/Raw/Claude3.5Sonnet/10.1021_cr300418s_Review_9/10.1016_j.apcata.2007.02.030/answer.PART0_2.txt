[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Characterization with XRD, shown in Fig. 1, shows that the mixed NiNbO oxides with Nb content up to 15% relative to the total metal content exhibit diffraction lines corresponding to a crystalline NiO-like phase, as well as a broad band centered at 2u 278 attributed to highly disordered niobium phase."

[5] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. These defects create strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2, reducing selectivity.

Doping NiO with niobium causes two structural changes: 1) Nb cations incorporate into the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and 2) a highly distorted Nb-rich phase forms, which is a precursor to NiNb2O6. The interaction between Nb ions and NiO structural defects reduces these vacancies, leading to extremely high selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH reactions.

The Nb dopant concentration affects the catalyst structure. Up to 15% Nb content, the catalysts exhibit a crystalline NiO-like phase and a disordered niobium phase. Higher Nb content leads to the formation of distinct NiNb2O6 crystals.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Optimizing the preparation process to control defect formation and dopant distribution.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity by fine-tuning the dopant concentration and preparation conditions.
4. Ensuring catalyst stability and safety under reaction conditions.
5. Scaling up production while maintaining precise control over catalyst properties.

Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance and to develop strategies for tailoring catalyst properties for specific reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

纯NiO的低温处理会导致形成具有阳离子缺陷的非化学计量相。这些缺陷会产生强氧化性的亲电氧物种，负责将乙烷完全氧化成CO2，从而降低选择性。

用铌掺杂NiO会导致两种结构变化：1）Nb阳离子掺入NiO晶格，形成NiNb固溶体，2）形成高度扭曲的富Nb相，这是NiNb2O6的前驱体。Nb离子与NiO结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些空位，导致在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯具有极高的选择性。

Nb掺杂浓度影响催化剂结构。Nb含量达到15%时，催化剂呈现出类NiO晶相和无序铌相。更高的Nb含量会导致形成明显的NiNb2O6晶体。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化制备工艺以控制缺陷形成和掺杂剂分布。
3. 通过精细调节掺杂浓度和制备条件来平衡效率和选择性。
4. 确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和安全性。
5. 在保持对催化剂性能精确控制的同时实现生产规模扩大。

还需要进一步研究以充分理解富Nb相在催化性能中的作用，并开发针对特定反应定制催化剂性能的策略。
