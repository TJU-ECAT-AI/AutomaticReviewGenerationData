[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "The reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies leads to rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, thus increasing the surface area and consequently the per weight activity of the samples in the ethane ODH reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Low-temperature treatment of NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies, leading to structural defects.

2. Doping with niobium (Nb) results in two distinct structural phases: a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase.

3. The interaction of Nb with cationic vacancies reduces structural defects in NiO, which correlates with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions. This is because the vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2.

4. Nb doping also causes the rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, increasing surface area and per-weight catalytic activity.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex multi-phase systems and their interactions.
2. Optimizing the balance between dopant concentration, defect reduction, and surface area increase.
3. Achieving high efficiency and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and safety in the highly exothermic ODH reactions.
4. Understanding and controlling the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance.
5. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant distribution and defect formation.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. These defects create strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2, reducing selectivity.

Doping NiO with niobium causes two structural changes: 1) Nb cations incorporate into the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution, and 2) a highly distorted Nb-rich phase forms, which is a precursor to NiNb2O6. The interaction between Nb ions and NiO structural defects reduces these vacancies, leading to extremely high selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH reactions.

The Nb dopant concentration affects the catalyst structure. Up to 15% Nb content, the catalysts exhibit a crystalline NiO-like phase and a disordered niobium phase. Higher Nb content leads to the formation of distinct NiNb2O6 crystals.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Optimizing the preparation process to control defect formation and dopant distribution.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity by fine-tuning the dopant concentration and preparation conditions.
4. Ensuring catalyst stability and safety under reaction conditions.
5. Scaling up production while maintaining precise control over catalyst properties.

Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance and to develop strategies for tailoring catalyst properties for specific reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

纯NiO的低温处理会导致形成具有阳离子缺陷的非化学计量相。这些缺陷会产生强氧化性的亲电氧物种，负责将乙烷完全氧化成CO2，从而降低选择性。

用铌掺杂NiO会导致两种结构变化：1）Nb阳离子掺入NiO晶格，形成NiNb固溶体，2）形成高度扭曲的富Nb相，这是NiNb2O6的前驱体。Nb离子与NiO结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些空位，导致在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯具有极高的选择性。

Nb掺杂浓度影响催化剂结构。Nb含量达到15%时，催化剂呈现出类NiO晶相和无序铌相。更高的Nb含量会导致形成明显的NiNb2O6晶体。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化制备工艺以控制缺陷形成和掺杂剂分布。
3. 通过精细调节掺杂浓度和制备条件来平衡效率和选择性。
4. 确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和安全性。
5. 在保持对催化剂性能精确控制的同时实现生产规模扩大。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO results in a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. When doped with niobium, two distinct structural phases form: a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase. 

The concentration of Nb dopant plays a crucial role. NiNbO mixed oxides with Nb content up to 15% show a crystalline NiO-like phase and a disordered niobium phase. This doping reduces structural defects in NiO, which correlates with high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH reactions.

The key mechanism behind the improved catalytic performance is the reduction of cationic vacancies through the interaction with niobium ions. These vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2. By eliminating these vacant sites, the catalysts achieve high selectivity to ethylene.

Challenges in this field likely include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants and vacancies.
2. Optimizing the dopant concentration to balance defect reduction and phase stability.
3. Scaling up the synthesis process while maintaining nanostructural features.
4. Balancing catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability over extended periods.
5. Ensuring safety in handling and using these nanostructured materials in industrial settings.

Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the Nb-rich phase in catalytic performance and to develop strategies for fine-tuning the electronic structure for optimal catalytic outcomes.

纯NiO的低温处理会导致非化学计量相的形成，伴随阳离子缺陷。当掺入铌时，会形成两种不同的结构相：一种是铌掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体，另一种是高度扭曲的富铌相。

铌掺杂剂的浓度起着关键作用。含铌量高达15%的NiNbO混合氧化物显示出类NiO晶相和无序的铌相。这种掺杂减少了NiO中的结构缺陷，与乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。

改善催化性能的关键机制是通过与铌离子的相互作用来减少阳离子空位。这些空位通常会导致强氧化亲电氧物种的形成，从而导致完全氧化为CO2。通过消除这些空位，催化剂实现了对乙烯的高选择性。

这一领域的主要挑战可能包括：
1. 对掺杂剂和空位之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化掺杂浓度以平衡缺陷减少和相稳定性。
3. 在保持纳米结构特征的同时扩大合成过程的规模。
4. 平衡长期的催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
5. 确保在工业环境中安全处理和使用这些纳米结构材料。

[4] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology. The HRTEM image of the sample Ni0.9Nb0.1 (Nb/Ni ratio = 0.111) in Fig. 4 demonstrates a clear reduction of the crystallite size, while two relatively well-defined areas are recognized: a well-crystallized cubic phase of ordered structure (marked as I on Fig. 4) and a highly distorted phase II, which appears in small concentration throughout the sample."

[5] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

This is because non-stoichiometric NiO can accommodate large amounts of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopants and vacancies on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and CO2 production.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with high-temperature oxidative processes.

5. Dopant concentration control: Determining and maintaining the optimal dopant levels for best catalytic performance.
