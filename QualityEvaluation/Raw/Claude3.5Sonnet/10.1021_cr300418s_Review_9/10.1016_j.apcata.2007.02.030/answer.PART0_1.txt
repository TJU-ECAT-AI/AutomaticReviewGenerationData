[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[5] "The key for a viable industrial application of this process is the development of a highly active and selective catalytic material, able to activate and convert the relatively inert alkane to olefin at low temperature and minimize the parallel and consecutive side reactions of both the alkane and alkene to carbon oxides."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO creates a non-stoichiometric phase with cationic deficiencies. Doping with niobium leads to two distinct structural phases: a NiNb solid solution and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase.

The interaction between niobium ions and structural defects in NiO reduces these defects, which correlates with high selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH reactions. This is because the vacancies typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2. The optimal Nb/Ni atomic ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the preparation conditions to achieve the desired structural features and dopant concentrations.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Developing catalysts that can activate inert alkanes at low temperatures while minimizing side reactions.

4. Safety: Ensuring the stability and safety of the catalysts under reaction conditions, particularly given the presence of oxygen in ODH reactions.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory findings to industrially viable processes that maintain high activity and selectivity at larger scales.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and process engineering to develop and optimize nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。纯NiO的低温处理会产生具有阳离子缺陷的非化学计量相。掺入铌会导致两种不同的结构相：NiNb固溶体和高度扭曲的富铌相。

铌离子与NiO中结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些缺陷，这与NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的高选择性相关。这是因为空位通常会导致形成强氧化亲电氧物种，这些物种负责完全氧化为CO2。最佳的Nb/Ni原子比例范围为0.11-0.18。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 工艺优化：平衡制备条件以获得所需的结构特征和掺杂浓度。

3. 效率和选择性：开发能够在低温下活化惰性烷烃同时最小化副反应的催化剂。

4. 安全性：确保催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和安全性，特别是考虑到ODH反应中存在氧气。

5. 可扩展性：将实验室发现转化为工业可行的过程，在更大规模下保持高活性和选择性。

这些挑战需要多学科方法，结合先进的表征技术、计算机建模和工艺工程，以开发和优化用于氧化脱氢反应的氧化镍基催化剂。
