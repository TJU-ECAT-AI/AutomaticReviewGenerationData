[1] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

          [2] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

          [3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

          [4] "In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH"

[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion, which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[6] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[7] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."

[8] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[9] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."

[1] "Mesostructured doped Ce1xMxO catalysts (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior"

[5] "More recently, we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the ODH of EB at ca. 450 C"

[6] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[6] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[7] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[8] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[9] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[10] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid."

[2] "The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%"

[3] "Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."

[4] "The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability."

[5] "The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity."

[6] "The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57/Al contains a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase. Centi et al. claimed that a non-stoichiometric rutile-type vanadium antimonate phase facilitates the redox transformation of vanadium."

[7] "The V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts studied here exhibit very high conversion (74–80%) and high selectivity (>95%) at an initial stage, while Sb/Al shows only 19.4% conversion for EB."

[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[6] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

[1] "Solutions of nickel nitrate (Johnson and Matthey Specpure) to which had been added solutions containing known quantities of lithium carbonate (dissolved in acetic acid) or ammonium chromate were evaporated to dryness. The mixtures were ground and decomposed to the oxides by slowly raising the temperature to 600C over a period of 5 h, followed by a further 5 h at 600C. The samples, contained in mullite boats, were then fired in air at 1000C for 3 h."

[2] "The following doped oxides were prepared: NiO with 0.01 %, 0-1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) chromium, and NiO with initially 0.1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) lithium. The last two specimens were analyzed for lithium, after firing, by flame photometry; their concentrations had fallen to 0.8 and 2.8 atom % lithium respectively."

[3] "For their interpretation one must consider the variations in vacancy concentratian which accompany doping. Thus the rapid fall by nearly 50 % on the chromium side is attributable to the increase in cation vacancy concentration which chromium substitution produces. On the lithium side, the first small quantities fill the cation vacancies of the inherently non-stoichiometric NiO and a resistance to sintering should emerge."

[4] "The kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene to C02 and water have been studied between 400" and 515C over the same catalysts, but no analogous correlation with dopent type has been found in this case."

"The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO."

"Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

"In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

"Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

"Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[5] "Characterization with XRD, shown in Fig. 1, shows that the mixed NiNbO oxides with Nb content up to 15% relative to the total metal content exhibit diffraction lines corresponding to a crystalline NiO-like phase, as well as a broad band centered at 2u 278 attributed to highly disordered niobium phase."

[6] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology. The HRTEM image of the sample Ni0.9Nb0.1 (Nb/Ni ratio = 0.111) in Fig. 4 demonstrates a clear reduction of the crystallite size, while two relatively well-defined areas are recognized: a well-crystallized cubic phase of ordered structure (marked as I on Fig. 4) and a highly distorted phase II, which appears in small concentration throughout the sample."

[7] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."

[2] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[3] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[6] "This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."

[8] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence."

[9] "NiO is a well-known non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic deficiency. This property renders NiO a good p-type semiconductor with its conductivity being attributed to this cation deficiency"

[10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[11] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[3] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[4] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[6] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

[7] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

[8] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."

[9] "XRD measurements on Ni-doped ceria show no peaks corresponding to NiO. The structure is that of the CeO2 with a smaller lattice spacing (the ionic radius of Ni is smaller than that of Ce)."

[10] "The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%."

[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."

[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the supported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."

[4] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[5] "MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calcination at 670 C."

[6] "Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C."

[7] "This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH."

[1] "NiO nanoparticles that are highly active for the ethane activation have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method."

[2] "The catalysts obtained are promising catalytic materials for both, ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions."

[3] "For NiO,NiNbO mixed phases and acid sites are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation."

[4] "The Nano-series catalysts exhibit the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase for the appropriate activation of ethane and ammonia and their conversion into acetonitrile."

[5] "In the case of the Micro-series catalysts, the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on the Nb2O5 material results in a catalytic material that present good performance for the oxidative dehydration (ODH) reaction, which confirms that the NiNb interaction is efficient for ethane activation."

[6] "The phenomenon associated with the generation of defects by the catalytic reaction in the Nb2O5 powders at low temperatures could be related to the loss of oxygen that promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy defects (Vo)s in its structure."

[7] "The synthesis method for a given catalyst composition has a dramatic effect on performance."

[1] "The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support, followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum."

[2] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

[5] "NiO loaded on Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified."

[6] "Heracleous et al. have reported that Nb for NiONbnOm catalyst improves the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitates CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter"

[7] "NiO and MgO are well known to form solid solution. Parmalaina et al. have reported that a high calcination temperature at 800 C favors the diffusion of NiO on the surface of MgO to the inside of the MgO lattice to form solid solution"

[8] "To evaluate sizes and the amount of reducible NiO on MgO after calcination, the calcined catalysts were hydrogen reduced at 400 C, and then CO adsorption was measured by pulse technique. The results are shown in Table 2. The amount of CO adsorbed decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature, indicating that loss of reducible NiO and increase in the particle sizes."

[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[3] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[4] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[5] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[6] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

[7] "The reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

[8] "Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vanadium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox properties of vanadium species [15]."

[9] "There are several possible causes for deactivation of the catalyst: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2) active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3) active species are gradually poisoned with water generated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi H2O+CO2)."

[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[6] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[7] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

[1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

[5] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."

[6] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[1] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages"

          [2] "Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."

          [3] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

          [4] "In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH"

[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion, which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[6] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[7] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."

[8] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[9] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."

[1] "Mesostructured doped Ce1xMxO catalysts (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."

[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."

[3] "By analysis of H2-TPR and total OSC characterization profiles, the superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."

[4] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior"

[5] "More recently, we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the ODH of EB at ca. 450 C"

[6] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[6] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[7] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[8] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[9] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[10] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid."

[2] "The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%"

[3] "Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."

[4] "The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability."

[5] "The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity."

[6] "The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57/Al contains a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase. Centi et al. claimed that a non-stoichiometric rutile-type vanadium antimonate phase facilitates the redox transformation of vanadium."

[7] "The V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts studied here exhibit very high conversion (74–80%) and high selectivity (>95%) at an initial stage, while Sb/Al shows only 19.4% conversion for EB."

[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[6] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

[1] "Solutions of nickel nitrate (Johnson and Matthey Specpure) to which had been added solutions containing known quantities of lithium carbonate (dissolved in acetic acid) or ammonium chromate were evaporated to dryness. The mixtures were ground and decomposed to the oxides by slowly raising the temperature to 600C over a period of 5 h, followed by a further 5 h at 600C. The samples, contained in mullite boats, were then fired in air at 1000C for 3 h."

[2] "The following doped oxides were prepared: NiO with 0.01 %, 0-1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) chromium, and NiO with initially 0.1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) lithium. The last two specimens were analyzed for lithium, after firing, by flame photometry; their concentrations had fallen to 0.8 and 2.8 atom % lithium respectively."

[3] "For their interpretation one must consider the variations in vacancy concentratian which accompany doping. Thus the rapid fall by nearly 50 % on the chromium side is attributable to the increase in cation vacancy concentration which chromium substitution produces. On the lithium side, the first small quantities fill the cation vacancies of the inherently non-stoichiometric NiO and a resistance to sintering should emerge."

[4] "The kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene to C02 and water have been studied between 400" and 515C over the same catalysts, but no analogous correlation with dopent type has been found in this case."

"The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO."

"Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

"In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

"Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

"Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[1] "Low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."

[2] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[3] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[4] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[5] "Characterization with XRD, shown in Fig. 1, shows that the mixed NiNbO oxides with Nb content up to 15% relative to the total metal content exhibit diffraction lines corresponding to a crystalline NiO-like phase, as well as a broad band centered at 2u 278 attributed to highly disordered niobium phase."

[6] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology. The HRTEM image of the sample Ni0.9Nb0.1 (Nb/Ni ratio = 0.111) in Fig. 4 demonstrates a clear reduction of the crystallite size, while two relatively well-defined areas are recognized: a well-crystallized cubic phase of ordered structure (marked as I on Fig. 4) and a highly distorted phase II, which appears in small concentration throughout the sample."

[7] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."

[2] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[3] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[6] "This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."

[8] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence."

[9] "NiO is a well-known non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic deficiency. This property renders NiO a good p-type semiconductor with its conductivity being attributed to this cation deficiency"

[10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[11] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

[1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[3] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[4] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[6] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

[7] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

[8] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."

[9] "XRD measurements on Ni-doped ceria show no peaks corresponding to NiO. The structure is that of the CeO2 with a smaller lattice spacing (the ionic radius of Ni is smaller than that of Ce)."

[10] "The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%."

[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."

[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the supported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."

[4] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[5] "MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calcination at 670 C."

[6] "Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C."

[7] "This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH."

[1] "NiO nanoparticles that are highly active for the ethane activation have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method."

[2] "The catalysts obtained are promising catalytic materials for both, ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions."

[3] "For NiO,NiNbO mixed phases and acid sites are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation."

[4] "The Nano-series catalysts exhibit the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase for the appropriate activation of ethane and ammonia and their conversion into acetonitrile."

[5] "In the case of the Micro-series catalysts, the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on the Nb2O5 material results in a catalytic material that present good performance for the oxidative dehydration (ODH) reaction, which confirms that the NiNb interaction is efficient for ethane activation."

[6] "The phenomenon associated with the generation of defects by the catalytic reaction in the Nb2O5 powders at low temperatures could be related to the loss of oxygen that promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy defects (Vo)s in its structure."

[7] "The synthesis method for a given catalyst composition has a dramatic effect on performance."

[1] "The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support, followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum."

[2] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

[5] "NiO loaded on Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified."

[6] "Heracleous et al. have reported that Nb for NiONbnOm catalyst improves the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitates CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter"

[7] "NiO and MgO are well known to form solid solution. Parmalaina et al. have reported that a high calcination temperature at 800 C favors the diffusion of NiO on the surface of MgO to the inside of the MgO lattice to form solid solution"

[8] "To evaluate sizes and the amount of reducible NiO on MgO after calcination, the calcined catalysts were hydrogen reduced at 400 C, and then CO adsorption was measured by pulse technique. The results are shown in Table 2. The amount of CO adsorbed decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature, indicating that loss of reducible NiO and increase in the particle sizes."

[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[3] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[4] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[5] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[6] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

[7] "The reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

[8] "Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vanadium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox properties of vanadium species [15]."

[9] "There are several possible causes for deactivation of the catalyst: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2) active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3) active species are gradually poisoned with water generated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi H2O+CO2)."

[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[2] "Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lattice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases."

[3] "Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate, with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface."

[4] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[6] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[7] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

[1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

[5] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."

[6] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
