Preparation method: NiNbO mixed oxides are prepared using an evaporation method, allowing for the formation of a NiNb solid solution.\n\n2. Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111-0.18) lead to optimal catalytic performance, with a 100% increase in reactivity compared to pure NiO.\n\n3. Vacancy formation and electronic structure: NiO is naturally nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies. Incorporating Nb into the NiO lattice reduces this nonstoichiometry by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies. This modification decreases the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) responsible for total oxidation.\n\n4. Catalytic performance: The incorporation of Nb significantly improves the selectivity towards ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Nb acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in NiO and eliminating electrophilic oxygen species that cause total oxidation.\n\nKey challenges in these catalytic systems include:\n\n1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb dopants and the NiO lattice, and how these affect oxygen species formation and reactivity.\n\n2.
