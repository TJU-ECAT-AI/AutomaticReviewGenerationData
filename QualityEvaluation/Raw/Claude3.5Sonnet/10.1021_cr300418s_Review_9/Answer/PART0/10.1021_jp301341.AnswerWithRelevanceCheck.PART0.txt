          "The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO."

"Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

"In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

"Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

"Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping NiO with elements like Nb, Ti, and Al affects the energy required to form oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the catalyst's oxidation potential. For instance, doping NiO with NbO2 lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation compared to undoped NiO.

Low-valence dopants (LVDs) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid, which lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases to the surface. This can enhance the catalytic activity for breaking C-H bonds, which is crucial for dehydrogenation reactions.

However, the "moderation principle" is important in catalyst design. While doping can make oxygen removal easier, it shouldn't be too easy, as this can hinder the reoxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. Finding the right balance is key to optimizing catalyst performance.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the acid-base properties of the doped surfaces and their interactions with reactants. Process optimization involves finding the right balance of dopant concentration and oxygen vacancy formation to maximize catalytic activity while maintaining selectivity.

Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful consideration of the dopant type and concentration. While stronger Lewis acidity can increase reactivity, it may also lead to over-oxidation or undesired side reactions. Safety concerns may arise from the potential formation of highly reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。用Nb、Ti和Al等元素掺杂NiO会影响形成氧空位所需的能量，这对催化剂的氧化潜力至关重要。例如，用NbO2掺杂NiO比未掺杂的NiO降低了形成氧空位所需的能量。

低价掺杂剂（LVDs）使氧化物表面变成路易斯酸，这降低了氧空位形成的能量，并增加了各种碱与表面的结合能。这可以增强断裂C-H键的催化活性，这对脱氢反应至关重要。

然而，在催化剂设计中"适度原则"很重要。虽然掺杂可以使氧的去除更容易，但不应过于容易，因为这会阻碍气相氧对表面的再氧化。找到正确的平衡对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确预测掺杂表面的酸碱性质及其与反应物的相互作用。工艺优化涉及找到掺杂浓度和氧空位形成的适当平衡，以最大化催化活性同时保持选择性。

在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细考虑掺杂剂类型和浓度。虽然更强的路易斯酸性可以提高反应活性，但也可能导致过度氧化或不希望的副反应。安全隐患可能来自催化剂表面可能形成的高活性氧物种。
