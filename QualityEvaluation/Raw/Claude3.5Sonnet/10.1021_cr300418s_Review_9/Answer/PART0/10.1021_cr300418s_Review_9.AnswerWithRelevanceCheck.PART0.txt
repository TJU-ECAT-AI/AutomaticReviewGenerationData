          [1] "NiO prepared at 700 C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor."

[2] "Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

[3] "The NiO prepared by the solgel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO)."

[4] "At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is 47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is 66%."

[5] "Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins."

[6] "Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict."

[7] "Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility."

[8] "The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations."

[9] "XRD measurements on Ni-doped ceria show no peaks corresponding to NiO. The structure is that of the CeO2 with a smaller lattice spacing (the ionic radius of Ni is smaller than that of Ce)."

[10] "The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: Different preparation temperatures result in NiO with varying properties. NiO prepared at 700°C is stoichiometric, while NiO prepared at 450°C has Ni vacancies and is p-conducting. The sol-gel method produces NiO with high specific surface area, which increases further with Zr doping.

Dopant concentrations: Zr-doping in NiO improves catalyst performance. 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO show similar ethylene selectivities, all higher than undoped NiO. The optimal doping level appears to be around 10% Zr, balancing improved selectivity with maintained activity.

Vacancy formation: Ni vacancies in NiO prepared at lower temperatures contribute to its p-type conductivity and affect its catalytic properties. Zr doping influences vacancy formation and oxygen binding, leading to improved selectivity but potentially reduced activity.

Catalytic performance: Zr-doped NiO catalysts show improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to undoped NiO. For instance, at 50% ethane conversion, 10ZrNiO shows 66% ethylene selectivity compared to 47% for undoped NiO. The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430°C with an ethylene yield of 40% and selectivity of 66%.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately describing NiO using DFT is challenging, with uncertainties in the results. PBE+U with specific U values is used, but only trends can be reliably interpreted.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity is crucial. While Zr doping improves selectivity, it may reduce overall activity by increasing the temperature required for hydrogen consumption.

3. Mechanistic understanding: Determining the exact reaction mechanism (e.g., Mars-van Krevelen vs. adsorbed oxygen species) is challenging but necessary for rational catalyst design.

4. Efficiency, selectivity, and safety: Achieving high ethylene yields while maintaining selectivity and preventing over-oxidation is a significant challenge. The use of oxygen as an oxidant introduces safety concerns, requiring careful control of the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratio to prevent explosion risks.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：不同的制备温度导致NiO具有不同的性质。700°C制备的NiO化学计量比准确，而450°C制备的NiO具有Ni空位并呈p型导电。溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiO具有高比表面积，通过Zr掺杂可进一步增加。

掺杂浓度：NiO中的Zr掺杂改善了催化剂性能。5ZrNiO、10ZrNiO和20ZrNiO显示相似的乙烯选择性，均高于未掺杂NiO。最佳掺杂水平似乎在10%Zr左右，平衡了提高的选择性和保持的活性。

空位形成：在较低温度下制备的NiO中的Ni空位促进了其p型导电性，并影响其催化性能。Zr掺杂影响空位形成和氧结合，导致选择性提高但可能降低活性。

催化性能：与未掺杂NiO相比，Zr掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出更高的乙烯选择性。例如，在50%乙烷转化率下，10ZrNiO的乙烯选择性为66%，而未掺杂NiO为47%。在430°C下，10ZrNiO获得最佳性能，乙烯产率为40%，选择性为66%。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：使用DFT准确描述NiO具有挑战性，结果存在不确定性。使用特定U值的PBE+U方法，但只能可靠地解释趋势。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡至关重要。虽然Zr掺杂提高了选择性，但可能通过增加氢消耗所需的温度来降低整体活性。

3. 机理理解：确定精确的反应机理（例如，Mars-van Krevelen机理vs吸附氧物种）具有挑战性，但对于理性催化剂设计是必要的。

4. 效率、选择性和安全性：在保持选择性和防止过度氧化的同时实现高乙烯产率是一个重大挑战。使用氧气作为氧化剂引入了安全隐患，需要仔细控制氧气/烃比以防止爆炸风险。
