          [1] "The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support, followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum."

[2] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

[5] "NiO loaded on Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified."

[6] "Heracleous et al. have reported that Nb for NiONbnOm catalyst improves the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitates CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter"

[7] "NiO and MgO are well known to form solid solution. Parmalaina et al. have reported that a high calcination temperature at 800 C favors the diffusion of NiO on the surface of MgO to the inside of the MgO lattice to form solid solution"

[8] "To evaluate sizes and the amount of reducible NiO on MgO after calcination, the calcined catalysts were hydrogen reduced at 400 C, and then CO adsorption was measured by pulse technique. The results are shown in Table 2. The amount of CO adsorbed decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature, indicating that loss of reducible NiO and increase in the particle sizes."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethane to ethylene conversion.

Key aspects include:

1. Preparation method: Impregnation of supports with Ni(acac)2 ethanol solution, followed by vacuum drying, with 5 wt% Ni loading being optimal.

2. Support material: High-surface-area MgO (HS-MgO) was found to be particularly effective, allowing for the formation of NiO-MgO solid solutions.

3. Calcination temperature: Higher temperatures (around 800°C) promote the formation of NiO-MgO solid solutions, which affects NiO reducibility and particle size.

4. Particle size and dispersion: NiO particles around 7 nm, highly dispersed on HS-MgO, were most effective for ODHE.

5. Oxidation state: NiO is active for dehydrogenation, while metallic Ni promotes partial oxidation, highlighting the importance of maintaining the NiO phase.

6. Dopants: Addition of elements like Nb can improve NiO dispersion and facilitate C-H bond activation.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of complex catalyst structures and reaction mechanisms.
2. Process optimization to maintain desired NiO oxidation state and dispersion.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity at high conversion rates.
4. Ensuring safety in high-temperature, oxygen-rich environments.
5. Understanding and controlling NiO-support interactions and solid solution formation.
6. Developing methods for precise control of NiO particle size and distribution.
7. Investigating the role of oxygen vacancies and defects in catalytic performance.

          在氧化脱氢反应（如乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

关键方面包括：

1. 制备方法：将Ni(acac)2乙醇溶液浸渍到载体上，然后在真空下干燥，最佳Ni负载量为5 wt%。

2. 载体材料：高比表面积MgO（HS-MgO）被发现特别有效，允许形成NiO-MgO固溶体。

3. 煅烧温度：较高的温度（约800°C）促进NiO-MgO固溶体的形成，影响NiO的可还原性和粒子大小。

4. 粒子大小和分散度：在HS-MgO上高度分散的约7 nm大小的NiO颗粒对ODHE最有效。

5. 氧化态：NiO对脱氢反应有活性，而金属Ni促进部分氧化，凸显了保持NiO相的重要性。

6. 掺杂剂：添加Nb等元素可以改善NiO的分散性并促进C-H键活化。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 复杂催化剂结构和反应机理的理论建模。
2. 优化工艺以保持所需的NiO氧化态和分散度。
3. 在高转化率下平衡效率和选择性。
4. 确保在高温、富氧环境中的安全性。
5. 理解和控制NiO-载体相互作用和固溶体形成。
6. 开发精确控制NiO粒子大小和分布的方法。
7. 研究氧空位和缺陷在催化性能中的作用。
