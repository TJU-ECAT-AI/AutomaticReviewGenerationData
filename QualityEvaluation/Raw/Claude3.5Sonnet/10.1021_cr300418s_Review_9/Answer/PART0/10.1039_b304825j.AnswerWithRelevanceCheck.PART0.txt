          [1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid."

[2] "The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%"

[3] "Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."

[4] "The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability."

[5] "The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity."

[6] "The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57/Al contains a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase. Centi et al. claimed that a non-stoichiometric rutile-type vanadium antimonate phase facilitates the redox transformation of vanadium."

[7] "The V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts studied here exhibit very high conversion (74–80%) and high selectivity (>95%) at an initial stage, while Sb/Al shows only 19.4% conversion for EB."

          The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene reactions. However, it provides relevant insights on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant:

1. Preparation methods: Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride, along with tartaric acid.

2. Dopant concentrations: The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%. Different ratios of vanadium to antimony were tested, with V0.43Sb0.57/Al (V/Sb ratio of 0.75) showing the best performance.

3. Influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance: 
   - Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al significantly improved both activity and stability.
   - The formation of a new mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) enhanced the redox properties of the catalyst.
   - This facilitated the redox cycle, improving both activity and stability.
   - High conversion (74-80%) and selectivity (>95%) were achieved.

4. Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:
   - Balancing conversion and selectivity
   - Maintaining catalyst stability over time
   - Understanding complex interactions between vanadium and antimony species
   - Optimizing dopant ratios for maximum performance
   - Theoretical modeling of mixed oxide phases and their role in catalysis

While the study doesn't directly address theoretical modeling, process optimization, or safety concerns, it demonstrates the importance of understanding and optimizing the redox properties and stability of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          该文献并未直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂或乙烷制乙烯的反应。然而，它提供了关于使用CO2作为氧化剂的钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的相关见解：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将活性氧化铝与偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑的水溶液进行浸渍制备的，同时加入酒石酸。

2. 掺杂浓度：负载的金属氧化物总量约为20重量%。测试了不同的钒与锑比例，其中V0.43Sb0.57/Al（V/Sb比例为0.75）表现最佳。

3. 对电子结构和催化性能的影响：
   - 向V/Al中添加氧化锑显著提高了活性和稳定性。
   - 新的混合钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成增强了催化剂的氧化还原性能。
   - 这促进了氧化还原循环，提高了活性和稳定性。
   - 达到了高转化率（74-80%）和高选择性（>95%）。

4. 这些催化体系的主要挑战包括：
   - 平衡转化率和选择性
   - 长期维持催化剂稳定性
   - 理解钒和锑物种之间的复杂相互作用
   - 优化掺杂比例以获得最佳性能
   - 对混合氧化物相及其在催化中的作用进行理论建模

虽然该研究没有直接涉及理论建模、工艺优化或安全问题，但它展示了理解和优化金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的氧化还原性质和稳定性的重要性。
