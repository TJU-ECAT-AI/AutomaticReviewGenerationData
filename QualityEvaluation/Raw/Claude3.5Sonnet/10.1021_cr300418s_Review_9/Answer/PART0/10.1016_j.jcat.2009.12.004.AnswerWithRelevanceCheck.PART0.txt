          [1] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."

[2] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[3] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[6] "This work examines the effect of Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb and Ta on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni-based mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "O2-TPD experiments showed that increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces the non-stoichiometric oxygen due to the cation deficient nature of the host oxide, in complete agreement with the principle of controlled valence."

[8] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence."

[9] "NiO is a well-known non-stoichiometric oxide with cationic deficiency. This property renders NiO a good p-type semiconductor with its conductivity being attributed to this cation deficiency"

[10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[11] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the conversion of ethane to ethylene. Key findings include:

1. Dopant introduction modifies both the quantity and mobility of exchanged oxygen species in NiO.
2. The catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned through doping, depending on the nature and valence of the dopant.
3. Higher valence dopants create more positive charge in the NiO lattice, resulting in fewer oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.
4. Solid solutions are formed when foreign metals with suitable ionic radii are introduced into the NiO structure.
5. Increasing the valence of the foreign cation reduces non-stoichiometric oxygen and the lability of oxygen species.
6. NiO is a p-type semiconductor due to its cationic deficiency.
7. Higher valence dopants generally lead to higher initial selectivity for the desired product (e.g., NiNb showed 90% selectivity compared to NiLi with 19%).

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of different dopants on the electronic structure and catalytic properties of NiO-based catalysts.
2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability while considering factors such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios.
3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions and carbon oxide formation.
4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, which involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen at elevated temperatures.
5. Dopant selection and concentration: Identifying optimal dopants and their concentrations to achieve the desired balance of catalytic properties.
6. Characterization techniques: Developing and applying advanced methods to accurately analyze the electronic structure, oxygen species, and active sites in the catalysts.
7. Scalability: Translating laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale production while maintaining catalyst performance and process efficiency.
