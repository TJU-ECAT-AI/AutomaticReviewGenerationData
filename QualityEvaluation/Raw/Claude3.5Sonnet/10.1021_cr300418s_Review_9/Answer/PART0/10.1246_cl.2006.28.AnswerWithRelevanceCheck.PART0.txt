          [1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."

[2] "VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."

[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the supported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."

[4] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."

[5] "MgO-modified alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is an atomic ratio of Mg/Al  0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calcination at 670 C."

[6] "Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at 650 C."

[7] "This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH."

          The literature primarily focuses on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts supported on magnesia-modified alumina for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. While it doesn't directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts, it provides insights into how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and electronic structure influence catalyst performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods:
1. MgO-modified alumina supports are prepared by impregnating activated alumina with Mg(NO3)2.6H2O solutions, followed by calcination at 670°C.
2. Vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts are then prepared by impregnating the supports with NH4VO3 and SbCl3 solutions, followed by calcination at 650°C.

Dopant concentrations:
1. Mg/Al atomic ratios of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 are studied.
2. An appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al = 0.1) leads to stable catalyst activity.
3. Higher Mg content leads to lower surface acidity.

Electronic structure and catalytic performance:
1. The addition of Mg modifies the surface acidity of the catalysts.
2. Lower surface acidity is associated with easier desorption of olefins and improved catalyst stability.
3. VOx species mainly determine catalyst activity, while SbOx contributes to stability.
4. VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts show high selectivity for styrene (>95%).

Key challenges:
1. Balancing decreased acidity with the amount of active VSb oxide species.
2. Optimizing Mg content to achieve stable activity without significantly reducing the specific surface area.
3. Understanding the interplay between support modification, surface acidity, and dispersion of active species.

The study emphasizes the importance of finding a favorable balance between catalyst acidity and the amount of active species to achieve stable and active catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          这篇文献主要关注以二氧化碳为氧化剂，使用氧化镁改性氧化铝负载的钒-锑氧化物催化剂进行乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯。虽然它没有直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂，但它提供了关于制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和电子结构如何影响氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解。

制备方法：
1. 氧化镁改性氧化铝载体通过将活性氧化铝浸渍在Mg(NO3)2.6H2O溶液中制备，随后在670°C下煅烧。
2. 钒-锑氧化物催化剂然后通过将载体浸渍在NH4VO3和SbCl3溶液中制备，随后在650°C下煅烧。

掺杂剂浓度：
1. 研究了Mg/Al原子比为0.1、0.3和0.5的情况。
2. 适量的氧化镁（Mg/Al = 0.1）导致催化剂活性稳定。
3. 较高的Mg含量导致表面酸度降低。

电子结构和催化性能：
1. Mg的添加改变了催化剂的表面酸度。
2. 较低的表面酸度与烯烃更容易脱附和催化剂稳定性提高有关。
3. VOx物种主要决定催化剂活性，而SbOx贡献于稳定性。
4. VSb/Al和VSb/MgnAl催化剂对苯乙烯表现出高选择性（>95%）。

主要挑战：
1. 平衡酸度降低与活性VSb氧化物物种数量。
2. 优化Mg含量以实现稳定活性，同时不显著降低比表面积。
3. 理解载体改性、表面酸度和活性物种分散之间的相互作用。

该研究强调了在氧化脱氢反应中，找到催化剂酸度和活性物种数量之间的有利平衡以实现稳定和活跃的催化性能的重要性。
