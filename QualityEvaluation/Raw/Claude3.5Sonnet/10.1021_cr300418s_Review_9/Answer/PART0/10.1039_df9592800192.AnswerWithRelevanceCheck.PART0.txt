          [1] "Solutions of nickel nitrate (Johnson and Matthey Specpure) to which had been added solutions containing known quantities of lithium carbonate (dissolved in acetic acid) or ammonium chromate were evaporated to dryness. The mixtures were ground and decomposed to the oxides by slowly raising the temperature to 600C over a period of 5 h, followed by a further 5 h at 600C. The samples, contained in mullite boats, were then fired in air at 1000C for 3 h."

[2] "The following doped oxides were prepared: NiO with 0.01 %, 0-1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) chromium, and NiO with initially 0.1 %, 1 % and 5 % (atom %) lithium. The last two specimens were analyzed for lithium, after firing, by flame photometry; their concentrations had fallen to 0.8 and 2.8 atom % lithium respectively."

[3] "For their interpretation one must consider the variations in vacancy concentratian which accompany doping. Thus the rapid fall by nearly 50 % on the chromium side is attributable to the increase in cation vacancy concentration which chromium substitution produces. On the lithium side, the first small quantities fill the cation vacancies of the inherently non-stoichiometric NiO and a resistance to sintering should emerge."

[4] "The kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene to C02 and water have been studied between 400" and 515C over the same catalysts, but no analogous correlation with dopent type has been found in this case."

          The preparation methods for nickel oxide-based catalysts involve evaporating solutions of nickel nitrate with lithium carbonate or ammonium chromate, followed by decomposition to oxides at 600°C and firing at 1000°C. Dopant concentrations varied from 0.01% to 5% for chromium and 0.1% to 2.8% for lithium after firing.

Vacancy formation is influenced by the type and concentration of dopants. Chromium substitution increases cation vacancy concentration, while small amounts of lithium fill existing cation vacancies in non-stoichiometric NiO. This affects the sintering behavior and surface area of the catalysts.

The study found that doping influences catalytic performance for CO and H2 oxidation, but not for ethylene oxidation to CO2 and water. This suggests that the impact of electronic structure on catalytic performance depends on the specific reaction.

While this study does not specifically address oxidative dehydrogenation reactions like ethylbenzene to styrene or ethane to ethylene, it highlights the complex interplay between dopant type, concentration, vacancy formation, and catalytic performance. This complexity suggests that modeling and optimizing more complex reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation would be challenging.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety are not directly addressed in this study. However, the findings indicate that future research would need to focus on developing more comprehensive models that account for the various factors influencing catalytic performance, conducting in-depth studies on specific reactions of interest, and exploring a wider range of dopants and preparation methods to optimize efficiency, selectivity, and safety in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法包括蒸发含有碳酸锂或铬酸铵的硝酸镍溶液，然后在600°C下分解为氧化物，并在1000°C下焙烧。掺杂浓度从铬的0.01%到5%不等，焙烧后锂的浓度为0.1%到2.8%。

空位形成受掺杂剂类型和浓度的影响。铬替代增加阳离子空位浓度，而少量锂填充非化学计量比NiO中现有的阳离子空位。这影响了催化剂的烧结行为和表面积。

研究发现，掺杂对CO和H2氧化的催化性能有影响，但对乙烯氧化成CO2和水的影响不明显。这表明电子结构对催化性能的影响取决于具体反应。

虽然本研究并未特别针对乙苯到苯乙烯或乙烷到乙烯等氧化脱氢反应，但它突显了掺杂剂类型、浓度、空位形成和催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。这种复杂性表明，对更复杂的反应（如氧化脱氢）进行建模和优化将具有挑战性。

本研究没有直接讨论理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战。然而，研究结果表明，未来的研究需要集中在开发更全面的模型，考虑影响催化性能的各种因素，对感兴趣的特定反应进行深入研究，并探索更广泛的掺杂剂和制备方法，以优化氧化脱氢反应的效率、选择性和安全性。
