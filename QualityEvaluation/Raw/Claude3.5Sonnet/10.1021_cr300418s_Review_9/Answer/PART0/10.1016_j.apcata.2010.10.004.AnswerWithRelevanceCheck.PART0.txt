          [1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion, which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased"

[4] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[5] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[6] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+"

[7] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases."

[8] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[9] "The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for ethane to ethylene conversion:

1. Preparation methods: NiNbO catalysts are prepared with various Nb contents (0-19%). Using ammonium oxalato niobate as a niobium precursor introduces oxalate ions, which upon thermal decomposition, reduce NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and affect catalytic properties.

2. Dopant concentrations: Even small amounts of Nb cause a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb content, which is related to a decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

3. Vacancy formation: Nb spreads at the surface of the NiO phase, reducing the amount of accessible O- species. This decrease in strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species leads to high selectivity to ethylene.

4. Electronic structure: NiO is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes (p+) as main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple. The presence of Nb modifies the nature and number of active sites.

5. Catalytic performance: The efficiency of NiNbO catalysts in ethane ODH is related to the presence of dispersed O- species at the NiO surface in an amount high enough to convert ethane sufficiently but low enough to avoid total oxidation.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and catalytic performance.

2. Optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity, as increasing Nb content affects both the number and nature of active sites.

3. Preventing catalyst deactivation and developing effective regeneration methods.

4. Balancing safety concerns with efficiency, as the reaction involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen at high temperatures.

5. Developing more stable and efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through a multidisciplinary approach combining advanced characterization techniques, theoretical modeling, and process engineering.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能，特别是在乙烷到乙烯的转化过程中：

1. 制备方法：NiNbO催化剂的制备采用不同的Nb含量（0-19%）。使用铌酸铵草酸盐作为铌前体引入草酸根离子，其热分解会降低NiO的氧过量化学计量比，从而影响催化性能。

2. 掺杂浓度：即使少量的Nb也能导致转化率相对于纯镍氧化物大幅提高。最佳活性观察到的Nb含量为15%，这与非晶态Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

3. 空位形成：Nb在NiO相表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种数量。这种强氧化亲电氧物种的减少导致了对乙烯的高选择性。

4. 电子结构：NiO是一种p型半导体氧化物，其主要载流子为正孔（p+），与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对相关。Nb的存在改变了活性位点的性质和数量。

5. 催化性能：NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH中的效率与NiO表面分散的O-物种的存在有关，其含量要足够高以充分转化乙烷，但又要足够低以避免完全氧化。

这些催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和催化性能之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化活性和选择性之间的平衡，因为增加Nb含量会影响活性位点的数量和性质。

3. 防止催化剂失活并开发有效的再生方法。

4. 平衡安全concerns和效率，因为反应涉及在高温下使用易燃烃类和氧气。

5. 通过结合先进的表征技术、理论建模和过程工程的多学科方法，开发更稳定和高效的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
