12 Two Case Studies: Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene and Ethane
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
12.1 Introduction
While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions. For this reason, we thought that it would be useful to concentrate on two examples for which substantial information exists. Both examples are oxidative dehydrogenation reactions: one converts ethyl benzene to styrene, and the other converts ethane to ethylene.
12.2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation: Generalities
The dehydrogenation reactions examined here are both described by the formula
In one case R is a hydrogen atom, and in the other it is a phenyl group C6H5. Both reactions are endothermic, equilibrium limited, and take place at sufficiently high temperatures to require expensive technology. It is therefore tempting to perform the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of a compound that reacts with H2, thereby shifting favorably the thermodynamic equilibrium and diminishing the amount of heat necessary for the reaction.
A much-pursued variant of this scheme is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen to form water:
An alternative is to use CO2, to react with H2 and make CO and water (the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction, RWGS):
To our knowledge, the first coupling of a dehydrogenation reaction with a hydrogen consuming reaction is the Deacon process, (383, 384) which can be viewed as a oxidative dehydrogenation of HCl (2HCl + 1/2O2 → Cl2 + H2O).
A detailed comparison between ODH with O2 and with CO2 is best made separately, for each compound being dehydrogenated. There are however several aspects that are common to all dehydrogenation reactions. The use of CO2 has the advantage of producing CO and thus recovering some of the fuel capacity of the disappearing hydrogen; ODH with O2 produces water and no fuel. One can think of the ODH with CO2 as using CO2 as an oxidant, instead of O2. CO2 is less aggressive than oxygen, and it is less likely to react with the alkene produced by dehydrogenation. The amount of oxygen in the ODH feed with O2 is limited by the danger of explosion. This is not a problem in ODH with CO2. Unfortunately, ODH with CO2 is an endothermic reaction and requires net heat addition.
While the idea of coupling dehydrogenation with a hydrogen consuming reaction is appealing, the performance of the catalysts studied so far is not good enough for commercial use.
13 The Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Styrene, C6H5CH═CH2, is an important alkene used to make a variety of polymers. (385) It is prepared industrially by dehydrogenating ethylbenzene:
(1)
a reaction catalyzed by a mixture of Fe2O3 (40&ndash;90%) and K2O (5&ndash;30%) promoted with Cr, Ce, Mo, Ca, and Mg oxides. (385) There are many catalyst preparations that are variations on this theme, and Lloyd (2) mentions that 12&ndash;15 different iron oxide catalysts for this reaction are provided by various suppliers. The promoters are added in small amounts, and we do not know if they are dopants or small oxide clusters supported on the surface of the main oxides. The role of these promoters is explained in a review by Cavani and Trifiro. (386) The dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic, equilibrium-limited, and thermodynamically favored by high temperature and low pressure. Because the temperature used in industry ranges between 550 and 680 °C, one cannot use molten salts as a heat transfer agent, and the reactants are heated by injecting hot steam in the feed. Besides serving as a heat-transfer medium, the steam reduces coking, acts as a diluent (which favors product formation according to the Le Chatelier principle), and prevents the reduction of the iron oxide catalyst. The need to use at least 6&ndash;8 mol of steam per mole of ethylbenzene (387) is a major expense in styrene manufacturing. The conversion is 60&ndash;70%, and molar selectivity is 90&ndash;95%. (387) High conversion is particularly important for this system because the boiling point of ethylbenzene (136.2 °C) is very close to that of styrene (145.2 °C), and separation is difficult.
This is a demanding process that could stand improvement, and much work has been devoted to finding good catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene. As discussed in section 12.2, this can be done by using either O2 or CO2. In what follows, we discuss the use of doped oxides to perform these reactions.
14 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene Using CO2 as an Oxidant
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
14.1 Introduction
In 1968, Olson was granted a patent (388) suggesting that the conversion of ethylbenzene by dehydrogenation can be improved by coupling it with the reverse water&ndash;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Towler and Lynn (387) have calculated that at 600 °C and a CO2-to-ethylbenzene ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of ethylbenzene is 95%. If the dehydrogenation is performed under the same conditions, but in the absence of CO2, the equilibrium conversion is 67%. These calculations were made by assuming that no other reactions, besides eq 1 and RWGS, take place in the system, which is true only if the catalyst is very selective. Because of this assumption, the equilibrium yield of styrene calculated in this way is an upper limit.
The reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction is endothermic, so heat must be provided externally, but the cost of heating CO2 is smaller than that of heating steam, which is a significant advantage. Producing CO recovers to some extent the fuel lost by consuming the hydrogen, which is not the case when O2 is used as oxidant.
A large number of papers have used oxides (389-416) or “mixed oxides” (390-392, 394, 395, 399-401, 403, 407-411, 413, 415, 417-427) as catalysts for the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene. Many of the papers using mixed oxides did not intend to make substitutionally doped oxides. In most cases, their goal was to create two phases of two oxides, one basic (to adsorb and perhaps activate CO2) and one acidic (to activate the dehydrogenation of the ethylbenzene). Many examples are offered by the work in Park’s group (390-392, 394, 403, 424-426) that studied ZrO2 mixed with TiO2, or with MnO2, (391) with SnO2, (392) or with vanadium oxide (394) or with TiO2 or with K2O, (390) and vanadia supported on Al2O3 mixed with MgO, P2O5, Cr2O3, MoO3, Sb2O3. (426) Reviews of this work are available. (424, 425) As a rule, the mixed oxides (two phase system) performed better than the individual, unmixed oxides. It is possible that these catalysts contained some amounts of doped oxides, but this has not been documented or suggested.
We will not discuss work on mixed oxides further and concentrate on papers that intended to prepare doped oxide catalysts or are likely to have done so. Given the fact that so many oxides have fairly good activity for styrene preparation by ODH, it is natural to ask whether doping them might increase their activity.
14.2 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation in the Presence of CO2, Catalyzed by Doped Oxides
14.2.1 Experimental Results
There is little work that attempted deliberately to prepare doped oxides and test them for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2. Ren et al. (415) studied TiO2 and TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg, and Gao et al. (420) used ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2. We examine Fe-doped TiO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2 together because in both cases the dopants are LVDs. TiO2 is reducible and ZrO2 is not, but this should not play an essential role in the chemical effects caused by the low-valence dopants.
Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same sol&ndash;gel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant). For example, the surface of TiO2 is 21.7 m2/g, that of Fe1Ti is 98.0 m2/g, and that of Fe3Ti is 61.1 m2/g. Here, we use the notation of Ren et al., (415) and Fe3Ti means that 3% of the Ti atoms were replaced with Fe. The XRD measurements detected no crystalline iron oxide. The undoped TiO2 made by the sol&ndash;gel method has an anatase structure. The presence of Fe results in a compound whose structure is a mixture of anatase and rutile; Fe7Ti is almost entirely rutile. This suggests that some of the Fe is atomically dispersed inside the TiO2 grains because it is unlikely that Fe will induce this phase transformation if all Fe atoms introduced in the system form small iron oxide clusters on the surface (which are not detectable in XRD).
The reactivity of these catalysts, for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2 as oxidant, was measured at a temperature of 550 °C, a pressure of 0.1 MPa, W/F = 40 gcat h/mol, a CO2/ethylbenzene ratio of 1:1, and a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%. The undoped TiO2 converted 5.4% of the ethylbenzene, with a styrene yield of 5.4%. If we do not take into account the change of surface area caused by doping, it would seem that Fe3Ti is more effective in converting ethylbenzene than TiO2. However, the area per gram of Fe3Ti is 98 m2/g, while that of TiO2 is 21.7 m2/g. If we calculate the ethylbenzene conversion per unit area then, by this measure, TiO2 is about as active as Fe3Ti; the main effect of the dopant on conversion is to increase the area per gram. However, the dopant improves selectivity, at the same conversion per area, which is 83.0% for TiO2 and 96.4% for Fe3Ti. The styrene yield is independent of area, and the better styrene yield on Fe3Ti indicates that selectivity benefits from doping.
Aside from low conversion, a further disappointment is the low stability of the catalyst: the conversion drops from 19.4% to 8.6% after 2 h on stream. TGA experiments on the catalyst after the reaction show that the catalyst coked. However, reoxidizing the catalyst did not restore the ethylbenzene conversion fully, which suggests that additional factors are involved in deactivation.
Gao et al. (420) prepared Ga-doped ZrO2 by coprecipitation. We follow below their notation, in which 10GZ means ZrO2 doped with Ga and having 10% Ga2O3 by weight. The properties of ZrO2 and those of 5GZ, 10GZ, 15GZ, and 20GZ were studied. XRD, Raman, and UV&ndash;vis measurements support the assumption that Ga-doped zirconia has been prepared even though one has not ruled out the possibility that Ga is present in the form of very small GaOx clusters on the surface. Reactivity tests were performed with a gas mixture with the molar ration of N2/CO2/ethylbenzene = 361/19/1, at a temperature of 600 °C, with a flow rate of 60 mL/min. All catalysts tested were heated for 2 h at 600 °C in N2 flow before performing the ODH reaction.
The conversion of ethylbenzene catalyzed by ZrO2 is 16.8%, and the selectivity is 100%, which gives a styrene yield of 16.8%. The ethylbenzene conversion increases by adding Ga, and the selectivity decreases slightly (it is in the nineties for all GZ catalysts). The best styrene yield is 34.3%, catalyzed by 15GZ. The yield increases with increased amount of Ga up to 15GZ and then decreases for 20GZ. This is common with many doped oxides: when too much dopant is added, the activity is lost. Doping with Ga increases the conversion, however, as the area per gram of 15GZ is 53.9 m2/g, while that of ZrO2 is 19.0 m2/g. The conversion per area of catalysts is higher for ZrO2 (0.88) than for 15GZ (0.63). The selectivity on ZrO is slightly better. We conclude therefore that ZrO2 doped with Ga is a worse catalyst than ZrO2, and both have very low performance. It is unfortunate that the ethylbenzene conversion decreases with the time on stream, and after 4 h it is ∼15%.
Ren et al. (415) prepared TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg. Among these, Fe3Ti is most active. The measurements on V3Ti, Zr3Ti, and Mg3Ti show that all of them have higher conversion and better selectivity than TiO2. When compared to each other, they have similar performance. In light of the computational results in other systems, this is surprising, given the fact that the V is a high-valence dopant, Mg is a low-valence dopant, and Zr has the same valence as Ti.
We caution that the experiments described here were very limited in scope and look only at a narrow range of parameters (dopant concentration, method of preparation, gas composition, temperature, etc.). The conclusions we draw are temporary, and further experiments may change the situation.
14.2.2 Are These Results Consistent with What We Know from Calculations?
Unfortunately, we have no systematic calculations for the systems discussed in this section. From calculations on other systems, we know that low-valence dopants lower the energy of vacancy formation and will make the oxide a better oxidant. Corma et al. (234, 329, 428) have shown that this is also true for anatase doped with Fe, which is close to one of the systems we discuss here. We also know that the easier it is to remove an oxygen atom from the surface layer, the more reactive is that atom. In particular, the oxide doped with a low-valence dopant (LVD) should break a C&ndash;H bond more efficiently than the undoped one. This should be the case for Ga-doped zirconia and Fe-doped TiO2. This prediction would be best tested by doing TPR experiments with ethylbenzene to determine the temperature of the onset of reaction with the doped oxide and the undoped one. Such measurements are not available for the systems reviewed in this section. The situation is more complicated for steady-state experiments. The oxide catalyst is reduced by ethylbenzene, and it is oxidized by CO2. Because CO2 is a poor oxidant, the rate of reduction is likely to be faster than the rate of reoxidation of the surface, and the catalyst under working condition is likely to be the reduced doped oxide. Doping with an LVD makes the reduction of the oxide more facile. This qualitative prediction could be tested by running the reaction at steady state and then suddenly stopping the feed, sending oxygen pulses through the catalyst bed, and measuring the oxygen consumption. As far as we know, such experiments have not yet been performed on these systems.
The next question is why Mg-, Zr-, and V-doped titania are less active than the Fe-doped sample. By analogy with calculations performed on other systems, we expect that doping with Zr will have a small effect on catalytic chemistry because its oxide is very similar to TiO2 (same valence, same structure). Calculations on CeO2 doped with a high-valence dopant have shown that the dopant loses electrons, which reduce a Ce atom from a formal charge of 4+ to 3+. If this happens for TiO2, which is a reducible oxide similar to CeO2, the V dopant will be tetravalent, and this means that the chemistry of the V-doped TiO2 surface is similar to that of TiO2. The formal charge of Mg is 2+, and a few calculations on other systems of this type showed that when the valence of the dopant is lower by 2 than the valence of the cation it substitutes, the energy for making an oxygen vacancy near the dopant is either very small or exothermic. Therefore, the doped oxide may have lost the active oxygen by the time the system reaches the temperature at which ethylbenzene is activated. These speculations may explain why Zr, V, and Mg dopants are less efficient than Fe.
Coupling the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction is worth exploring further. Doping oxide catalysts, to improve their performance for this reaction, has received little attention. Very few oxide&ndash;dopant pairs have been examined, and no attempt was made to optimize the performance of those studied so far. No computations have been performed specifically for this reaction system, and the analysis performed here is based on analogy with other systems.
15 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene by Using Oxygen and Doped Oxide Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
As we have emphasized, the use of oxygen to react with the H2 shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction favorably. An obvious disadvantage is that an aggressive molecule such as oxygen might react with styrene, reducing selectivity. Danger of explosion and fire limits the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used. Burning hydrogen, which is a valuable product, may also diminish the economic appeal of the process.
Sivarajani et al. (412) prepared vanadium-doped titania, Ti1&ndash;xVxO2, by the combustion method. The values of x in the above formula were 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15, but these are calculated on the basis of the amount of V present in the precursors. The authors caution that some V may have been lost by evaporation during calcination. In their preparation method, they used urea as a fuel to avoid carbon contamination.
No vanadium oxide peaks were observed in XRD, and the material is a mixture of rutile and anatase structures. Neither Raman nor IR measurements find evidence for the formation of VOx clusters supported on TiO2. The electron binding energies of Ti2p3/2, V2p, and O1s were measured by XPS. The Ti peaks were assigned to Ti4+, and there is no mention of the presence of Ti3+, which would be expected if the V dopant donates electrons to Ti. The XPS measurements were interpreted to mean that V dopants have a formal charge of 5+. Calculations (262) have shown that a V atom substituting a Ti atom in the surface layer will bind oxygen from the gas phase, and the dopant is the V═O group formed during calcination. In this compound, V is 5+ and it is possible that the surface-sensitive XPS measurements detect this group. This is consistent with the fact that no Ti3+ was detected. Another way of saying the same thing is to note that a V atom substituting a Ti atom is a Lewis base; given the chance to transfer an electron to Ti4+ or to oxygen, it will chose the oxygen, which is the stronger Lewis acid. (221)
Doping with V causes an increase in area per gram, as compared to that of TiO2 prepared by the same method.
The styrene yield on all doped oxides is higher than that of undoped TiO2, but unfortunately the performance deteriorates rapidly with the time on stream. Sivarajani et al. performed a careful analysis of the catalyst after the reaction. They found that the structure of the working catalyst is converted entirely to the rutile, which does not affect performance. No V2O5 was detected in the XRD spectra of the spent catalyst, and the XPS measurements detected coke on the surface. Calcination in air for 20 min at 500 °C restores activity, which suggests that the main reason for deactivation is coking.
These experiments show that doping TiO2 with V improves performance, but the lack of stability is a serious limitation. If process economics justifies the added cost, the catalyst can be moved continuously out of the reactor, decoked, and moved back into the reactor. Such a procedure is used for several industrial catalytic processes.
Fan’s group (413) studied ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene with oxygen, catalyzed by CeO2 doped with Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni. All doped oxides had a 10% molar ratio of dopant to cerium. They were prepared by a template-assisted method, (429, 430) which makes a disordered mesoscopic solid. The Ni-doped ceria catalyst was also prepared by oxalate-gel coprecipitation to determine how the preparation method affects catalytic performance.
The best catalyst in this group is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which gives an ethylbenzene conversion of 70% and a selectivity to styrene of 75%, at a temperature of 450 °C, O2/ethylbenzene ratio = 0.8, and space velocity = 250 mL/gcat/min. Changing the space velocity to 418 mL/gcat/min lowers the conversion to 64%, but increases the selectivity to 86%. Increasing the temperature increases the conversion but decreases selectivity. The performance of the catalyst decreases if the Ni content is lower or higher than 10% molar. It is likely that the performance can be improved by a more thorough optimization of the catalyst and of the reaction conditions.
The performance of all other materials tested by Fan et al. is worse than that of Ni0.1Ce0.9O2. The selectivity is roughly the same, but the conversion is lower. The order of catalysts by their conversion at 450 °C is
However, this scale was made without normalizing the conversion to surface area. If we perform that normalization (we divide the conversion by the specific area), Zr-doped and Al-doped ceria are slightly more active than CeO2, because CeO2 has the highest area per gram of all of the materials studied here. It is interesting to note that for other methods of preparation, doping increases, almost always, the specific area of the catalyst; the method of preparation used by Fan et al. is an exception from this rule.
The method of preparation makes a difference. Ce0.9Ni0.1O2 made by oxalate-gel coprecipitation has a conversion of 40.8%, which is much lower than that of the same composition prepared by the template-assisted method. However, the BET area of the material made by coprecipitation is 71 m2/g, and that of the material made by the template method is 134 m2/g. If one scales the conversion by the area, the sol&ndash;gel material has better performance.
All Ni-doped catalysts are stable for 12 h on stream: neither the conversion nor the selectivity change, and the mesostructure of the catalyst is maintained. It is interesting that the activity of the mesoscopic undoped CeO2 decreases due to structural deterioration (414) and doping with Ni suppresses or at least slows this process.
XRD measurements on Ni-doped ceria show no peaks corresponding to NiO. The structure is that of the CeO2 with a smaller lattice spacing (the ionic radius of Ni is smaller than that of Ce).
H2-TPR measurements show a dramatic change upon doping with Ni. For CeO2, the TPR signal (hydrogen consumption) is very broad, while that for Ni-doped CeO2 has a sharp peak at a much lower temperature. While we are not aware of any calculations of Ni-doped ceria surfaces, all calculations in which the dopant has a lower valence than the cation it replaces show that the dopant makes the oxygen atoms in the surface more reactive. This means that the dissociative adsorption of H2 and the removal of water (with the creation of an oxygen vacancy) are facilitated by the presence of the LVD. This is consistent with the H2-TPR results.
The temperature programmed reaction of oxygen with the Ni-doped ceria catalyst that spent 12 h on stream was accompanied by TGA measurements. These show that no carbon deposits were present on the catalyst. The reaction is not catalyzed by carbon deposits, as has been sometimes suggested.
Both Ce3+ and Ce4+ are observed in the XPS spectrum, and this is consistent with a Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism. The hydrogen released by the hydrocarbon reacts with a surface oxygen atom desorbing as water and leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show (188, 268) that an oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by the reduction of two Ce4+ ions to Ce3+, and this will account for the presence of both ions in the catalyst (after use).
As a rule, we expect that replacing Ce with a tetravalent dopant does not have a dramatic effect on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation or on the reactivity of the oxide. Calculations on Zr-doped ceria (229, 255, 334, 362) show that the presence of Zr makes it easier to make oxygen vacancies and make the oxygen atoms near the dopant more reactive. If the rate-limiting step in ODH is the breaking of a C&ndash;H bond in ethylbenzene, then the presence of Zr should improve the catalytic activity. This is not what the experiments find. However, if we normalize for differences in surface area, then Zr-doped ceria has roughly the same activity as CeO2.
In general, the presence of an LVD, like Al, is expected to make the surface a better oxidant. This is true, but Al overdoes it: calculations by Nolan (190) show that the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al-doped ceria is exothermic. This means that the catalyst loses one oxygen atom next to the dopant when it is heated. We are not aware of any calculations that examine whether the oxygen atoms remaining on the surface (after on O-vacancy has been made) are still activated by the presence of Al. The acid&ndash;base rules proposed by us (221) suggest that this will not be the case.
16 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene

Ethylene is produced by steam cracking of naphtha, or light petroleum products or natural gas rich in ethane. (431) Early contributions to steam cracking were made by Dubbs father and son. In a moment of excessive enthusiasm for industrial organic chemistry, Dubbs father named his son Carbon. One would think that upon reaching maturity, the son might want to change his name: he did and became Carbon Petroleum Dubbs. His daughters were named Methyl and Ethyl.
More ethylene is produced in the world than any other organic compound. The value of the product compensates for numerous shortcomings of the process: it is performed at high temperature (∼850 °C), it is endothermic and requires prodigious amounts of heat, it produces significant amounts of CO2, it is economical only if the units are of enormous size, the technology is complicated by a residence time of milliseconds (the gas velocity exceeds the speed of sound), and the composition of the products cannot always be adjusted to track changes in the demand. These difficulties stimulate the need for new processes for ethylene production, such as oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen or CO2. Several reviews of alkane ODH are available. (7, 432-434)
To be competitive with steam cracking, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene ought to have (433) high selectivity and productivity higher than 1.0 kg C2H4/gcat/h. The best catalyst found so far is Mo&ndash;V&ndash;Te&ndash;Nb oxide, (435, 436) which achieves 87% conversion and 89% selectivity. We are not aware of a commercial application of this catalyst.
We dedicate substantial space to ethane ODH on NiO or doped NiO catalysts because they are the most extensively studied doped-oxide catalysts for this reaction. (126, 127, 437-441) These articles provide information on ethane ODH catalysis by undoped NiO and NiO doped with Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Zr, Ta, and Nb. We have thus an opportunity to study, for one reaction and one host oxide, how catalytic performance changes with the dopant and the method of preparation of the catalyst. We do not review here work (442-445) on undoped NiO supported on other oxides; we are interested in undoped and unsupported NiO for comparing it to unsupported, doped NiO.
17 Background Information on NiO
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Nickel forms (446) one stable oxide, NiO, which has the sodium chloride structure. Ni2O3 exists, is a strong oxidant, and is much less stable than NiO. The heat of formation of NiO is small, and it should be a good oxidant as compared to most other oxides. NiO prepared at 700 °C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 °C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor. (58, 447) The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. (58, 447) The two holes may be localized on either two oxygen atoms or on two Ni atoms. (448, 449) In a chemist’s language, the presence of a Ni vacancy will create either O&ndash; or Ni3+ ions. Density functional theory has been used to examine Ni vacancies in the surface of NiO. The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations.
Pacchioni’s calculations (454) show that if a Ni vacancy is present on the (100) surface of NiO, two holes are localized on the oxygen atoms. However, NiO is particularly easy to cleave (159) along the (100) surface, and this suggests that this is not a reactive face. For this reason, we have examined Ni vacancies on the Ni(011) face. When a Ni vacancy is present on the surface of NiO(011), the Fermi level shifts toward the top of the valence band, which indicates that the vacancy is a p-dopant, as expected. The empty orbitals at the top of the valence band are localized on the oxygen atoms next to the Ni vacancy. Therefore, formally the formation of a Ni vacancy at the surface results in the creation of two O&ndash; ions. We note that by creating two holes localized on the oxygen atoms, a Ni vacancy is equivalent to an LVD. This means that the surface having a Ni vacancy is a strong Lewis acid and is a better oxidant than NiO that has no Ni vacancies. As in the case of all LVDs, it is possible that the presence of a Lewis base (e.g., H or C2H5) on the surface will compensate the effect of the Ni vacancy. (145, 221) In particular, it is reasonable to expect that H binds to the two O&ndash; atoms near the Ni vacancy to form two hydroxyls. We know no experimental evidence for or against this possibility.
18 Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation with Oxygen Catalyzed by Zr-Doped NiO
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a sol&ndash;gel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 °C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 °C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 °C for 6 h. Pure ZrO2 was not tested, but it is unlikely that it will catalyze ethane ODH at the temperature used in this work (T ≤ 400 °C). The amount of precursors was chosen so that the molar ratio 100 Zr/(Zr+Ni) was equal to 5, 10, 20, 40, and 75.
The XRD measurements found that 5Zr and 10Zr have the structure of NiO. The notation 5Zr indicates Zr-doped NiO with the molar ratio 100 Zr/(Zr + Ni) = 5. The lattice parameter of NiO increased with the addition of Zr, whose ionic radius (0.72 Å) is larger than that of Ni (0.69 Å). No ZrO2 diffraction pattern was observed for Zr molar fractions less or equal to 10%. These results suggest that a Zr-doped NiO has been prepared when the dopant concentration is less or equal to 10%. In the XRD of 20Zr, one can see ZrO2 diffraction peaks. Because the catalytic activity of 20Zr is essentially the same as that of 10Zr, we suggest that 20Zr consists of a Zr-doped NiO phase (rather than an undoped NiO phase) and a ZrO2 phase.
The NiO prepared by the sol&ndash;gel method mentioned above has a high specific area of 90 m2/g. Doping with Zr increases the specific area to 122 m2/g (for 5ZrNiO) and 170 m2/g (for 10ZrNiO). Later in this section, we show that the catalytic activity of undoped NiO depends strongly on the method of preparation. (126, 438, 440, 441)
Reactivity experiments were performed (126) at temperatures between 250 and 450 °C. The feed was a mixture of ethane, oxygen, and nitrogen (C2H6/O2/N2 = 1/1/8) with a space velocity of 30 000 mL/h·gcat. NiO starts converting ethane (126) at ∼275 °C, and between 270 and 350 °C, it converts more ethane than any of the Zr-doped catalysts. The ethylene yield on NiO at 350 °C is 23% with ethylene selectivity of 47%; CO2 and ethylene were the only products. Unfortunately, at temperatures above 350 °C, the selectivity for ethylene is rapidly and completely lost. One suspects that the oxide also deactivates at lower temperatures, but it does so more slowly.
The performance of the NiO and ZrNiO catalysts can be best judged from a plot (Figure 8) of selectivity to C2H4 versus ethane conversion. (126) A point in the graph gives the conversion and the selectivity at a given temperature. Different points correspond to different temperatures. The conversion increases with temperature (up to 400 °C). At any given conversion, the ethylene selectivities of 5ZrNiO, 10ZrNiO, and 20ZrNiO are close to each other and substantially higher than that of NiO. For example, at a 50% ethane conversion the ethylene selectivity of NiO is ∼47%, while that of 10ZrNiO is ∼66%. It is clear that doping improves the selectivity and therefore the overall performance for ethane ODH. The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 °C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%.
While 5ZrNiO and 10ZrNiO consist of one phase with the NiO structure, 20ZrNiO consists of a phase with NiO structure and a second phase which is ZrO2. It appears that the phase with NiO structure, in this two-phase 20ZrNiO system, is a doped nickel oxide because the activity of 20ZrNiO is very close to that of 10ZrNiO (which consists of one phase with NiO structure) and because a mixture of NiO and ZrO2 has the same activity (126) as NiO, which indicates a lack of synergy between NiO and ZrO2.
Zr-doped NiO behaves as calculations lead us to expect from an irreducible oxide doped with a high-valence dopant. Doping with Zr improves the selectivity to ethylene substantially, makes the oxide less reducible, and binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, just as the calculations predict. We are not aware of any calculations on Zr-doped NiO. However, on the basis of calculations on similar systems (e.g., high-valence dopants (HVDs) in irreducible oxides), we expect the following. Because the only stable oxide of zirconium is ZrO2, Zr is a high-valence dopant (in NiO) and will act as a strong Lewis base. This can affect the system in several ways. Because NiO has a tendency to have Ni vacancies, they may be present even though we doped the oxide. In the absence of Zr, these Ni vacancies make NiO a better oxidant, and some authors assume that this is why NiO is an effective alkane combustion catalyst. A Zr dopant, which is a strong Lewis base, is very likely to transfer electrons to the electron&ndash;holes associated with the Ni vacancies. Put in another way, Zr will transfer electrons to the O&ndash; centers created when the Ni vacancy was formed, converting it to O2&ndash;. Thus, the presence of Zr is likely to decrease ethane oxidation.
In addition to diminishing the reactivity caused by the Ni vacancies, Zr will increase the binding energy of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide surface. This is equivalent to making these oxygen atoms less reactive. Temperature programmed hydrogen reduction (126) experiments support this suggestion. Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins. Therefore, if the rate-limiting step in ethane ODH is the dissociative adsorption of ethane, to make a hydroxyl and an ethoxide with the oxygen atoms on the surface (Mars&ndash;-van Krevelen mechanism), the presence of Zr should make this reaction more difficult. This is not necessarily bad, because Zr will also limit the reactivity of the doped oxide with ethylene: a loss in conversion may be a gain in selectivity.
Our ability to anticipate the mechanism without detailed calculations on this specific system is diminished by the fact that the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism is not the only possibility. As we have already explained, high-valence dopant adsorbs O2 from the gas phase. If the binding energy of the O2 to the dopant is not very large, the adsorbed O2 is reactive and can break the C&ndash;H bond in an alkane. We are not aware of any calculation in which this possibility has been examined for Zr-doped NiO. Experiments with 18O2 are sometimes able to distinguish which of these two mechanisms is operative (i.e., reaction with O2 adsorbed on Zr or reaction with surface O), but they have not been performed for this system. Experiments on hydrogen TPR and oxygen desorption from NiO and Zr-doped NiO are of help. They show that doping with Zr makes the oxide less able to consume hydrogen or to release oxygen. This suggests that Zr acts as a typical high-valence dopant (without O2 adsorbed on it).

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. 

Preparation methods:
1. Various techniques are employed, including sol-gel methods, impregnation, and dry nanodispersion.
2. The sol-gel method using citric acid can produce catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods [10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005].
3. A novel dry nanodispersion method has been used to prepare highly active NiO nanoparticles dispersed on different Nb2O5 materials [10.1002/cctc.201100115].

Dopant concentrations:
1. Small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111-0.18) lead to optimal catalytic performance, with a 100% increase in reactivity compared to pure NiO [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002].
2. For Zr-doped NiO, the best performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO catalyst, yielding 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity [10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.01.120].
3. In Ce-based catalysts, 10 mol% Ni demonstrated the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of ethylbenzene [10.1016/j.apcata.2011.08.001].

Vacancy formation and electronic structure:
1. NiO is naturally nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies. Incorporating dopants like Nb reduces this nonstoichiometry by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002].
2. Dopants modify the quantity and mobility of exchanged oxygen species in NiO [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004].
3. Higher valence dopants create more positive charge in the NiO lattice, resulting in fewer oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004].

Catalytic performance:
1. The incorporation of Nb significantly improves the selectivity towards ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002].
2. Zr-doped NiO catalysts show improved selectivity for ethylene in ethane ODH compared to undoped NiO [10.1021/cr300418s\_9].
3. The Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst showed superior performance in ethylbenzene ODH due to improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity [10.1016/j.apcata.2011.08.001].

Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice is challenging. DFT calculations on NiO systems have encountered difficulties, requiring the use of specific methods like PBE+U [10.1021/cr300418s\_9].

2. Process optimization: Balancing activity, selectivity, and stability while considering factors such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios is crucial [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004].

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing desired product yield while minimizing undesired side reactions and carbon oxide formation is a significant challenge [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004].

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, which involves flammable hydrocarbons and oxygen at elevated temperatures, requires careful control of reaction conditions [10.1021/cr300418s\_9].

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale production while maintaining catalyst performance and process efficiency is a major challenge [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has shown significant progress, particularly in improving selectivity and stability through careful dopant selection and preparation methods. The interplay between dopants, vacancy formation, and electronic structure offers a rich field for further exploration and optimization.

Future research directions may include:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions.
2. Development of multi-component catalysts that combine the beneficial properties of different dopants to further enhance performance.
3. Exploration of novel preparation methods, such as atomic layer deposition or electrospinning, to achieve more precise control over catalyst structure and composition.
4. Integration of machine learning and high-throughput screening methods to accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization.
5. Investigation of sustainable and economically viable sources for dopants to ensure long-term industrial feasibility.
6. Development of more sophisticated theoretical models that can accurately predict catalyst behavior across a wide range of conditions and compositions.

By addressing these challenges and exploring new avenues, the field of nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has the potential to significantly impact industrial processes, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly production of valuable chemical intermediates.
