Abstract
The formation, structure and transport properties of LixNi1xO solid solutions with x 0.3 are described. Pure stoichiometric nickel
oxide is a green insulator compound with rocksalt structure. When Li+ partially substitute the normal sites of Ni2+, a hole is introduced
in the form of Ni3+ or Oto keep charge neutrality conditions, and the oxide becomes a black semiconductor. For Li atomic fraction
x > 0.3 a rhombohedral distortion of the cubic structure by partial lithium and nickel ions ordering on alternate 1 1 1planes takes place,
giving rise to a hexagonal structure. Some questions, regarding the hole state, the ordering and vacancy presence in the solid solutions, are
discussed. The effect of Li content in the solid solutions on the most typical charge-and-mass transport properties, as electrical conductivity,
thermoelectric power and chemical diffusivity, is reviewed.

1. Introduction
Lithium nickel oxide solid solutions (LixNi1xO) are
an important class of materials whose chemical, magnetic
and transport properties have been extensively studied.
LixNi1xO enjoys wide applications as cathode for molten
carbonate fuel cells, due to its high electrical conductivity
together with good oxygen exchange kinetics [14], and
as material for electrochromic display devices [5,6]. More-
over, it is a potential material for thermoelectric power
applications [7,8] and for use as ceramic sensor [9]. Finally,
studies of Li-doped Ni/MgO catalysts have been performed
because alkali promoters, such as lithium, affect the re-
ducibility, the morphology, the active surface area and the
electronic properties of Ni/MgO catalyst [1012].
Pure stoichiometric nickel oxide is a green insulator com-
pound with rocksalt structure. NiO is antiferromagnetic, the
spin in one particular set of succeeding 1 1 1planes be-
ing antiparallel [1315]. When Li+ partially substitute the
normal sites of Ni2+, a hole is introduced in the form of
Ni3+ or Oto keep charge neutrality conditions, and the
oxide becomes a black semiconductor. For Li atomic frac-
tion x > 0.3 a rhombohedral distortion of the cubic struc-
ture by partial lithium and nickel ions ordering on alternate

1 1 1planes takes place, giving rise to a hexagonal structure
[16]. The crystal structure and magnetic properties of lay-
ered LixNi1xO with x > 0.3 and other complex oxides of
the LiMO2 series (M = transition 3d metal) were reviewed
by Kellermann [17]. The present work deals with the forma-
tion, structure and transport properties of cubic LixNi1xO
solid solutions with x 0.3.
2. Formation
Many papers have been devoted to the formation of
LixNi1xO solid solutions. Solid state reaction of Ni2+
precursor and Li2CO3 in air in the temperature range
700900 C is the method commonly used to obtain
LixNi1xO solid solutions. The reactions of nickel oxide
and metallic nickel with lithium carbonate have been ex-
tensively studied [16,1831]. The formation of the solid
solution from NiO and Li2CO3 powder mixture takes place
as in the following reactions:
Li2CO3 Li2O + CO2
(1)
1
2xLi2O + (1 x)NiO + 1
4xO2 LixNi1xO
(2)
with the formation of x holes in the form of Ni3+ or O.
Accordingly, the oxygen atmosphere promotes the solid so-
lution formation. Goodenough et al. [16] studied the forma-
tion of LixNi1xO with x in the range 00.48. LixNi1xO

solid solution with x 0.3 were prepared by solid state re-
action of NiO and Li2CO3 at 800 C in air, while for x >
0.3 other methods were used. They observed that the cubic
phase is maintained up to x = 0.3; then an eight-fold in-
crease in the unit cell volume occurs between x = 0.30 and
0.38, and finally a hexagonal phase is obtained for x > 0.38.
A linear relation of the cell volume and Li atomic fraction
in all the range of compositions, independent of the phase
change, was obtained, as reported in Fig. 1.
According to Verwey et al. [32], the decrease of the unit
cell with increasing Li content is due to the difference in
ionic radius between Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions. Iida [18] prepared
LixNi1xO by thermal treatment in the temperature range
650800 C of an NiO/Li2CO3 powder mixture with nomi-
nal lithium atomic fraction x = 0.21. He observed that the
bulk diffusion of lithium oxide in nickel oxide takes place
at a fast rate at temperatures higher than 750 C. As at these
temperatures the solution of lithium oxide in nickel oxide is
in competition with the evaporation of lithium oxide, the Li
content of the resulting solid solution is always lower than
the nominal composition.
Li loss during the formation of LixNi1xO from metal-
lic Ni and Li2CO3 at 745 and 830 C was also observed
by Antolini [19]. The Li loss was due to the vaporisation
of both free and NiO-dissolved lithium oxide. As shown in
Fig. 2, Li loss is negligible after thermal treatment at 745 C
for 48 h of mixtures with nominal Li atomic fraction <0.28
and at 830 C for 48 h of mixtures with nominal x < 0.08.
Moore and White [20] prepared Li-doped NiO by solid state
reaction of NiO and Li2CO3 at 800 C in air for 3 h. The
relationship between the Li2O content present in unreacted
mixture of NiO and Li2CO3 and the Li2O content found to
have dissolved in the NiO after thermal treatment is shown
in Fig. 3. It can be denoted that the maximum take-up of
Li2O occurred with 10 wt.% Li2O in the original mixture
and was only 4.5 wt.%. Moreover, they found that unreacted

NiO was always present with LixNi1xO solid solution, the
lattice parameter of the solid solution decreasing with in-
creasing Li2CO3 content in the starting mixture. After re-
firing at 950 C NiO disappeared and a solid solution with
increased lattice parameter was observed, indicating the dif-
fusion of Li from the surface to the interior of NiO particle.
According to the authors, the most probable cause of the
decrease in lithia take-up with high Li2CO3 contents and
of the retention of undoped NiO after the initial firing was
that penetration of atmospheric oxygen into NiO pellets has
been obstructed by the presence of liquid carbonate in the
voids between the particles.
The presence of a Li2CO3 liquid phase giving rise to
the sintering of LixNi1xO for x > 0.2 was observed by
Antolini and Giordani [21,22] during the synthesis of the
solid solution from metallic Ni and Li2CO3. Fig. 4 shows

synthesis at 700 and 750 C, respectively (Li2CO3 melting
temperature 723 C). Shrinkage by liquid phase sintering
occurs at 750 C for samples with appreciable Li2CO3
amount (x > 0.2).
The lithiation of NiO surface followed by Li+ diffusion
into the interior of the oxide particle was observed also by
Sata [23]. He fired NiO and Li2CO3 in flowing oxygen at
500 C (x = 0.1 and 0.2) and at 600 C (x = 0.3 and 0.4).
As shown in Fig. 5, the x-value of the specimen surface
increased from the original value of the starting mixture
at an early stage, then decreased with time to the original
x-value, except for x = 0.4. Lithium carbonate first reacts at

the surface rich in oxygen gas to form a solid solution rich in
x, leaving unreacted NiO in the bulk. Then, the dissolution
proceeds to the interior of the NiO grains, decreasing to an
average value of x.
Lin et al. [24] studied the kinetics and the mechanism of
LixNi1xO formation from NiO and Li2CO3. They found
that LixNi1xO formation is a thermally activated process,
and the reaction activation energy is estimated to be about
190 kJ mol1. According to the authors, the formation of
the solid solution can be viewed as the combination of two
reactions: the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ accompanied by
the creation of cation vacancies, and the filling of lithium
ions into the cation vacancies created. The rate-determining
step is considered to be the creation of nickel vacancies and
can be described as

The defect notations here and so on are similar to those
used by Kroger and Vink [33]. Marini et al. [25] studied the
formation of LixNi1xO by solid state reaction of metallic
Ni and Li2CO3 up to 870 C. They found that for x < 0.12
solid solution formation is rate-determined by nickel ox-
idation. This is an exothermic reaction, and if a phase
boundary locally forms between NiO and Li2CO3 particles,
a controlled carbonate decomposition can take place, as a
consequence of the energy release due to nickel oxidation.
Carbonate decomposition should take place in the entire
temperature range of nickel oxidation, with a rate totally
modulated by the rate of nickel oxidation. Lithium oxide
produced in this way should directly enter solid solution and
should then be interested to a short-range surface diffusion.
So, solid solution formation should take place in an ordered
way. This mechanism leads to solid solution formation at
lower temperatures than those required both for bulk diffu-
sion of lithium oxide into nickel oxide and for spontaneous
carbonate decomposition. A different situation arises when
appreciable amounts of spontaneously decomposed lithium
carbonate are present (x > 0.20). In these cases the solid
solution is obtained by a much more disordered process.
Antolini [26] studied the way of formation of LixNi1xO
with x = 0.06 by solid state reaction of Ni and Li2CO3 at
temperatures in the range 400900 C. The configuration of
Ni particles at various temperatures was the following:
• 400 C: Ni particle coated with LixNi1xO layer;
• 500 C: NiO grain coated with LixNi1xO layer;
• 700 C: bulk LixNi1xO with x < 0.06 and surface
LixNi1xO with x > 0.06;
• 900 C: homogeneous LixNi1xO with x = 0.06.
Fig. 6 shows the dependence of Li content in the outer
and inner part of nickel oxide particle on synthesis temper-
ature. LixNi1xO formation from Ni/Li2CO3 powder mix-
ture seems to be a three-step process: (1) formation of an
outer layer of LixNi1xO; (2) formation of an inner layer of
undoped NiO; (3) diffusion of lithium ions from exterior to
the bulk of NiO particle. Other studies on the synthesis of

LixNi1xO with x = 0.2 and 0.3 from Ni/Li2CO3 system
[27,28] indicated the formation of a Li-rich external phase
followed by the diffusion of lithium ions into the bulk of NiO
particle. The formation of these solid solutions occurs with
morphological changes. A considerable grain growth takes
place in the first stages of the thermal treatment at 800 C up
around 27 h. For longer times no appreciable grain growth
seems to occur, and the only morphological change is con-
stituted by a certain particle rounding [28]. In short, in both
cases (metallic nickel or nickel oxide as precursor) the pro-
cess of lithiation takes place in two steps: formation of a
Li-rich solid solution at NiO grain surface followed by Li dif-
fusion into the interior of the particle. In addition to serving
as a Li source, lithium carbonate acts as pore former [29,30].
As shown in Table 1, the values of Hg porosity and
true porosity from density measurements indicate that the
Li2CO3 presence in the starting mixture gives rise to the
formation of micropores, but does not affect the number
of mesopores and macropores of the resulting LixNi1xO
solid solution. The way of Li2CO3 decomposition affects
the microstructure of LixNi1xO particle obtained from
Ni/Li2CO3 powder mixture [31]. Carbonate decomposition
requires CO2 evolution. The higher the amount of Li2CO3
decomposition taking place under non-modulated Ni oxida-
tion and then uncontrolled conditions (at high temperature
and in the presence of high Li2CO3 amount), the lower the
LixNi1xO density, owing to the voids in the microstructure
formed by uncontrolled CO2 evolution.

Toussaint [34] prepared LixNi1xO solid solutions by fir-
ing mixtures of NiO and Li2O2 at 1000 C in sealed cru-
cibles. He observed that at room temperature the structure
of NiO and LixNi1xO for x < 0.12 is rhombohedral, while
for 0.12 < x < 0.35 is cubic.
The coprecipitation method was used by Sato et al. [9]
for the synthesis of LixNi1xO solid solutions. The mixtures
of Ni(NO3)2 and LiNO3 aqueous solutions with the desired
proportions were evaporated to dryness, and then calcined
at 750 and 850 C for 48 h.
Belhomme et al. [35] prepared LixNi1xO with 0 <
x < 0.5 by a soft chemistry route. An aqueous solution
of nickel nitrate was added to a solution of lithium hy-
droxide in NH4OH. The gelatinous green precipitates were
thermally treated, resulting in a powder, which then were
calcined in a tubular furnace at 700 C for 5 h in flowing
oxygen.
2.1. NiO electro-oxidation in molten carbonates
In molten carbonate fuel cells the conductivity of NiO
cathodes is enhanced by doping in situ with Li provided
by the Li2CO3 component of the molten carbonate elec-
trolyte. Thus the electro-oxidation in molten carbonates
was extensively studied [3646]. In molten carbonates the
formation of LixNi1xO can be formally attributed to the
electro-oxidation [36]:

Li incorporation in NiO according to the reaction (4) pro-
ceeds in smooth electrodes at potentials higher than 0.6 to
0.3 V [37] and higher than 0.24 V in porous electrodes
[38]. An interesting method to evaluate the time dependence
of the lithiation process is to follow the open-circuit poten-
tial of a nickel foil in molten Li/K carbonates. The increase
in the potential value up to 100 s corresponds to a region, ac-
cording to Nishina et al. [39], where an NiO layer is formed
and the lithiation process has not yet taken place. Afterwards
a stable potential was observed owing to the lithiation pro-
cess. According to the authors, the presence of a potential
arrest in the open-circuit potential decay confirms that the
lithiation is not a simple incorporation of lithium ions, but
an electrochemical process involving the oxidation of Ni2+
to Ni3+ in the NiO lattice. The potential will change dras-
tically if the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+, i.e. the lithiation
process, is finished. The period of stable potential, related to
lithiation rate, was as long as the partial pressure of carbon
dioxide [40,41]. The presence of lithiated compounds was
confirmed by atomic adsorption [39] and X-ray diffraction
analysis [41] performed following the open-circuit potential
treatment. By adsorption spectroscopy of in situ lithiated
NiO, Li atomic fraction at equilibrium xeq was estimated to
be 0.010.04 [4345], but these works did not consider the
distribution of Li+ into NiO.

Tomczyk et al. [46] studied the lithiation of NiO
monocrystals in molten Li/Na carbonate eutectic in the pres-
ence of oxygen. They determined the Li concentration as a
function of the distance from the NiO surface. The results
are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the Li concentration
is highest near the NiO surface and decreases rapidly in the
interior of the monocrystal. Data on the effective resistance
Reff of NiO electrodes confirmed the non-homogeneous
lithiation of nickel oxide in molten carbonates [47]. Reff of
ex situ lithiated electrodes with x = 0.02 was lower than
that of in situ lithiated electrodes, because of a different Li
distribution within their volume. In the first case, the interior
of the electrode and its surface layer are both electrically
conductive, acquiring some Li content during fabrication
and, additionally, from the melt during the experiments. In
the second case, the interior of the electrode consists of
pure NiO, and Li is present only in the surface layer of
the monocrystal, which probably consists of a skin effect
of current flow and, as a consequence, in a comparatively
higher effective ohmic resistance of this electrode.
To explain the results of a voltammetric study on NiO
lithiation in molten carbonates, Malinovska et al. [41] as-
sumed the presence of a non-homogeneous Li distribution
in the NiO lattice. Lithium dissolution in molten carbonates
takes place in Li-rich solid solutions. Post-test analyses of
LixNi1xO solid solutions with high Li content (x > 0.20)
immersed in molten carbonates showed that lithium content
was less than the initial composition [48]. Fig. 7 shows the

change of x in LixNi1xO with molten carbonate fuel cell
operating time. Finally, Belhomme et al. [35] indicated that,
whatever the initial oxide, poor or rich in Li, the Li content
in LixNi1xO, after 48 h immersion in melt Li/Na carbon-
ates, reaches a value close to x = 0.05.
3. Structure
The structure of the LixNi1xO solid solutions with x <
0.3 is based on the cubic rock salt structure of the parent
nickel oxide, where Li and Ni are distributed statistically
in the octahedral sites of the close-packed oxygen lattice
(disordered NaCl-type structure).
3.1. Hole state
A first question has to do with the nature of the hole
state introduced by Li doping. The magnetic properties of
LixNi1xO have generally been described by the presence
of low-spin d7 Ni3+ as the species charge compensating
for the Li+ ions [16,49,50]. As the controlled valency
model [32], the positive holes (Ni3+) are attracted to the
Li+ ions, which have an effective negative charge. From
measurements of the Seebeck effect and electrical conduc-
tivity, van Houten [51] inferred that the holes are localised
at nickel atoms. Morin [52] suggested that Li+ ions are
not compensated by Ni3+ ions only, but to some extent
also by Oions. Later, many authors [5359] concluded
that the hole state is localised at oxygen rather than at
nickel atoms, thus the charge compensating state is better
described as Orather than Ni3+. Kuiper et al. [54] used
calculations involving the energy of a pre-edge peak in
the lithium nickel oxide oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption
near-edge structure spectrum to estimate a partial density
of holes of about 0.7 on oxygen, with the remainder on
nickel.
The same result was obtained by Mackrodt et al. [59]
from HartreeFock calculations. First-principles periodic
HartreeFock calculations of the ground state electron dis-
tribution and empty oxygen p states in LixNi1xO with
x = 0.125 and 0.25 provided direct evidence of oxygen p
holes in Li-doped NiO. Pickering et al. [60] deduced the
kind of charge compensating state from the 2.9 Å NiNi
bond length by LixNi1xO nickel K-edge extended X-ray
absorption fine structure fitting. If the holes are present pre-
dominantly as Ni3+, then the NiNi distance will depend
on the fraction of nickel which is Ni3+, i.e. on x/(1 x).
Conversely, if the holes are present predominantly as O,
then the NiNi distance will depend on the fraction of
oxygen which is O, i.e. on x.
As shown in Fig. 8, the NiNi bond length shows an
excellent linear fit as a function of x/(1x), thus suggesting
that the Ni3+ state is closer to reality. This relationship is also
observed for the 5.9 Å NiNi interatomic distance. These
controversial conclusions indicate that further studies are

needed to elucidate the nature of the hole state in lithium
nickel oxides.
3.2. Ordering
The second question involves the presence of some degree
of order in LixNi1xO solid solutions with x 0.3, partic-
ularly in the range 0.25 < x 0.3. A rhombohedral distor-
tion of the cubic structure occurs for x > 0.3, indicative of
lithium nickel ordering on alternate 1 1 1planes. For x <
0.3 LixNi1xO is antiferromagnetic. Transition to ferrimag-
netic behaviour occurs at x = 0.3 and the magnetic moment
per Ni atom has been related to the distribution of Ni atoms
between the two 1 1 1layers [16]. Stoyanova et al. [61] in-
vestigated the magnetic interactions in LixNi1xO with x =
0.3 by electron paramagnetic resonance to obtain a more de-
tailed elucidation of the cation distribution. They assumed
the presence of a structural subunit as a sandwich-type clus-
ter formed by ordering of part of the Li+, Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions
in alternating 1 1 1cubic planes. These clusters are embed-
ded in a disordered NaCl-type structure and their amount
sharply decreases with rising preparation temperature.
Pickering et al. [62] evaluated an ideal value of x at
cubic-to-hexagonal transition using neutron powder diffrac-
tion analysis for the distortion of various LixNi1xO solid
solutions from an ideal cubic cell, expressed as the percent-
age deviation (P) in c/a (hexagonal lattice parameter ratio)
above the ideal, where P = 100[c/2(6)1/2a 1]. The re-
sults indicated that the distortion decreases with decreasing
x and increases with temperature. Extrapolating the curves
to P = 0 for each temperature gives values of x of 0.313
for the cubicrhombohedral transition in LixNi1xO. The
same authors evaluated the variation in metaloxygen bond
lengths with x, as shown in Fig. 9, showing how the two sites

ter as x increases. On the same graph is shown the average
of the two bond lengths, and also the observed bond lengths
of LixNi1xO samples with low x, where Li distribution is
thought to be random. Both sets of data fall close to the
same straight line, as might be expected for a continuous re-
placement of 2Ni2+ with Li+ and Ni3+. Although the data
in the partially ordered region are insufficient to make an
extrapolation with confidence, the results suggest that some
degree of order is still present for x < 0.3.
The synchrotron results for a sample with x = 0.268
which is cubic still show the presence of superlattice re-
flexions though they are broad and diffuse. It thus appears
that the solid solution phase may be metrically cubic, but
it still retains remnants of the alternation of occupancies of
the 1 1 1planes. They determined for the sample with x =
0.32 an order parameter of 0.91 (Ni occupancy) for the Li
distribution in Ni-rich A-plane and the presence of a small
amount of Ni3+ on the Li-rich B-site. From the formation
mechanism of LixNi1xO solid solutions with x = 0.3 and
0.44, Antolini and Ferretti [27] assumed for x > 0.3 the ex-
istence of an equilibrium relationship between cubic disor-
dered and hexagonal ordered LixNi1xO phases having the
same x. The phase equilibrium was shifted towards the cubic
phase by decreasing x in LixNi1xO. The presence of this
orderdisordered phase equilibrium also for x < 0.3 can-
not be excluded. The coexistence of hexagonal and cubic
LixNi1xO phase with different Li content following Li2O
evaporation was detected by Azzoni et al. [63].
Corti et al. [64], studying the LixNi1xO phase transi-
tion during Li evaporation, inferred that for total x 0.3,
the formation of an ordered Li-rich phase (x in the range
0.330.36) and a disordered Li-poor phase (x in the range
E. Antolini / Materials Chemistry and Physics 82 (2003) 937948
943
0.200.24) takes place. Antolini [65] ascribed the difference
in x-value between hexagonal and cubic phases to a differ-
ent Li vaporisation rate. The metastable hexagonal phase
present in the samples with total x < 0.3 is formed as Li2O
evaporation rate from the cubic phase is higher than both
Li2O evaporation rate from the hexagonal phase and phase
transition rate. Following thermal treatment at 750 C of the
samples with x < 0.3, homogeneous cubic single phase was
obtained. In the absence of Li loss, lithium ion migration in
the cubic phase and subsequent phase transition led to the
formation of cubic disordered single phase. In conclusion,
the presence of an ordered phase imbedded in a disordered
phase can depend on both:
(a) non-homogeneous Li distribution (the ordered phase is
Li-rich);
(b) homogenous Li distribution (the amount of ordered and
disordered phases depending on x in LixNi1xO and
formation temperature).
3.3. Defects
The third question is whether the presence of lithium
in nickel oxide affects the creation of cation vacancies
in the material. Few studies are addressed to this ques-
tion. Nickel oxide is considered to be a metal-deficient
non-stoichiometric compound. Often it contains excess
oxygen [6668], with a majority defect pair constituted
by doubly ionised Ni vacancies and electron holes, as in
the relation (3). As Marini et al. [25], the formation of Ni
vacancies takes place during synthesis of LixNi1xO with
x > 0.2 from Ni and Li2CO3. Formation of Ni vacancies
in LixNi1xO with 0.15 < x < 0.3 occurs also by Li loss
from solid solution with nominal x > 0.3 [69].
The dependence of vacancy concentration on nominal
Li content and thermal treatment temperature is shown in
Table 3. It must be denoted by the following: (1) thermal
treatment being equal, there is a tendency to increase the
vacancy concentration by increasing the lithium content in
the starting mixture. (2) Nominal composition being equal,
the vacancy concentration increases by increasing the tem-
perature of the thermal treatment. It must be noted that solid

but also different chemical stability.
4. Transport properties
4.1. Electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity σ of NiO is proportional to the
concentration of positive holes [h•] in the lattice according
to the relation:
σ = e[h•]
(5)
where e is the electronic charge and  the mobility of posi-
tive holes. For undoped non-stoichiometric NiOx with x > 1
the electrical conductivity depends on oxygen partial pres-
sure and varies from 104 to 101 1 cm1 at 727 C [70].
The electrical conductivity increases in a remarkable way
by doping NiO with lithium ions [51]. Fig. 10 shows the de-
pendence of the electrical conductivity at room temperature
on Li atomic fraction x in LixNi1xO. As can be seen, a re-
markable increase in the electrical conductivity occurs fol-
lowing introduction into NiO lattice of very low Li amount
(x < 0.001); then it has an almost linear slight increase of
the conductivity with x up to 0.2. According to Koide [71],
the electrical conductivity of single-crystal LixNi1xO is al-
most constant above x = 0.03. It has to be pointed out that
the mechanism of p-type semiconduction in NiO is a con-
troversial problem. Many studies have been carried out to
elucidate electrical conduction mechanism in both pure and
Li-doped NiO.
There are two proposed models for the conduction
mechanism: thermally activated hopping of small polarons
[66,67,71,72], and band-like conduction of holes [7376].

According to van Houten [51], the wandering of a hole
through the lattice can be treated as a thermally activated
diffusion process with a mobility:
 = ed2ν0 exp(Ea/kT)
kT
(6)
where d is the shorter interatomic distance between two Ni
ions, ν0 the reciprocal of the vibrational period of the lattice
(of the order of 1013 s), k the Boltzmanns constant, T the
absolute temperature, and Ea is the activation energy of the
jumping of a hole between normal Ni ions. The mobilities at
room temperature calculated in this way vary from 2×105
to 6 × 104 cm2 V1 s1. From Eqs. (5) and (6) we obtain
σ = C
T exp
Ea
kT
(7)
where C is a constant proportional to [h•]. With increasing Li
content into NiO lattice the electrical conductivity increases
owing to both the increase of the holes ([h•] = [Li+]) and
the decrease of the activation energy Ea.
Fig. 11 shows the dependence of Ea on x in LixNi1xO in
the temperature range 27227 C. It is seen that the activa-
tion energy at first decreases sharply with x, and later much
more slowly. As shown in Table 4, in the temperature range
35 to 350 C Ea for undoped NiO is about 48 kJ mol1,
while for Li-doped NiO the activation energy for conduction
is in the range 1424 kJ mol1. The Arrhenius plot of the
electrical conductivity data presents three inflection points,

at temperatures 35/50 C, 250/337 C (Nel point) and
790 C (Mitoff knee), corresponding to four different acti-
vation energies (Table 4). The transition at the Nel tem-
perature was attributed to a change in elastic properties of
the crystal [77]. Also above the Nel temperature the activa-
tion energy for pure NiO was higher than that for Li-doped
nickel oxide [20]. The transition at 790 C corresponds to the
knee found by Mitoff [72], and attributed to freezing-in of
the defects responsible for conduction. Mitoff showed that
above the knee the crystal is in equilibrium with the atmo-
sphere and the activation energy includes both the energy
to form defects and the energy for motion of the holes. Be-
low the knee, since the concentration of the holes is con-
stant, only the activation energy for movement of these is
involved. The activation energies above the knee increased
with increasing Li content in the solid solution and were in
the range 3168 kJ mol1, the same order as that observed
with NiO (45 kJ mol1) [20].
Koumoto et al. [78] evaluated the dependence of electri-
cal conductivity of LixNi1xO with x = 0.002 on oxygen
partial pressure PO2 in the temperature range 8001400 C.
They found that the electrical conductivity becomes inde-
pendent of both temperature and oxygen partial pressure as
decreasing PO2, while at rather high PO2 it is dependent both
on temperature and PO2. Assuming that the hole concentra-
tion is fixed by dopant in the low PO2 region, they calculated
a value of the hole mobility in the present temperature range
of 0.43 cm2 V1 s1. The temperature-independent hole mo-
bility indicates that no activation energy is needed for hole
conduction. This result was explained considering the con-
duction of holes taking place in a rather wide band instead
of a thermally activated hopping of small polarons. Electri-
cal conductivity and Seebeck effect in the temperature range
27800 C were studied by Wu et al. [79] in Li and (Li+Ca)
NiO. Semiconductor-metal transition was observed in their
samples.
4.2. Seebeck effect
The experimental dependence of the Seebeck coefficient
(thermoelectric power) α on temperature was measured on
LixNi1xO samples with x = 0.002 [78], x = 0.024 [80]
and in the range 0.050.2 [51]. In the temperature range
173 to 1000 C both van Houten [51] and Shin and Mu-
rayama [80] noted, at low temperature, a decrease of α with
increasing temperature up to a minimum at about 400 C;
then a very slight increase occurred at high temperatures. In
E. Antolini / Materials Chemistry and Physics 82 (2003) 937948
945
the temperature range 8001400 C Koumoto et al. [78], in-
stead, observed a remarkable increase of the Seebeck coef-
ficient with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient
is generally expressed by the following equation:
a =
 1
eT
(EF + AkT)
(8)
where EF is the energy of the Fermi level and AkT is a kinetic
energy transport term. The value of this term is usually low
and can be neglected. EF is given by
EF = 1
2kT ln
Nv
h•
+ 1
2Ea
(9)
where Nv = Nv0 2[h•] is the effective density of states
at the transport level, where Nv0 is 5.5 × 1022 cm1 for
NiO, and Ea is the energy difference between the Ni2+
and the Ni3+ levels. From Eqs. (8) and (9) and the exper-
imental value of α, van Houten obtained a value of Ea of
3.4 kJ mol1, in agreement with the formation of Ni3+. This
result is not in agreement with the assumption that the con-
duction takes place in the oxygen band. In this case Ea would
be much larger (about 24 kJ mol1), giving a much sharper
decrease of α with increasing temperature. Koumoto et al.
[78] explained the high increase of α with increasing tem-
perature with the band conduction mechanism. In this case
the effective density of states is proportional to T3/2. From
Eqs. (8) and (9), the Seebeck coefficient at fixed temperature
seems to depend on lithium atomic fraction as log(12x)/x.
Fig. 12 shows the dependence of α on log(1 2x)/x at
40 C; as expected, a linear dependence is obtained.
For high-temperature application in a thermoelectric gen-
erator, an important parameter is the power factor PF = σα2.
Li-doped NiO has high electrical conductivity but low ther-
mopower. To increase the thermopower, additional Na dop-

4.3. Chemical diffusion (lithium loss and sintering)
4.3.1. Lithium loss
As indicated in Section 2, lithium oxide loss occurs from
the solid solution at high temperatures. The question relates
to the diffusion mechanism and the kind of diffusing species.
Iida [81] firstly evaluated lithium loss from LixNi1xO with
x = 0.13 at temperatures higher than 1000 C. He found that
the evaporation of lithium oxide from the solid solution is
a diffusion-controlled process, governed by a parabolic law.
The activation energy was 209 kJ mol1 in the temperature
range 12001400 C. Antolini [82] studied the kinetics of
Li2O evaporation from LixNi1xO with x = 0.23 and 0.26
at 870 C. From the dependence of Li loss on time (presence
of two straight lines), he inferred that in the initial stage
of vaporisation Li loss occurs by grain-boundary diffusion,
then for long times by volume diffusion.
Sata [23] investigated lithium oxide vaporisation from
LixNi1xO with x ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 at relatively low
temperatures between 400 and 700 C. The loglog plots of
vaporisation weight loss per unit surface area versus time
at each temperature consist of two or three straight lines.
The slopes in the first and second stages increased with in-
creasing x and increasing temperature, as shown in Table 5.
In the third stage the vaporisation stopped. The x-values in
the specimens decreased linearly from the surface to the in-
terior along the specimen thickness. An activation energy
of 344 kJ mol1 obtained for the initial time of the second
stage corresponds to the heat of reaction from Li2O(c) to
Li2O2(g) vapour. From the increase in slope value for the
respective stage, the inverse gradient of x and halt of the va-
porisation at the third stage, Sata inferred that the formation
of Li2O2 and its diffusion in the body may be related to the
