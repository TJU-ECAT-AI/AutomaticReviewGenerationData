The given literature does not contain information specifically related to nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document primarily discusses the chemistry of oxides doped with lower valence cations (LVDs) and their effects on oxygen reactivity and surface chemistry. It does not address preparation methods, dopant concentrations, or catalytic performance of nickel oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene or ethane dehydrogenation. The literature also does not cover theoretical modeling challenges, process optimization, or safety considerations for these specific catalytic systems. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided document.
