[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[6] "Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: A modified sol-gel method was used to prepare NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents. This method allowed for better control of particle size and dopant distribution.

2. Dopant concentration: The doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts. The best yield to ethylene was obtained with 10% NiZrO catalyst, showing 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity.

3. Electronic structure: Strong interactions between Ni and Zr were observed, which affected the reducibility of the catalyst and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species. This interaction led to a shift in reduction peaks to higher temperatures and made NiZrO catalysts more difficult to reduce to Ni metal.

4. Catalytic performance: The interaction between Ni and Zr resulted in the active site Ni tending to adsorb O− species rather than non-selective O2− species, which favored increased ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopant concentration and distribution on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity by fine-tuning dopant concentrations and preparation methods.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene yield while preventing deep oxidation and ethane cleavage reactions.

4. Safety: Ensuring stable catalyst performance at high temperatures without deactivation or formation of potentially hazardous by-products.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备了不同Zr含量的NiZrO纳米颗粒。这种方法能更好地控制粒径和掺杂剂分布。

2. 掺杂浓度：Zr的掺杂影响了催化剂的晶胞参数和化学环境。10% NiZrO催化剂获得了最佳的乙烯产率，表现为60%的乙烷转化率和66%的乙烯选择性。

3. 电子结构：观察到Ni和Zr之间存在强相互作用，这影响了催化剂的可还原性和吸附氧物种的分布。这种相互作用导致还原峰向高温移动，使NiZrO催化剂更难被还原为Ni金属。

4. 催化性能：Ni和Zr之间的相互作用导致活性位Ni倾向于吸附O−物种而不是非选择性O2−物种，这有利于提高乙烯选择性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂浓度和分布对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：通过微调掺杂浓度和制备方法，平衡乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持高乙烯产率的同时，防止深度氧化和乙烷裂解反应。

4. 安全性：确保催化剂在高温下性能稳定，不会失活或形成潜在的危险副产品。
