[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition. It is beneficial to improve the ethane cleavage-resistant capability since the appearance of Ni metal in the catalyst is the main reason of ethane cleavage"

[6] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The study focuses on NiZrO catalysts prepared by a modified sol-gel method with varying Zr contents. The doping of Zr affects the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts, creating a strong interaction between Ni and Zr. This interaction plays a crucial role in reducing the catalyst's reducibility and influencing the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, which in turn affects catalytic performance.

The best catalytic performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO, yielding 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity. The decreased reducibility of NiZrO catalysts makes them more resistant to reduction to Ni metal, which improves their ethane cleavage-resistant capability. This is important because the formation of Ni metal is the main cause of ethane cleavage.

The Ni-Zr interaction increases the valence and electron-accepting capability of Ni cations, favoring the adsorption of O− species over non-selective O2− species. This preference for O− species contributes to increased ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopant concentration and vacancy formation on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions and deep oxidation products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, especially when dealing with oxygen-rich environments at elevated temperatures.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory-scale results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining catalytic performance and stability.

在氧化脱氢反应中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和镍氧化物基催化剂中的空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

该研究主要关注通过改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备的NiZrO催化剂，其中Zr含量各不相同。Zr的掺杂影响了催化剂的晶胞参数和化学环境，在Ni和Zr之间形成了强相互作用。这种相互作用在降低催化剂的可还原性和影响吸附氧物种的分布方面起着关键作用，从而影响催化性能。

最佳的催化性能是在10%NiZrO催化剂上实现的，乙烷转化率为60%，乙烯选择性为66%。NiZrO催化剂的可还原性降低使其更难被还原成Ni金属，这提高了其抗乙烷裂解的能力。这一点很重要，因为Ni金属的形成是导致乙烷裂解的主要原因。

Ni-Zr相互作用增加了Ni阳离子的价态和接受电子的能力，有利于吸附O−物种而不是非选择性的O2−物种。这种对O−物种的偏好有助于提高乙烯选择性。

该催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂浓度和空位形成对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：在保持催化剂稳定性的同时，平衡乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和深度氧化产物。

4. 安全性：确保安全的操作条件，特别是在高温下处理富氧环境时。

5. 可扩展性：将实验室规模的结果转化为工业规模的过程，同时保持催化性能和稳定性。
