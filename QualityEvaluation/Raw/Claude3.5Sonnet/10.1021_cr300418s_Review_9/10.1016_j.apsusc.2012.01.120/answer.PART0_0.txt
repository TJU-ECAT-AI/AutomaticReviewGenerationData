[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[6] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation method: The study used a modified sol-gel method to prepare NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents. This method allowed for the creation of uniform nanoparticles with strong interactions between Ni and Zr.

Dopant concentrations: The Zr content in the catalysts affected their cell parameters and chemical environment. The best performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO catalyst, yielding 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity.

Electronic structure: The interaction between Ni and Zr resulted in increased valence and electron-accepting capability of Ni cations. This led to preferential adsorption of O- species over non-selective O2- species, improving ethylene selectivity.

Catalytic performance: The strong Ni-Zr interaction lessened the reducibility of the catalysts and influenced the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species. This decreased reducibility made NiZrO catalysts more resistant to reduction to Ni metal, which improved their ethane cleavage-resistant capability.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding and predicting the complex interactions between Ni and Zr, and their effects on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the dopant concentration to achieve optimal conversion and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving ethylene yield while maintaining high selectivity, as the study showed a trade-off between conversion and selectivity with increasing Zr content.

4. Safety: Ensuring the stability of the catalyst at higher temperatures to prevent deactivation and maintain performance over extended periods.

基于氧化镍的催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

制备方法：该研究使用改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备了具有不同Zr含量的NiZrO纳米粒子。这种方法允许创建具有Ni和Zr之间强相互作用的均匀纳米粒子。

掺杂浓度：催化剂中的Zr含量影响了它们的晶胞参数和化学环境。10%NiZrO催化剂获得了最佳性能，乙烷转化率为60%，乙烯选择性为66%。

电子结构：Ni和Zr之间的相互作用导致Ni阳离子的价态和接受电子能力增加。这导致优先吸附O-物种而不是非选择性O2-物种，从而提高了乙烯选择性。

催化性能：强烈的Ni-Zr相互作用降低了催化剂的还原性，并影响了吸附氧物种的分布。这种降低的还原性使NiZrO催化剂更难被还原成Ni金属，从而提高了它们的乙烷裂解抗性能力。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解和预测Ni和Zr之间的复杂相互作用，以及它们对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡掺杂浓度以达到最佳转化率和选择性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性。

3. 效率和选择性：提高乙烯产率的同时保持高选择性，因为研究显示随着Zr含量的增加，转化率和选择性之间存在权衡。

4. 安全性：确保催化剂在较高温度下的稳定性，以防止失活并在长期使用中保持性能。
