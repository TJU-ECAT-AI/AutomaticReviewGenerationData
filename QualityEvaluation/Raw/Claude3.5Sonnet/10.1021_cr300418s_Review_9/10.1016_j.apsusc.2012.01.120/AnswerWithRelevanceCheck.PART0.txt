          [1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

[5] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[6] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: A modified sol-gel method was used to prepare NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents. This method allows for better control of particle size and dopant distribution.

2. Dopant concentration: The doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts. The best performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO catalyst, yielding 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity.

3. Electronic structure: The interaction between Ni and Zr resulted in increased valence and electron-accepting capability of Ni cations. This change in electronic structure affected the adsorption preferences of oxygen species on the catalyst surface, favoring O− species over non-selective O2− species.

4. Catalytic performance: The strong Ni-Zr interaction lessened the reducibility of the catalysts and influenced the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species. This decreased reducibility made NiZrO catalysts more resistant to reduction to Ni metal, which improved their ethane cleavage-resistant capability and enhanced ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopant concentration and vacancy formation on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions and deep oxidation products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation conditions, especially when dealing with oxygen-rich environments at elevated temperatures.

5. Catalyst stability: Developing catalysts that maintain their performance over extended periods and resist deactivation.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备了含有不同锆含量的NiZrO纳米颗粒。这种方法可以更好地控制粒子尺寸和掺杂剂分布。

2. 掺杂浓度：锆的掺杂影响了催化剂的晶胞参数和化学环境。10%NiZrO催化剂表现最佳，乙烷转化率为60%，乙烯选择性为66%。

3. 电子结构：镍和锆之间的相互作用导致镍阳离子的价态和接受电子能力增强。这种电子结构的变化影响了催化剂表面氧物种的吸附偏好，有利于O−物种而不是非选择性O2−物种。

4. 催化性能：强烈的Ni-Zr相互作用降低了催化剂的可还原性，并影响了吸附氧物种的分布。这种降低的还原性使NiZrO催化剂更难被还原成Ni金属，从而提高了它们的乙烷裂解抗性能力并增强了乙烯选择性。

该催化体系的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂浓度和空位形成对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：在保持催化剂稳定性的同时，平衡乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和深度氧化产物。

4. 安全性：确保安全的操作条件，特别是在高温下处理富氧环境时。

5. 催化剂稳定性：开发能够长期保持性能并抵抗失活的催化剂。
