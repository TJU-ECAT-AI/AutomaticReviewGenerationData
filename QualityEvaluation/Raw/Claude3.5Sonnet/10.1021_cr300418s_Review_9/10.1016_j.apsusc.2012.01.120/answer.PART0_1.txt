[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[5] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

[6] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430°C."

The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: A modified sol-gel method was used to prepare NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents. This method allows for better control of particle size and dopant distribution.

2. Dopant concentration: The doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts. Different Zr contents led to varying degrees of interaction between Ni and Zr, influencing the catalytic performance.

3. Electronic structure: The interaction between Ni and Zr resulted in increased valence and electron-accepting capability of Ni cations. This change in electronic structure affected the adsorption preferences of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

4. Catalytic performance: The NiZrO catalysts showed improved ethylene selectivity compared to pure NiO. The best performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO catalyst, yielding 40% ethylene with 66% selectivity at 430°C.

5. Vacancy formation: While not explicitly mentioned, the interaction between Ni and Zr likely affects oxygen vacancy formation, which influences the catalyst's reducibility and oxygen species distribution.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately modeling the complex interactions between Ni and Zr, as well as their effects on electronic structure and catalytic behavior.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between ethylene yield and selectivity by fine-tuning dopant concentration and reaction conditions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Improving ethylene yield while maintaining high selectivity, especially at higher temperatures.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation at elevated temperatures and in the presence of oxygen and hydrocarbons.

5. Catalyst stability: Developing catalysts that maintain their performance over extended periods and resist deactivation.
