[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified sol–gel method"

[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."

[3] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, consequently influence their catalytic performance."

[4] "Due to the combined effects of such interaction and particle size, the reduction peaks became broader and shifted to high temperature. The decreased reducibility makes NiZrO catalysts more difficult to be reduced to Ni metal under the same condition."

[5] "The interaction between Ni and Zr results in the increased valence and accepting electron capability of Ni cations. Therefore, the active site Ni tends to adsorb O− species than non-selective oxygen species O2−, which is in favor of the increase of ethylene selectivity."

[6] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430°C."

The preparation method, dopant concentration, and interactions between nickel and zirconium significantly influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: A modified sol-gel method was used to prepare NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents, allowing for uniform particle size and good dispersion of the dopant.

2. Dopant concentration: The addition of Zr affected the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts. The optimal performance was achieved with 10% NiZrO catalyst.

3. Electronic structure: The interaction between Ni and Zr resulted in increased valence and electron-accepting capability of Ni cations. This led to preferential adsorption of O− species over non-selective O2− species, improving ethylene selectivity.

4. Catalytic performance: The NiZrO catalysts showed improved ethylene selectivity and yield compared to pure NiO. The best performance was 40% ethylene yield with 66% selectivity at 430°C for 10% NiZrO.

5. Reducibility: The Ni-Zr interaction decreased the reducibility of the catalyst, making it more difficult to reduce to Ni metal. This improved the catalyst's resistance to ethane cleavage, a common side reaction.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding and predicting the complex interactions between Ni and Zr, and their effects on catalyst performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing dopant concentration, reaction temperature, and other parameters to maximize ethylene yield and selectivity.

3. Efficiency vs. selectivity: Improving ethylene selectivity while maintaining high ethane conversion rates.

4. Safety: Managing the exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and preventing the formation of explosive mixtures.

5. Catalyst stability: Ensuring long-term performance and resistance to deactivation under reaction conditions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和镍锆之间的相互作用显著影响了其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备了不同锆含量的NiZrO纳米颗粒，实现了均匀的粒径和掺杂剂的良好分散。

2. 掺杂浓度：锆的添加影响了催化剂的晶胞参数和化学环境。10%NiZrO催化剂达到了最佳性能。

3. 电子结构：镍和锆之间的相互作用导致镍阳离子的价态和接受电子能力增强。这使得催化剂倾向于吸附O−物种而非非选择性O2−物种，提高了乙烯选择性。

4. 催化性能：与纯NiO相比，NiZrO催化剂表现出更高的乙烯选择性和产率。10%NiZrO在430°C时达到最佳性能，乙烯产率为40%，选择性为66%。

5. 还原性：镍-锆相互作用降低了催化剂的还原性，使其更难被还原为金属镍。这提高了催化剂对乙烷裂解（一种常见的副反应）的抗性。

该催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解和预测镍和锆之间的复杂相互作用及其对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡掺杂浓度、反应温度和其他参数，以最大化乙烯产率和选择性。

3. 效率与选择性：在保持高乙烷转化率的同时提高乙烯选择性。

4. 安全性：管理氧化脱氢反应的放热性质，防止形成爆炸性混合物。

5. 催化剂稳定性：确保在反应条件下的长期性能和抗失活能力。
