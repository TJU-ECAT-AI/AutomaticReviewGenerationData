[1] "The presence on the surface of any of the bases mentioned above changes the binding energy of oxygen from 0.15 (when no base is present) to 1.00 eV. This is the binding energy to the rutile surface, not to the base. The charge on the coadsorbed O2 is  0.5 electron (instead of zero, when no base is present)."

[2] "Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

[3] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on H/LaCeO2 is essentially the same as that on CeO2; the presence of the adsorbed hydrogen cancels the effect of the La dopant. Similar behavior was found for Mg-doped La2O3 or CaO doped with alkali."

[4] "In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Doping NiO with high-valence dopants like Nb can create Lewis acid sites on the surface, which lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation. This can enhance the catalyst's oxidative ability, but there's a need to balance this effect to maintain catalyst stability and selectivity.

The "moderation principle" is crucial in designing oxidation catalysts. While doping can make oxygen removal easier, it shouldn't be too easy, as this can hinder the reoxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. Finding the right balance is key to optimizing catalyst performance.

Dopant concentration affects the electronic structure and catalytic properties. For instance, in some systems, the presence of adsorbed species (like hydrogen) can cancel out the effects of certain dopants, highlighting the complexity of these systems.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex interplay between dopants, vacancies, and adsorbates. Process optimization requires balancing multiple factors such as efficiency, selectivity, and safety. The challenge lies in finding the right combination of dopant type, concentration, and preparation method that provides optimal catalytic performance while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity.

Safety considerations are particularly important in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions due to the presence of oxygen and potentially flammable hydrocarbons. Balancing reactivity with safety requires careful reactor design and process control.

Overall, while doping and vacancy formation can significantly enhance catalytic performance, optimizing these systems requires a nuanced understanding of the interplay between electronic structure, surface chemistry, and reaction conditions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

用高价掺杂剂(如Nb)掺杂NiO可以在表面上创造Lewis酸位点，这降低了氧空位形成所需的能量。这可以增强催化剂的氧化能力，但需要平衡这种效应以保持催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

"适度原则"在设计氧化催化剂时至关重要。虽然掺杂可以使氧的去除更容易，但不应过于容易，因为这会阻碍气相氧对表面的再氧化。找到正确的平衡对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

掺杂浓度影响电子结构和催化性能。例如，在某些体系中，吸附物种(如氢)的存在可以抵消某些掺杂剂的影响，这突显了这些体系的复杂性。

理论建模的主要挑战包括准确地表示掺杂剂、空位和吸附物之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要平衡效率、选择性和安全性等多个因素。挑战在于找到掺杂剂类型、浓度和制备方法的正确组合，以提供最佳的催化性能，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

安全性考虑在氧化脱氢反应中尤为重要，因为存在氧气和潜在的易燃烃类。平衡反应性和安全性需要仔细的反应器设计和过程控制。

总的来说，虽然掺杂和空位形成可以显著提高催化性能，但优化这些系统需要对电子结构、表面化学和反应条件之间的相互作用有深入的理解。
