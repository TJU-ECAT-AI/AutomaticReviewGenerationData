[1] "The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO."

[2] "Calculations show (15) that this is true when O2 (a Lewis acid) is coadsorbed on TiO2(110) with one of the bases listed above. The binding energy of O2 to rutile is 0.15 eV, and the molecule is unable to gain electron charge from the rutile surface, (15) in spite of the fact that O2 has a large electronegativity; stoichiometric rutile is a poor base."

[3] "We are interested in doped oxides because of their potential of being good catalysts for oxidation reactions. Under catalytic conditions, the doped oxide will be in contact with gas-phase oxygen."

[4] "Calculations (15) show that indeed this is the case: the energy of the rutile slab on which O2 is coadsorbed with Au4* is lower by 0.67 eV than that of the rutile slab on which O2 is coadsorbed with Au4. The presence of the Lewis acid (i.e., O2) stabilizes that Au cluster that is a Lewis base (namely Au4*)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some relevant insights can be extracted:

1. Dopant concentrations affect vacancy formation energies in NiO. For example, doping NiO with Nb, Ti, or Al increases the energy required to form oxygen vacancies compared to undoped NiO.

2. The electronic structure of oxide catalysts influences their interaction with reactants. For instance, stoichiometric rutile TiO2 is a poor base and binds O2 weakly, while doped oxides can exhibit different binding properties.

3. Doped oxides are of interest as potential catalysts for oxidation reactions, where they would interact with gas-phase oxygen under catalytic conditions. 

4. The presence of Lewis acids (like O2) can stabilize certain structures of catalyst clusters that act as Lewis bases, potentially influencing catalytic performance.

Key challenges in theoretical modeling likely include accurately representing the complex electronic structures of doped oxides and their interactions with reactants. Process optimization would need to balance the effects of dopants on vacancy formation, reactant binding, and overall catalytic activity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety would require careful tuning of the catalyst properties to achieve the desired performance while avoiding unwanted side reactions or stability issues.

However, the document does not provide specific information on nickel oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene to styrene or ethane to ethylene reactions, so detailed conclusions about these specific systems cannot be drawn from the given literature.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于氧化镍基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的问题。然而,可以提取一些相关的见解:

1. 掺杂浓度影响NiO中的氧空位形成能。例如,用Nb、Ti或Al掺杂NiO会增加形成氧空位所需的能量,相比未掺杂的NiO。

2. 氧化物催化剂的电子结构影响其与反应物的相互作用。例如,化学计量比的金红石TiO2是一种较弱的碱,与O2结合较弱,而掺杂的氧化物可能表现出不同的结合特性。

3. 掺杂的氧化物作为潜在的氧化反应催化剂备受关注,在催化条件下它们会与气相氧相互作用。

4. Lewis酸(如O2)的存在可以稳定作为Lewis碱的某些催化剂簇结构,可能影响催化性能。

理论建模的主要挑战可能包括准确表示掺杂氧化物的复杂电子结构及其与反应物的相互作用。工艺优化需要平衡掺杂剂对空位形成、反应物结合和整体催化活性的影响。平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要仔细调整催化剂性质,以达到所需的性能,同时避免不希望的副反应或稳定性问题。

然而,该文档没有提供关于氧化镍催化剂用于乙苯制苯乙烯或乙烷制乙烯反应的具体信息,因此无法从给定的文献中得出关于这些特定系统的详细结论。
