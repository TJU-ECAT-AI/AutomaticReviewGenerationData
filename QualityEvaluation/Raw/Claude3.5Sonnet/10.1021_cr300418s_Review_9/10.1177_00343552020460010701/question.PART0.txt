Even if you know of them as the top bananas in the dis-
ability community, reading Enabling Lives should eventu-
ally bring you to the realization that its featured subjects
constitute a truly outstanding coterie of characters with
elite experiences and stellar levels of self-actualization.
Following are some specific examples, one from each of
the six individuals interviewed for this book.
• Judy Heumanns first job application rejec-
tion, by the New York City Board of Educa-
tion because she used a wheelchair, generated
a New York Times editorial and an interview
on the national news that were exclusively
about her situation.
• Upon retiring from Congress, Tony Coelho
switched careers to the corporate sector. His
boss, grateful to have snatched this enterpris-
ing former House Majority Whip, offered him
a $100,000 annual bonus for reading the Wall
Street Journal each day in toto, as part of a
crash course in finance (p. 146).
• After publishing a New York Times op-ed
piece that sharply criticized the fund-raising
strategy based on patronizing pity that the
Jerry Lewis telethon employed, Evan Kemp
found out that the beneficiary of that tele-
thon, the Muscular Dystrophy Association,
paid a private investigator about a quarter of a
million dollars to surreptitiously discredit his
reputation.
• Despite early-onset deafness and not making a
phone call until he was 25 years old, Frank
Bowe was largely responsible for the proposal
and passage of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 and the Decoder Circuitry Act of
1990 that mandate telephone and television
equipment and services be accessible to
everyone.
• For decades, Justin Dart and his wife,
Yoshiko, have conducted their own version of
foster parenting (life-quality training) in
their home for more than 80 individuals with
significant disabilities, to provide them with
the skills and supports to start working and
living independently.
• With all his high-brow experiences to remi-
nisce aboutstarring in a Hollywood film for
which he received two Academy Awards and
directing the Presidents Committee on Em-
ployment of People with Disabilities under
nine consecutive presidentsa retired septua-
genarian, Harold Russell, chose to work as a
program consultant and peer counselor for a
radical, grass-roots service program for home-
less veterans.
Needless to say, such lives offer very enjoyable and inspir-
ing reading. I just hope that the extraordinary elements of
their stories do not lead readers, especially those in gen-
eral public, to perceive them as such exceptional people
that they get ruled out as evidence that would decrease
the stereotypes of passivity and limited potential that is
pinned on so many people with disabilities.
In addition to a chapter devoted to each of these six
prominent personalities, the book contains three appen-
dices: A Call to Revolution: An Agenda for Campaign
2000, National Disability Policy: A Progress Report by

Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin
and Assisted Suicide: A Disability Perspective. These ap-
pendices contain a considerable amount of data and refer-
ence information from a consumer perspective and
provide a nice complement to the biographical informa-
tion in the rest of the book. They constitute 80 pages,
which is about one third of the entire text.
Perhaps the most mentioned specific topic in the
main part of the text is the Americans with Disabilities
Act, mostly in the form of anecdotes about the politics of
crafting and passing this legislation. There are many other
important issues for rehabilitation counseling that the
book introduces, however, and these represent good op-
portunities for problem-based learning activities, class dis-
cussions, or research projects. They include advocacy
strategies and styles; attitudinal barriers and stereotypes;
development of a disability identity; disability stigma; dis-
crimination in education, employment, and health care;
history and current provisions of disability-related legisla-
tion and service programs; informal perceptions and for-
mal policies of the statefederal rehabilitation service
system; and role models and self-help in the rehabilitation
process. The book has no name or subject indexes. Ap-
pendix C is the only section of the book that has a refer-
ence list, and it consists of legal citations.
Several of the crucial experiences recounted by the
activists centered on encounters with children whom they
did not know that turned the direction of their lives at a
critical point. Coelho was lifted from a period of dejection
and suicidal ideation when he was touched by the liberat-
ing trust in the world displayed by children he observed at
play in a public park where he had sought refuge from his
despair. Bowes accomplished career as an advocate for
disability rights and improvement in special education
was initially sparked by the excitement of young students
in a school for the deaf at seeing him as a role model when
he made an impromptu visit there just prior to graduating
from college, where his interests up to that point had been
in English, philosophy, and religion. On a philanthropy
tour for his Japanese business, Dart visited an institution
in Vietnam for children with polio who were warehoused
in deplorable conditions and were starving to death. He
recalled a scene that is burned forever in his soul and
that led to his abandoning his very profitable corporate
career for one devoted to advocacy for the disenfran-
chised: A little girl reached up to me and looked into my
eyes . . . it penetrated to the deepest part of my conscious-
ness. . . . I thought, Here is a human being looking for
God, looking for a miraculous solution, and instead she
has found a counterfeit saint doing a photo op (p. 73).
In contrast to these positively stirring experiences with
younger strangers, I noted that the parental recollections
in four of the biographies were either absent (Russells fa-
ther died when he was a toddler) or were marred by harsh
discipline and rejection (No son of mine has epilepsy,
defiantly spoken by Coelhos father; the refusal of Bowes
parents to learn even simple signs to ease pragmatic com-
munication around the house; Darts employment rejec-
tion from his familys large business enterprise because
they considered his wheelchair an inappropriate fit with
the work environment).
A common aspect of all the interviewees back-
grounds was a keen interest or involvement in the civil
rights struggle for racial equality, although in most cases
they had not yet recognized equivalent injustices toward
people with disabilities. Politics and the federal govern-
ment have been a major focus of all the subjects personal
and professional lives, at one point or another. Recurring
themes of spirituality and conscientious living character-
ize Darts life in particular. Part of his personal search for
truth was rejecting, for much of his life, the extreme com-
petitiveness and wealth of his business baron family. He
and his wife maintained an ascetic life of retreat for 
6 years in a primitive mountain cabin in Japan in order to
wrestle with his personal addictions to alcohol and pre-
scription drugs and to contemplate how to fight the ad-
dictions of society to money, power, and prestige at the
cost of oppression and other evils.
Some of the chapters are written in a style that al-
lows for a fair amount of literary license. The one about
Judy Heumann has the most fictional flair to it, and the
one about Justin Dart is the most straightforward and doc-
umentary in style. Personally, I prefer the latter; however,
many students would probably find the dramatic story
style a refreshing switch from their pile of assigned text-
book readings. Although the text is generally well written
and edited, there are some unfortunate errors. Ralf Hotch-
kiss, who is briefly mentioned only once, is listed (p. 51)
as Ralph Hodgkins, a seemingly minuscule mistake that
still could lead a student who is doing a Web-based or bib-
liographic name search to a dead end rather than to the
available information about this trail-blazing rehabilita-
tion engineer and disability change agent. The text con-
tains more than a few chronological misstatements. It is
reported that Evan Kemp was 12 in 1954 (p. 39) and also
12 in 1949 (p. 41). The chapter on Tony Coelho has an
apparently confounded chronology in describing influen-
tial events that would have occurred during his high
school, college, and early career years. The given dates
have him born in June of 1946 (p. 136) and starting work
as an aide to a member of Congress in 1965 (p. 138) or in
1964 (p. 139), which would have made him 19 or 18 years
old, respectively, at the time. Nonetheless, it is reported
that in between 1946 and 1965 (or 1964), he accom-
plished the following life transitions: already graduated
from college; changed his career aspiration to that of be-
coming a priest, after being so affected by the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy; been rejected for Jesuit
seminary because of his epilepsy (based on exclusions
stated in Catholic canon law in effect at the time); and
worked for a while as a household aide to comedian Bob

Hope, who facilitated his getting the Congressional posi-
tion. I include all of this to make the point that the sto-
ries are so filled with fascinating anecdotes that the
misrendered dates may escape many readers, although
those who are more detail-oriented may well be annoyed.
Speaking of personal life details, I found that there were,
periodically, more tidbits given about a subject (in partic-
ular, romantic pursuits and failures, and sometimes even
those of the children) than I thought were useful to men-
tion. Such information seems beyond the meaningful pa-
rameters, maybe not of a whole book on the persons life,
but certainly of a chapter targeted to his or her role in re-
habilitation and disability circles.
I enjoyed reading Enabling Lives very much, although
it took me a while to get used to a rehabilitation text that
had such a literary flavor. Because of its versatility, I would
definitely recommend it to virtually anyone. Rehabilita-
tion and disability studies educators could use it as a sup-
plemental text for a course on historical and psychosocial
topics, or even as a primary text in a course designed on a
problem-based learning model where students would use
it as a springboard for multiple independent research ac-
tivities. Students and practitioners from other helping
professions who read it could be sensitized by the struggles
and invigorated by the successes delineated in the book,
and they might appreciate it as a bibliotherapy resource
for some of their clients. Finally, general readers would be
impressed and enlightened about issues of equity and the
disability experience that typically are not so appropri-
ately communicated in the popular press. The authors and
editors deserve our compliments for producing this inter-
esting book, and the featured subjects get my admiration
and thanks for showing us all how to live enriching lives.
