[1] "Being an excellent redox material, ceria stabilized with zirconia has found widespread use as catalyst or catalyst support."

[2] "Moreover, defect-site-enriched ceria (with the nature of the defects determined by the applied preparation method) has been reported to promote ODEB with N2O."

[3] "The oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ by CO2 and the reduction of V5+ to lower oxidation states (possibly V4+) by ethylbenzene are directly involved in CO2-ODEB. Subsequently, V4+ is oxidized to V5+ with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ to complete the full cycle."

[4] "To reveal the effect of the coke deposition on the stability of the catalyst, the coke contents of the catalysts after 10h TOS were determined by thermogravimetrydifferential scanning calorimetry (TGDSC) analysis"

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions mentioned in the question. However, it does discuss some related concepts for vanadium and cerium-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODEB) with CO2.

The preparation method influences the catalyst's electronic structure and performance. The literature mentions that defect-site-enriched ceria, whose defect nature is determined by the preparation method, can promote ODEB. The study uses a modified sol-gel method to prepare Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 support.

Dopant concentrations are shown to be important. The addition of Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 to V2O5/Al2O3 doubled the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst. The ratio of Ce to Zr (0.6:0.4) in the support material is also specified, indicating the importance of dopant concentrations.

Vacancy formation is not explicitly discussed, but the redox cycle involving Ce3+/Ce4+ and V5+/V4+ suggests that oxygen vacancies play a role in the catalytic process.

Key challenges include:

1. Theoretical modeling: The paper mentions that despite many attempts, the catalytic mechanism is not yet fully understood.

2. Process optimization: Balancing V2O5 loading is crucial, as increasing it from 6 to 15 wt% led to a significant decrease in TOF.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: The study aims to achieve both high activity and stability in the catalyst.

4. Safety: The paper mentions that using CO2 as an oxidant avoids the safety problems associated with mixing oxygen and light hydrocarbons.

Additionally, the study reveals that coke deposition, often considered detrimental, actually improves catalyst stability in this case, highlighting the complexity of these catalytic systems.

文献并未直接涉及氧化镍基催化剂或问题中提到的特定氧化脱氢反应。然而，它确实讨论了一些与钒和铈基催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙苯（ODEB）中相关的概念。

制备方法影响催化剂的电子结构和性能。文献提到，缺陷位点富集的氧化铈（其缺陷性质由制备方法决定）可以促进ODEB。该研究使用改进的溶胶-凝胶法制备Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3支撑材料。

掺杂剂浓度被证明很重要。向V2O5/Al2O3中添加Ce0.6Zr0.4O2使催化剂的转化频率（TOF）翻倍。支撑材料中Ce和Zr的比例（0.6:0.4）也被指定，表明掺杂剂浓度的重要性。

虽然没有明确讨论空位形成，但涉及Ce3+/Ce4+和V5+/V4+的氧化还原循环表明氧空位在催化过程中发挥作用。

主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：论文提到，尽管进行了多次尝试，但催化机理尚未完全理解。

2. 过程优化：平衡V2O5负载至关重要，因为将其从6增加到15 wt%导致TOF显著降低。

3. 效率和选择性：研究旨在实现催化剂的高活性和稳定性。

4. 安全性：论文提到，使用CO2作为氧化剂可避免将氧气与轻烃混合所带来的安全问题。

此外，研究揭示，通常被认为有害的积碳实际上在这种情况下改善了催化剂的稳定性，凸显了这些催化系统的复杂性。
