[1] "SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100% of SnO2 were prepared at room temperature by co-precipitation method using aqueous ammonia as a hydrolyzing agent."

[2] "Both acidic and basic sites distribution of the nanocomposite catalysts is quite different from those of respective single oxides (SnO2 or ZrO2). Catalytic activity of these nanocomposite catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation (EBD) to styrene in the presence of excess CO2 was evaluated."

[3] "The change in the acidbase bi-functionality of the nanocomposite catalysts in comparison with single oxides had profound positive influence in enhancing the catalytic activity."

[4] "The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character of mixed oxides such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, CeO2ZrO2 have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in our earlier reports"

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or the specific challenges mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some relevant insights on mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

The preparation method (co-precipitation) and dopant concentrations (varying SnO2 content from 0-100%) were shown to influence the acid-base properties and catalytic performance of SnO2-ZrO2 nanocomposites for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene. The mixed oxide catalysts exhibited enhanced acid-base bi-functionality compared to single oxides, which positively impacted catalytic activity.

Key factors affecting performance included:
1. Nanocomposite composition and synergistic effects between the oxides
2. Acid-base site distribution and strength  
3. Particle size/morphology

While not directly addressing theoretical modeling or process optimization challenges, the study demonstrates the importance of carefully tuning catalyst composition and properties to balance activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Further research would be needed to fully address the specific questions about nickel oxide catalysts and associated challenges.

该文献并未直接涉及氧化镍基催化剂或问题中提到的具体挑战。然而，它确实提供了一些关于混合氧化物纳米复合催化剂用于氧化脱氢反应的相关见解：

制备方法（共沉淀法）和掺杂浓度（SnO2含量从0-100%变化）被证明会影响SnO2-ZrO2纳米复合材料用于乙苯脱氢生成苯乙烯的酸碱性质和催化性能。与单一氧化物相比，混合氧化物催化剂表现出增强的酸碱双功能性，这对催化活性产生了积极影响。

影响性能的关键因素包括：
1. 纳米复合材料的组成和氧化物之间的协同效应
2. 酸碱位点的分布和强度
3. 粒径/形貌

虽然没有直接解决理论建模或工艺优化挑战，但该研究表明，在氧化脱氢反应中，仔细调整催化剂组成和性质以平衡活性和选择性是非常重要的。需要进行进一步的研究才能全面解答关于氧化镍催化剂及相关挑战的具体问题。
