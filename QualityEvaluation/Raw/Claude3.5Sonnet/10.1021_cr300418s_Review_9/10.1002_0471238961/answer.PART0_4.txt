The given scientific literature does not contain any information related to nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on dinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes as catalysts for the vinyl/addition polymerization of norbornene. It does not discuss nickel oxide catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature also does not address theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety for the catalytic systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
