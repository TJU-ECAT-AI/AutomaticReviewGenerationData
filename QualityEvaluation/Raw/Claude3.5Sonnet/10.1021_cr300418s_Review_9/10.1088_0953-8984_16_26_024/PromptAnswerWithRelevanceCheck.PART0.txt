<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically related to nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or process optimization. The text primarily discusses computational methods for modeling the adsorption of NH3, CO, and NO molecules on NiO and Ni-doped MgO surfaces. It does not address catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions or the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily focuses on computational studies of molecular adsorption (NH3, CO, and NO) on NiO and Ni-doped MgO surfaces using various density functional theory (DFT) and wavefunction-based methods. It does not discuss catalyst preparation, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

To properly address this question, additional literature specifically focused on nickel oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions would be needed. This would likely include experimental studies on catalyst synthesis, characterization, and performance testing, as well as theoretical modeling of reaction mechanisms and active sites.
