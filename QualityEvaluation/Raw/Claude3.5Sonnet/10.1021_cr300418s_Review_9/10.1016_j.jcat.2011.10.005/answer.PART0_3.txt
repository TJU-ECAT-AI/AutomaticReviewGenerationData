[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface"

[3] "It was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites"

[4] "The significant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium content."

[5] "These results could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods affect the morphology and surface area of the catalysts. The sol-gel method using citric acid produces catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods. This increased surface area can enhance catalytic activity.

Niobium doping has a complex effect on the catalysts. At low concentrations (2-4 at%), it can improve catalyst performance by reducing NiO crystallite size and potentially lowering aggregation. However, at higher concentrations, it forms an amorphous NixNbyO phase that covers the NiO crystallites.

This Nb-rich phase affects the electronic structure by filling cationic vacancies in NiO. This reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation, which enhances the diffusion of unselective oxygen species inside the bulk and increases selective oxygen species on the surface. As a result, Nb-doped catalysts generally show lower activity but higher selectivity compared to pure NiO.

The key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interaction between NiO and the amorphous Nb-rich phase.

2. Optimizing the Nb concentration to balance activity and selectivity.

3. Controlling the formation and distribution of the Nb-rich phase on the NiO surface.

4. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts over long periods of operation.

5. Ensuring safety in handling and using these catalysts in industrial-scale oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

制备方法影响催化剂的形态和比表面积。使用柠檬酸的溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂比沉淀法制备的催化剂具有更高的比表面积。这种增加的比表面积可以提高催化活性。

铌掺杂对催化剂有复杂的影响。在低浓度（2-4原子%）时，它可以通过减小NiO晶粒尺寸和可能降低聚集来改善催化剂性能。然而，在更高的浓度下，它形成了一种覆盖NiO晶粒的无定形NixNbyO相。

这种富铌相通过填充NiO中的阳离子空位影响电子结构。这减少了氧解离的活性位点数量，增强了非选择性氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了表面上的选择性氧物种。因此，与纯NiO相比，掺铌催化剂通常表现出较低的活性但较高的选择性。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对NiO和无定形富铌相之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化铌浓度以平衡活性和选择性。

3. 控制富铌相在NiO表面的形成和分布。

4. 平衡催化剂在长期运行过程中的效率、选择性和稳定性。

5. 确保在工业规模的氧化脱氢过程中处理和使用这些催化剂的安全性。
