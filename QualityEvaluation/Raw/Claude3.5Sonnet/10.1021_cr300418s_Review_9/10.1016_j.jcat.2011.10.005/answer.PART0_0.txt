[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods impact the morphology, surface area, and crystallite size of the catalysts. The sol-gel method produces catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods, which can lead to improved catalytic activity.

Dopant concentrations, particularly niobium, play a crucial role in modifying the electronic structure and catalytic properties. Low concentrations of Nb (3-4 at%) can enhance catalyst performance by reducing NiO crystallite size and improving selectivity. However, higher Nb loadings (>5 at%) can lead to decreased activity due to the formation of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering the active NiO sites.

Vacancy formation is influenced by the presence of dopants. Niobium is believed to fill cationic vacancies in NiO, which affects the distribution and mobility of oxygen species. This modification can enhance the selectivity of the catalyst by increasing the number of nucleophilic oxygen species on the surface while reducing unselective electrophilic oxygen species.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on catalyst performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity, as higher selectivity often comes at the cost of lower activity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene yields while minimizing undesired side reactions and CO2 formation.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation under oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures.

5. Catalyst stability: Preventing deactivation due to restructuring of the nanocomposite under reaction conditions, especially at high dopant loadings.

6. Understanding the role of amorphous phases: Elucidating the impact of amorphous Nb-rich oxide phases on catalyst performance and developing strategies to control their formation and distribution.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的形态、比表面积和晶粒尺寸。溶胶-凝胶法产生的催化剂比沉淀法具有更高的比表面积，这可能导致催化活性的提高。

掺杂浓度，特别是铌的浓度，在改变电子结构和催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。低浓度的Nb（3-4原子%）可以通过减小NiO晶粒尺寸和提高选择性来增强催化剂性能。然而，较高的Nb负载（>5原子%）可能导致活性降低，这是由于形成了覆盖活性NiO位点的非晶态Nb富集氧化物相。

空位形成受掺杂剂存在的影响。铌被认为可以填充NiO中的阳离子空位，这影响了氧物种的分布和移动性。这种修饰可以通过增加表面上亲核氧物种的数量同时减少非选择性的亲电氧物种来提高催化剂的选择性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型来预测掺杂剂和空位对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡，因为较高的选择性通常以较低的活性为代价。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2的形成。

4. 安全性：确保在高温氧化条件下安全操作。

5. 催化剂稳定性：防止由于反应条件下纳米复合材料的重构而导致的失活，特别是在高掺杂量的情况下。

6. 理解非晶相的作用：阐明非晶态Nb富集氧化物相对催化剂性能的影响，并开发控制其形成和分布的策略。
