[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[2] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[4] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[5] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane ODH, nanooxides show activity related to their redox properties, unlike bulk nickel oxides. The addition of Nb as a dopant has several effects:

1. It limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits NiO reducibility.

2. At higher Nb content (>5 at.%), the catalysts become less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This is likely due to the Nb-rich phase covering some of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species on NiO.

3. However, high Nb loadings can lead to significant catalyst deactivation, possibly due to restructuring of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions.

4. The most efficient catalysts contain 3-4 at.% Nb, balancing high activity, selectivity, and stability.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between NiO and the Nb-rich phase.

2. Process optimization to maintain catalyst stability while achieving high activity and selectivity.

3. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, especially considering the potential for catalyst restructuring under reaction conditions.

4. Understanding and controlling the formation and distribution of oxygen species on the catalyst surface to maximize selective oxidation pathways.

5. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant concentration and distribution to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷ODH，纳米氧化物的活性与其氧化还原性质有关，这与块状氧化镍不同。添加Nb作为掺杂剂有以下几个效果：

1. 它限制了NiO晶粒的尺寸并抑制了NiO的可还原性。

2. 在较高的Nb含量（>5 at.%）下，催化剂对乙烷ODH的活性降低但选择性提高。这可能是因为富Nb相覆盖了NiO上一些非选择性的、非化学计量的活性氧物种。

3. 然而，高Nb负载可能导致催化剂显著失活，这可能是由于在ODH条件下纳米复合材料的重构。

4. 最有效的催化剂含有3-4 at.%的Nb，平衡了高活性、选择性和稳定性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对NiO和富Nb相之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化工艺以保持催化剂稳定性，同时实现高活性和选择性。

3. 平衡效率、选择性和安全性，特别是考虑到催化剂在反应条件下可能发生重构。

4. 理解和控制催化剂表面氧物种的形成和分布，以最大化选择性氧化途径。

5. 开发允许精确控制掺杂剂浓度和分布的制备方法，以实现最佳催化性能。
