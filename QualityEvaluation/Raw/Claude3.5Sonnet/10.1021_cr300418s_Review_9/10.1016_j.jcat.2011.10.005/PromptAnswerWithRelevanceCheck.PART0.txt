[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods impact the morphology, surface area, and crystallite size of the catalysts. The sol-gel method produces catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods, which can lead to improved catalytic activity.

Dopant concentrations, particularly niobium, play a crucial role in modifying the electronic structure and catalytic properties. Low concentrations of Nb (3-4 at%) can enhance catalyst performance by reducing NiO crystallite size and improving selectivity. However, higher Nb loadings (>5 at%) can lead to decreased activity due to the formation of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering the active NiO sites.

Vacancy formation is influenced by the presence of dopants. Niobium is believed to fill cationic vacancies in NiO, which affects the distribution and mobility of oxygen species. This modification can enhance the selectivity of the catalyst by increasing the number of nucleophilic oxygen species on the surface while reducing unselective electrophilic oxygen species.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the effects of dopants and vacancies on catalyst performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity, as higher selectivity often comes at the cost of lower activity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene yields while minimizing undesired side reactions and CO2 formation.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation under oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures.

5. Catalyst stability: Preventing deactivation due to restructuring of the nanocomposite under reaction conditions, especially at high dopant loadings.

6. Understanding the role of amorphous phases: Elucidating the impact of amorphous Nb-rich oxide phases on catalyst performance and developing strategies to control their formation and distribution.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的形态、比表面积和晶粒尺寸。溶胶-凝胶法产生的催化剂比沉淀法具有更高的比表面积，这可能导致催化活性的提高。

掺杂浓度，特别是铌的浓度，在改变电子结构和催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。低浓度的Nb（3-4原子%）可以通过减小NiO晶粒尺寸和提高选择性来增强催化剂性能。然而，较高的Nb负载（>5原子%）可能导致活性降低，这是由于形成了覆盖活性NiO位点的非晶态Nb富集氧化物相。

空位形成受掺杂剂存在的影响。铌被认为可以填充NiO中的阳离子空位，这影响了氧物种的分布和移动性。这种修饰可以通过增加表面上亲核氧物种的数量同时减少非选择性的亲电氧物种来提高催化剂的选择性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发准确的模型来预测掺杂剂和空位对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡，因为较高的选择性通常以较低的活性为代价。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2的形成。

4. 安全性：确保在高温氧化条件下安全操作。

5. 催化剂稳定性：防止由于反应条件下纳米复合材料的重构而导致的失活，特别是在高掺杂量的情况下。

6. 理解非晶相的作用：阐明非晶态Nb富集氧化物相对催化剂性能的影响，并开发控制其形成和分布的策略。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane ODH, nanooxides show activity related to their redox properties, unlike bulk nickel oxides. The addition of Nb as a dopant has several effects:

1. It limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits NiO reducibility.

2. At higher Nb content (>5 at.%), the catalysts become less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This is likely due to the Nb-rich phase covering some of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species on NiO.

3. However, high Nb loadings can lead to significant catalyst deactivation, possibly due to restructuring of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions.

4. The most efficient catalysts contain 3-4 at.% Nb, balancing high activity, selectivity, and stability.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between NiO and the Nb-rich phase.

2. Process optimization to maintain catalyst stability while achieving high activity and selectivity.

3. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, especially considering the potential for catalyst restructuring under reaction conditions.

4. Understanding and controlling the formation and distribution of oxygen species on the catalyst surface to maximize selective oxidation pathways.

5. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant concentration and distribution to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷ODH，纳米氧化物的活性与其氧化还原性质有关，这与块状氧化镍不同。添加Nb作为掺杂剂有以下几个效果：

1. 它限制了NiO晶粒的尺寸并抑制了NiO的可还原性。

2. 在较高的Nb含量（>5 at.%）下，催化剂对乙烷ODH的活性降低但选择性提高。这可能是因为富Nb相覆盖了NiO上一些非选择性的、非化学计量的活性氧物种。

3. 然而，高Nb负载可能导致催化剂显著失活，这可能是由于在ODH条件下纳米复合材料的重构。

4. 最有效的催化剂含有3-4 at.%的Nb，平衡了高活性、选择性和稳定性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对NiO和富Nb相之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化工艺以保持催化剂稳定性，同时实现高活性和选择性。

3. 平衡效率、选择性和安全性，特别是考虑到催化剂在反应条件下可能发生重构。

4. 理解和控制催化剂表面氧物种的形成和分布，以最大化选择性氧化途径。

5. 开发允许精确控制掺杂剂浓度和分布的制备方法，以实现最佳催化性能。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods affect the morphology and surface area of the catalysts. For example, using a sol-gel method with citric acid can produce nickel oxides with higher surface areas and better catalytic performance compared to precipitation methods.

Dopant concentrations, particularly niobium, play a crucial role in modifying the catalyst's properties. Low concentrations of Nb (3-4 at%) can improve catalyst efficiency by increasing selectivity while maintaining high activity. Higher Nb concentrations (>5 at%) tend to decrease activity but further increase selectivity.

Vacancy formation is influenced by the presence of dopants. Niobium is believed to fill cationic vacancies in the NiO structure, which affects the distribution and mobility of oxygen species. This modification alters the balance between selective and non-selective active sites on the catalyst surface.

The key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact mechanisms of how dopants modify the electronic structure and catalytic properties of NiO.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity when adding dopants.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Developing catalysts that maintain high activity while improving selectivity to the desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the catalytic process, especially when working with oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures.

5. Structural characterization: Accurately determining the distribution and role of amorphous phases that may form with certain dopants.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and careful process engineering to develop improved catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的形态和比表面积。例如，使用柠檬酸的溶胶-凝胶法可以生产出比表面积更高、催化性能更好的氧化镍，相比于沉淀法而言。

掺杂浓度，特别是铌的浓度，在改变催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。低浓度的Nb（3-4原子%）可以通过提高选择性同时保持高活性来改善催化剂效率。更高的Nb浓度（>5原子%）往往会降低活性但进一步提高选择性。

空位形成受掺杂剂存在的影响。铌被认为可以填充NiO结构中的阳离子空位，这影响了氧物种的分布和移动性。这种修饰改变了催化剂表面选择性和非选择性活性位点之间的平衡。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

2. 工艺优化：在添加掺杂剂时平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：开发保持高活性同时提高对目标产品选择性的催化剂。

4. 安全性：确保催化过程的安全操作，特别是在高温氧化条件下工作时。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods affect the morphology and surface area of the catalysts. The sol-gel method using citric acid produces catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods. This increased surface area can enhance catalytic activity.

Niobium doping has a complex effect on the catalysts. At low concentrations (2-4 at%), it can improve catalyst performance by reducing NiO crystallite size and potentially lowering aggregation. However, at higher concentrations, it forms an amorphous NixNbyO phase that covers the NiO crystallites.

This Nb-rich phase affects the electronic structure by filling cationic vacancies in NiO. This reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation, which enhances the diffusion of unselective oxygen species inside the bulk and increases selective oxygen species on the surface. As a result, Nb-doped catalysts generally show lower activity but higher selectivity compared to pure NiO.

The key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interaction between NiO and the amorphous Nb-rich phase.

2. Optimizing the Nb concentration to balance activity and selectivity.

3. Controlling the formation and distribution of the Nb-rich phase on the NiO surface.

4. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts over long periods of operation.

5. Ensuring safety in handling and using these catalysts in industrial-scale oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

铌掺杂对催化剂有复杂的影响。在低浓度（2-4原子%）时，它可以通过减小NiO晶粒尺寸和可能降低聚集来改善催化剂性能。然而，在更高的浓度下，它形成了一种覆盖NiO晶粒的无定形NixNbyO相。

这种富铌相通过填充NiO中的阳离子空位影响电子结构。这减少了氧解离的活性位点数量，增强了非选择性氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了表面上的选择性氧物种。因此，与纯NiO相比，掺铌催化剂通常表现出较低的活性但较高的选择性。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对NiO和无定形富铌相之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。

2. 优化铌浓度以平衡活性和选择性。

3. 控制富铌相在NiO表面的形成和分布。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The efficiency of nickel oxide catalysts was improved by using them unsupported rather than supporting them on inorganic materials. Additionally, doping NiO with various elements, particularly niobium, has been a successful strategy to enhance catalytic performance.

Dopant concentrations: Niobium doping has shown the best results among various dopants. The concentration of niobium plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity. At low concentrations (3-4 at.%), niobium doping leads to smaller NiO crystallites (7-13 nm) and improved catalytic performance. However, at higher concentrations (>5 at.%), the NbNiO composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH.

Vacancy formation: Niobium doping affects the vacancy formation in NiO. It reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies. This process enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O- oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2- oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between the dopant, the NiO structure, and the catalytic process at an atomic level.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity, as higher niobium content leads to lower activity but higher selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high ethene yields while maintaining high selectivity, especially at higher temperatures.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the catalytic process, particularly when dealing with highly reactive oxygen species and flammable hydrocarbons.

5. Structural characterization: Accurately determining the distribution and role of the amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase in the catalyst structure.

6. Scalability: Developing methods to produce these nanostructured catalysts on an industrial scale while maintaining their unique properties.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

制备方法：通过使用未负载的氧化镍催化剂而不是将其负载在无机材料上，提高了催化剂的效率。此外，用各种元素（尤其是铌）掺杂NiO也是提高催化性能的成功策略。

掺杂浓度：在各种掺杂元素中，铌掺杂显示了最佳结果。铌的浓度在决定催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。在低浓度（3-4 at.%）下，铌掺杂导致更小的NiO晶粒（7-13 nm）和改善的催化性能。然而，在更高的浓度（>5 at.%）下，NbNiO复合物在乙烷ODH反应中的活性降低但选择性提高。

空位形成：铌掺杂影响NiO中的空位形成。它通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点数量。这个过程增强了非选择性、亲电子O-氧物种在体相内的扩散，并增加了催化剂表面上较不活泼、选择性的亲核O2-氧物种的数量。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：在原子水平上理解掺杂剂、NiO结构和催化过程之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡，因为更高的铌含量导致较低的活性但较高的选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持高选择性的同时实现高乙烯产率，特别是在较高温度下。

4. 安全性：确保催化过程的安全操作，尤其是在处理高反应性氧物种和易燃烃类时。

5. 结构表征：准确确定催化剂结构中非晶态富铌氧化物相的分布和作用。

6. 可扩展性：开发在工业规模上生产这些纳米结构催化剂的方法，同时保持其独特性能。
