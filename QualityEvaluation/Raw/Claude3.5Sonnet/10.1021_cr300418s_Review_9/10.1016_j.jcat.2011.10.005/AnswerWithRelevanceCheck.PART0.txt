          [1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[6] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[7] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[8] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[9] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[10] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene.

Preparation methods:
1. Using unsupported nickel oxides instead of supporting them on inorganic materials improved catalyst efficiency.
2. Doping NiO with various elements, particularly niobium, has been a successful strategy to enhance catalytic performance.
3. Sol-gel methods using citric acid can produce catalysts with higher surface areas compared to precipitation methods.

Dopant concentrations:
1. Niobium has shown the best results among various dopants.
2. Low concentrations of Nb (3-4 at%) can improve catalyst efficiency by increasing selectivity while maintaining high activity.
3. At Nb content >5 at%, NbNiO composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH.
4. The presence of Nb limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits NiO reducibility.

Vacancy formation:
1. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies.
2. This enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O- oxygen species inside the bulk.
3. It also increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2- oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The electronic structure and catalytic performance are influenced by:
1. The formation of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface.
2. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer.
3. Possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:
1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between NiO and the Nb-rich phase.
2. Process optimization to balance activity, selectivity, and stability.
3. Understanding and controlling the formation and distribution of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Developing preparation methods that allow precise control over dopant concentration and distribution.
5. Ensuring safe operation under oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures.
6. Preventing catalyst deactivation due to restructuring under reaction conditions.

          氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应（如乙烷到乙烯）中的催化性能。

制备方法：
1. 使用未负载的氧化镍而非将其负载在无机材料上提高了催化剂效率。
2. 用各种元素（尤其是铌）掺杂NiO是提高催化性能的成功策略。
3. 使用柠檬酸的溶胶-凝胶法可以产生比沉淀法具有更高比表面积的催化剂。

掺杂浓度：
1. 在各种掺杂元素中，铌显示了最佳结果。
2. 低浓度的Nb（3-4原子%）可以通过提高选择性同时保持高活性来改善催化剂效率。
3. 在Nb含量>5原子%时，NbNiO复合物在乙烷ODH反应中活性降低但选择性提高。
4. Nb的存在限制了NiO晶粒的尺寸并抑制了NiO的可还原性。

空位形成：
1. 铌通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点数量。
2. 这增强了非选择性、亲电子O-氧物种在体相内的扩散。
3. 它还增加了催化剂表面上较不活泼、选择性的亲核O2-氧物种的数量。

电子结构和催化性能受到以下因素的影响：
1. 覆盖部分NiO晶粒表面的非晶态富铌氧化物相（Nb2O5，NiNb2O6）的形成。
2. NiO与薄的富铌混合氧化物层之间的紧密相互作用。
3. 在ODH条件下纳米复合材料可能发生的重构。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：
1. 对NiO和富铌相之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化工艺以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
3. 理解和控制催化剂表面氧物种的形成和分布。
4. 开发允许精确控制掺杂剂浓度和分布的制备方法。
5. 确保在高温氧化条件下的安全操作。
6. 防止催化剂在反应条件下由于重构而失活。
