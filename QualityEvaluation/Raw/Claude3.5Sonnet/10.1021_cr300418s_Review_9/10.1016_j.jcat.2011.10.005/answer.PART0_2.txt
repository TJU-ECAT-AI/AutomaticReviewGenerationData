[1] "These limitations could be waived by producing ethylene under oxidizing conditions, from catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane."

[2] "Among this latter class, mixed oxides selectively produce ethene at particularly low temperature. It is the case of MoV-based systems [24] (doped with Nb) initially developed in 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [25] and refined later by Lopez Nieto et al. [26] and, more recently, NiNbTa-based systems discovered by a combinatorial approach in 2003 [27]."

[3] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[4] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[5] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods affect the morphology and surface area of the catalysts. For example, using a sol-gel method with citric acid can produce nickel oxides with higher surface areas and better catalytic performance compared to precipitation methods.

Dopant concentrations, particularly niobium, play a crucial role in modifying the catalyst's properties. Low concentrations of Nb (3-4 at%) can improve catalyst efficiency by increasing selectivity while maintaining high activity. Higher Nb concentrations (>5 at%) tend to decrease activity but further increase selectivity.

Vacancy formation is influenced by the presence of dopants. Niobium is believed to fill cationic vacancies in the NiO structure, which affects the distribution and mobility of oxygen species. This modification alters the balance between selective and non-selective active sites on the catalyst surface.

The key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact mechanisms of how dopants modify the electronic structure and catalytic properties of NiO.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity when adding dopants.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Developing catalysts that maintain high activity while improving selectivity to the desired products.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the catalytic process, especially when working with oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures.

5. Structural characterization: Accurately determining the distribution and role of amorphous phases that may form with certain dopants.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and careful process engineering to develop improved catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法影响催化剂的形态和比表面积。例如，使用柠檬酸的溶胶-凝胶法可以生产出比表面积更高、催化性能更好的氧化镍，相比于沉淀法而言。

掺杂浓度，特别是铌的浓度，在改变催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。低浓度的Nb（3-4原子%）可以通过提高选择性同时保持高活性来改善催化剂效率。更高的Nb浓度（>5原子%）往往会降低活性但进一步提高选择性。

空位形成受掺杂剂存在的影响。铌被认为可以填充NiO结构中的阳离子空位，这影响了氧物种的分布和移动性。这种修饰改变了催化剂表面选择性和非选择性活性位点之间的平衡。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解掺杂剂如何修改NiO电子结构和催化性能的确切机制。

2. 工艺优化：在添加掺杂剂时平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：开发保持高活性同时提高对目标产品选择性的催化剂。

4. 安全性：确保催化过程的安全操作，特别是在高温氧化条件下工作时。

5. 结构表征：准确确定某些掺杂剂可能形成的非晶相的分布和作用。

这些挑战需要多学科方法，结合先进的表征技术、计算机建模和精心的工艺工程，以开发改进的氧化脱氢反应催化剂。
