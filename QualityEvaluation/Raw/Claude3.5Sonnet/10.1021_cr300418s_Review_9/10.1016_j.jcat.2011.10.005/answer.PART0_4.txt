[1] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[2] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[3] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[4] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

[5] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[6] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation methods: The efficiency of nickel oxide catalysts was improved by using them unsupported rather than supporting them on inorganic materials. Additionally, doping NiO with various elements, particularly niobium, has been a successful strategy to enhance catalytic performance.

Dopant concentrations: Niobium doping has shown the best results among various dopants. The concentration of niobium plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity. At low concentrations (3-4 at.%), niobium doping leads to smaller NiO crystallites (7-13 nm) and improved catalytic performance. However, at higher concentrations (>5 at.%), the NbNiO composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH.

Vacancy formation: Niobium doping affects the vacancy formation in NiO. It reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies. This process enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O- oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2- oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between the dopant, the NiO structure, and the catalytic process at an atomic level.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-off between activity and selectivity, as higher niobium content leads to lower activity but higher selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Achieving high ethene yields while maintaining high selectivity, especially at higher temperatures.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation of the catalytic process, particularly when dealing with highly reactive oxygen species and flammable hydrocarbons.

5. Structural characterization: Accurately determining the distribution and role of the amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase in the catalyst structure.

6. Scalability: Developing methods to produce these nanostructured catalysts on an industrial scale while maintaining their unique properties.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

制备方法：通过使用未负载的氧化镍催化剂而不是将其负载在无机材料上，提高了催化剂的效率。此外，用各种元素（尤其是铌）掺杂NiO也是提高催化性能的成功策略。

掺杂浓度：在各种掺杂元素中，铌掺杂显示了最佳结果。铌的浓度在决定催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。在低浓度（3-4 at.%）下，铌掺杂导致更小的NiO晶粒（7-13 nm）和改善的催化性能。然而，在更高的浓度（>5 at.%）下，NbNiO复合物在乙烷ODH反应中的活性降低但选择性提高。

空位形成：铌掺杂影响NiO中的空位形成。它通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点数量。这个过程增强了非选择性、亲电子O-氧物种在体相内的扩散，并增加了催化剂表面上较不活泼、选择性的亲核O2-氧物种的数量。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：在原子水平上理解掺杂剂、NiO结构和催化过程之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡活性和选择性之间的权衡，因为更高的铌含量导致较低的活性但较高的选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：在保持高选择性的同时实现高乙烯产率，特别是在较高温度下。

4. 安全性：确保催化过程的安全操作，尤其是在处理高反应性氧物种和易燃烃类时。

5. 结构表征：准确确定催化剂结构中非晶态富铌氧化物相的分布和作用。

6. 可扩展性：开发在工业规模上生产这些纳米结构催化剂的方法，同时保持其独特性能。
