The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, or their influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The text is a book review of "Metal Oxides: Chemistry and Applications" and does not go into detail about specific catalytic systems or reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.
