[1] "The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support, followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum."

[2] "Ruckenstein et al. have described that Ni species loaded on MgO catalyst exist in the form of a solid solution, which stabilizes nickel against sintering during the CO2 reforming of methane"

[3] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[4] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiO–MgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[5] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 onto a suspended support, followed by evaporation under vacuum. This method allows for good dispersion of NiO on the support.

2. Dopant concentration: The study used 5 wt% Ni loading, which was found to be optimal for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) reaction.

3. Vacancy formation: The formation of a NiO-MgO solid solution on the surface of high-surface-area MgO stabilizes nickel against sintering and helps maintain the NiO phase, which is crucial for the ODHE reaction.

4. Electronic structure: The active phase for ODHE was found to be NiO surrounded by NiO-MgO solid solution. Maintaining Ni species as NiO is essential for the reaction, as reduced metallic Ni leads to partial oxidation instead of dehydrogenation.

5. Catalytic performance: Highly dispersed NiO on high-surface-area MgO (particle size around 7 nm) was found to be effective for ODHE, providing high ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the formation and behavior of NiO-MgO solid solutions and their impact on catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions (temperature, O2 partial pressure, space velocity) to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity while preventing the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni, which leads to undesired partial oxidation reactions.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with operating at high temperatures (600°C) and controlling the oxygen concentration to avoid explosive mixtures.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将Ni(acac)2的乙醇溶液浸渍到悬浮的载体上，然后在真空下蒸发制备而成。这种方法可以使NiO在载体上得到良好的分散。

2. 掺杂浓度：研究使用了5 wt%的Ni负载量，这被发现是乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）反应的最佳负载量。

3. 空位形成：在高比表面积MgO表面形成的NiO-MgO固溶体可以稳定镍，防止其烧结，并有助于维持NiO相，这对ODHE反应至关重要。

4. 电子结构：ODHE反应的活性相被发现是被NiO-MgO固溶体包围的NiO。保持Ni物种为NiO对反应至关重要，因为还原成金属Ni会导致部分氧化而不是脱氢。

5. 催化性能：在高比表面积MgO上高度分散的NiO（粒径约7 nm）被发现对ODHE反应非常有效，提供了高的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测NiO-MgO固溶体的形成和行为及其对催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件（温度、O2分压、空速）以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不希望的副反应。

3. 效率和选择性：保持高乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性，同时防止NiO还原为金属Ni，后者会导致不希望的部分氧化反应。

4. 安全性：管理高温（600°C）操作相关的风险，并控制氧气浓度以避免形成爆炸性混合物。
