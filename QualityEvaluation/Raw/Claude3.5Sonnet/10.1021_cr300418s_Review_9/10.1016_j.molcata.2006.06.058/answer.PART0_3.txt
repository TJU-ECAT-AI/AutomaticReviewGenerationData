[4] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential."

[5] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For catalyst preparation, the study used an impregnation method with nickel acetylacetonate in ethanol solution on various supports, with MgO being the most effective. The nickel loading was optimized at 5 wt%, and calcination temperature played a crucial role in forming a NiO-MgO solid solution.

The formation of a NiO-MgO solid solution was key to the catalyst's performance. Higher calcination temperatures (around 800°C) promoted the diffusion of NiO into the MgO lattice, creating this solid solution. This structure, where NiO is surrounded by NiO-MgO solid solution, was identified as the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

Particle size and dispersion were critical factors. The study found that NiO particles around 7 nm in size, highly dispersed on high-surface-area MgO, were most effective for ODHE. This highlights the importance of controlling particle size and maintaining high dispersion during catalyst preparation.

The main challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism at the atomic level.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions (temperature, oxygen partial pressure, space velocity) to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene selectivity at high ethane conversion rates, which is often challenging due to over-oxidation.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with operating at high temperatures with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

5. Catalyst stability: Ensuring long-term stability of the catalyst structure, particularly preventing sintering or phase changes of the NiO particles.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and careful process engineering to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

在催化剂制备方面，该研究使用乙醇溶液中的乙酰丙酮镍盐浸渍各种载体的方法，其中氧化镁最为有效。镍的最佳负载量为5 wt%，煅烧温度在形成NiO-MgO固溶体方面起着关键作用。

NiO-MgO固溶体的形成是催化剂性能的关键。较高的煅烧温度（约800°C）促进了NiO向MgO晶格的扩散，形成这种固溶体。这种结构，即NiO被NiO-MgO固溶体包围，被确定为乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）的活性相。

粒径和分散度是关键因素。研究发现，在高比表面积MgO上高度分散的约7 nm大小的NiO颗粒对ODHE最有效。这凸显了在催化剂制备过程中控制粒径和保持高分散度的重要性。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：在原子水平上理解活性位点的确切性质和反应机理。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件（温度、氧分压、空速）以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

3. 效率和选择性：在高乙烷转化率下保持高乙烯选择性，这通常因过度氧化而具有挑战性。

4. 安全性：管理在高温下操作潜在爆炸性的烃类和氧气混合物的风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：确保催化剂结构的长期稳定性，特别是防止NiO颗粒的烧结或相变。

这些挑战需要多学科方法，结合先进的表征技术、计算机建模和精心的过程工程，以开发更高效和选择性的氧化脱氢反应催化系统。
