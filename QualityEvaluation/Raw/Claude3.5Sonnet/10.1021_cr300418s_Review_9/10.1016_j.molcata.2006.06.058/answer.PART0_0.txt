[1] "The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support, followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum."

[2] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE), the study focused on NiO catalysts supported on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO). The preparation method involved impregnating the support with an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2, followed by evaporation and drying under vacuum. The optimal Ni loading was found to be 5 wt%.

The electronic structure and catalytic performance were greatly influenced by the interaction between NiO and the support. The active phase for ODHE was determined to be NiO surrounded by a NiO-MgO solid solution. This structure was crucial for maintaining Ni in its oxide form, which was essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. When NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the reaction pathway shifted from dehydrogenation to partial oxidation of ethane.

The high surface area of MgO was critical in keeping Ni species as NiO. This resulted in highly dispersed NiO particles with sizes around 7 nm, which proved effective for ODHE.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between NiO, the support, and the formation of solid solutions.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions to maintain NiO in its active form while achieving high conversion and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Preventing the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni, which leads to undesired partial oxidation reactions.

4. Safety: Managing the exothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and preventing the formation of explosive mixtures.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢(ODHE)，研究集中在高比表面积MgO(HS-MgO)负载的NiO催化剂上。制备方法涉及将Ni(acac)2的乙醇溶液浸渍到支撑体上，然后在真空下蒸发干燥。最佳的Ni负载量被发现为5 wt%。

电子结构和催化性能极大地受到NiO与支撑体之间相互作用的影响。ODHE的活性相被确定为被NiO-MgO固溶体包围的NiO。这种结构对于保持Ni的氧化形态至关重要，而这对脱氢反应是必不可少的。当NiO被还原为金属Ni时，反应路径从脱氢转变为乙烷的部分氧化。

MgO的高比表面积对于保持Ni物种为NiO形态至关重要。这导致了高度分散的NiO颗粒，其尺寸约为7 nm，对ODHE反应非常有效。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解NiO、支撑体以及固溶体形成之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件，以保持NiO的活性形态，同时实现高转化率和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：防止NiO还原为金属Ni，这会导致不期望的部分氧化反应。

4. 安全性：管理氧化脱氢反应的放热性质，并防止形成爆炸性混合物。
