[1] "NiO loaded on Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified."

[2] "Heracleous et al. have reported that Nb for NiONbnOm catalyst improves the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitates CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter"

[3] "When NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[4] "NiO and MgO are well known to form solid solution. Parmalaina et al. have reported that a high calcination temperature at 800 C favors the diffusion of NiO on the surface of MgO to the inside of the MgO lattice to form solid solution"

[5] "To evaluate sizes and the amount of reducible NiO on MgO after calcination, the calcined catalysts were hydrogen reduced at 400 C, and then CO adsorption was measured by pulse technique. The results are shown in Table 2. The amount of CO adsorbed decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature, indicating that loss of reducible NiO and increase in the particle sizes."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For ethane to ethylene conversion, highly dispersed NiO on supports like Al2O3 or MgO produces high ethylene yields. The dispersion of NiO can be improved by adding dopants like Nb, which acts as an electron transfer promoter and facilitates C-H bond activation.

The calcination temperature during catalyst preparation is crucial. Higher temperatures promote the formation of NiO-MgO solid solutions, which affects the reducibility and particle size of NiO. As calcination temperature increases, the amount of reducible NiO decreases and particle sizes increase, impacting catalytic performance.

The oxidation state of nickel is critical for selectivity. NiO is active for dehydrogenation, while metallic Ni promotes partial oxidation. Reduction of NiO to Ni can drastically decrease ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between NiO and support materials, as well as the effects of dopants.

2. Process optimization to maintain the desired NiO oxidation state and dispersion during reactions.

3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity, as higher conversions often lead to decreased selectivity due to over-oxidation of products.

4. Ensuring safety in handling oxygen-rich gas mixtures at high temperatures required for these reactions.

5. Understanding and controlling the formation of NiO-support solid solutions and their impact on catalytic properties.

6. Developing methods to precisely control NiO particle size and distribution on support materials.

7. Investigating the role of oxygen vacancies and defects in NiO catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷制乙烯的转化，高度分散在Al2O3或MgO等载体上的NiO可产生高乙烯收率。添加Nb等掺杂剂可以改善NiO的分散性，它作为电子转移促进剂，促进C-H键的活化。

催化剂制备过程中的焙烧温度至关重要。较高的温度促进NiO-MgO固溶体的形成，影响NiO的可还原性和粒子大小。随着焙烧温度的升高，可还原NiO的数量减少，粒子尺寸增大，影响催化性能。

镍的氧化态对选择性至关重要。NiO对脱氢反应有活性，而金属Ni促进部分氧化。NiO还原为Ni会大大降低乙烯选择性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对NiO与载体材料之间复杂相互作用以及掺杂剂效应的理论建模。

2. 优化工艺，在反应过程中保持所需的NiO氧化态和分散度。

3. 平衡效率和选择性，因为较高的转化率常常导致产物过度氧化，选择性降低。

4. 确保在这些反应所需的高温下处理富氧气体混合物的安全性。

5. 理解和控制NiO-载体固溶体的形成及其对催化性能的影响。

6. 开发精确控制NiO粒子大小和在载体材料上分布的方法。

7. 研究NiO催化剂中氧空位和缺陷的作用及其对催化性能的影响。
