The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE), the study focused on NiO catalysts supported on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO). The preparation method involved impregnating the support with an ethanol solution of Ni(acac)2, followed by evaporation and drying under vacuum. The optimal Ni loading was found to be 5 wt%.

The electronic structure and catalytic performance were greatly influenced by the interaction between NiO and the support. The active phase for ODHE was determined to be NiO surrounded by a NiO-MgO solid solution. This structure was crucial for maintaining Ni in its oxide form, which was essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. When NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the reaction pathway shifted from dehydrogenation to partial oxidation of ethane.

The high surface area of MgO was critical in keeping Ni species as NiO. This resulted in highly dispersed NiO particles with sizes around 7 nm, which proved effective for ODHE.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between NiO, the support, and the formation of solid solutions.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions to maintain NiO in its active form while achieving high conversion and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Preventing the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni, which leads to undesired partial oxidation reactions.

4. Safety: Managing the exothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and preventing the formation of explosive mixtures.

对于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢(ODHE)，研究集中在高比表面积MgO(HS-MgO)负载的NiO催化剂上。制备方法涉及将Ni(acac)2的乙醇溶液浸渍到支撑体上，然后在真空下蒸发干燥。最佳的Ni负载量被发现为5 wt%。

电子结构和催化性能极大地受到NiO与支撑体之间相互作用的影响。ODHE的活性相被确定为被NiO-MgO固溶体包围的NiO。这种结构对于保持Ni的氧化形态至关重要，而这对脱氢反应是必不可少的。当NiO被还原为金属Ni时，反应路径从脱氢转变为乙烷的部分氧化。

MgO的高比表面积对于保持Ni物种为NiO形态至关重要。这导致了高度分散的NiO颗粒，其尺寸约为7 nm，对ODHE反应非常有效。

这个催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解NiO、支撑体以及固溶体形成之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件，以保持NiO的活性形态，同时实现高转化率和选择性。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane to ethylene conversion, the study shows that highly dispersed NiO on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO) is particularly effective. The preparation method involves loading NiO onto HS-MgO, with an optimal Ni loading of 5 wt%. The high surface area of MgO is crucial for maintaining Ni species as NiO, which is the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

The electronic structure plays a key role, as evidenced by the fact that reduced metallic Ni favors partial oxidation of ethane to CO and H2, while NiO promotes dehydrogenation to ethylene. This suggests that the oxidation state of Ni is critical for selectivity.

Particle size is another important factor, with HR-TEM images showing NiO particles of around 7 nm on HS-MgO being effective for ODHE. This indicates that controlling particle size during preparation is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact nature of active sites and the mechanism of ODHE on NiO catalysts.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions (temperature, O2 partial pressure, space velocity) to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene selectivity at high ethane conversion rates, as secondary oxidation of ethylene to CO2 can occur.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with using oxygen in high-temperature hydrocarbon reactions.

5. Catalyst stability: Ensuring the catalyst maintains its activity and selectivity over extended periods, preventing reduction of NiO to metallic Ni during operation.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, theoretical studies, and careful process engineering to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

对于乙烷转化为乙烯，研究表明高度分散在高比表面积氧化镁（HS-MgO）上的NiO特别有效。制备方法包括将NiO负载到HS-MgO上，最佳Ni负载量为5 wt%。MgO的高比表面积对于保持Ni物种为NiO态至关重要，这是乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）的活性相。

电子结构起着关键作用，这从还原态金属Ni有利于乙烷部分氧化生成CO和H2，而NiO促进脱氢生成乙烯的事实可以看出。这表明Ni的氧化态对选择性至关重要。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解NiO催化剂上活性位点的确切性质和ODHE机理。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件（温度、O2分压、空速）以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

3. 效率和选择性：在高乙烷转化率下保持高乙烯选择性，因为乙烯的二次氧化生成CO2可能发生。

4. 安全性：管理高温碳氢化合物反应中使用氧气的相关风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：确保催化剂在长期使用中保持其活性和选择性，防止运行过程中NiO还原为金属Ni。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For ethane to ethylene conversion, highly dispersed NiO on supports like Al2O3 or MgO produces high ethylene yields. The dispersion of NiO can be improved by adding dopants like Nb, which acts as an electron transfer promoter and facilitates C-H bond activation.

The calcination temperature during catalyst preparation is crucial. Higher temperatures promote the formation of NiO-MgO solid solutions, which affects the reducibility and particle size of NiO. As calcination temperature increases, the amount of reducible NiO decreases and particle sizes increase, impacting catalytic performance.

The oxidation state of nickel is critical for selectivity. NiO is active for dehydrogenation, while metallic Ni promotes partial oxidation. Reduction of NiO to Ni can drastically decrease ethylene selectivity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between NiO and support materials, as well as the effects of dopants.

2. Process optimization to maintain the desired NiO oxidation state and dispersion during reactions.

3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity, as higher conversions often lead to decreased selectivity due to over-oxidation of products.

4. Ensuring safety in handling oxygen-rich gas mixtures at high temperatures required for these reactions.

5. Understanding and controlling the formation of NiO-support solid solutions and their impact on catalytic properties.

6. Developing methods to precisely control NiO particle size and distribution on support materials.

7. Investigating the role of oxygen vacancies and defects in NiO catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For catalyst preparation, the study used an impregnation method with nickel acetylacetonate in ethanol solution on various supports, with MgO being the most effective. The nickel loading was optimized at 5 wt%, and calcination temperature played a crucial role in forming a NiO-MgO solid solution.

The formation of a NiO-MgO solid solution was key to the catalyst's performance. Higher calcination temperatures (around 800°C) promoted the diffusion of NiO into the MgO lattice, creating this solid solution. This structure, where NiO is surrounded by NiO-MgO solid solution, was identified as the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

Particle size and dispersion were critical factors. The study found that NiO particles around 7 nm in size, highly dispersed on high-surface-area MgO, were most effective for ODHE. This highlights the importance of controlling particle size and maintaining high dispersion during catalyst preparation.

The main challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism at the atomic level.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions (temperature, oxygen partial pressure, space velocity) to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene selectivity at high ethane conversion rates, which is often challenging due to over-oxidation.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with operating at high temperatures with potentially explosive mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen.

5. Catalyst stability: Ensuring long-term stability of the catalyst structure, particularly preventing sintering or phase changes of the NiO particles.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and careful process engineering to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
