[1] "NiO loaded on Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified."

[2] "If NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni."

[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE. To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."

[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

For ethane to ethylene conversion, the study shows that highly dispersed NiO on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO) is particularly effective. The preparation method involves loading NiO onto HS-MgO, with an optimal Ni loading of 5 wt%. The high surface area of MgO is crucial for maintaining Ni species as NiO, which is the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

The electronic structure plays a key role, as evidenced by the fact that reduced metallic Ni favors partial oxidation of ethane to CO and H2, while NiO promotes dehydrogenation to ethylene. This suggests that the oxidation state of Ni is critical for selectivity.

Particle size is another important factor, with HR-TEM images showing NiO particles of around 7 nm on HS-MgO being effective for ODHE. This indicates that controlling particle size during preparation is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the exact nature of active sites and the mechanism of ODHE on NiO catalysts.

2. Process optimization: Balancing reaction conditions (temperature, O2 partial pressure, space velocity) to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maintaining high ethylene selectivity at high ethane conversion rates, as secondary oxidation of ethylene to CO2 can occur.

4. Safety: Managing the risks associated with using oxygen in high-temperature hydrocarbon reactions.

5. Catalyst stability: Ensuring the catalyst maintains its activity and selectivity over extended periods, preventing reduction of NiO to metallic Ni during operation.

These challenges require a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, theoretical studies, and careful process engineering to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

对于乙烷转化为乙烯，研究表明高度分散在高比表面积氧化镁（HS-MgO）上的NiO特别有效。制备方法包括将NiO负载到HS-MgO上，最佳Ni负载量为5 wt%。MgO的高比表面积对于保持Ni物种为NiO态至关重要，这是乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）的活性相。

电子结构起着关键作用，这从还原态金属Ni有利于乙烷部分氧化生成CO和H2，而NiO促进脱氢生成乙烯的事实可以看出。这表明Ni的氧化态对选择性至关重要。

粒子尺寸是另一个重要因素，HR-TEM图像显示HS-MgO上约7 nm的NiO粒子对ODHE有效。这表明在制备过程中控制粒子尺寸对优化催化性能至关重要。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解NiO催化剂上活性位点的确切性质和ODHE机理。

2. 过程优化：平衡反应条件（温度、O2分压、空速）以最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

3. 效率和选择性：在高乙烷转化率下保持高乙烯选择性，因为乙烯的二次氧化生成CO2可能发生。

4. 安全性：管理高温碳氢化合物反应中使用氧气的相关风险。

5. 催化剂稳定性：确保催化剂在长期使用中保持其活性和选择性，防止运行过程中NiO还原为金属Ni。

这些挑战需要多学科方法，结合先进的表征技术、理论研究和精心的过程工程，以开发更高效和选择性的氧化脱氢反应催化系统。
