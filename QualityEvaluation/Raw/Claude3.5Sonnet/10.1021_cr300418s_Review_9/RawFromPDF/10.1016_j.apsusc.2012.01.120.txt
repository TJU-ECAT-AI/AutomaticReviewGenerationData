 Introduction
The
 industrial
 production
 of
 ethylene
 from
 ethane
 is
 by
 thermal
pyrolysis,
 which
 is
 a
 costly
 process
 in
 energy
 [1].  Many
 attempts
 to
replace
 this
 process
 by
 catalytic
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 have
been
 carried
 out.
 One
 challenge
 for
 the
 process
 is
 how
 to
 achieve
high
 selectivity
 and
 yield
 to
 ethylene
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 oxygen
at
 low
 temperature
 [2,3],
 because
 ethylene
 is
 more
 reactive
 than
ethane
 and
 side
 reactions
 such
 as
 cracking
 and
 combustion
 are
easier
 to
 occur.
 Research
 on
 the
 catalysts
 of
 oxidative
 dehydrogena-
tion
 of
 ethane
 (ODHE)
 usually
 falls
 into
 two
 operating
 temperature
categories,
 above
 or
 below
 the
 temperature
 at
 which
 signiﬁcant
gas-phase
 reaction
 mechanisms
 participate
 [4].  High
 tempera-
ture
 catalyst
 mainly
 contains
 alkali-metal
 and
 alkaline-earth-metal
oxides
 supported
 on
 transition-metal
 oxides,
 rare-earth-metal
oxides
 systems
 and
 other
 catalytic
 materials
 [5–12].
 Low
 temper-
ature
 catalysts
 usually
 consist
 of
 reducible
 transition
 metal
 oxides.
Earlier
 transition
 metals
 (Mo,
 V)
 based
 multi-component
 catalysts
were
 mostly
 researched
 [13–17].  Therein,
 MoVTeNb
 catalyst
 exhib-
ited
 excellent
 ODHE
 performance
 with
 75%
 ethylene
 yield
 at
 400 ◦C
[15].
 Due
 to
 the
 complicated
 multi-component
 structure,
 how-
ever,
 the
 mechanisms
 of
 the
 type
 of
 catalysts
 are
 difﬁcult
 to
 be
investigated.

NiO,
 as
 a
 mono-component
 oxide
 catalyst,
 has
 attracted
increasing
 attention
 since
 NiO
 was
 regarded
 as
 a
 potential
 low-
temperature
 catalyst
 for
 ODHE
 reaction
 [18,19].  In
 order
 to
 improve
the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 NiO,
 nano-NiO
 [20,21]
 and
 meso-NiO
[22]
 were
 prepared
 and
 their
 catalytic
 activities
 were
 increased
to
 some
 extent.
 The
 selectivity
 to
 ethylene,
 however,
 is
 not
 desir-
able
 enough.
 Although
 the
 ethylene
 selectivity
 could
 be
 increased
effectively
 when
 NiO
 was
 loaded
 on
 the
 supports
 with
 high
 sur-
face
 area
 such
 as
 Al2O3,
 the
 reaction
 temperature
 was
 increased
distinctly
 [23].
 Therefore,
 in
 order
 to
 promote
 the
 catalytic
 perfor-
mance
 some
 transition
 metal
 oxides
 were
 selected
 to
 dope
 into
 NiO,
which
 showed
 remarkable
 effect
 on
 the
 catalytic
 behavior
 [24–27].
Especially,
 NiNbO
 catalyst
 exhibited
 good
 low-temperature
 cat-
alytic
 performance
 with
 40%
 ethylene
 yield
 and
 70%
 selectivity
 at
400 ◦C
 [27].
 The
 function
 of
 Nb
 is
 its
 enhancing
 action
 on
 the
 ethy-
lene
 selectivity
 by
 reducing
 the
 oxidizing
 species
 on
 the
 surface
 for
the
 total
 oxidation
 of
 ethane.
These
 studied
 effectual
 dopants
 of
 NiO
 were
 generally
 transi-
tion
 metals
 possessing
 variable
 valence.
 As
 a
 relatively
 steady
 metal
with
 single
 valance,
 Zr
 has
 seldom
 been
 reported
 to
 be
 dopant
 for
ODHE
 reaction,
 although
 it
 is
 frequently
 reported
 to
 be
 a
 unique
 car-
rier
 [28,29]. In
 this
 work,
 Zr
 was
 used
 to
 be
 a
 dopant
 to
 improve
 the
performance
 of
 NiO
 catalyst
 for
 ODHE
 reaction.
 A
 modiﬁed
 sol–gel
method
 was
 applied
 to
 prepare
 Ni–Zr–O
 nanoparticles
 because
 the
preparation
 method
 could
 inﬂuence
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 [30].
Zr
 content
 was
 studied
 with
 regard
 to
 the
 behavior
 for
 the
 ethane
oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 to
 ethylene,
 and
 the
 function
 of
 Zr
 was
also
 discussed.

 Experiment
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
A
 series
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts
 with
 varying
 Zr
 contents
 were
prepared
 by
 a
 modiﬁed
 sol–gel
 method
 using
 Ni(NO3)2·6H2O
 and
Zr(NO3)4·5H2O.
 They
 were
 dissolved
 in
 de-ionized
 water
 respec-
tively
 and
 simultaneously
 added
 dropwise
 into
 stoichiometric
 citric
acid
 solution
 under
 stirring
 to
 generate
 a
 completely
 homogeneous
and
 transparent
 solution.
 Then
 the
 water
 was
 evaporated
 with
 con-
tinuous
 stirring
 at
 70 ◦C
 until
 a
 highly
 viscous
 gel-like
 material
 was
formed.
 After
 further
 drying
 at
 110 ◦C
 for
 24
 h,
 the
 sponge-like
 and
brittle
 solid
 was
 calcined
 at
 450 ◦C
 for
 6
 h
 in
 air.
 The
 obtained
 sample
was
 denoted
 as
 X
 %
 Ni–Zr–O
 (X
 means
 the
 molar
 ratio
 of
 Zr/(Ni
 +
 Zr),
X
 =
 5,
 10,
 20,

 For
 comparison
 purposes,
 pure
 nickel
 and
zirconium
 oxide
 were
 also
 prepared
 by
 the
 same
 method.

 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 speciﬁc
 surface
 areas
 of
 all
 prepared
 catalysts
 were
 deter-
mined
 by
 a
 surface
 area
 analyzer
 (Quantachrome,
 Autosorb-1)
using
 nitrogen
 adsorption
 analysis
 at
 the
 liquid
 nitrogen
 tempera-
ture
 of
 −196 ◦C
 with
 the
 BET
 method.
X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 patterns
 were
 collected
 on
 a
 Philips
PW3040/60
 powder
 diffractometer
 operating
 at
 40
 kV
 and
 40
 mA
using
 
Cu
 
k
 
radiation
 
(
 =
 0.15406
 nm)
 
and
 
step
 
scanning
(0.2◦/min)
 in
 the
 2
 range
 of
 20–90◦.
High-resolution
 transmission
 electron
 microscopy
 (HRTEM)
was
 done
 using
 a
 JEM-2010F
 electron
 microscope
 operated
 at
 an
acceleration
 voltage
 of
 200
 kV.
 Scanning
 electron
 microscopy
 (SEM)
was
 done
 using
 a
 Hitachi
 S-4800
 scanning
 electron
 microscope
 with
of
 10
 kV
 accelerating
 voltage.
H2 temperature-programmed
 reduction
 (H2-TPR)
 studies
 were
carried
 out
 using
 a
 home
 made
 TPR
 apparatus.
 The
 samples
 were
loaded
 in
 a
 quartz
 reactor
 and
 heated
 to
 600 ◦C
 in
 a
 5%
 H2-Ar
 ﬂow
(25
 mL/min)
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min.
 H2 consumption
 was
 monitored
by
 a
 thermal
 conductivity
 detector.
 Water
 produced
 during
 the
reduction
 was
 removed
 with
 5 ˚
A  molecular
 sieves.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS)
 studies
 were
 per-
formed
 using
 a
 VG
 ESCALAB/Auger
 spectrometer
 to
 identify
 the
oxidation
 states
 of
 the
 surfaces
 by
 means
 of
 chemical
 shift
investigation.
 The
 effect
 of
 charging
 was
 corrected
 by
 means
of
 adventitious
 carbon
 (284.6
 eV)
 referencing.
 The
 areas
 of
 the
peaks
 were
 computed
 by
 ﬁtting
 the
 experimental
 spectra
 to
 Gaus-
sian/Lorenztian
 curves
 after
 removal
 of
 the
 background
 (Shirley
function).
 Surface
 atom
 ratios
 were
 calculated
 from
 peak
 area
 ratios
normalized
 by
 using
 the
 corresponding
 atomic
 sensitivity
 factors
[31].
O2
temperature-programmed
 desorption
 (O2-TPD)
 experi-
ments
 were
 conducted
 on
 a
 mass
 spectrometer
 (MS).
 The
 catalysts
(0.1
 g)
 were
 ﬁrst
 pretreated
 in
 air
 for
 0.5
 h
 at
 450 ◦C
 and
 then
 cooled
to
 room
 temperature.
 After
 the
 system
 was
 purged
 with
 a
 He
 gas
ﬂow
 to
 smooth
 the
 baseline,
 the
 sample
 was
 heated
 to
 600 ◦C
 under
He
 at
 a
 constant
 rate
 of
 15 ◦C/min
 under
 a
 gas
 ﬂow
 rate
 35
 mL/min.
The
 reactor
 exit
 was
 monitored
 online
 by
 a
 quadrupole
 mass
 ana-
lyzer
 (Balzer
 OmniStar
 200),
 and
 the
 desorbed
 oxygen
 was
 detected
by
 following
 the
 32
 (m/z)
 fragment.
The
 
acidity
 
of
 
samples
 
was
 
measured
 
by
 
temperature-
programmed
 desorption
 of
 ammonia
 (NH3-TPD).
 The
 sample
 (0.2
 g)
was
 placed
 into
 a
 quartz
 reactor
 and
 a
 ﬂow
 of
 NH3 was
 introduced
for
 30
 min.
 The
 gaseous
 or
 physisorbed
 NH3 was
 removed
 by
 N2
(20
 mL/min)
 at
 100 ◦C
 for
 1
 h,
 then
 the
 sample
 was
 heated
 to
 600 ◦C
with
 a
 rate
 of
 10 ◦C/min.
 The
 desorbed
 NH3 was
 monitored
 contin-
uously
 by
 following
 the
 15
 (m/z)
 fragments
 via
 a
 mass
 spectrometer
(HIDEN
 Analytical,
 QIC-20).
2.3.
 Catalytic
 reaction
The
 catalytic
 reactions
 were
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 quartz
 ﬁxed-bed
vertical-ﬂow
 tubular
 quartz
 reactor
 (i.d.

 packed
 with
 0.1

catalyst
 and
 0.18
 g

 were
 uniformly
 mixed
 and
 to
be
 used.
 The

10%
 Ni–Zr–O
 exhibits
 uniform

 with
a
 smaller
 average
 diameter
 of
 about
 7–10
 nm.
 The
 other
 Ni–Zr–O
samples
 with
 different
 Zr
 contents
 are
 similar
 in
 texture
 as
 it,
except
 for
 the
 difference
 of
 nanoparticle
 sizes.
 The
 variation
 in
speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 of
 the
 catalysts
 as
 a
 function
 of
 Zr
 content
is
 listed
 in
 Table
 1.
 For
 catalysts
 up
 to
 a
 Zr
 content
 of
 20%,
 sur-
face
 area
 increased
 with
 enhanced
 Zr
 content.
 With
 the
 further
rise
 in
 Zr
 content,
 there
 is
 a
 decrease
 in
 surface
 area.
 It
 indicates
that
 the
 appropriate
 mixing
 of
 Zr
 could
 restrain
 the
 growth
 of
 NiO
particles.

amorphous
 ZrO2 phase,
 was
 observed
 for
 20%
 and
 40%
 Ni–Zr–O
samples.
 Due
 to
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 broad
 peak,
 the
 NiO-like
 phase
shifted
 slightly
 to
 lower
 angle,
 especially
 the
 ﬁrst
 peak
 at
 ca.
 37◦.
As
 Zr
 content
 rose
 to
 75%,
 obvious
 diffraction
 peaks
 of
 tetragonal
ZrO2 were
 observed
 and
 the
 peaks
 of
 NiO
 phase
 were
 very
 weak.
The
 cell
 parameters’
 variation
 was
 calculated
 by
 the
 peak
 positions
of
 NiO-like
 phase
 by
 Debye–Scherrer
 method.
 The
 results,
 listed
in
 Table
 1,
 show
 that
 the
 cell
 parameter
 of
 the
 catalysts
 increased
with
 the
 increasing
 Zr
 content
 up
 to
 10%.
 Such
 increase
 indicates
that
 larger
 Zr4+ ions
 (0.72 ˚
A)
 [32]
 could
 enter
 the
 lattice
 of
 nickel
oxide
 and
 substitute
 Ni2+ (0.69 ˚
A)
 sites,
 which
 results
 in
 lattice
 dis-
tortion.
 This
 result
 could
 be
 further
 conﬁrmed
 by
 HRTEM
 image
shown
 in
 Fig.
 1(c).
 Based
 on
 the
 d(2
 0
 0)
 value,
 the
 cell
 parameter
of
 4.1873 ˚
A
 could
 be
 evaluated,
 consistent
 with
 the
 result
 calcu-
lated
 by
 XRD
 method.
 Further
 increase
 of
 the
 Zr
 amount,
 however,
does
 not
 cause
 the
 alteration
 of
 the
 cell
 parameter.
 The
 variation
in
 cell
 parameter
 suggests
 the
 existence
 of
 a
 solid
 solution
 of
 Zr4+
ions
 in
 NiO.
 The
 stable
 NiO
 cell
 parameter
 measured
 for
 the
 high-Zr
loading
 (≥20%)
 samples
 indicate
 that
 it
 has
 reached
 an
 upper
 limit
to
 the
 maximum
 possible
 dissolution
 of
 Zr4+ cations
 into
 the
 NiO
lattice.
 No
 detection
 on
 any
 XRD
 peaks
 related
 to
 phases
 of
 solid
solution
 is
 probably
 a
 result
 of
 the
 little
 extent
 of
 Zr4+ inﬁltration.
Nevertheless,
 it
 could
 be
 suggested
 that
 there
 is
 a
 strong
 interaction
between
 Zr
 and
 Ni.

 with

 Unlike
 large
 NiO
 with
 a
reduction
 peak
 in
 the
 range
 of
 300–450 ◦C
 [33],
 two
 narrower
reduction
 peaks
 at
 the
 lower
 temperature
 (230–330 ◦C)
 indicate
NiO
 nanoparticles
 is
 easy
 to
 be
 reduced
 due
 to
 its
 small
 parti-
cle
 sizes.
 The
 low-temperature
 peak
 corresponds
 to
 the
 reduction
of
 higher
 valence
 state
 NiO1+ı on
 the
 surface,
 while
 the
 high-
temperature
 peak
 is
 assigned
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 bulk
 nickel
 oxide.
After
 the
 addition
 of
 Zr,
 the
 reduction
 peaks
 became
 broader
 and
shifted
 to
 high
 temperature.
 For
 5%
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalyst,
 the
 shoulder
peak
 at
 about
 355 ◦C
 might
 be
 ascribed
 the
 reduction
 of
 Ni–O–Ni.
Compared
 with
 pure
 NiO,
 the
 temperature
 was
 increased
 approx-
imately
 125 ◦C
 because
 of
 a
 weak
 interaction
 at
 the
 interface
 of
NiO/ZrO2.
 The
 main
 peak
 at
 about
 415 ◦C
 could
 be
 attributed
 to
the
 reduction
 of
 Ni–O–Zr
 due
 to
 the
 strong
 interaction
 between
 Zr
and
 Ni
 cations.
 The
 increase
 in
 Zr
 content
 to
 10%
 resulted
 in
 the
decrease
 of
 the
 low-temperature
 reduction
 peak.
 Further
 increases
in
 Zr
 content
 did
 not
 change
 the
 reduction
 proﬁle
 a
 lot,
 only
 a
 little
shift
 to
 high
 temperature
 was
 observed.
 When
 Zr
 content
 increased
to
 a
 higher
 level,
 a
 little
 shoulder
 peak
 which
 might
 be
 assigned
 to
the
 reduction
 of
 NiO
 cluster
 surrounded
 by
 much
 ZrO2 appeared
 at
high
 temperature.
 It
 is
 obvious
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 Zr
 led
 to
 difﬁ-
culty
 in
 catalyst’s
 reduction
 due
 to
 the
 interaction
 of
 Ni
 and
 Zr.
 The
difference
 of
 reduction
 proﬁles
 between
 NiO
 and
 Ni–Zr–O
 might
 be
attributed
 to
 the
 combined
 effects
 of
 particle
 size
 and
 interaction
of
 Zr
 and
 Ni.
 The
 particle
 size
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 with
 Zr
 content
 below
40%
 is
 smaller
 than
 that
 of
 NiO,
 and
 thus
 the
 reduction
 peaks
 might
shift
 to
 low
 temperature.
 Meanwhile,
 due
 to
 the
 inﬁltration
 of
 Zr,
the
 catalysts
 became
 more
 difﬁcult
 to
 be
 reduced
 and
 the
 reduc-
tion
 peaks
 shifted
 to
 high
 temperature.
 Therefore,
 the
 broadened
reduction
 proﬁles
 are
 observed
 on
 the
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts,
 especially
for
 the
 sample
 with
 low
 Zr
 concentration.

 XPS
 studies
XPS
 measurements
 were
 performed
 to
 obtain
 information
about
 the
 oxidation
 state
 and
 chemical
 environment
 of
 the
 ele-
ments
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 nanoparticles.
 As
 Fig.

 showed,
there
 was
 a
 main
 peak
 located
 at
 528.8
 eV
 for
 NiO
 nanoparti-
cles
 in
 O1s
 spectra.
 The
 binding
 energy
 (B.E.)
 of
 O1s
 was
 seen
 to
shift
 from
 529.0
 eV
 for
 5%
 Ni–Zr–O
 to
 529.6
 eV
 for
 75%
 Ni–Zr–O,

approaching
 that
 of
 ZrO2 (529.7
 eV).
 It
 might
 be
 because
 higher
valence
 Zr4+ is
 easier
 to
 induce
 O2−than
 Ni2+,
 so
 the
 electron
 den-
sity
 around
 O2−decreases
 and
 subsequently
 results
 in
 the
 increase
of
 the
 O1s
 B.E.
 In
 the
 Ni2p3/2 spectra,
 all
 the
 samples
 exhibited
two
 resolvable
 peaks
 at
 B.E.
 of
 around
 853.4
 and
 855.3
 eV,
 with
a
 shakeup
 satellite
 at
 ∼860.5
 eV,
 which
 are
 assigned
 to
 Ni2+ and
Ni3+ species
 [34–36].  The
 Ni2p3/2 binding
 energy
 was
 seen
 shifting
to
 higher
 values
 with
 increasing
 Zr
 content,
 from
 853.9
 eV
 (5%)
 to
855.4
 eV
 (75%).
 The
 B.E.
 of
 the
 latter
 was
 near
 that
 of
 Ni3+.
 It
 can
 be
speculated
 that
 nanosized
 Ni–Zr–O
 contains
 more
 Ni2+ı contents,
so
 the
 B.E.
 was
 closer
 to
 that
 of
 Ni2O3.
 The
 Zr3d5/2 B.E.
 was
 seen
shifting
 to
 lower
 values
 with
 the
 Zr
 content
 decreasing.
 The
 B.E.
 of
5%
 Ni–Zr–O
 (181.4
 eV)
 was
 0.4
 eV
 less
 than
 that
 of
 ZrO2 nanopar-
ticle
 (181.8
 eV).
 The
 occurrence
 of
 electron
 transfer
 is
 easier
 from
low
 valence
 Ni2+ to
 high
 valence
 Zr4+ through
 the
 Zr–O–Ni
 bridge
linkage.
 Then
 the
 zirconium
 ion
 sites
 become
 electron-rich
 and
Zr3d5/2 emission
 shifts
 to
 lower
 B.E.
 values,
 as
 is
 accordant
 with
the
 change
 trend
 of
 Ni2p3/2 data.
 The
 XPS
 results
 clearly
 indicate
that
 the
 chemical
 valence
 of
 nickel
 and
 zirconium
 ion
 on
 the
 sur-
face
 has
 distinct
 variation
 for
 Ni–Zr–O
 compared
 with
 that
 of
 pure
NiO
 or
 ZrO2 nanoparticles.
 It
 further
 conﬁrms
 that
 there
 is
 a
 strong
interaction
 between
 Zr
 and
 Ni,
 which
 may
 have
 a
 strong
 effect
 on
the
 catalytic
 performance.
The
 quantitative
 results
 of
 the
 XPS
 analyses
 are
 also
 summarized
in
 Table
 1.
 The
 values
 of
 the
 surface
 composition
 were
 derived
 from
the
 integration
 of
 the
 Ni2p,
 Zr3d,
 and
 O1s
 core-level
 photoemis-
sion
 spectra,
 using
 the
 appropriate
 sensitivity
 correction
 factors.
The
 results
 showed
 that
 the
 surface
 Zr/(Zr
 +
 Ni)
 atomic
 ratios
 of
 the
catalyst
 with
 Zr
 content
 lower
 than
 10%
 were
 close
 to
 the
 nominal.
Whereas,
 when
 the
 concentration
 of
 Zr
 exceeds
 a
 certain
 amount,
it
 tended
 to
 be
 enriched
 on
 the
 surface.

 O2-TPD-MS
 studies

 shows
 the
 O2-TPD-MS
 ﬁtting
 curves
 of
 NiO
 and
 10%
Ni–Zr–O
 nanoparticles.
 NiO
 nanoparticles
 presented
 three
 peaks
at
 about
 305,
 373
 and
 461 ◦C
 respectively,
 denoting
 that
 there
 are
at
 least
 three
 different
 types
 of
 oxygen
 species.
 It
 was
 reported
that
 oxygen
 desorption
 from
 NiO
 occurring
 at
 temperatures
 below
700 ◦C
 corresponds
 to
 the
 non-stoichiometric
 oxygen
 [27,37]. The
peak
 located
 at
 320–360 ◦C
 was
 assigned
 to
 O2−,
 while
 the
 peaks
at
 420–450 ◦C
 and
 >520 ◦C
 were
 assigned
 to
 O−on
 different
 sites
[38].
 Considering
 the
 effect
 of
 different
 experiment
 parameters
 and
preparation
 methods
 [21],
 in
 this
 case
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 suggest
the
 ﬁrst
 oxygen
 desorption
 peak
 could
 be
 assigned
 to
 O2−,
 and
the
 two
 latter
 could
 be
 assigned
 to
 O−species.

decreased
 Ni
 content
 since
 the
 ZrO2 has
 no
 adsorption
 peak.
 Nev-
ertheless,
 the
 ratio
 of
 O−/O2−increased
 gradually
 with
 the
 increase
of
 Zr
 content.
 Besides,
 the
 desorption
 temperature
 of
 O−has
 a
 shift
to
 low
 temperature,
 indicating
 the
 better
 migratory
 capability
 of
the
 oxygen
 species.
 It
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 decreased
 electron
donor
 capability
 of
 Ni
 cations
 with
 higher
 valence
 due
 to
 the
 inter-
action
 between
 Ni
 and
 Zr.
 For
 75%
 Ni–Zr–O,
 only
 high-temperature
adsorption
 oxygen
 species
 appeared
 without
 low-temperature
ones.
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 repetition
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 exper-
iments
 without
 prior
 O2 adsorption
 yielded
 the
 same
 desorption
patterns.
 This
 result
 indicates
 that
 the
 desorbed
 oxygen
 originates
from
 the
 bulk
 structure
 of
 the
 materials
 under
 study.
3.5.
 Catalyst
 performance
The
 dependence
 of
 the
 catalytic
 behavior
 of
 the
 Ni–Zr–O
 cata-
lysts
 on
 Zr
 content
 and
 reaction
 temperature
 for
 selective
 oxidation
of
 ethane
 by
 oxygen
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7.
 The
 results
 in
 Fig.
 7(a)
showed
 that
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 strongly
 depended
 on
 the
reaction
 temperature.
 With
 reaction
 temperature
 rising,
 the
 ethane
conversion
 increased.
 Compared
 with
 pure
 NiO,
 the
 conversion
 of
ethane
 on
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts
 decreased
 gradually
 with
 the
 increase
of
 Zr
 content.
 The
 conversion
 of
 oxygen
 exhibited
 a
 similar
 trend
to
 that
 of
 ethane
 (Fig.
 7(b)).
 On
 pure
 NiO,
 the
 oxygen
 conversion

was
 over
 95%
 at
 350 ◦C
 and
 the
 reaction
 became
 a
 limiting
 oxygen
one.
 With
 the
 addition
 of
 Zr,
 the
 oxygen
 conversion
 decreased
 at
the
 same
 reaction
 temperature,
 suggesting
 an
 increase
 of
 ethylene
selectivity
 since
 the
 formation
 of
 CO2 consumed
 more
 oxygen
 than
C2H4.
 Ethylene
 selectivity
 versus
 ethane
 conversion
 is
 presented
 in
Fig.
 8.
 The
 pure
 NiO
 exhibited
 about
 55%
 selectivity
 with
 a
 low
 con-
version,
 and
 showed
 an
 observable
 drop
 in
 selectivity
 for
 ethylene
with
 increasing
 conversion
 due
 to
 secondary
 reaction
 of
 the
 oleﬁn
product.
 When
 the
 conversion
 reached
 50%,
 only
 47%
 of
 ethylene
selectivity
 could
 be
 obtained.
 It
 is
 obvious
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 Zr
remarkably
 promotes
 the
 ethylene
 selectivity.
 Even
 a
 little
 amount
(5%)
 of
 dopant
 could
 heighten
 selectivity
 up
 to
 approximate
 60%.
 It
is
 worthwhile
 to
 note
 that
 the
 selectivity
 remained
 relatively
 sta-
ble
 with
 the
 increased
 conversion.
 A
 further
 increase
 in
 Zr
 content
could
 raise
 the
 selectivity
 to
 a
 certain
 level
 (ca.
 66%).
 High
 Zr
 con-
tent
 (75%)
 brought
 the
 selectivity
 down
 again.
 The
 highest
 yield
 of
40%
 could
 be
 obtained
 at
 430 ◦C
 over
 10%
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalyst.
Although
 nanosized
 NiO
 exhibited
 much
 higher
 activity
 than
large
 NiO
 [21],
 an
 adverse
 factor
 of
 tending
 to
 deactivate
 at
 a
 low
temperature
 will
 restrain
 nanosized
 NiO
 to
 obtain
 high
 ethylene
yield.
 At
 350 ◦C
 NiO
 nanoparticles
 gave
 a
 maximum
 ethylene
 yield
of
 23%
 with
 ethylene
 selectivity
 of
 47%
 and
 ethylene
 and
 CO2 were
the
 only
 reaction
 products.
 When
 reaction
 temperature
 was
 fur-
ther
 increased,
 the
 catalyst
 would
 deactivate
 soon
 and
 ethylene
selectivity
 decreases
 sharply
 to
 zero
 with
 high
 ethane
 conversion.
In
 this
 case,
 ethane
 mainly
 converses
 to
 COx as
 the
 deep
 oxidation
product
 and
 CH4 from
 ethane
 cleavage.
 We  deﬁned
 the
 temper-
ature
 as
 deactivation
 temperature
 (Tde)
 of
 a
 catalyst.
 Tde of
 pure
NiO
 nanoparticles
 was
 about
 360 ◦C,
 while
 that
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 cata-
lyst
 showed
 an
 obvious
 rise.
 Tde of
 5%
 Ni–Zr–O
 was
 increased
 up
 to
410 ◦C.
 Further
 increase
 in
 Zr
 content
 could
 raise
 the
 temperature
above
 460 ◦C.
 In
 other
 words,
 ethane
 cleavage-resistant
 capability
of
 catalysts
 was
 greatly
 enhanced
 with
 mixing
 ZrO2.
Obviously,
 compared
 with
 NiO,
 Ni–Zr–O
 is
 a
 better
 catalyst
for
 ODHE
 with
 higher
 ethylene
 selectivity
 and
 ethane
 cleavage-
resistant
 capability.
 And
 thus,
 the
 added
 Zr
 should
 play
 an
important
 role.
 Since
 ZrO2 nanoparticles
 showed
 no
 activity
 below
550 ◦C,
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 suggest
 that
 Ni–O
 is
 the
 active
 site
 in
this
 reaction.
 The
 added
 Zr
 is
 highly
 dispersed
 in
 the
 catalyst
 and
restrains
 the
 growth
 of
 NiO.
 In
 general,
 the
 small
 particle
 size
is
 beneﬁcial
 for
 a
 catalyst
 to
 present
 a
 high
 catalytic
 activity.
 As
shown
 in
 Table
 2,
 the
 Ni–Zr–O
 sample
 (particle
 size
 is
 ∼7
 nm)
exhibits
 higher
 activity
 than
 Ni–Zr–O–L
 (particle
 size
 is
 ∼100
 nm).
For
 the
 NiO
 and
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalyst,
 however,
 it
 should
 be
 noted
 that
the
 size
 difference
 between
 the
 two
 catalysts
 is
 not
 so
 prominent
(only
 about
 2–5
 nm).
 It
 indicates
 that

size
 of
 NiO
 cannot
 explain
 the
 catalytic
 behavior
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 cat-
alyst
 completely.
 The
 dispersion
 and
 isolation
 of
 the
 additive
 Zr
might
 play
 the
 more
 important
 role.
 Thus,
 the
 different
 catalytic
behaviors
 between
 NiO
 and
 Ni–Zr–O
 might
 be
 explained
 as
 fol-
lows:
 On
 one
 hand,
 the
 decreased
 Ni
 concentration
 certainly
 leads
to
 a
 decrease
 of
 ethane
 conversion.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 less-
ened
 active
 site
 Ni
 could
 reduce
 the
 amount
 of
 non-stoichiometric
oxygen,
 resulting
 in
 the
 decrease
 of
 catalytic
 activity.
 At
 the
 same
time,
 the
 chance
 of
 deep
 oxidation
 was
 also
 restrained
 at
 some
 level
due
 to
 the
 isolation
 effect
 of
 Zr,
 and
 thus
 the
 ethylene
 selectivity
was
 increased.
It
 can
 be
 concluded
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 well-dispersed
 Zr
 into
NiO
 could
 contribute
 to
 improving
 the
 performance.
 Similar
 results,
however,
 could
 not
 be
 obtained
 on
 the
 catalyst
 of
 simply
 mixture
of
 ZrO2 and
 NiO.
 As
 shown
 in
 Table
 2,
 the
 mechanically
 mixture
of
 ZrO2 and
 NiO
 showed
 similar
 catalytic
 performance
 as
 pure
 NiO
catalyst.
 It
 indicates
 that
 there
 are
 more
 important
 reasons
 for
 the
superior
 performance
 of
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts.
 Based
 on
 the
 character-
ization
 results
 of
 TPR,
 XRD,
 and
 XPS,
 it
 can
 be
 found
 that
 there
 is
 a
strong
 interaction
 between
 Ni
 and
 Zr,
 which
 inﬂuences
 the
 physic-
ochemical
 property
 and
 consequently
 the
 behavior
 of
 catalyst.
 Due
to
 the
 combined
 effects
 of
 such
 interaction
 and
 particle
 size,
 the
reduction
 peaks
 became
 broader
 and
 shifted
 to
 high
 temperature.
The
 decreased
 reducibility
 makes
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts
 more
 difﬁcult
to
 be
 reduced
 to
 Ni
 metal
 under
 the
 same
 condition.
 It
 is
 beneﬁ-
cial
 to
 improve
 the
 ethane
 cleavage-resistant
 capability
 since
 the
appearance
 of
 Ni
 metal
 in
 the
 catalyst
 is
 the
 main
 reason
 of
 ethane
cleavage
 [33].
In
 addition,
 the
 interaction
 between
 Ni
 and
 Zr
 results
 in
 the
increased
 valence
 and
 accepting
 electron
 capability
 of
 Ni
 cations.
Therefore,
 the
 active
 site
 Ni
 tends
 to
 adsorb
 O−species
 than
 non-
selective
 oxygen
 species
 O2−,
 which
 is
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 increase
 of
ethylene
 selectivity.
 The
 ratio
 of
 O−/O2−increased
 gradually
 with
increasing
 Zr
 content,
 and
 thus
 the
 ethylene
 selectivity
 is
 increased
distinctly
 except
 for
 75%
 Ni–Zr–O.
 Besides,
 the
 desorption
 tem-
perature
 of
 O−has
 a
 shift
 to
 low
 temperature,
 indicating
 a
 better
migratory
 capability
 of
 the
 oxygen
 species.
 The
 increased
 mobility
of
 selective
 oxygen
 species
 O−would
 accelerate
 the
 transformation
of
 oxygen
 to
 active
 oxygen
 species
 and
 thus
 favor
 selective
 oxida-
tion.
 Over
 75%
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalyst,
 however,
 a
 low
 selectivity
 was
obtained.
 It
 might
 be
 due
 to
 the
 different
 existence
 forms
 of
 NiO.
The
 XRD
 result
 shows
 that
 very
 weak
 NiO
 peaks
 were
 observed.
Considering
 the
 NiO
 concentration
 is
 not
 low,
 we
 believe
 some
 NiO
might
 exist
 in
 the
 form
 of
 amorphous
 or
 be
 doped
 into
 the
 ZrO2
lattice,
 which
 might
 be
 the
 reason
 of
 the
 low
 ethylene
 selectivity
over
 75%
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalyst.
Moreover,
 the
 acidity
 of
 catalyst
 generally
 could
 be
 related
with
 its
 catalytic
 behavior
 for
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
For
 Ni–Zr–O
 samples,
 however,
 the
 acidity
 has
 no
 direct
 connec-
tion
 with
 catalytic
 behavior
 based
 on
 the
 NH3-TPD
 results
 (see
Supporting
 Information
 Fig.
 S1),  though
 the
 addition
 of
 Zr
 did
change
 the
 acidity
 of
 catalysts.
 Although
 the
 role
 of
 doped
 Zr,
similar
 with
 Nb,
 is
 to
 increase
 ethylene
 selectivity,
 the
 change
rule
 of
 physicochemical
 properties
 with
 dopant
 content
 was
 not
quite
 similar.
 It
 still
 needs
 to
 be
 further
 investigated
 whether
 the
relatively
 stable
 electron
 structure
 is
 related
 with
 the
 less
 increas-
ing
 amount
 in
 ethylene
 selectivity
 originated
 from
 the
 doping
 of
 Zr
than
 Nb.

 Conclusion
Uniform
 nanoparticles
 Ni–Zr–O
 catalysts
 with
 various
 Zr
 con-
tents
 were
 prepared
 by
 a
 modiﬁed
 sol–gel
 method.
 The
 strong
interaction
 between
 Ni
 and
 Zr
 was
 detected
 in
 the
 synthesized
catalyst.
 The
 dopant
 Zr
 could
 enter
 the
 NiO
 lattice
 and
 lead
 to
 an
increase
 in
 cell
 parameter.
 The
 valence
 of
 Ni
 was
 increased
 due
 to
electron
 transfer
 through
 the
 Zr–O–Ni
 bridge
 linkage.
 The
 above
two
 changes
 are
 believed
 to
 play
 important
 roles
 in
 the
 lessened
reducibility
 and
 the
 distribution
 of
 adsorbed
 oxygen
 species.
 The
active
 site
 Ni
 tends
 to
 adsorb
 O−species
 than
 nonselective
 oxy-
gen
 species
 O2−,
 which
 is
 beneﬁcial
 for
 the
 increase
 of
 ethylene
selectivity.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 ethane
 conversion
 was
 decreased
 due
to
 the
 reduced
 Ni
 concentration.
 A
 best
 yield
 to
 ethylene
 of
 40%
with
 66%
 selectivity
 could
