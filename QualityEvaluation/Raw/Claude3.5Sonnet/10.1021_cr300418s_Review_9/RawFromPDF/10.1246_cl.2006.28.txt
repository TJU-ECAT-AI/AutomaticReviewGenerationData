Modiﬁcation of alumina support with an appropriate amount
of magnesia (Mg/Al ¼ 0:1) leads to the stable activity of the
supported vanadium–antimony oxide catalyst for the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon
dioxide as oxidant. Correlation between catalytic performance
and surface acidity has been found.
Catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence
of carbon dioxide (CO2-EBDH) has recently been attempted to
explore a new technology for producing styrene selectively be-
cause it could provide us with an energy-saving and environ-
mentally friendly process to utilize CO2, a greenhouse gas, as
a mild oxidant.1–3 Several families of the catalysts, mainly based
on supported or mixed oxides of Fe, V, or Cr were found to be
active and selective in the CO2-EBDH.2–14 However, most of
the catalysts have usually shown strong deactivation for this re-
action during even a few hours on stream. As a typical example,
over Mg–Al–V mixed oxides, the initial styrene yield, 64% after
1 h on stream, decreased to 40% after 7 h.7 The similar deactiva-
tion rate was observed also for VOx/MgO catalyst.3 We have
proposed a very active and selective catalyst, V0:43Sb0:57Ox/
Al2O3 (VSb/Al), but its deactivation was also signiﬁcant mainly
owing to coke formation although the deactivation rate was less
than other reported catalysts.12,13
Since the coke precursors are easily formed through the
oligomerization of oleﬁns, facilitation of oleﬁns desorption from
a catalyst surface could minimize the carbon accumulation.
Taking into consideration a basic character of electron-rich
oleﬁns including styrene, lower surface acidity of the catalyst
appears to induce easier desorption of oleﬁns from the catalyst
surface. VOx catalysts loaded on MgAl oxide support exhibited
a decreased adsorption and rapid desorption of propylene as
compared with those on alumina.14,15 Based on these considera-
tions, an attempt has been made to stabilize the activity of VSb/
Al catalyst in the CO2-EBDH by the modiﬁcation of the alumina
support with a basic MgO component.
MgO-modiﬁed alumina (MgnAl) supports were obtained by
impregnation of an activated alumina with aqueous solutions
containing a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (MgnAl; n is
an atomic ratio of Mg/Al ¼ 0:1, 0.3, or 0.5) followed by calci-
nation at 670 C. Alumina (Al)- or MgnAl-supported vanadium–
antimony oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnation with
the solutions of NH4VO3 and SbCl3 followed by calcination at
650 C. The loading of the supported V0:43Sb0:57Ox component
(20 wt %) was the same for all samples. The catalyst supports
and supported catalysts were characterized by BET speciﬁc sur-
face area (SBET) measurements (Micrometrics model ASAP
2400), X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/MAX-3B diﬀrac-
tometer)
and
the
NH3-temperature-programmed-desorption
method (NH3-TPD) (Micrometrics, TPD/TPR 027 Option).
The catalytic tests were performed with 1 g of catalyst at
595 C under atmospheric pressure in an isothermal ﬁxed bed
ﬂow reactor of the continuous micro-activity test unit. The ethyl-
benzene feed rate was 8.2 mmol/h, molar ratio CO2/EB ¼ 5, to-
tal ﬂow rate of the gas mixture of CO2 and N2 was 45 mL/min.
The components of reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line
gas chromatograph.
VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with
respect to styrene (>95%). The VSb/Al and VSb/Mg0:1Al sam-
ple showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after
1 h on-stream. However, considering the diﬀerence in their
SBET values (87 and 67 m2/g, respectively), the VSb/Mg0:1Al
catalyst can be regarded as a little more active one due to its
higher speciﬁc yield based on the SBET value (YST/SBET),
1.1%/m2 against 0.9%/m2 for the VSb/Al. The VSb/Mg0:3Al
and VSb/Mg0:5Al catalysts displayed substantially lower sty-
rene yield (45 and 30%, respectively) due to their reduced spe-
ciﬁc surface areas (48 and 38 m2/g, respectively) but their YST/
SBET values (0.9–0.8%/m2) are very close to that for the VSb/Al
catalyst. Thus, the speciﬁc surface areas of the catalysts decrease
with an increase of MgO-content, aﬀecting only slightly their
speciﬁc activities. The activities of the supported V–Sb oxide
catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the sup-

ported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively af-
fects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox
cycle.12,13 Moreover, it is noted that the Mg-containing catalysts
studied exhibit much stable catalytic behavior compared to the
VSb/Al (Figure 1). When we checked the content of carbon
formation on each catalyst after 12 h on stream, we observed that
Mg-modiﬁed catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4–
6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %), indicating
that modiﬁcation of alumina support with magnesia leads to
the stable activity, at least partly, due to strong resistance against
carbon formation.
As illustrated in NH3-TPD proﬁles (Figure 2), the VSb/
MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid
sites compared with the un-modiﬁed VSb/Al catalyst. Thus,
the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity. Therefore,
the better stability of the MgO-containing catalysts is ascribed
to their reduced surface acidities.
According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al sup-
port and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline
MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into
spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10. However, a crystal-
line MgO is distinctively observed in the Mg0:3Al and Mg0:5Al
whose major phase is MgAl2O4. Trace of free MgO particles
is also detectable when the V–Sb oxide is loaded on these sup-
port materials. However, taking into account no detectable phase
of vanadium oxide in XRD, a catalytically active V-component
appears to be well dispersed on the support materials. It was
found that XRD peaks of VSbO4–like phases, which are well de-
tectable in the VSb/Al12,13 and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts, are very
weak in the VSb/Mg0:3Al and, moreover, they fully disappear in
the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst. This result implies the stronger inter-
action between acidic V–Sb oxide and MgnAl support materials
while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation.
The increased acid–base interaction might lead to the formation
of magnesium vanadate(s) with the lower speciﬁc surface area,
which is probably two-dimensional and un-detectable phase in
XRD. It is reasonably assumed that a decrease in an amount of
active V-species exposed at the catalyst surface diminishes the
EB-conversions compared with those over VSb/Al and VSb/
Mg0:1Al samples.
In summary, this work demonstrates that a favorable balance
between the decreased acidity of the V–Sb oxide catalyst sup-
ported on MgO-modiﬁed alumina and an amount of V–Sb oxide
species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance
in the CO2-EBDH. As a result, modiﬁcation of alumina support
with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al ¼ 0:1) leads to
the stable activity of the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst for the reaction.
