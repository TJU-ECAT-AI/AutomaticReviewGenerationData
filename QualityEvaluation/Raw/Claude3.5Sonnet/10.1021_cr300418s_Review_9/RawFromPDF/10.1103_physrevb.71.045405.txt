Following our former study of the CO/NiOs100d system [Phys. Rev. B 69, 075413 (2004)], we have
investigated the geometrical, electronic, and magnetic properties of NO adsorbed on NiO(100) to further
elucidate the role of strong electron correlations in the substrate on the chemisorption of small molecules. As
for CO/NiOs100d, density-functional theory (DFT, both in the local-density and in the generalized gradient
approximations) strongly overestimates the adsorption strength, but in contrast to CO, the strongly tilted
adsorption geometry of NO is correctly predicted even at the DFT level. If strong electronic correlation in NiO
are described by a DFT+U approach, the shift of the occupied Ni d states to higher binding energies nearly
completely suppresses donation from the occupied 5s molecular orbital to the Ni dz2 states and backdonation
from the Ni dxy,xz orbitals to the partially ﬁlled (NO) 2p* molecular orbital, the conventional bonding mecha-
nism between a p-bonded molecular dimer and a transition-metal atom. DFT+U calculations predict NO to be
almost unbound in an upright conﬁguration. In a tilted conﬁguration, a hybridization of the 2p* molecular
orbital with the Ni dz2 states, which is symmetry forbidden in the upright conﬁguration, provides an alternative
mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent adsorbate-substrate bond. The energetic, geometric, vibra-
tional, and magnetic properties of the adsorbate/substrate complex are strongly inﬂuenced by this alternative
mechanism. Altogether our results demonstrate that, as suggested by earlier studies, the on-site Coulomb
repulsion in the Ni d band plays a decisive role in the description of adsorption on transition-metal oxides and
that DFT+U provides a sound description of chemisorption on these difﬁcult systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
We have investigated the adsorption of NO on the
NiO(100) surface, complementing our former study of CO
on NiO(100) (Ref. 1—hereafter, this paper will be referred to
as I) and with the aim to further elucidate the effects of
strong electronic correlation in NiO on the chemisorption of
small molecules. The CO/NiOs100d and NO/NiOs100d sys-
tems are excellent test cases for theories of chemisorption on
strongly correlated systems because accurate information
about the geometry, adsorption energy, and spin properties is
available.2–10 Additional interest in the NO/NiOs100d ad-
sorption system comes from the fact that it involves the in-
teraction of a paramagnetic molecule with an antiferromag-
netic surface. Because of the magnetic nature of both the
adsorbate and the substrate and the difﬁculty to describe the
intrashell Coulomb repulsion in 3d transition-metal ions, this
problems represents a challenge to theory.
Near-egde x-ray adsorption ﬁne structure2 (NEXAFS) and
photoelectron diffraction (PED) experiments3–5 have demon-
strated that both CO and NO adsorb via the C and N atom,
respectively, on top of a nickel atom. In both cases the mo-
lecular axis is tilted with respect to the surface normal. The
tilting angle is rather modest for CO (12°66°), but large
s59° +31° /−17°d for NO (Ref. 3). The NiuNO bond
length is found to be 1.88 Å (Ref. 3), an NO bond-length of
1.12 Å is reported, but with a substantial uncertainty of
±0.15 Å.
Temperature
programmed
desorption
(TPD)
experiments7,8 have shown that the desorption energy is
0.57 eV/molecule, i.e., nearly twice as large as for CO
s0.3 eV/moleculed. High-resolution electron energy loss
(HREELS) experiments2,6 have demonstrated that the NuO
stretching frequency of the adsorbed molecule is redshifted
by about 80 cm−1 compared to the gas phase, whereas the
stretching mode of adsorbed CO remains nearly unchanged
compared to the free molecule. Together with the observed
difference in the desorption energy this was interpreted as
indicating the formation of a weak covalent bond between
NO and the NiO surface, whereas the interaction in the
CO/NiO system was characterized as mainly electrostatic in
nature. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies9,10 of
NO on Ni-doped MgO surfaces have shown that NO binds
much more strongly to surface Ni atoms than to Mg atoms
and have presented evidence for an unpaired electron in the
Ni d shell.
The interesting properties of molecular adsorbates on
NiO(100) have also attracted the interests of theorists. Early
cluster calculations at the Hartree-Fock (HF) and post-HF
[complete active space self-consistent ﬁeld (CASSCF)]
calculations2,11,12 indicated an underestimation of the binding
energy (CO, 0.25 eV according to Pacchioni et al.12 and
0.08 eV
according
to
Pöhlchen
and
Stämmler;11
NO,
0.17 eV according to Kuhlenbeck et al.2); the theoretical
NiuN bond-length for NO adsorption2 was 0.22 Å longer
than the experimental value. These results have inspired ex-
perimentalists to announce the “failure of current theoretical
methods” for the description of molecular bonding on oxide
surfaces.4,5 On the other hand, a spin-polarized gradient-
corrected DFT calculation for NO adsorbed on Ni-doped
MgO surfaces13 led to an adsorption geometry and energy in
reasonable agreement with experiment, dNiuN=1.85 Å and
Eads=0.74 eV. However, this paper does not mention the
bent adsorption geometry—hence the calculations probably
describe an upright NO and the calculated adsorption energy
can be considered only as a lower bound to the actual value.

A very comprehensive cluster study of the bonding of NO to
NiO(100) using HF and post-HF techniques and density-
functional theory (DFT) has been conducted by Di Valentin
et al.14 and later continued by Chiesa et al.10 Their conclu-
sions can be summarized as follows: (1) its is difﬁcult to
describe bonding by a single determinant, (2) a spin-
polarized gradient corrected DFT calculation using a hybrid
functional mixing HF and DFT exchange [the Becke-
modiﬁed Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) functional15,16] gives rea-
sonable adsorption properties at the expense of a physically
incorrect spin distribution, and (3) a key to the understanding
of the NO/NiO system is in the correct description of the
on-site Coulomb repulsion within the Ni 3d band. Di Valen-
tin et al. emphasize that of these two aspects of bonding,
on-site repulsion and conﬁguration mixing, the ﬁrst one is
probably more important.
II. METHODOLOGY
In the present paper we report on periodic DFT and post-
DFT calculations of the adsorption of NO on antiferromag-
netic NiO(100). The calculations have been performed
within the local spin density approximation (LSDA, using
the Perdew-Zunger exchange-correlation functional17,18) and
the
spin-polarized
generalized
gradient
approximation
(SGGA) according to Perdew et al.19 and using the DFT
+U method.20–22 For a discussion of these techniques, in
particular of the DFT+U, as implemented in the Vienna ab
initio simulation package VASP,23–25 we refer to I. In the
DFT+U method, the failure of the density-functional ap-
proach to describe strong electronic correlations is corrected
by adding a Hubbard-like term describing on-site Coulomb
and exchange interactions in a narrow band to the DFT
Hamiltonian. The parameter U determining the strength of
the on-site Coulomb repulsions between the Ni d electrons
was chosen according to former optimizations of the proper-
ties of bulk NiO (see I) to be 6.3 eV. The NiO(100) surface
was modeled by periodically repeated slabs, separated by
vacuum. The NO molecule and the two upmost surface lay-
ers were free to relax. For any further details we refer again
to I. Since the experimental investigations have been per-
formed at a NO coverage of Q=0.5, a cs232d supercell has
been used (see Fig. 1). The procedure to ﬁnd the optimal
adsorption geometry was the same as that for the preceding
work on the CO/NiOs100d system (see I).
III. RESULTS
Table I shows adsorption energies, tilting angles, and
bond lengths for the optimized adsorption geometries from
our calculations compared to experiment and previous theo-
retical studies. Furthermore, the magnetic moments of the
atoms formingthe NO molecule and for the Ni substrate are
listed.
In both DFT and DFT+U methods, as well as in the other
theoretical studies, tilting of NO is energetically favorable.
But whereas the tilting direction in DFT is towards the
nearest-neighbor oxygen atom (i.e., along the [011] direc-
tion), DFT+U prefers the [001] direction towards the
nearest-neighbor nickel site (see Fig. 2). For CO/NiO, a
modest tilting towards the Ni neighbor was found in any
case.
LSDA and
SGGA underestimate
the
adsorbate-
substrate sNiuNd bond length, and overestimate by far the
adsorption energy compared to experiment. In a LSDA+U
case the adsorption energy is strongly reduced to a value in
good agreement with experiment, but the NiuN distance is
improved only marginally. The situation is reversed in the
SGGA+U case, where the adsorption energy is slightly un-
derestimated while overestimating the NiuN bond length.
The NiuN bond lengths from the HFLYP, B3LYP, and
BLYP calculations agree quite well with our LSDA+U re-
sults. Due to the large measurement uncertainty in the NuO
bond length, a comparison with the calculated values is not
very enlightening, but the results from our calculations and
the former theoretical work are in reasonable agreement. The
NO bond length is only marginally increased compared to
the free NO molecule, but the increase is higher for DFT
than for DFT+U calculations. The calculated bond length for
gas-phase NO is 1.16s3d Å for LSDA and 1.16s7d Å for
SGGA. Tilting angles of the NO bond are slightly underes-
timated for DFT and slightly overestimated by the HF-based
hybrid methods compared to experiment, but the measure-
ment uncertainty is quite substantial. The shift of the Ni d
band induced by the on-site Coulomb interaction induces
only a minimal increase of the tilting angle.
The largest differences by far among between the various
theoretical approaches appear for the adsorption energy. HF-
based calculations predict the NO molecule to be unbound,
with a large endothermic adsorption energy. Hybrid function-
als work better, with the BLYP calculations overestimating
the adsorption strength, similarly to the DFT calculations.
Using the B3LYP functional, Di Valentin et al.14 performed
spin-restricted cluster calculations predicting an essentially
unbound molecule, and spin-unrestricted calculations result-
ing in a reasonable value of the adsorption energy, but unre-

alistic spin values on the Ni site. The most important effect
of the electronic correlation effects is the strong reduction of
the adsorption energy from Ead,1.3 eV (LSDA and SGGA)
to Ead,0.7 eV sLSDA+Ud and Ead,0.4 eV sSGGA+Ud,
resulting in a marked improvement of agreement with ex-
periment. It is important to emphasize that within both the
SGGA and the SGGA+U, the energy gain due to the tilting
of the molecule accounts for about three-quarters of the ad-
sorption energy (see Table I and Fig. 2).
Vibrational frequencies have been evaluated for the NO
stretch mode with SGGA and SGGA+U. The experimental
downshift of the frequencies by ,80 cm−1 from the gas
phase to adsorbed NO could be also seen for both SGGA and
SGGA+U. Since the GGA value for the free NO stretch is
1922 cm−1, the downshift is 148 cm−1 s113 cm−1d for SGGA
sSGGA+Ud.
Correlation effects also inﬂuence the magnetic properties
of the adsorbate-substrate complex. Within a plane-wave-
based code such as VASP, local magnetic moments can be
calculated only by projecting the plane-wave components of
each eigenstate on spherical waves within atomic spheres.
This necessarily leads to some uncertainty in the precise val-
ues of the moments, which must be kept in mind in the
following discussion. In particular we note that for the free
NO molecule, the magnetic moments calculated for the N
and O atoms add up to a moment of 0.7mB. Larger atomic
radii would bring the molecular moment into closer agree-
ment with the correct value of 1mB, but at the expense of a
double counting in the region where the atomic spheres over-
lap. In the present context, only the adsorption-induced
changes in the moments are relevant. Within the SGGA
(which underestimates the antiferromagnetic moment of Ni
in bulk NiO; cf. I), the magnetic moment of a Ni atom to
which an NO molecule is attached is reduced by nearly 40%
in an upright conﬁguration and by about 60% if the energeti-
cally favorable tilting is admitted. The adsorbate-induced lo-
cal demagnetization of the substrate is accompanied by an
even stronger demagnetization of the paramagnetic NO mol-
ecule: in the upright conﬁguration the magnetic moments
located on both the N and O atoms are reduced to about
50%, in the tilted conﬁguration the molecule is practically
completely demagnetized. Within the SGGA+U (which pro-
duces an antiferromagnetic moment in good agreement with
experiment), the magnetic moments of both adsorbate and
substrate are essentially unchanged as long as the upright
geometry is assumed. In the tilted conﬁguration, the absolute
value of the magnetic moment of the Ni atom is reduced by
,0.2mB, and the moment of the N atom by about ,0.15mB,
while the moment on the O atom is essentially unchanged.
We shall return below to a more detailed analysis of the
adsorption-induced changes of the magnetization densities.

solid surface is analyzed in terms of electron donation from
the occupied 5s molecular orbital to the Ni dz2 states and
back donation from the Ni dxy,xz orbitals to the empty (CO)
or partially ﬁlled (NO) 2p* molecular orbital. Strong elec-
tronic correlation effects shift the occupied Ni d bands to
higher binding and increases the exchange splitting and the
energy gap. Within DFT, the top of the valence band has Ni
eg character for the majority spins and Ni t2g character for the
minority spins, with the lowest empty states at the other side
of the small Mott-Hubbard gap. Within DFT+U, all occu-
pied Ni d states are shifted to higher binding energies. The
top of the valence band is now predominantly of O p char-
acter with only a small admixture of Ni t2g states and the
much wider gap is of a mixed charge-transfer and Mott-
Hubbard d-d type. The changes in the electronicstructure of
the substrate reduce both donation and backdonation and
therefore lead to a substantial reduction of the adsorption
energy, a detailed analysis in terms of the local partial den-
sities of states has been given in I, Figs. 9 and 10. NO differs
from CO by an extra electron in the 2p* state at the Fermi
level, and the occupied 5s and 1p states are shifted to higher
binding energies. As a consequence, both hybridization
mechanisms are less favorable, and in an upright conﬁgura-
tion we ﬁnd NO to be weakly bound within the SGGA
sEads,0.25 eVd and essentially unbound within the SGGA
+U sEads,0.08 eVd.
In the tilted conﬁguration, one expects in addition a hy-
bridization of the 2p* and 1p orbitals with the Ni dz2 states,
which are symmetry forbidden in the upright conﬁguration.
The most direct illustration of the mechanism leading to a
tilted adsorption geometry is provided by a charge ﬂow
analysis. Figure 3 shows the difference electron densities
(i.e., the self-consistent charge density of the adsorbate-
substrate system minus the charge densities of the separated
molecule and substrate, as calculated for their slightly dis-
torted geometries adopted in the adsorption conﬁguration)
for the upright and the tilted geometries.
For the upright case the SGGA+U calculations ﬁnd a
modest depletion of the 5s orbital and of the dxz,xy states, and
a modest ﬂow of electrons into the 2p* orbital and into the
bounding region between the adsorbate and substrate [see
Fig. 3(a)]—one has to remember that in the SGGA+U
method the molecule is nearly unbound in an upright con-
ﬁguration
(cf.
Table
I
and
Fig.
2).
In
contrast
to
CO/NiOs100d, where the charge donated to the 2p* state is
distributed evenly over 2py
* and 2pz
* (see Fig. 11 in I), for
NO/NiOs100d the degeneracy of the 2p* state is broken as a
consequence of the local symmetry breaking caused by anti-
ferromagnetic ordering (see Fig. 1). In the antiferromagnetic
structure of NaCl-type NiO, nearest-neighbor Ni atoms in a
(100) surface couple ferromagnetically along the [011] and
antiferromagnetically along the [001] direction. The elec-
trons donated to the antibonding molecular p orbital prefer-
entially occupy the 2py
* orbital extending along the “ferro-
magnetic” direction, whereas the 2pz
* orbital is even slightly
depleted. The spin-speciﬁc charge redistribution also inﬂu-
ences the magnetization density, as shown in Fig. 4a: The
increased ﬁlling of the 2py
* orbital reduces its contribution to
the magnetization density, while the depletion of the 2pz
*
leads to an increased magnetization. Integrated over atomic
spheres, both effects balance, and the magnetic moments of
both adsorbate and substrate remain unchanged upon adsorp-
tion (see Table I).
A much more pronounced charge and spin redistribution
is found for a tilted adsorption geometry [see parts (b) of
Figs. 3 and 4], but the main effect (which is much more
pronounced than the weak donation from the dxy,xz states) is
again an intramolecular electron redistribution. A strong dz2
-2p* hybridization requires the 2pz
* perpendicular to the
plane of the tilt and to the dz2 orbital to be depleted, the
electrons being transferred to the 2py
* orbital overlapping
with the Ni d states. The charge ﬂow also leads to the for-
mation of a substantial bond charge between the tilted adsor-
bate and the Ni atom. This result conﬁrms the formation of a
weak covalent bond in the NO/NiO system. Again the elec-
tron redistribution is reﬂected in the magnetization densities
[see Fig. 4b]. Since for the 2py
* orbital both spin-up and
spin-down states are occupied, the magnetization density is
reduced. This reduction is more pronounced on the N than on
the O atom. For the 2pz
* orbital, on the other hand, the mag-
netization density is enhanced, so that the net change in the
magnetization of the adsorbate remains modest. The diagram
also reﬂects the local reduction of the moment on the Ni
sites.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have presented a detailed investigation of
the adsorption of NO on NiO(100), using both density-
functional theory and the DFT+U approach, in which a Hub-
bard term describing the strong on-site Coulomb interactions
is added to the DFT Hamiltonian, and using both local
(LSDA)
and
gradient-corrected
(SGGA)
spin-polarized
exchange-correlation functionals. As in our previous study
on CO/NiOs100d we ﬁnd that the best description of this
difﬁcult adsorption system is achieved at the SGGA+U

level: The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative
change in the adsorption behavior of NO, but at the LSDA
+U level, the molecule is still slightly overbound. In contrast
to CO/NiO were the molecule is adsorbed in a nearly up-
right geometry, a vertically adsorbed NO molecule is nearly
unbound on NiO and the higher adsorption energy for NO
than for CO is entirely a consequence of the strong
dz2-2p* hybridization enabled by the tilted geometry. The
magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic sub-
strate and the paramagnetic molecule lead to a lifting of the
degeneracy of the 2p* molecular orbital and a strong in-
tramolecular ﬂow of electrons from 2py
* to 2pz
* states, en-
hancing the hybridization with the Ni dz2 states. The magne-
tization of the substrate atom bonding to the adsorbate is

slightly reduced by 0.2mB upon adsorption, the magnetiza-
tion on the bonding N atom by 0.13mB, while the moment in
the O atom not in direct contact with the surface remains
unchanged. This is in general agreement with EPR studies.
Altogether, the SGGA+U approach leads to a better descrip-
tion of the surface physics and chemistry of this strongly
correlated system than density-functional theory alone (using
local, semilocal, or hybrid functionals) or HF-based ap-
proaches. However, the overestimation of the NiuN dis-
tance suggests that there may be room for further improve-
ment.
