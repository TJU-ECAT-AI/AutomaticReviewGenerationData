Ni–Nb–O catalysts with various Nb contents (0–19%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane. An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene
was obtained for a Ni–Nb–O catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 ◦C with a weight to ﬂow W/F ratio
of 0.54 g s mL−1. The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that
the efﬁciency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an
amorphous Nb2O5 phase. Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate
ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these
oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also inﬂuences the catalytic
properties. It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and
the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the
decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents
the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors.
It was also shown that the thermal decomposition of oxalates limits NiO crystal growth. Above 15% of
Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel
oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the
Ni–Nb–O catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed
both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and
to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature.
Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed.

1. Introduction
The demand of ethylene and propylene as starting materials for
the production of chemicals has never been so high and there is
a need to develop alternative routes to produce them. Catalytic
oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes would be one of the
most promising routes if catalysts efﬁcient enough to make the
process commercially attractive were found.
The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far
beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO
oxide [1–8], or mixed molybdates [9–13]. Other catalysts such as
Li–Dy–Mg–O and La–Sr–Cu–Cl–O [14,15] also led to high yields but
contrarily to the two former systems which have optimum prop-
erties around 400 ◦C, these catalysts are efﬁcient above 630 ◦C. At
these temperatures, dehydrogenation occurs partially in the gas
phase and is likely not oxidative.
Compared to mixed molybdates whose composition and syn-
thesis pathways are quite complex, NiO based catalysts appeared

simpler and equally efﬁcient as previously demonstrated by Maz-
zochia and coworkers who greatly contributed to the development
of Ni-based catalysts for light alkanes oxidative hydrogenation [16].
They correspond to bulk Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides with an optimal
Nb/Ni ratio around 0.18 resulting in an overall ethylene yield of
46% at 400 ◦C [2]. The materials have been characterized and it has
been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1−xNbxO
solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni
cations and/or ﬁlling the cationic vacancies in the defective non-
stoichiometric structure [2,3].
First C–H bond breaking in light alkanes is a difﬁcult reaction
that cannot be performed by nucleophilic oxygen species. Oxidative
species like O−are needed. The involvement for light alkanes acti-
vation of O−species at the surface of p-type semi-conductors has
already been suggested from thermodynamic considerations and
discussed in various case examples [17–19]. NiO alike some light
alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with
positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated
to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:
Ni3+ ⇄Ni2+ + p+

These holes correspond to electron vacancies in the valence band
of O2−and may be represented in terms of chemical sites by O−
according to the reaction:
O2−+ p+ ⇄O−
(2)
Such electrophilic species have been shown to be able to cleave the
ﬁrst C–H bond of a light alkane molecule leading to a radical from
whom a second hydrogen can rapidly be abstracted [18,19]:
C2H6 + O−⇄C2H5• + O2−+ H+
(3)
C2H5• + O−⇄C2H4 + O2−+ H+
(4)
NiO presents a high surface content of O−that makes it a very active
but unselective catalyst to oxidize ethane. It is thus important to
reduce their concentration at the surface of the active phase in order
to limit this total oxidation. Lemonidou and coworker have pro-
posed that the substitution of Ni by Nb cations in Ni–Nb–O catalysts
reduced the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the
electrophilic O−species concentration [2]. The catalytic efﬁciency
of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the
presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed O−species in amount
high enough to convert sufﬁciently ethane but low enough to
avoid total oxidation. Other recent studies in the literature seem to
show that substitution with other cations such as Ti could similarly
induce enhancement of catalytic activity in light alkane oxidative
dehydrogenation over NiO based oxides [20].
The present study has been undertaken to explore the potential
of these catalysts and to better understand the role of structural
features of these new Ni–Nb–O catalysts. Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides
with various Nb/NiO ratios have been prepared, tested and charac-
terized by different methods including X-ray diffraction, electron
microscopy, Raman and XPS spectroscopy. To understand the effect
of oxalates, pure NiO prepared with various amounts of oxalic acid
were studied. The role of niobium was investigated comparing pure
NiO to niobium oxide supported on NiO. Finally the stability with
time on stream of all these catalysts, which had not yet been exten-
sively studied, has speciﬁcally been addressed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Ni–Nb–O
catalysts
have
been
prepared
using
a
method
described in the literature [4]. Nickel nitrate hexa-hydrated and
ammonium niobium oxalate were dissolved in hot water. The solu-
tion was maintained for 1 h at 70 ◦C under stirring and reﬂux before
being evaporated under reduced pressure at the same tempera-
ture. The solid obtained were dried at 120 ◦C and calcined under air
ﬂow at 450 ◦C for 5 h. Catalysts with different atomic compositions
Ni1−xNbxO with x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.13, 0.15, 0.19,
have been synthesized and will be referred to as these compositions
(Ni0.85Nb0.15).
In parallel pure NiO and NbOx supported on NiO catalysts have
been synthesized. Pure NiO catalysts have been prepared using two
methods. The ﬁrst one corresponded to the thermal decomposition
of nickel nitrate at 450 ◦C in air for 5 h. The second one corresponded
to the method described for the synthesis of Ni–Nb–O catalysts
but substituting the niobium precursor by oxalic acid. Different
amount of oxalic acid corresponding to Ni/H2C2O4 ratios of 1, 2
and 3, have been added in order to study the speciﬁc inﬂuence
of oxalic acid. It is important to recall that niobium is added in
the Ni–Nb–O catalyst preparation as a mixed ammonium niobium
oxalate (NH4)NbO(C2O4)2.H2O and that oxalate anions are thus
present in the reaction medium. The NiO catalysts will be referred
to as NiO, NiO-OA-1/1, NiO-OA-2/1 and NiO-OA-3/1.
A catalyst corresponding to niobium oxide supported on NiO
(Nb/NiO) has been prepared by impregnation of the NiO-OA-2/1
catalyst with a solution of mixed ammonium niobium oxalate. The
amount of niobium supported was of 0.7 weight %, which corre-
sponded approximately to one tenth of theoretical monolayer. The
suspension was maintained 1 h under stirring at room temperature
and the water was then evaporated at 70 ◦C. The solid obtained was
dried and calcined under air at 450 ◦C for 5 h.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Metal contents of the solids were determined by atomic absorp-
tion (ICP) and their speciﬁc surface areas determined using the
BET method with nitrogen adsorption. Theoretical speciﬁc surface
area of the NiO phase has been calculated from the particle sizes
estimated from XRD data using the Scherrer formula:
D ≈
0.9
(2)FWHM cos 
(5)
where D is the domain size, and  is the angle of the Bragg peak
(FWHM: full width at half max). The formula was applied to peaks
of (1,0,1), (0,1,2), (1,1,3) and (0,2,4) crystal planes. Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a BRUKER D5005
diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( = 1.54184 ˚
A) with 0.02◦(2)
steps over 10–80◦angular range and 1 s counting time per step. The
unit cell of the phases was reﬁned using BRUKER TOPAS P program.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
was done using a JEOL 2010 equipment operating at 200 kV with
a high resolution pole piece and an energy-dispersive X-ray spec-
trometer (EDX; Link Isis, Oxford Instruments). The samples were
dispersed in ethanol using a sonicator. A drop of the suspension was
dripped onto a carbon ﬁlm supported on a copper grid; EDX studies
were carried out using a 15 nm probe to analyze the particles.
Raman spectra were recorded before and after catalytic testing
using a LabRam HR spectrometer (Jobin Yvon-Horiba). The exciting
line at 514.53 nm of an Ar-Kr 2018 RM laser (Spectra Physics) was
focused on several points of the samples with a long working X50
objective. The laser power on samples was limited to ca 100 W.
Raman mappings were recorded using a motorized stage to analyze
the samples homogeneity at the micron scale.
Surface analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
were performed in a KRATOS Axis Ultra DLD equipped with a mag-
netic immersion lens, a hemispherical analyzer and a delay line
detector. Experiments were performed using a monochromated
Al K X-ray source with a pressure in the analysis chamber below
5 × 10−8 Pa. XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Nb 3d, O1s and C1s levels were
measured at 90◦(normal angle with respect to the plane of the sur-
face). A charge neutralizer was used to control charges effects on
samples.
Oxygen thermo-desorption (O2-TPD-MS) experiments were
carried out at atmospheric pressure in the testing apparatus.
0.5 g of sample was used and pretreated under O2 atmosphere
(30 mL/min) at 450 ◦C for 30 min and cooled down to ambient
temperature, then heated under N2 (rate 15 ◦C min−1) to 800 ◦C.
Oxygen desorption was recorded on-line using a VG PROLAB mass
spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corporation). Temperature reduc-
tion experiments (TPR) have been conducted in the same way as
the O2-TPD-MS ones. The samples were reduced using a ﬂow of 5%
of H2 in N2 (30 mL min−1, 10 ◦C min−1) up to 550 ◦C.
2.3. Catalysts testing
The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was per-
formed in a ﬁxed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure.
The experiments were conducted between 300 and 400 ◦C with
a catalyst amount varying from 0.1 to 1 g. The feedstock com-

O2:C2H6:N2 = 9:9:82 [1]. The weight to ﬂow ratio (W/F) used was
equal to 0.54 g s mL−1. Ethane and the reaction products were ana-
lyzed on-line by gas chromatography with a TCD detector. Ethane,
ethylene and CO2 were separated on a Hayesep T column and O2,
N2, and CO, on a molecular sieve column. The calculated carbon
balances were always very close to 100%. To check for the absence
of formation of oxygenates, the reaction products were condensed
in an ice-cooled trap and analyzed off-line using a chromatograph
equipped with a FID detector and a Nukol column.
3. Results
3.1. Study of Ni–Nb–O catalysts
The results of the chemical analyses and of the speciﬁc surface
area measurements are presented in Table 1. They showed that
compounds with the desired stoichiometry have been obtained
and that the speciﬁc surface area increased with the Nb content up
to 15% and then decreased. XRD patterns of mixed oxides showed
only one phase corresponding to NiO (Fig. 1). It was not possible to
attribute the patterns to Fm3m cubic (ICDD File: 004-083) or R3c
rhombohedric (ICDD 044-1159) structure because of bands widths.
As substitution increased a broad background showing the pres-
ence of an amorphous phase was detected. At Nb content higher
than 15% a mixed oxide NiNb2O6 was identiﬁed. The pseudo cubic
cell parameters of the NiO phase are gathered in Table 1 with the
particle sizes calculated from XRD data. No signiﬁcant change in

cell parameters was detected, but a decrease in particle size was
clearly evidenced increasing Nb content. Fig. 2 shows that at low
and high Nb contents the NiO theoretical speciﬁc surface area cal-
culated from the particle size was higher than the measured one.
This result was explained by a strong agglomeration of the parti-
cles at low Nb content and by the formation of the mixed oxide
NiNb2O6 at high Nb content. The presence of the amorphous phase
was conﬁrmed by transmission electron microscopy and EDX anal-
yses allowed to attribute this phase to amorphous Nb2O5. The EDX
analyses performed on more than 30 NiO particles of the 15% sam-
ple did not conﬁrm the formation of a solid solution of Nb in NiO.
Two types of particles were evidenced: relatively large ones (up
to 20 nm), which were more or less agglomerated and small ones
(2–3 nm), which appeared as embedded into the amorphous Nb2O5
phase (Fig. 3a). Because of that, it was impossible to have EDX
analyses speciﬁc to the smallest particles. However the analyses
of the larger ones consistently showed Nb content close to only
1% (Nb/(Ni + Nb) = 0.01 ± 0.003). The latter particles appeared well
crystallized and without any surface amorphization (Fig. 3b).
The samples have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy
(Fig. 4). The spectra showed main bands at 462 and 505 cm−1
and second order broad bands at 710, 930 and 1090 cm−1. The
ﬁrst two bands have been respectively attributed to transverse
and longitudinal optic vibration modes related to a rhombohedric
deformation of the structure or to non-stoichiometric Ni–O
stretching vibrations and the others to overtones of the ﬁrst ones
or their combinations [21,22].
Small bands at 1480 and 1060 cm−1 have also been observed;
they were respectively attributed to the combination of two
magnons (2 M mode) [22] and to 1 vibration mode of carbonate
groups, whose presence at the surface of the catalysts has been
conﬁrmed by infra-red and XPS spectroscopy. For compounds with
substitution higher than 7%, an additional band at 840 cm−1 was
observed and attributed to stretching vibrations of slightly dis-
torted NbO6 octahedra in amorphous Nb2O5 (Fig. 4). Raman images
plotting the spatial distribution of the relative intensity of this band
evidenced a high homogeneity at the micron scale up to 3% of Nb

but not above. These results conﬁrmed well those obtained by XRD
and TEM on the biphasic nature of the samples.
The quantitative results of the XPS analyses are summarized in
Table 2. They showed that the surface Nb/(Ni + Nb) atomic ratios
of the catalysts were close to those of the bulk ones and no
changes were observed after the catalytic treatment. The O1s sig-
nals were complex with several peaks between 529 and 533 eV
(Fig. 5). They have been ﬁtted with 4 bands. The two main bands at
529.3–529.8 eV and 530.0 eV have been respectively attributed to

to Nb5+. The binding energy in the latter case correspond exactly to

by the observation of a C1s band at 288.2 eV) and the fourth one
at 531.9–532.2 eV ascribed to O−species [23–25]. The two lat-
ter bands, which are present in the spectrum of pure NiO, have
a low intensity and the spectral resolution obtained did not allow
ascertaining any relative intensity for these bands and to further
interpret the XPS data. It is specially the case for the Ni0.85Nb0.15
sample after deactivation which spectrum showed only small dis-
placements in binding energies due to charging effects and small
change in relative intensity compared to before.
The Ni 2p signal showed one large peak around 856.0 eV with
a shoulder at 1.5 eV higher energy, that have respectively been
ascribed to Ni+2 and Ni+3 species [23,24,26]. It should be mentioned
that controversies remain about the attribution of the shoulder.
Sawatzky and coworker [27] suggested that this second peak is the
result of a screening process by an electron that does not come
from the oxygen atoms directly around the ionized Ni atom, but
from neighboring NiO6 units. Since the attribution of the second
peak is uncertain, the results have not been taken into account in
the conclusions drawn on the evolution of the Ni3+ content of the
catalysts. Furthermore the evolutions observed are very weak and
may be considered as insigniﬁcant.
The thermo-desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD-MS) has been used
to characterize the surface of several catalysts. Four adsorbed
oxygen species on transition metal oxide like NiO have been
described in the literature [28]. These species, which desorbed at
increasing temperature, correspond to O2 ( around 30 ◦C), O2−(
320–360 ◦C) and O−( 420–450 ◦C and  above 520 ◦C).  and 
species have been assigned to O−adsorbed on different sites [28].
The desorption curves obtained are presented in Fig. 6a and the
volume of O2 desorbed expressed per surface square meters of cat-
alysts as a function of Nb/(Nb + Ni) ratio in Fig. 6b. On the pure NiO
and lower Nb content catalysts, the three species ,  and  were
observed whereas only the  and  species were detected on the
compounds richer in Nb. Both desorption temperatures and quanti-
ties of desorbed oxygen varied with the Nb content. The desorption
temperature for the  species increased whereas the temperature
for the  ones decreased. In parallel the volume of adsorbed oxygen
strongly decreased with increasing Nb content. The results show
that the presence of niobium had more impact on the  species
since the relative ratio between  and  species strongly decreased.
It should be recalled that a decrease in particles size was also taking
place that may have an effect on the adsorption properties of the
solids.
TPR proﬁles of Ni0.93Nb0.07 and Ni0.985Nb0.015 samples are
shown in Fig. 7a and compared to that of a pure NiO phase prepared
the same way. The reduction of the catalysts containing niobium
started at approximately the same temperature (320 ◦C). All the
reduction processes proceeded with almost the same rate up to
550 ◦C. These results were in good agreement with those previously
published on similar catalysts [2].
The catalytic properties of the Ni–Nb–O catalysts are presented
in Table 3. In all cases, oxygen conversion did not exceed 85%. The
results obtained conﬁrmed those published in the literature [2]. The
presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase
in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. Increasing the Nb
content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion,
which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then
decreased similarly to what was previously observed[2]. The intrin-
sic rate and the apparent activation energy of ethane conversion
decreased continuously when the Nb content increased up to a Nb
content between 3 and 7% and then remained almost constant. In
the same time the selectivity to ethylene increased to also reach
a plateau for the same Nb content. The stability of the selectivity
to ethylene when the conversion was varied between 6 and 25%
has been studied on the Ni0.93Nb0.07 and Ni0.97Nb0.03 catalysts at
350 ◦C. The conversion was changed varying the ﬂow rate from 30

appeared very stable as previously reported [2].

ing to niobium oxide supported on NiO always showed a single
phase corresponding to NiO except the NiO-OA-1/1, which showed
peaks of Ni0 and was not further investigated. The pseudo-cubic
cell parameters of the pure NiO phase are gathered in Table 4 with
the calculated particle sizes and the speciﬁc surface area measure-
ments. The results showed that the addition of oxalic acid had a
strong effect on the NiO particle sizes, which decreased and that
such effect was obtained with only a limited amount of oxalic acid
since the NiO-OA-2/1 and −3/1 samples have comparable proper-
ties. The deposition of niobium oxide did not modify the structure
and texture of the supporting NiO oxide.
The catalytic properties of the compounds are compared at
330 ◦C in Table 5. We observed a large increase in conversion with
the addition of oxalic acid during the solid preparation and in paral-
lel the selectivity to ethylene increased. When comparing NiO and
NiO-OA-3/1, the increase in conversion observed can be related to
the increase in speciﬁc surface area since the intrinsic rate of ethane
conversion remained almost constant. NiO-OA-3/1 was slightly less
active than NiO-OA-2/1 and upon addition of niobium the con-
version and the rate strongly decreased but the selectivity further
increased to reach 78%. Similarly to Ni–Nb–O catalysts, the selectiv-
ity to ethylene appeared stable when the conversion was increased
up to 33% at 350 ◦C.
The samples have been characterized by O2-TPD-MS and again
the three ,  and  species can be observed although the two latter
appeared as the major ones (Fig. 8). The NiO-OA-2/1 O2-TPD-MS
proﬁle was similar to that of Ni0.85Nb0.15O. The further addition of
Nb had several effects; the  species were not observed and the
temperature of desorption of the  and  species increased and
decreased respectively. In the same time, the amount of adsorbed
O2 on the two species strongly decreased from 7 to 4.10−2 mL g−1.
TPR analyses conducted on the NiO-OA-2/1 and Nb/NiO samples
showed that the addition of Nb oxide at the surface of NiO increased
the reduction temperature of almost 50 ◦C (Fig. 7b).
3.3. Study of catalysts deactivation
The stability of the catalytic properties as a function of time has
been studied in one hand on the Ni0.93Nb0.07O and Ni0.85Nb0.15O
catalysts and in the other one, on the NiO-OA-3/1 and Nb/NiO com-
pounds. The variations of the conversion, selectivity to ethylene
and yield in ethylene over time at 380 ◦C are presented for each
catalyst type in Fig. 9. With time on stream, a continuous deactiva-
tion of the Ni–Nb–O catalyst was observed except for Ni0.85Nb0.15O,
which underwent a more rapid deactivation during the ﬁrst 20 h

on stream. In the same time the selectivity slightly decreased
for pure NiO and Ni0.93Nb0.07O and remained almost constant for
Ni0.85Nb0.15O. For the Nb/NiO compound a rapid deactivation was
observed after only 100 h of testing with an increase in selectivity.
After more than 290 h the catalysts have been submitted in the cat-
alytic reactor to a heat treatment at 450 ◦C under O2 for 30 min and
brought back in the reaction conditions. No change in the catalytic
properties was observed and the catalysts continued to deactivate.
In the case of the pure NiO phase it seemed that the deactivation
was even accelerated.
In order to understand the origin of the deactivation, the
solids have been characterized using various techniques. The X-
ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts remained unchanged after
deactivation except for Ni0.93Nb0.07O for which small peaks corre-
sponding to NiNb2O6 were observed (Fig. 10). The speciﬁc surface
areas of the catalysts decreased after deactivation. However the
decreases were rather limited and could not explain the deac-
tivation process. For example, the speciﬁc surface area of the
Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalyst went from 81 m2 g−1 before deactivation to
74 m2 g−1 after.
The Raman spectra of the solids after deactivation testing are
gathered in Fig. 11. In the spectra of the NiO-OA-3/1 and Nb/NiO cat-
alysts a signiﬁcant decrease in the relative intensity of the ﬁrst order
bands at 462 and 505 cm−1 compared to the second order band at
1090 cm−1 was observed. It has been previously shown that the
relative intensity of these bands that is not null for stoichiometric

NiO increases with the non-stoichiometry value of NiO(1+x) [29,30].
Therefore, the damping phenomenon observed after deactivation
can be related to strong decrease in the Ni3+ content of the solids
and thus to strong reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry
in agreement with the green color of the two samples after reac-
tion. A similar decrease in relative intensity has been observed for
the bands in the spectra of Ni0.85Nb0.15O after deactivation but was
much less marked.
XPS analyses of several catalysts have been made after deactiva-
tion and compared to those obtained before. No signiﬁcant change
in Nb/(Ni + Nb) was observed (Table 5). O2-TPD-MS experiments
performed on the Nb/NiO catalyst before and after deactivation
showed that the  and  species observed before testing between
500 and 650 ◦C have disappeared after deactivation and only
new oxygen species were observed with desorption temperature
around 700 ◦C (Fig. 8). No assignment has presently been proposed
for these species. The TPR experiments conducted on the same
solids showed that the reduction of the compound was delayed
on the deactivated sample (Fig. 7c).
4. Discussion
The results of the catalytic testing of the Ni–Nb–O catalysts are in
good agreement with those published in the literature and similar
ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the
catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions
[2–4]. The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at
low and high content.
At low Nb content, up to 3–7%, the apparent activation energy
and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,
which is in agreement with a modiﬁcation of the active sites both in
nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less
numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In par-
allel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. No indication of
formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained
from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be
completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly
lower than 1% of Nb. We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the
surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible
O−species. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which
are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate
C–H bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selec-
tivity to ethylene. Such hypothesis formulated by Lemonidou and
coworker ﬁts well with the results obtained [2].
At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectiv-
ity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained
almost constant. The active sites are not modiﬁed anymore and
since the speciﬁc surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,
the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently
observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the
phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in
active phase starts to decrease. Although it has not been detected
in the fresh catalysts, the NiNb2O6 phase may start to be formed at
lower Nb content but leads to a limited effect up to 19%.
The increase in the speciﬁc surface area that leads to the optimal
ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained
by an effect already reported in the literature and called “mutual
protective effect” [31]. It is known that in a biphasic oxide phase
mixture the presence of an oxide may prevent the crystallization
or/and growth of particles of the other and that such effect may be
operative as soon as 5% of one phase is added to the other. The amor-
phous Nb2O5 phase plays that role for the active NiO phase. Similar
effect have been reported earlier for other binary oxide systems
and used to explain catalytic performances enhancements [32,33].
Although this effect is not fully understood, it has been proposed
156
B. Savova et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 390 (2010) 148–157
that it could take place already upon co-precipitation when mixed
oxalates were formed. The catalytic data clearly showed that this
effect will promote the conversion since the speciﬁc surface area
of the active phase will be larger but does not affect the nature
of the catalytic sites neither their concentration, both the apparent
activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remaining
constant.
The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid
introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the tex-
ture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an
increase in the speciﬁc surface area of the solids. In the same time,
the decomposition of oxalic acid reduced the nickel oxide. When a
molecule of oxalic acid is decomposed 2e−are liberated that may
reduce nickel, Ni3+ cations ﬁrst and then Ni2+:
H2C2O4 →2CO2 + 2H+ + 2e−
(6)
The oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO is thus decreased in NiO-
OA-3/1 and NiO-OA-2/1 and when the amount of oxalic acid is high
(NiO-OA-1/1) a reduction of the Ni2+ cations to Ni0 is observed.
Table 5 shows that the presence of oxalic acid increases the selec-
tivity to ethylene. The conversion ﬁrst increased for NiO-OA-3/1
and then slightly decreased for NiO-OA-2/1. The ﬁrst effect can be
mainly ascribed to the increase in speciﬁc surface area as shown
by the rather close intrinsic rates of conversion calculated but not
the second since the difference in speciﬁc surface area between
NiO-OA-3/1 and NiO-OA-2/1 is small. Furthermore the decrease
in rate of ethane conversion is high. This decrease can only be
explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxy-
gen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and
consequently of the amount of O−. The decrease in the number of
the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene.
When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the
texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane
conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene
strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained
on Ni–Nb–O catalysts. This clearly showed that Nb has an effect on
the surface of NiO where it decreases the number of active sites
by covering them. Upon reduction by the oxalic acid added during
the synthesis of NiO-OA-2/1 and further addition of Nb, the appar-
ent activation energy decreases while the intrinsic rate of ethane
conversion decreases. This can be explained by a decrease in the
number of active sites at the surface of the NiO phase that becomes
in the same time more active. The same trend was observed on
the Ni–Nb–O catalysts. It is however not possible to ascertain if Nb
could have a speciﬁc catalytic role by itself besides contributing to
the reduction of the number of active sites and their site isolation
[34].
The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand
the nature of the active surface species. At the catalytic reaction
temperature and higher three main adsorbed species have been
identiﬁed, ,  and  species and assigned to O2−for the ﬁrst one
and O−adsorbed on different surface sites for the two latter. As the
strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption
temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen. Both
upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were
the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species
strongly decreased.  species are known to be active for total oxida-
tion and their disappearing is positive for the selectivity although
certainly not determinant. In the same time, the temperature of
desorption of  species, increases and that of  decreases. It may
be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since
contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when
less numerous. This could also explain the decrease in apparent
activation energy observed. Interestingly almost only these species
are observed on the Nb/NiO, which is the most selective catalyst.
After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the
Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be
involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species
strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor-
ners) which number may increase after surface transformations
related to the deactivation.
TPR data are more complex to analyze. In the Ni–Nb–O cata-
lysts the slight spreading of Nb at the surface of NiO phase, which
was the same for all the catalysts and appends as soon as Nb was
added, simply lowered the number of O−species rendering them
more reactive as shown from the catalytic data. This isolation of
O−was the same for all the Ni–Nb–O catalysts and would simi-
larly be obtained with pure NiO prepared with large amount oxalic
acid (NiO-OA-2/1). This explained why the reduction temperatures
were the same for all the catalysts (Fig. 7a). However, when large
amount of niobium was deposited at the surface of NiO (Nb/NiO
sample), niobium oxide was covering the surface preventing NiO
from reduction and thus increasing the reduction temperature of
the solid (Fig. 7b).
The stability of the Ni–Nb–O catalysts had been studied by
Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 ◦C [2]. Because
it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial develop-
ment of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the
catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature
where the catalysts may present conversions with potential inter-
est namely 380 ◦C. First it has been observed that all the catalysts
studied were undergoing a deactivation after more or less time.
To begin with, Ni–Nb–O catalysts will be considered. The deacti-
vation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled
with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small
extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in
conversion. This deactivation is not related to a decrease in speciﬁc
surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface. It may
be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be
evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac-
tion. Furthermore TPR experiments performed on the Ni0.93Nb0.07
after deactivation showed an increase of about 50 ◦C of the reduc-
tion temperature that can be explained by the formation of this
phase at the surface of NiO by reaction between Nb2O5 and NiO.
The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen
over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase. We have seen that the
addition of niobium or oxalic acid allowed to decrease the surface
O−content and to isolate O−that become active and selective sites
for ODH of ethane. When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of
NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface O−species are
isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites
but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity
without change in selectivity. This is what is observed over time on
stream.
The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman
spectroscopy, was difﬁcult to observe on the Ni–Nb–O catalysts
since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change
in the spectra are within the experimental precision. However the
decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced
by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds
that suffered from stronger deactivation. The deactivation process
may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected
from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface
with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O−, is favored because the extrac-
tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]. Inversely when the
surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption
is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation
process is auto-catalyzed. Contrary to Ni–Nb–O catalysts, the for-
mation of the NiNb2O6 phase was not observed on the Nb/NiO
catalyst deactivated. However niobium was highly dispersed on
the surface of Nb/NiO and the phase could either not be formed
or not be detected with the characterization techniques used. It is
B. Savova et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 390 (2010) 148–157
157
thus not obvious to determine the relative part taken by the two
processes i.e. the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 and the decrease
in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase, in the
catalysts deactivation. It is furthermore probable that the two pro-
cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface
species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should
depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry.
What is important to note is that it appears difﬁcult to avoid the
formation of NiNb2O6 since it is the thermodynamic stable phase at
380 ◦C and that a treatment under oxygen at 450 ◦C do not allow to
re-establish the oxygen over-stoichiometry. A treatment at higher
temperature may be envisaged but the solid will certainly lose its
high speciﬁc surface area, which would be detrimental to ethane
conversion over the solid. Running the catalytic reaction at lower
temperature could also delay the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase,
but this would also be detrimental to the catalytic efﬁciency. Finally,
a signiﬁcant increase in the O2/C2H4 ratio of the gas feed to avoid
the decrease in the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry is not possible
since the domain of inﬂammability would be reached.
5. Conclusions
The most important conclusions are the following:
(1) The catalytic results obtained by Lemonidou et al. have been
conﬁrmed. Ni–Nb–O catalysts are efﬁcient catalyst for ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation. Upon addition of niobium oxide,
the NiO oxide phase, which is active for ethane oxidation but
mainly selective to CO2, loses partially its activity but gains a
high selectivity to ethylene.
(2) The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are
predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low load-
ing, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase
where it reduces the amount of accessible O−. The remain-
ing more isolated O−species which are active sites turned
to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
At loading higher than 3–7% the active sites are not modiﬁed
anymore since a maximum of interaction between the two
oxides is obtained but since the speciﬁc surface area of the
catalysts continues to increase, the total conversion of ethane
increases. The increase in speciﬁc surface area is explained by
a “mutual protective effect” between NiO and Nb2O5 that pre-
vents the crystallization and/or growth of particles of NiO. This
effect allows obtaining the best yields for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O
compound. Above 15% of Nb, the inactive phase NiNb2O6 is
formed and the catalytic properties are not optimal anymore.
The results obtained show that surface interaction with nio-
bium oxide is not the only way to lower the O−concentration
at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid
thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be con-
sidered.
(3) The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A con-
tinuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts
was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations
over time on stream have been explained by the formation
of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-
stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more O−active species
were present at the surface of NiO. A treatment in air at 450 ◦C
for 30 min did not allow to regenerate the catalysts. Neither a
treatment at higher temperature nor a treatment for a longer
time at lower temperature, have been considered. The ﬁrst one
would lead to a decrease in the speciﬁc surface area of the cat-
alysts and consequently a decrease in the catalytic activity and
the latter has been shown to lead to the formation of the inac-
tive NiNb2O6 phase. The way to delay the process could be to
decrease the reaction temperature but the catalysts would not
be so efﬁcient and of minor interest. A way to avoid the deac-
tivation has thus still to be discovered in order to use these
efﬁcient catalysts for industrial applications.
