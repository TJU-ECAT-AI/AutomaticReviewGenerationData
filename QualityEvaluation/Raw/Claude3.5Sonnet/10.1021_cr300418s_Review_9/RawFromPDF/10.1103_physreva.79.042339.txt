We propose an efÔ¨Åcient scheme for the implementation of quantum information transfer in a one-
dimensional coupled resonator waveguide. We show that, based on the effective long-range dipole-dipole
interactions between the atoms mediated by the cavity modes, Raman transitions between the atoms trapped in
different nodes can take place. Quantum information could be transferred directly between the opposite ends of
the coupled waveguide without involving the intermediate nodes via either Raman transitions or the stimulated
Raman adiabatic passages. Since this scheme, in principle, is a one-step protocol, it may provide useful
applications in quantum communications.

I. INTRODUCTION
The transfer of quantum states from one place to another
is an important goal in the Ô¨Åeld of quantum information sci-
ence for distributing and processing information 1,2. To
accomplish this task, several approaches have been em-
ployed. For long distance quantum communications, optical
systems such as cavity QED system 3,4 are used to transfer
states from one node to another through photons transmitting
in a Ô¨Åber 5,6. For the case of short distance quantum com-
munications, spin chains are proposed 7. In spin chains,
single spin addressing is difÔ¨Åcult because the spatial separa-
tion between neighboring spins is very small. Thus the con-
trol over the couplings between the spins or over individual
spins is very hard to achieve. Therefore, these protocols
based on spin chains have some drawbacks, which impair the
performance for quantum information transfer QIT. Re-
cently coupled resonator waveguide has attracted great inter-
ests 8‚Äì14. We have proposed a protocol for generating
atomic cluster states using coupled resonators for one-way
quantum computation 15. Coupled resonator waveguide
has the advantage of easily addressing individual lattice sites
with optical lasers. Furthermore, the atoms trapped in the
resonators can have relatively long-lived atomic levels for
encoding quantum information. Therefore, it is desirable to
develop a technique for implementing short distance quan-
tum communications in a coupled resonator waveguide.
In this work, we propose a scheme for the implementation
of QIT between three-state atoms trapped in a one-
dimensional coupled resonator waveguide. We Ô¨Årst demon-
strate that the coupled system can be reduced to an effective
 conÔ¨Åguration which supports Raman transitions between
the Ô¨Årst atom and the end one. Then we utilize this protocol
to implement short distance quantum communications. This
proposal exploits the effective long-range dipole-dipole in-
teractions mediated by the cavity modes between the atoms.
The nonlocal interactions combined with lasers are utilized
to induce Raman transitions between the atoms trapped in
the two ends of the waveguide via the exchange of virtual
cavity photons. Quantum states can be transferred directly
from the Ô¨Årst node to the end one within the one-dimensional
coupled resonator waveguide, through either Raman transi-
tions or the stimulated Raman adiabatic passages STIRAPs
16. This proposal for QIT in a network using coupled reso-
nators should provide very interesting applications in the
Ô¨Åeld of quantum information processing, such as entangle-
ment distribution, teleportation 17, and distributed quantum
computation 18. Experimentally this protocol could be re-
alized with the state-of-the-art technology.
II. QUANTUM-INFORMATION TRANSFER
IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL COUPLED
RESONATOR WAVEGUIDE
Consider a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide
consisting of N nodes, as sketched in Fig. 1. The coupled
resonator waveguide can be realized in a wide range of
physical systems, such as nanocavities in photonic crystals
19, and superconducting transmission line resonators 20.
To implement QIT, each node consists of a cavity and a
trapped three-state atom. Each atom has the level structure
of a three-state system with two lower states 0j and 1j
j=1,2, ... ,N for storage of one qubit of quantum informa-
tion, and an upper state ej. The cavity mode is far detuned

Here we add a laser to each resonator for generality, but in

the terms up to second order and dropping the fast oscillating

tions eN+i00, i=1,2, ... ,N. The Ô¨Årst term corresponds
to the level shift for each atom, the second term describes the
interactions between atoms and lasers, and the last term rep-
resents the effective dipole coupling of trapped atoms in-
duced by cavity modes.
We introduce the states 1i=000...1i...000 and ei
=000...ei...000, which denote that the atom at the ith site
has been Ô¨Çipped to the state 1 and e while other atoms
stay in 0. Assuming that only the lasers 1 and N are
switched on and the system initially stays in 11, then the
coupling scheme can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a.
To gain more insight into this coupling conÔ¨Åguration, we
turn

we see that Hamiltonian 6 describes an effective  system,
with two lower states 11, 1N and several upper states k.
Under the conditions Ek1k,2k, Raman transitions can
take place between the states 11 and 1N. Through adia-

tween the Ô¨Årst node and the last one, assisted by the inter-
mediate nodes through virtual photon exchanges.
We now discuss how to implement QIT in this one-
dimensional coupled resonator waveguide. We assume that
the state sender Alice is located at the Ô¨Årst node and the state
receiver Bob is located at the end of the waveguide. Alice

wants to transfer an unknown state to Bob through this
waveguide. To start the protocol, Alice places the atom at the
Ô¨Årst site in the arbitrary unknown state 	01+
11, while
the atoms in other nodes are prepared in the state 0. We can
describe the state of the whole system at this instant as
0=	0+
11, with 0=000...0. Then under the in-
teraction of Eq. 7, the state vector at the time t is
t = 	0 + 
cosrt11 ‚àíi sinrt1N.
8
At the moment rtf=/2 they turn off the couplings and
Bob gets the state tf=	0‚àíi
1N. If Bob performs a
gate operation U=1,i, he could retrieve the state 	0N
+
1N for the atom N. The procedure completes QIT inside
the one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide, which in
principle could be extended to realize short distance quantum
communications. Different from the schemes based on spin
chains for short distance quantum communications, the prin-
ciple advantage of this scheme is that, in the coupled reso-
nator waveguide, individual lattice sites can be addressed
with optical lasers. Therefore, it is much easier to switch the
interactions of the qubit on which the initial state is encoded
and the qubit on which the Ô¨Ånal state is received with the rest
of the waveguide in this proposal.
It is noted that QIT can also be implemented through
STIRAP techniques 16 with this one-dimensional coupled
resonator waveguide. In such a case, we require the lasers to
select a resonant transition from the initial state 11 to the
Ô¨Ånal state 1N via an intermediate state such as k
Àú, while
other transition channels are far off resonance. Then the sys-
tem is reduced to a typical  conÔ¨Åguration, which supports a
dark state involving the two states 11 and 1N. Adiabatic
passage following the dark state can be implemented by
varying the Rabi frequencies slowly. Then an arbitrary un-
known state 	01+
11 can be transferred directly from the
Ô¨Årst atom to the end one following the STIRAP.
It is necessary to verify the model through numerical
simulations. We consider the case of QIT in three coupled
resonators. The system is initially prepared in the state
1

201+110203. Employing a quantum master equation
approach, we have simulated the dynamics of the system
through the Monte Carlo wave function MCWF formalism
23,24. In Fig. 3 the numerical solutions of the density ma-
trix equations for the full system described by the exact
Hamiltonian H are shown together with the dynamics of the
system undergoing the effective Hamiltonian 7. Here the
parameters are chosen such that they are within the param-
eter range for which the scheme is valid discussed in the
next paragraph. It is clear that the agreement between the
exact and effective models is excellent under the given pa-
rameters.
The
system
starts
from
the
state
1

201
+110203. At the time t=/2r, the Ô¨Årst atom evolves
into its ground state 01 and the third atom evolves into
1

203‚àíi13. This process completes the procedure for QIT
between these two atoms. During this process, the popula-
tions of the atomic excited states and the cavity modes keep
small.
We now study the performance of this protocol under re-
alistic circumstances and estimate the range of parameters
implementing optimal QIT. Consider a one-dimensional
coupled resonator waveguide consisting of N nodes. Alice
wants to transfer an arbitrary quantum state from the Ô¨Årst
node to Bob who is located at the end. To quantify the per-
formance of QIT, we utilize the Ô¨Ådelity F=pfp, where
p refers to the perfectly transferred state and f is the Ô¨Ånal
reduced density matrix of the last atom under realistic cir-
cumstances. The Ô¨Ådelity is reduced due to the small prob-
abilities of populating either the atomic excited states or the
cavity modes. For this protocol, spontaneous emission from
the state ej at a rate  and cavity decay of photons at a rate
 lead to effective decay rates E=kk/Ek2 and C
=kg/
Nk2, with k=max1k,2k. Hence to achieve
coherent interaction requires that E,Cr. These re-
quirements could be satisÔ¨Åed if JCg2/2 and JC.
Since photons are more likely to tunnel to the next cavity
than decay into free space, JC should hold in most cases.
For the condition JCg2/2 to hold, cavities with a high
ratio g/ are very good candidates. These two requirements
together imply that the cavities should have a high cooperat-
ivity factor. To make sure this scheme is valid, we also re-
quire that g and g2/i. Taking into account these
probabilities of error, the Ô¨Ådelity is estimated as F1
‚àíEtf‚àíCtf, where tf=/2r is the time to complete QIT.
For experimental implementation of QIT in a coupled
resonator waveguide, atoms or polar molecules trapped in
coupled superconducting stripline microwave resonators
20,25 are promising candidates. It is noted that hybrid de-
vices combining solid state circuits with trapped atoms or
molecules have been explored 26. We choose the param-

ber increases the Ô¨Ådelity decreases. For a waveguide con-
sisted of 100 coupled resonators, the Ô¨Ådelity is about 88%
and the time to complete QIT is tf0.01 s. Thus the num-

QIT in this network, the proposed methods for quantum error

We have presented a protocol for the implementation of
short

in
a
one-
dimensional coupled resonator waveguide. This protocol uti-
lizes the cavity Ô¨Åeld induced nonlocal interactions and Ra-
man transitions between trapped atoms at the opposite ends
of the waveguide. QIT could take place directly from the Ô¨Årst
node to the end one without involving the intermediate
nodes, which represents an interesting step toward realizing
quantum communications.
