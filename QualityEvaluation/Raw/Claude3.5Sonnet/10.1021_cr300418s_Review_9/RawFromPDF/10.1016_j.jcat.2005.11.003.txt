Abstract
In this work, transient and SSITKA experiments with isotopic 18O2 were conducted to study the nature of oxygen species participating in the
reaction of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene and obtain insight in the mechanistic aspects of the ODH reaction over Ni-based catalysts.
The study was performed on NiO, a typical total oxidation catalyst, and a bulk Ni–Nb–O mixed-oxide catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15) developed previously
[E. Heracleous, A.A. Lemonidou, J. Catal., in press], a very efﬁcient ethane ODH material (46% ethene yield at 400 ◦C). The results revealed
that over both materials, the reaction proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, with participation of lattice oxygen anions. However,
the 18O2 exchange measurements showed a different distribution of isotopic oxygen species on the two materials. The prevalent formation of
cross-labelled oxygen species on NiO indicates that dissociation of oxygen is the fast step of the exchange process, leading to large concentration
of intermediate electrophilic oxygen species on the surface, active for the total oxidation of ethane. Larger amounts of doubly exchanged species
were observed on the Ni–Nb–O catalyst, indicating that doping with Nb makes diffusion the fast step of the process and suppresses formation of
the oxidizing species. Kinetic modeling of ethane ODH over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst by combined genetic algorithm and nonlinear regression
techniques conﬁrmed the above, since the superior model is based on a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network with the participation of two
types of active sites: type I, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II, active for the direct oxidation of
ethane to CO2. The kinetic model was able to successfully predict the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst in considerably different
experimental conditions than the kinetic experiments (high temperature and conversion levels).

1. Introduction
Ethylene, one of the most important petrochemicals, is cur-
rently produced by steam cracking of naphtha or ethane. Steam
cracking is an extremely energy-intensive process, and thus
the development of a substitute method for the production of
light alkenes has become an urgent task. The oxidative dehy-
drogenation of alkanes to alkenes in the presence of a suitable
catalytic material constitutes the most attractive alternative to
steam cracking.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene
has been studied over a wide range of materials [1–4]; however,
most catalysts suffer from low yields at high conversion due to
the thermodynamically favored oxidation of both reactant and
product to carbon oxides. In the ﬁrst part of this series [5], we
reported the development of bulk Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides as
highly active and selective catalysts for ethane ODH. The Ni–
Nb–O multicomponent oxides combine both high activity at
low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion
levels, resulting in an overall ethene yield of 46% at 400 ◦C.
Detailed characterization of a series of Ni–Nb–O oxides with
varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previ-
ously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates
that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is

the Ni–Nb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb,
since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from
a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic mater-
ial. Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was
achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst),
since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lat-
tice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel
and niobium phases. Nickel sites were recognized as the active
sites responsible for the activation of the parafﬁnic substrate,
with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to oleﬁn by mod-
ifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface.
The present work is complementary to the characterization
and catalytic performance study of the Ni–Nb–O oxides re-
ported earlier [5] and aims to obtain insight into the ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation pathways over this new promising
class of catalytic materials. Several previous studies have ad-
dressed the details of the primary and secondary steps of the
oxidative dehydrogenation reaction [6–9]. It is widely accepted
that over reducible oxides, with operating temperature below
500–600 ◦C, the reaction proceeds via a redox (Mars–van Krev-
elen [MVK]) type mechanism in two steps: reduction of the cat-
alyst by the alkane with extraction of lattice oxygen, followed
by reoxidation of the reduced catalyst by molecular dioxygen.
In the present study, we use various isotopic 18O2 exchange
techniques on pure NiO and Nb-doped NiO to probe the nature
of the active and selective sites and elucidate the ODH reaction
mechanism. Oxygen isotope exchange is a common method for
studying the participation of oxygen from the catalyst in oxida-
tion reactions. The isotopic tracer method is very effective and
has been widely used for investigating the oxidative dehydro-
genation reaction mechanism over various metal oxide catalysts
[10–17].
Kinetic study of the alkane oxidative dehydrogenation re-
action also yields important information about the reaction
mechanism. Even though the kinetic studies cannot determine
the molecular mechanism, they allow the exclusion of possi-
ble reaction pathways and help obtain a quantitative analysis
for the participation of particular reaction routes (e.g., paral-
lel vs. consecutive reactions) and different catalytic sites in the
proposed mechanism. Several kinetic models for the oxidative
dehydrogenation of light alkanes to oleﬁns on various catalytic
systems have been reported in the literature [17–30]. Although
there is a general consensus concerning propane ODH, which
has been successfully modeled using the classical MVK re-
dox mechanism [20,21,23–25,27,28], some controversy exists
in the case of ethane ODH. Since the early work of Thornstein-
son [31] on mixed Mo–V–Nb oxides, the intervention of lattice
oxygen for ethylene production has been proposed and a re-
dox mechanism postulated. Furthermore, kinetic data obtained
over vanadium oxide-based catalysts [17,19,22,32] were satis-
factorily ﬁtted with rate equations and parameters based on the
MVK mechanism or a combination of the MVK mechanism
for ethylene production and Langmuir–Hinshelwood expres-
sions for carbon oxide formation. However, a different mecha-
nism has been proposed on molybdenum catalysts by Lunsford
and Solymosi [33,34], who proposed, rather than a MVK re-
action pattern, a mechanism that considers the intervention of
O−species in the determining step; that is, the activation of
ethane involves hydrogen abstraction by O−to give ethyl rad-
icals, which further react with oxygen species on the surface.
Kaddouri et al. [20,35] performed kinetic studies on NiMoO4
with both propane and ethane feed and showed that the ethane
ODH was dependent on the oxygen partial pressure, whereas
propane ODH was not. Moreover, they observed that ethylene
was formed only in the presence of molecular oxygen, with
its concentration passing through a maximum before declining
when the oxygen feed was turned off [35]. Thus, they proposed
that whereas propane ODH proceeds via the participation of
lattice oxygen, in ethane ODH ethylene is formed via mild ox-
idation by O−adsorbed species. Schuurman et al. [36] came to
the same conclusion by performing TAP experiments on NiO
and suggested that the ethane ODH reaction over nickel in-
volves a parallel-consecutive scheme for CO2 production and
that ethane is irreversibly adsorbed and activated by O−species.
In this work, we report isotopic tracer exchange studies of
ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over NiO and Nb-doped NiO
(Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst) to elucidate the reaction mechanism over
these catalytic materials and obtain information on the nature
of oxygen species and the selective and unselective pathways
of the ODH reaction. Based on the information obtained from
these experiments and kinetic studies, we develop a sequence of
steps and a macroscopic kinetic model describing the catalytic
behavior.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Experiments were performed on a Ni–Nb–O mixed-oxide
catalyst with a Nb/Ni atomic ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15) and
pure NiO. The preparation, physicochemical characterization,
and evaluation of the catalytic performance of the materials in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene have been
reported in detail previously [5].
2.2. 18O2 isotopic experiments
The isotopic tracer exchange studies were conducted at a
homemade ﬂow apparatus, specially designed to allow fast re-
sponse times (<10 s). A four-port switching valve, driven by
an electric actuator, was used to switch between different feeds
and create step concentration functions to the reactor. The ex-
periments were performed in a U-shaped quartz reactor. The
internal diameter of the reactor tube in the catalytic zone was
9 mm, whereas the internal diameter in the precatalytic and
postcatalytic sections was 4 mm. The temperature of the cat-
alyst was measured by a thermocouple placed in a quartz capil-
lary well located in the middle of the catalytic bed. The reactor
was situated in a cylindrical furnace controlled by a program-
mable temperature controller.
Before each experiment, the catalyst was pretreated in 10%
16O2/He ﬂow at 450 ◦C for 1 h, followed by ﬂushing in He for
1 h and subsequent cooling or heating of the sample to the ap-
propriate temperature for each experiment. For the temperature-

177
programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experiments, the cata-
lyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Spectra Gases;
95% atom enrichment)/He ﬂow (50 cm3/min), and the temper-
ature was raised from room temperature to 650 ◦C at a heating
rate of 15 ◦C/min. The system was maintained isothermally
at 650 ◦C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The isother-
mal isotopic oxygen exchange experiments were conducted at
425 ◦C and involved the switch from a ﬂow of 1% 16O2/2%
Ar/He to 1% 18O2/He (50 cm3/min). For the SSITKA exper-
iments, a reaction mixture of 1% 16O2/1% C2H6/2% Ar/He
(50 cm3/min) was introduced in the reactor at 375 ◦C. The re-
action was carried out until steady-state conditions were estab-
lished, at which point the ﬂow was subsequently changed to the
oxygen isotope–containing mixture (1% 18O2/1% C2H6/He).
The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary
system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for
on-line monitoring of the exit gas composition. The concentra-
tion proﬁles were obtained by acquiring the signals relative to
the following mass-to-charge (m/z) values: 2 (H2), 18 (H2O),
20 (H218O), 24 (C2H4), 30 (C2H6), 32 (O2), 34 (18O16O), 36
(18O2), 44 (CO2), 46 (C18O16O), and 48 (C18O2). Details of the
procedure followed for quantitative analysis have been reported
previously [37]. All experiments were repeated using an empty
volume reactor to check the contribution of gas-phase reactions,
describe the forcing function of the system, and account for all
of the back-mixing and electronic delays.
2.3. Kinetic studies
The kinetic studies were conducted at atmospheric pressure
in a continuous ﬁxed-bed ﬂow reactor over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 cat-
alyst [5]. The quartz reactor (9 mm i.d.) was equipped with
a coaxial thermocouple in a thermowell located in the middle
of the catalytic bed for temperature monitoring. The catalyst
particles were diluted with a double amount of quartz parti-
cles of the same size to achieve isothermal operation. The re-
action products were analyzed on-line by a Perkin-Elmer gas
chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.
Two columns in a series-bypass conﬁguration were used in the
analysis: a Porapak Q and a MS 5A. The main reaction products
were C2H4, CO2, and H2O. Negligible amounts of oxygenates
were observed at the reactor exit. The ethane conversion and
the selectivity to the reaction products were calculated on car-
bon basis. Closure of the carbon mass-balance was better than
±1%.
Before the measurements, the catalyst was activated in ﬂow-
ing oxygen for 30 min at 450 ◦C. The kinetic experiments were
conducted at four different temperatures (240, 260, 280, and
300 ◦C) with varying inlet partial pressures of ethane (1.01–
9.12 kPa), oxygen (1.01–20.26 kPa), and the balance helium.
The choice of experimental conditions allowed the study of
C2H6/O2 ratios ranging from 5/1 to 1/5. To assess the sec-
ondary reactions of ethene oxidation, the same experiments
were repeated using ethene as feed instead of ethane. The in-
ﬂuence of the reaction products in ethane oxidative dehydro-
genation was studied at 280 ◦C by introducing varying concen-
trations of water (0–10.13 kPa) into the feed (5.07 kPa C2H6,
5.07 kPa O2, balance He).
Catalyst weight was adjusted accordingly in each set of con-
ditions to keep the reactants conversion <6% and maintain
differential conditions in the reactor. The total ﬂow rate was
150 cm3/min in all cases. Preliminary experiments performed
at the higher reaction temperature studied (300 ◦C) with vary-
ing total ﬂow ensured the absence of external mass transfer
limitations for ﬂow rates ⩾150 cm3/min. Internal mass trans-
fer limitations become important with increasing size of cata-
lyst particles. Since the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst used in this study
has a very small particle size (<100 µm), the internal trans-
fer limitations were assumed to be negligible. The absence of
heat and mass transfer limitations were also conﬁrmed theoret-
ically, using the Mears criteria. The contribution of gas-phase–
initiated reactions was tested by conducting experiments using
an empty-volume reactor. The conversion of ethane/ethene at
these experiments was negligible, conﬁrming that gas-phase re-
actions are absent at the experimental conditions used for the
kinetic tests.
3. General considerations for kinetic modeling
The kinetic parameters were determined by modeling the
quartz tubular reactor as an isothermal axial plug ﬂow reactor.
Assuming steady-state operation, the material balance for each
gas phase component was expressed by the following equation:
dpi
dmcat
= RT
Q

j
vijrj,
where rj is the rate of the j reaction, νij is the stoichiometric
coefﬁcient of species i in reaction j, mcat is the weight of the
catalyst sample, and Q is the total inlet volumetric ﬂow rate at
reaction conditions, resulting in a ﬁrst-order differential equa-
tion system.
At steady-state conditions, the concentration of the surface
species is assumed to be constant. Therefore, surface coverage
values were calculated by numerically solving a system of al-
gebraic equations describing the mass balance of each species
and the global balance of the normalized surface coverages for
each center.
The system of differential equations was numerically inte-
grated over the catalyst mass for each set of initial experimental
conditions, using an explicit Runge–Kutta [2,3] pair method. In
the parameter search procedure, the objective function was to
minimize the weighted sum of the squared differences between
the experimental molar fractions for each species and their ﬁt-
ted values. The minimization was performed by ﬁrst obtaining
an initial estimate of the kinetic constants using a genetic al-
gorithm. The big advantage of genetic algorithms lies in the
fact that they are able to depart from local minima, thus ob-
taining with high probability a global solution. The solutions
offered by the genetic algorithm were then used as starting val-
ues for nonlinear regression analysis, using a Gauss–Newton
algorithm with Levenberg–Marquardt modiﬁcations for global
convergence [38]. The sufﬁciency of each model tested was
evaluated based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) of
178
E. Heracleous, A.A. Lemonidou / Journal of Catalysis 237 (2006) 175–189
the regression and the square of the correlation between the
response values and the predicted response values (R2), ad-
justed on the residual degrees of freedom (number of response
values minus the number of ﬁtted coefﬁcients) [39]. The joint
conﬁdence region and the correlation between the parameter
values were also assessed. All computational calculations were
performed with MATLAB software. In all models studied, the
Arrhenius equation and the Van’t Hoff law were used to express
the reaction rate and adsorption parameters, respectively. The
pre-exponential factors determined refer to a mean temperature,
T0 (270 ◦C). This centering procedure was used to minimize the
strong correlation between the pre-exponential factor and the
activation energy and thus facilitate the parameter search [40].
4. Results and discussion
4.1. 18O2 isotopic exchange studies
4.1.1. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange
One of the major issues in a partial oxidation reaction over
oxide catalysts is the role of the catalyst oxygen and the in-
teraction of the oxidant with the catalytic surface, which can
be studied using labeled 18O2. Several phenomena, including
release/uptake, diffusion, sorption, and 18O isotope exchange,
can occur during the interaction of gas-phase oxygen with the
solid oxide. The simplest type of reaction is that of equilibra-
tion or homomolecular exchange (R0 mechanism), which is
catalyzed by the oxide surface but does not involve exchange
with oxygen of the oxide lattice [41,42]. The exchange of la-
belled gas-phase oxygen with the catalyst oxygen is referred to
as heterolytic exchange and can occur via a simple (R1 mecha-
nism, the exchange of only one surface oxygen species) and/or
a multiple (R2 mechanism, the simultaneous exchange of two
surface oxygen species) heteromolecular 18O isotope exchange
mechanism. All three types of interaction of gaseous oxygen
with the solid can occur simultaneously and yield important in-
formation concerning the oxygen activity [41,42].
In view of the above, temperature-programmed 18O2 iso-
tope exchange (TPIE) measurements were conducted on se-
lected samples to investigate the oxygen species and the type
and density of sites available for oxygen activation on nickel-
based oxides. The experiments were performed on pure NiO,
which, as shown previously [5], exhibits high activity for con-
verting ethane mainly to CO2, and on the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst,
which demonstrates a very high activity and selectivity in eth-
ylene production via ethane ODH.
The TPIE proﬁles in the 30–650 ◦C temperature range for
NiO and Nb-doped NiO are presented in Figs. 1A and B, re-
spectively, where the surface consumption and formation rate
of all isotopic species (18O2, 16O18O, and 16O2 species) is de-
picted as a function of temperature. The oxygen balance in all
experiments amounted to 95 ± 5%, and hence the amount of
oxygen consumed for any irreversible adsorption or desorption
was not signiﬁcant. The oxygen-exchange process commences
at low temperature in both solids, the temperature range of in-
terest for the actual catalytic reaction. The lower Tonset recorded
for NiO (350 compared with 380 ◦C recorded for Ni0.85Nb0.15)

indicates higher oxygen mobility in NiO. The temperature de-
pendence of the conversion of 18O2 to the various oxygen iso-
topes allowed estimation of the apparent activation energy for
the exchange reaction for the two materials (see Table 1). The
value of 114.6 kJ/mol for NiO is in good agreement with re-
sults reported by Winters [42]. The introduction of Nb induces
a signiﬁcant increase in the activation energy for oxygen ex-
change up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reﬂecting more strongly bonded
oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO. Further-
more, the rate of 18O exchange with the surface of Ni0.85Nb0.15
is markedly reduced with respect to the Nb-free solid.
Over both catalysts, the exchange process starts via the
multiple-exchange mechanism, because the ﬁrst product de-
tected is 16O2, with concurrent exchange of two surface species
with gas-phase oxygen. For the Nb-doped catalyst, the rate
of this reaction reaches a maximum at 485 ◦C and decreases
thereafter, while simultaneously the simple heteromolecular ex-
change begins at 400 ◦C as the 16O18O signal starts to increase.
The (m/z) 34 signal reaches a maximum at ∼550 ◦C and then
decreases, whereas the exchange of gaseous oxygen with a sec-
ond type of oxygen species is evidenced by a broad shoulder at
650 ◦C. The amount of catalyst oxygen exchanged up to 550 ◦C
(maximum of the 16O18O signal) corresponds roughly to mono-

lattice constant and crystallographic structure of NiO) and sig-
niﬁes the beginning of a slower exchange with oxygen diffusing
from the bulk of the oxide. The NiO TPIE proﬁle (Fig. 1A)
shows again that exchange proceeds with two different oxygen
species with peaks at 485 and 625 ◦C in the (m/z) 34 signal, but
with a much larger contribution from the high-temperature oxy-
gen species in contrast to the Nb catalyst, in which the opposite
is observed.
Fig. 2 presents the total surface exchange rate of 16O species
(16O2 and 16O18O) and the amount of exchangeable oxygen
species estimated from the integration of the TPIE 16O response
curves as a function of reaction temperature. It is clearly seen
that the amount and lability of exchangeable oxygen decrease
considerably upon doping of NiO with Nb. The results of the
TPIE experiments are summarized in Table 1. NiO exchanges
almost twice the amount of oxygen species than Nb/NiO, cor-
responding to ∼7 equivalent monolayers of oxygen, whereas 3
oxygen layers are available for exchange in Ni0.85Nb0.15. Thus
on both solids, the diffusion of O from the inner bulk of the solid
is a signiﬁcant process for supplying oxygen to the surface. It is
interesting to compare the surface rate of oxygen exchange with
the rate of ethane consumption during ethane ODH. According
to the values reported previously [5], NiO exhibits almost twice
the surface ethane activation rate than the Ni–Nb–O catalyst at
the same reaction temperature, whereas the rate of oxygen ex-
change for NiO in the TPIE experiments appears to be again
double in the 400–500 ◦C range. This implies a correlation be-
tween the ability of the catalysts to convert ethane and exchange
oxygen on the surface. Therefore, it can be postulated that the
high surface activity of NiO in the ethane ODH reaction is a

result of highly active oxygen species, which, however, fully
oxidize ethane to CO2. The addition of niobium reduces or
eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned,
based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and
literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxy-
gen species.
4.1.2. Isothermal isotopic oxygen exchange
Additional information was extracted from isothermal steady-
state isotope exchange experiments conducted at 425 ◦C over
the NiO and Ni0.85Nb0.15 oxides. Figs. 3A and B present the
transient curves of different oxygen isotopes obtained when a
stream of 1% 16O2/2% Ar was switched to a stream of 1%
18O2 (balance He) for NiO and Nb/NiO, respectively. The ar-
gon transient relaxes back to zero within 10 s after the feed

switch, whereas the transients for 18O2, 16O2, and 16O18O
change much slower, providing clear evidence for the occur-
rence of isotopic exchange between oxygen in the gas phase
and lattice and/or adsorbed oxygen species on the solid oxides.
Over the NiO sample, the 16O2 transient decreases to zero rel-
atively rapidly (4 min after the switch), indicating a very rapid
double-oxygen exchange via the R2 mechanism. Cross-labelled
oxygen formation reaches a maximum 40 s after the switch,
and a pseudo-steady state is reached after 4 min with a ca. 9%
concentration of 16O18O in the exit gas stream, indicating the
dominance of the simple heteroexchange mechanism, in agree-
ment with the TPIE measurements. The initial rapid transient
of the 16O2 signal is attributed to the rapid double exchange of
16O for 18O at the surface of NiO particles. As the surface is de-
pleted in oxygen, oxygen diffusing from the bulk progressively
participates to a greater extent.
A different behavior is recorded for the Nb-doped NiO oxide
(Fig. 3B). The 16O2 signal exhibits a rapid decrease in the ﬁrst
minute after the switch and then smoothly decreases, approach-
ing a steady value >0 and equal to ∼5% during the time span
of the experiment. This rapid rate of oxygen exchange could be
attributed to the reaction with surface lattice oxygen and/or ad-
sorbed 16O species on the catalytic surface, while the slower
rate to the exchange of catalyst oxygen diffusing from the bulk
of the oxide. Signiﬁcant amounts of cross-labelled oxygen are
also formed on the Ni–Nb catalyst; however, the formation rate
of this species increases slowly with time, exceeds the concen-
tration of unlabeled 16O2 at 5 min, and reaches a 20% concen-
tration after 20 min of isotopic exchange.
Comparing the behavior of the two solids, we can deduce
that doping of NiO with Nb suppresses the very rapid surface
oxygen exchange recorded in the case of pure NiO and en-
hances the exchange proceeding via the multiple heteromolec-
ular mechanism as opposed to the simple exchange mechanism
prevailing on pure NiO. According to a generally adopted ki-
netic scheme [44], the interaction of the catalyst with adsorbed
oxygen comprises an electron transfer from the solid to the ad-
sorbate, converting oxygen from O2 to lattice O2−anions via
the following sequence, which includes oxygen dissociation, in-
corporation, and diffusion steps:
O2(g) ←
→O2(surface)
e
←
→O2−(surface)
e
←
→O22−(surface) ←
→2O−(surface)
2e
←
→2O2−(surface) ←
→2O2−(bulk)
The distribution of isotopic exchange products depends on the
relative rates of the dissociation, incorporation, and diffusion
steps. Hence, a faster incorporation reaction and subsequent
diffusion results in 16O2 as the dominant product. In contrast,
faster dissociation of oxygen compared with oxygen incorpo-
ration leads to formation of 16O18O [45]. The prevalent forma-
tion of cross-labelled oxygen species on NiO indicates that the
incorporation and diffusion of oxygen is the rds, whereas dis-
sociation of oxygen on the surface is very fast, in accordance
with the high exchange rate observed. Doping with Nb possibly
reduces the active sites available for dissociation, making diffu-
sion the fast step of the process, leading to a lower exchange rate
and production of larger amounts of doubly exchanged species.
This is in agreement with ﬁndings from O2-TPD and electrical
conductivity studies reported previously [5], in which NiO was
found to accommodate a large amount of excess nonstoichio-
metric oxygen, that based on literature consists mainly [46,47]
consisting mainly of O2−and O−species. The presence of Nb
was found to consume or eliminate the incompletely reduced
electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O−, O2−, and O22−) [5].
Therefore, the rapid oxygen exchange occurring immediately
after the isotopic switch on NiO is attributed to rapid oxygen
dissociation on surface defects, leading to the formation of ac-
tive electrophilic oxygen species. In agreement with the TPIE
results, these surface defects are suppressed by the addition of
niobium, and thus a slower exchange rate is recorded.

ing conditions, the steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analy-
sis (SSITKA) method, a very powerful technique that allows
the study of the dynamic behavior of the system without per-
turbing the steady-state course of the reaction, was used. The
SSITKA experiments were performed at 375 ◦C by switching
the reaction feed stream from 1% C2H6/1% 16O2/2% Ar to 1%
C2H6/1% 18O2 (balance He). The transient curves for the CO2
and H2O species over NiO and Ni0.85Nb0.15 are illustrated in
Figs. 4A and B, respectively. It should be stressed that the sum
of the signals for a single molecular species remained constant
after the feed change, indicating that the steady state of the
reaction was not disturbed. Concerning pure NiO, the carbon
dioxide transients reveal a very rapid response, and the system
seems to approach a pseudo-steady state within the ﬁrst minute
after the isotopic switch. The C16O2 transient relaxes relatively
fast and approaches a steady value of almost 10%, whereas pro-
duction of both the cross-labelled carbon dioxide and C18O2 be-
gins immediately after the feed change. Cross-labelled CO2 ex-
hibits a maximum rate of formation at 40 s and then stabilizes at
a concentration of 40%, which drops very slowly in favor of the
C18O2 that acquires a value of 50%. A very different response
is observed when NiO is doped with niobium. A much slower
decay of the C16O2 signal is recorded, whereas the ﬁrst labelled
product detected is C16O18O, followed by double-labelled car-
bon dioxide after a delay of about 1 min. With increasing time,
C18O2 increases slowly at the expense of cross-labelled CO2,
because more surface 16O is exchanged with 18O, and the pos-
sibility of removing two isotopic oxygen species increases.
The transients for the oxygen species during the isotopic
switch under ethane ODH reaction conditions (not shown) show
very rapid oxygen exchange, with 16O2 depletion following
stabilization of the inert argon tracer at a low constant concen-
tration of 2% for the duration of the experiment. In contrast
to the isotopic oxygen exchange experiments in the absence of
ethane, no cross-labelled oxygen formation was detected un-
der ODH conditions. Therefore, it seems that the dissociative
chemisorption of oxygen is irreversible in the course of the
oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, in agreement with various
previous reports [12,15,17]. The drastic change in the responses

of the oxygen exchange products in the presence of ethane in-
dicates that the rate of ethane reaction with the oxygen species
formed from the activation of gas-phase 18O2 on the surface is
faster than the rate of recombination and desorption of the oxy-
gen species in the form of 16O2 or 16O18O, as was observed in
the absence of the hydrocarbon feed.
The water responses (H216O, H218O) are generally much
slower than the CO2 curves, a ﬁnding that was expected con-
sidering the strong adsorption of these species on the catalytic
surface and on the experimental apparatus. However, compar-
ing the relaxation of H216O on the two samples shows that the
decay is much faster for pure NiO than for the niobium cata-
lyst, in agreement with the results for the CO2 transients. The
concentration of unlabelled oxygen remains at high levels for
a signiﬁcant duration, indicating that the oxygen inserted into
water comes primarily from the catalyst lattice. A rough calcu-
lation of the theoretical concentration of H216O in the reactor
exit—assuming that all water is produced from the stoichio-
metric total oxidation reaction of ethane to carbon dioxide and
based on the concentration of the isotopic CO2 species—gives
a value much lower than the actual measured value. This in-
dicates that the water produced from the selective step of the
alkane to oleﬁn conversion also contains signiﬁcant amounts of
lattice oxygen, conﬁrming the participation of catalyst oxygen
in the selective pathway of the reaction.
To check for the accumulation of reaction intermediates un-
der reaction conditions, at the end of the SSITKA experiments
the ﬂow was switched to pure He under the reaction temperature
(375 ◦C). After suppressing ethane and oxygen from the feed,
all reactants and products disappeared rapidly following the in-
ert argon tracer transient, indicating no signiﬁcant accumulation
of hydrocarbon or carbonaceous intermediates/deposits on the
catalytic surface. A delay was observed only for the H2O tran-
sient, signifying the strong adsorption of water on the catalytic
surface.
The formation of signiﬁcant amounts of 16O-containing
products long after the isotopic switch on both studied sam-
ples is a strong indication that over nickel-based catalysts, the
reaction proceeds with the participation of lattice oxygen via
a MVK-type mechanism. Furthermore, the formation of unla-
beled CO2 species points to the participation of lattice oxygen
in the unselective pathways of the reaction as well, in contrast
to some earlier literature reports postulating that lattice oxygen
is involved only in the selective step of converting the paraf-
ﬁnic substrate to oleﬁn, whereas total oxidation occurs with
oxygen from the gas phase [48]. It should also be mentioned
at this point that isothermal isotope oxygen exchange experi-
ments under oxidizing conditions (in the absence of ethane in
the feed) performed at 375 ◦C showed no exchange activity, and
higher temperatures were required to observe measurable iso-
topic exchange (see the description of experiments performed
at 425 ◦C). However, the experiments performed under reaction
conditions at 375 ◦C, as shown in Figs. 4A and B, exhibit signif-
icant activity of lattice oxygen, indicating that when the surface
is partially reduced, oxygen vacancies are created and thus lat-
tice oxygen mobility is enhanced compared with exchange in
the absence of the alkane.
Nevertheless, even if isotopic tracer studies are very help-
ful for elucidating the oxygen species involved in the reaction
scheme, it is still very difﬁcult to determine the primary oxy-
gen source responsible for the formation of the products. It is
possible that a product species could be formed initially by re-
action of ethane with an adsorbed oxygen species from the gas
phase, but that secondary O exchange of its oxygen with lattice
oxygen could then occur. Such secondary exchange processes
have been reported to have very low activation energy and oc-
cur very rapidly on metal oxides, at a rate much higher than
the formation of the product species [49]. The total fraction of
16O species in all O-containing products (CO2 and H2O) as a
function of reaction time after the isotopic switch for the two
catalysts is plotted in Fig. 5. In both cases, the 16-oxygen con-
centration approaches near-equilibrium conditions, suggesting
that secondary exchange reactions and surface-catalyzed ex-
change processes resulting in gas-phase equilibration are very
likely to occur. Therefore, only qualitative (not quantitative) in-
terpretation of the SSITKA results has been attempted in this
study. As seen in Fig. 5, the concentration of 16O over NiO
drops to 55% immediately after the switch, indicating either di-

rect participation of gas-phase oxygen or very rapidly formed
adsorbed oxygen species. After 5 min, a pseudo-steady state
equilibration is reached, with the 16O concentration stabilizing
at 45%. Introducing niobium produces a noticeably slower de-
cay that equilibrates 45 min after the isotopic switch, reinforc-
ing previous results [5] demonstrating that niobium eliminates
the very active nonselective O−species on the surface of NiO
by reducing the active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation on
the surface. This slower relaxation could be an indication of the
involvement of less labile selective lattice O2−species, respon-
sible for the high ODH activity recorded over the Ni–Nb–O
mixed oxide.
4.2. Kinetic modeling
4.2.1. Reaction network
To develop an efﬁcient kinetic model able to predict and
describe the course of a catalytic reaction, a reaction network
must ﬁrst be constructed. The kinetic experiments were con-
ducted over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst (Nb/Ni atomic ratio of
0.176), which proved to have the optimum catalytic formula-
tion among the different Ni–Nb–O catalysts studied for achiev-
ing maximum ethene yield (46% at 400 ◦C) [5]. The selec-
tivity versus conversion relation, obtained from experiments
performed at constant temperature and varying W/F presented
previously [5], showed that the catalyst has a high initial ethene
selectivity (90%) that remains almost constant (with only a very
small drop) with increasing conversion, indicating a very low
extent of secondary oleﬁn oxidation reactions. Moreover, the
only byproduct detected was CO2, allowing the construction
of a very simple reaction network consisting of the oxydehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethylene [reaction (1)], the primary
oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide [reaction (2)], and the
secondary oxidation of produced ethene to CO2 [reaction (3)]:

T = 300 ◦C).
4.2.2. Ethane and oxygen partial pressure variations
The effect of reactant partial pressure on the ethane oxidative
dehydrogenation reaction was studied by maintaining the par-
tial pressure of the one reactant constant and varying that of the
other, while keeping the total inlet ﬂow constant by balancing
with He. These experiments were conducted at four different
temperatures (240, 260, 280, and 300 ◦C), and similar results
were obtained at all temperatures studied. The effect of ethane
partial pressure on the rates of consumption/formation of re-
actants/products at 300 ◦C is depicted in Fig. 6. Increasing the
ethane concentration in the feed stream proves beneﬁcial for
the ODH reaction, increasing the consumption rate of ethane
and oxygen and formation rate of ethylene and carbon dioxide
similarly. This ﬁnding is clearly conﬁrmed by the selectivity
pattern (not shown), which shows no alteration in the C2H4 and
CO2 selectivity, indicating a similar ethane activation pathway
for dehydrogenation and the oxidation reaction.
The analogous results for the variation of the oxygen par-
tial pressure at 300 ◦C are illustrated in Fig. 7. At low oxygen
pressures, all rates increase almost linearly up to an oxygen con-
centration of 5.07 kPa, corresponding to a C2H6/O2 ratio of 1.
Further increases reduces the affect of O2 on the ethane con-
sumption and ethene formation rates, while that of O2 and CO2
keep increasing, demonstrating that high oxygen concentrations
promote total oxidation at the expense of the oxydehydrogena-
tion reaction.
4.2.3. Effect of H2O
The transient experiments performed on the Ni–Nb–O cat-
alyst demonstrated the occurrence of only a water adsorp-
tion step. Weak inhibition of ethane ODH rates by the water
formed in ODH and combustion steps has been reported previ-
ously [17], where it was postulated that water titrates vacancy
sites with hydroxyl species and decreases the number of lat-
tice oxygen atoms available for the C–H bond activation steps.
The inﬂuence of water on the ethane oxidation reaction over
the nickel–niobium system was studied by introducing varying

amounts of H2O (0–10.13 kPa) into the feed (5.07 kPa C2H6,
5.07 kPa O2, balance He) at 280 ◦C. Fig. 8 shows the relation
between the amount of H2O in the feed and the rates of con-
sumption/formation for all other reactants/products. The rates
of ethane consumption and ethene formation similarly decrease
with a negative order in the H2O partial pressure, with the in-
hibition effects weakening with increasing water concentration.
In contrast, the production of carbon dioxide seems to be unaf-
fected by the presence of water. The different effect of H2O on
the rate of ethene and carbon dioxide formation over this cata-
lyst suggests the existence of two types of active sites, selective
sites responsible for converting ethane to ethene and unselec-
tive sites capable of primarily oxidizing ethane to CO2. Water
seems to be preferentially adsorbed only on the selective sites,
and thus has no effect on carbon dioxide production. The inhi-
bition caused by water in the ethane ODH reaction appears to
be reversible, since the activity was restored to its original value
when H2O was removed from the feed.

rates of consumption/formation during ethene oxidation (reaction conditions:
(a) pO2 = 5.07 kPa, T = 300 ◦C; (b) pC2H4 = 5.07 kPa, T = 300 ◦C).
4.2.4. Ethene oxidation reaction
To assess and model the kinetics of the secondary reactions
of ethene oxidation, experiments with ethene and oxygen as
feed were performed over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. The only
reaction observed was the total oxidation of ethene to CO2 and
H2O. In general, under the same conditions (temperature, hy-
drocarbon, and oxygen partial pressure), the ethane conversion
rate is 2.5 times higher than ethene, indicating the preferential
activation of ethane over the catalyst and supporting the high
observed selectivity and very low decrease in selectivity with
conversion. In addition, the lower ethylene oxidation rate con-
ﬁrms that the activation of the C–H bond, not the reoxidation
of the catalyst, is the rate-determining step, because if the latter
applied, then similar rates would be expected for both hydrocar-
bons. The effect of varying ethene and oxygen partial pressures
on the consumption rate of the reactants and the formation rate
of carbon dioxide is illustrated in Figs. 9A and B, respectively.
The increase in ethene partial pressure brings about a similar
increase on all reaction rates. Oxygen induces a logarithmic
increase on all rates, with this effect diminishing at very high
oxygen concentrations.

4.2.5. Power-law model
Although the power-law model does not provide any funda-
mental information on the reaction mechanism, it is often very
useful from an engineering standpoint for directly evaluating
the effect of the operation variables on reactor performance.
As discussed in Section 4.1, the reaction network consists of
three reactions: (1) the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to
ethene, (2) the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide, and
(3) the consecutive oxidation of ethene to carbon dioxide. The
rate of each of these reactions can be expressed in the form
ri = ki(PHC)a(PO2)b.
The kinetic parameters were calculated in a stepwise man-
ner. The parameters for the oxidation of ethene [reaction (3)]
were estimated directly from data derived from experiments
with ethene/oxygen as the feed. These parameters were then
considered constant, and the kinetic parameters for reactions
(1) and (2) were obtained by ﬁtting all data obtained with
ethane/oxygen mixtures as the feed, using the procedure de-
scribed in Section 3. The kinetic parameters, with the 95% con-
ﬁdence intervals, obtained for the power-law model, denoted as
the PL model, are tabulated in Table 2.
Despite the power-law model’s simplicity, it adequately pre-
dicts the main trends of the reaction and provides a good ﬁtting
of the experimental results. The total oxidation reactions of both
ethane and produced ethene to CO2 have a much lower rate
than the oxydehydrogenation reaction, conforming to the high
selectivity recorded over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. On all three
reactions, the power on the hydrocarbon (ethane or ethene) par-
tial pressure is around 0.5. Concerning the effect of oxygen
concentration in the feed, we can see that in the case of the oxy-
dehydrogenation reaction and secondary oxidation of produced
ethene, oxygen has a lower effect on the reaction rates, with
similar power for oxygen on both reactions, ranging between
0.2 and 0.3. In contrast, in the primary oxidation of ethene to
carbon dioxide, oxygen plays the dominant role, with almost
ﬁrst-order dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen concentra-
tion. Furthermore, the apparent activation energy for the ethane
oxidation to CO2 is lower than the activation energies of the two
other reactions; therefore, the selectivity to CO2 is expected to
decrease with increasing temperature.
4.2.6. Mechanistic models
The models developed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane to ethene over Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides were based on
the MVK redox mechanism, according to the mechanistic in-
dications derived from the isotopic and transient experiments
presented in the preceding sections. Brieﬂy, the SSITKA exper-
iments with labeled 18O2 conﬁrmed the participation of catalyst
oxygen in both the selective and unselective steps of the reac-
tion sequence, a conclusion supported by the increased isotopic
exchange activity observed in the presence of the hydrocarbon
indicating that ethane reduces the catalytic surface and cre-
ates oxygen vacancies, readily replenished by gaseous dioxy-
gen. In addition, preliminary ﬁtting of the kinetic data con-
sidering Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms and Eley–Rideal
schemes demonstrated the inadequacy of these models to de-
scribe the catalytic performance, with either large RMSE values
or out-of-range kinetic parameters, thus reinforcing the assump-
tion of a redox reaction mechanism. Furthermore, ethane and
ethylene TPD experiments (not shown) demonstrated no con-
siderable adsorption of either hydrocarbon on the catalyst sur-
face, and hence it is assumed that either a quasi-equilibrated
weak molecular adsorption of ethane exists or that ethane re-
acts directly from the gas phase, as has been proposed pre-
viously [17]. No signiﬁcant accumulation of hydrocarbon or
carbonaceous intermediates/deposits on the catalytic surface
was observed during transient experiments in which ethane and
oxygen were suppressed from the reacting feed. A delay was
observed only for the H2O transient, signifying a water adsorp-
tion step, consistent with the mild inhibition effects of water
observed on ethane ODH rates in this work and previous stud-
ies [11,12,17].
Based on all of the foregoing, we formulated four basic mod-
els of the MVK mechanism with several variants, as described
next. The reactions and rate equations for each model are tab-
ulated in Table 3. It should be stressed that the objective was
to account for the experimental observations with a minimum
number of reactions steps and kinetic parameters; therefore, the
reactions presented in Table 3 do not necessarily consider el-
ementary steps, but rather consider a sequence of steps. In all
models, ethane and ethylene reverse reactions were not consid-
ered, given that the equilibrium of oxidation reactions is on the
product side. Because water was found to inhibit the ODH rate,
the water adsorption/desorption step was considered reversible
and quasi-equilibrated, with the desorption rate constant ex-
pressed by the ratio of the adsorption rate constant (ki) and
equilibrium constant (Ki). The reoxidation of the active centers
by gaseous dioxygen was considered irreversible, because no
formation of cross-labelled oxygen species was detected under
reaction conditions. As described in Section 4.3.5, the kinetic
parameters for ethylene oxidation were obtained separately by
ﬁtting data with ethylene/oxygen as the feed and were then con-
sidered constant for estimating the rest of the model parameters.
Ethylene oxidation was best ﬁtted assuming a reaction order of
2 with respect to the concentration of oxidized sites (reaction 3
in Table 3) and a 0.5-order rate equation with respect to oxygen
in the reoxidation of reduced sites (reaction 5 in Table 3).

4.2.6.1. Model MVa
This model assumes a single type of
active site [M–O] for all selective and unselective reactions.
A reaction order of 1 (Model MVa1) or 2 (Model MVa2) with
respect to the concentration of oxidized sites was postulated for
the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The reaction order for
the primary oxidation of ethane to CO2 was taken as 2, whereas
a 0.5-order rate equation with respect to oxygen in the reoxida-
tion of reduced sites was considered.
4.2.6.2. Model MVb
Selective oxidation and primary and
secondary total oxidation reactions are ascribed to two differ-
ent types of active sites, [M–O] and [T–O], respectively. The
reaction orders with respect to the concentration of the active
sites was taken to be 1 for the selective reactions and 2 for
the combustion reactions, with 0.5 order for oxygen in the re-
oxidation of the unselective sites and 0.5 (Model MVb1) or 1
(Model MVb2) for the reoxidation of the selective centers. Be-
cause water was found to affect only the ethylene formation
rate, adsorption/desorption of water only on selective sites was
considered.
4.2.6.3. Model MVc
In this model, two types of actives sites
are again considered, with sites [M–O] responsible for the ox-
idative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and secondary
overoxidation of ethylene to CO2 and sites [T–O] active for the
direct combustion of ethane to CO2. The reaction order with
respect to the concentration of unselective [T–O] sites was set
to 2, whereas in the reoxidation reactions, the order for oxygen
was taken as 0.5 for reaction (5) and 1 for reaction (6). Several
alternatives were considered for the order with respect to the
concentration of type [M–O] sites in the ODH reaction (1) and
ethylene overoxidation reaction (3), taken as 1 in both reactions
(Model MVc1), 2 (Model MVc2), and 1 and 2 (Model MVc3).
Adsorption/desorption of water was again considered only on
type [M–O] sites.
4.2.6.4. Model MVd
This model has two types of active sites,
I [M–O] and II [T–O]. On type I sites, all reactions (selective
and nonselective) occur, whereas on type II sites, only direct
oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide occurs. The reaction order
with respect to the concentration of oxidized sites is taken as
1 for the ODH reaction and 2 for all total oxidation reactions,
whereas the reaction order with respect to oxygen is 0.5 for type
I sites and 1 for type II sites.
4.2.7. Assessment of mechanistic models
To keep the computational time at a reasonable level, as a
ﬁrst approximation the water adsorption/desorption step [reac-
tion (4) in all models] was not taken into account. The assump-
tion of a negligible effect of water is reasonable because the
kinetic data used for the ﬁtting procedure were obtained un-
der differential conditions with very low conversion levels, and
thus the amount of water formed under the conditions of the ki-
netic experiments was too low to have any substantial impact
on the reaction. Table 4 lists the RMSE of the regression and
the R2, adjusted on the residual degrees of freedom, for each
of the models described above. A close inspection of the table

shows that best ﬁt is achieved with model MVc2, which consid-
ers the presence of two types of active sites: type I, responsible
for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type
II, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.
After model MVc2 was selected as the one that most ade-
quately describes the kinetic data, the water adsorption/desorp-
tion step on selective sites I [reaction (4) in Table 3] was con-
sidered and was included in the reaction network of the model,
as shown in Table 3. Taking into account the water effect im-
proved the ﬁt, resulting in a higher R2 value. The estimated
kinetic parameters, with the 95% conﬁdence intervals, obtained
for the MVc2 model are tabulated in Table 5. The value of
adsorption enthalpy estimated for water adsorption lies in a rea-
sonable range and is in good agreement with reported values for
ethane oxidation over Mo–V–Nb–Pd–O catalysts [50]. Fig. 10
compares experimental and simulated data for all data points
included in the parameter estimation. The parity plots do not
show any systematic deviations, with all points equally spread
around the diagonal line, indicating that the deviations are due
to experimental, not model-based, error.
The superiority of this model supports the kinetic consid-
erations described above and the indications derived from the
power-law model. The different effect of H2O on the formation
rate of ethylene and carbon dioxide can only be explained by
two different sites for selective and primary oxidation reactions,
as is conﬁrmed here by the inadequacy of the models consider-
ing only one type of active site for describing the catalytic data.
In the dominant model, the reaction order with respect to the
concentration of oxidized sites is 2 for all reactions, substan-
tiating the indication that all reactions proceed via a common
ethane intermediate. In addition, the similar dependence of the
rate of ethene formation and ethene overoxidation to CO2 on
the oxygen pressure and the different behavior exhibited in the
direct oxidation of ethane to CO2 (which implies that the ﬁrst

two reactions occur on the same type of sites, whereas the lat-
ter reaction occurs on a different active center) is validated by
the optimum ﬁt achieved with model MVc2. Based on the in-
dications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, ethane
ODH and ethene overoxidation occur on strongly bonded lattice
O2−species, whereas ethane combustion occurs on the limited
amount of nonstoichiometric O−species remaining on the sur-
face after incorporation of Nb.
The estimated activation energies for the dominant model,
shown in Table 5, indicate that carbon dioxide formation is fa-
vored at low temperatures, with its main origin being the total
oxidation of ethane. As the reaction temperature increases, the
formed carbon dioxide also results from the overoxidation of
formed ethylene. Therefore, there seems to be an optimum op-
erating temperature window for the ODH reaction in which
the temperature is not too low to favor the ethane total oxi-
dation and not too high to enhance the oleﬁn overoxidation.
Furthermore, the preferential afﬁnity of the Ni–Nb–O catalyst
to ethane rather than ethylene, resulting in the high selectivity
values recorded over the catalytic material, is reﬂected in the ki-
netic parameters, where the oxidation of ethene exhibits both a
much lower pre-exponential factor and higher activation energy
than the reactions in which ethane participates.
The estimated parameters for a certain kinetic model can
also be evaluated by analyzing the conditional joint parameter
likelihood regions, as suggested previously [50,51]. The cal-
culated conditional joint parameter likelihood regions of the
kinetic parameters given in Table 5 for 99, 95, 80, and 50 %
conﬁdence levels are shown in Fig. 11. The range of the ki-
netic parameters presented in this ﬁgure is between zero and
twice the estimated values. It should be mentioned that the ki-
netic parameters for the ethylene overoxidation reaction (k3) are
not included in the joint parameter likelihood regions, because
they were obtained from separate experiments with an ethyl-
ene/oxygen feed and were kept constant for the estimation of
the rest of the parameters. For linear models, the conﬁdence re-
gions have elliptical form [50]. For the dominant kinetic model,
MV2c, this elliptical proﬁle is seen for the parameter pairs
k1/k2, k1/k5, k2/k4, and k4/k5, whereas the rest of the contour
plots deviate from this shape, indicating considerable nonlin-
earity. The kinetic parameter for the activation of ethane to
ethylene (k1) exhibits the narrowest likelihood region, suggest-
ing that this step is the most signiﬁcant one. Furthermore, all
plots of K6 versus the other parameters look similar, with con-
tours open in the direction of both low and high values. This
indicates that the adsorption of water on the catalytic sites is of
relatively low signiﬁcance under the experimental conditions of
the kinetic experiments, consistent with the observed mild inhi-
bition induced by water.
A model based on mechanistic considerations should be able
to reliably predict the catalyst performance under operating
variables far from the range of experimental conditions used

in the kinetic studies. Therefore, our kinetic model was used
to predict the catalytic performance data of the Ni0.85Nb0.15
catalyst reported previously [5], which were realized under con-
siderably different experimental conditions (i.e., higher tem-
perature, different W/F and reactant partial pressure) than the
kinetic experiments, resulting in high ethane and oxygen con-
version levels. The results of the model simulation (represented
by full lines) and the experimental data (represented by sym-
bols) for ethane and oxygen conversion and ethylene and CO2
selectivity versus temperature are illustrated in Fig. 12. The
model’s excellent ability to predict the catalytic data is ap-
parent. The successful application of model MVc2 proves the
physicochemical sense of the kinetic parameters and ensures
that the underlying mechanistic assumptions are true and cor-
rect.
5. Conclusion
In this work, 18O2-isotopic studies were performed on pure
NiO, which as shown previously [5], exhibits high activity
for converting ethane mainly to CO2, and on Nb-doped NiO
(Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), which demonstrates a very high activ-
ity and selectivity in ethylene production via ethane oxidative
dehydrogenation. Niobium doping was found to signiﬁcantly
decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled
oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric elec-
trophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxi-
dation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds
on both oxides via a MVK mechanism with the participation
of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing sur-
face oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different
oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the differ-

ent product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction.
On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous
oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and
diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic
oxygen species on the surface. Niobium ﬁlls the cationic va-
cancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation,
thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore,
strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, se-
lective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the
catalyst surface. Finally, a kinetic model able to successfully
predict the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst in
considerably different experimental conditions than the kinetic
experiments, was developed. Kinetic modeling indicates that
the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO oc-
curs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the
participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsi-
ble for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and
type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.
Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic exper-
iments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2−
species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount
of nonstoichiometric O−species remaining on the surface after
the incorporation of niobium.
