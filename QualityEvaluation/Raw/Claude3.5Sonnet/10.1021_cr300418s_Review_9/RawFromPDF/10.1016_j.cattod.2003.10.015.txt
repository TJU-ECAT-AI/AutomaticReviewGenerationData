Abstract
Alumina-supported vanadium oxide, VOx/Al2O3, and binary vanadium–antimony oxides, VSbOx/Al2O3, have been tested
in the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide and characterized by SBET, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and CO2 pulse methods. VSbOx/Al2O3 exhibited enhanced cat-
alytic activity and especially on-stream stability compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Incorporation of antimony into VOx/Al2O3
increased dispersion of active VOx species, enhanced redox properties of the systems and formed a new mixed vanadium–
antimony oxide phase in the most catalytically efﬁcient V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 system.

1. Introduction
Styrene, an important monomer for synthetic poly-
mers, is commercially produced by the vapor phase
catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EBDH).
This process is carried out at high-temperature
(550–650 ◦C) with large excess of superheated steam.
However, it is thermodynamically limited and energy
consuming. Use of traditional oxidant—oxygen—
allows to overcome the thermodynamic limitation,
and, consequently, to operate at lower temperatures
with an exothermic reaction. Combined EBDH pro-
cess with the use of oxygen to oxidize hydrogen as

a co-product and thus to displace the dehydrogena-
tion equilibrium has been commercialized [1], but a
process with direct use of oxygen for oxidative de-
hydrogenation has not been realized yet because of a
signiﬁcant loss of styrene selectivity by the produc-
tion of carbon oxides and oxygenates [2]. Therefore,
another desirable oxidant has sought for a long time.
Recently, several attempts were carried out to use
carbon dioxide as an oxidant for EBDH and at the
same time to utilize effectively CO2, the global warm-
ing gas [3–26]. It has been reported that carbon diox-
ide could play a role as the soft oxidant as well as the
diluent in the EBDH reaction with CO2 (CO2-EBDH),
different from steam and oxygen employing as
the diluent and the oxidant, respectively, in the
non-oxidative
and

known as an active component of industrial catalysts
for non-oxidative EBDH process, were mainly used.
Meanwhile, it is known that various V-containing ox-
ide systems, such as V–Mg, V–Cr, V–P, V–Mo, V–Sb,
etc. are active and selective in the relative reactions
of selective oxidation, oxidative dehydrogenation and
ammoxidation of lower parafﬁns and alkylaromatics
[27–35], including the oxidative EBDH with oxy-
gen [32–35]. However, V-containing catalysts for
the CO2-EBDH reaction have been reported only by
few groups [13–16,23–26]. Suzuki and co-workers
[13–15] reported that active carbon-supported vana-
dium catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity in EBDH
to give styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide.
However, it suffered from severe catalyst deactiva-
tion due to coke deposition. We also recently re-
ported high selectivity (>95%) and catalytic activity
of alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) in the
CO2-EBDH along with some arguments in favor of
the carbon dioxide action as the soft oxidant [23–26].
Among a series of tested additives to VOx/Al2O3
catalyst, antimony oxide was found to be the best sec-
ond additional component improving the VOx/Al2O3
catalyst activity and stability [26]. The objective of
this work is to study the nature of promotional effect
and role of antimony on the improved VSbOx/Al2O3
catalyst in the CO2-EBDH reaction.
2. Experimental
V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts were prepared by im-
pregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich 19,996-6,
SBET = 121 m2/g) with aqueous solutions of am-
monium metavanadate and antimony (III) chloride
(Aldrich) along with tartaric acid. Subscript numbers
of V and Sb in the formulae of VSbOx/Al2O3 indicate
the atomic percentages of the element in the supported
binary system. The impregnated samples were dried
at 120 ◦C and then calcined in air at 600 ◦C for 4 h.
The total amount of the supported oxide component
was 20 wt.%.
The calcined samples were characterized by means
of BET speciﬁc surface area (SSA) measurements,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR), and CO2 pulse method. SSA
data were calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms
using a Micrometrics model ASAP 2400. XRD pat-
terns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-3B diffrac-
tometer using monochromatic Cu K radiation. The
X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using
an ESCALAB MK II spectrometer provided with a
hemispherical electron analyzer and Al anode X-ray
exciting source (Al K = 1487.6 eV). The binding
energies (BE) were referred to the adventitious C 1s
peak at 284.6 eV. For the Sb 3d core level spectra,
the less intense Sb 3d3/2 peak of the Sb 3d doublet
was taken for calculation based on the overlapping
of the principal Sb 3d5/2 peak with the much more
intense O1s peak. V 2p3/2 peak ﬁtting was performed
using symmetrical Gaussian–Lorenzian (80/20) lines
with the following constraints for all oxidation states:
non-linear Shirley background subtraction, an in-
tensity ratio of V 2p3/2 to V 2p1/2 of 2.19, and a
doublet separation (V 2p1/2–V 2p3/2) of 7.3–7.6 eV.
Temperature-programmed reduction of the catalysts
with hydrogen (5 vol.% H2 in helium) was performed
from 100 to 900 ◦C with heating rate of 10 ◦C/min
in a conventional ﬂow system equipped with a TCD
detector for monitoring of the H2 consumption. The
samples (100 mg) were previously calcined in a ﬂow
of air at 600 ◦C for 1 h and then cooled down to
100 ◦C. In order to estimate the re-oxidizability with
carbon dioxide of the pre-reduced catalysts, CO2 pulse
experiments were conducted at 600 ◦C in the quartz
reactor with 200 mg of the catalyst. Prior to these
experiments, the catalysts were partially reduced at
600 ◦C for 30 min in 5 vol.% H2 in He ﬂow. Pulses of
carbon dioxide (250 l CO2) were injected into inert
helium ﬂow (30 cm3/min) using gas sampling valve
installed between the sample inlet and GC column.
The catalytic tests in the CO2-EBDH reaction were
carried out in a micro-activity test unit (Zeton, MAT
2000) with a ﬁxed bed isothermal reactor under atmo-
spheric pressure. A catalyst sample of 1 g was placed
into reactor on a quartz wool support. Ethylben-
zene was introduced by a syringe pump with a feed
8.2 mmol/h and supplied into the reactor with a carrier
gas mixture CO2 and N2 (total ﬂow rate: 45 cm3/min).
Nitrogen was used as inert diluent component as well
as the internal standard for gas analysis. Gas com-
ponents of the reaction mixture (H2, N2, CO, CH4,
CO2) were analyzed by the TCD of the on-line gas
chromatograph. Liquid products (benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, styrene) were collected each 30 min

and analyzed by FID of the GC. Catalyst behavior was
characterized by EB conversion degree, X(EB), initial
yield of styrene after 1 h on-stream, Y1, selectivity to
styrene, S(ST), and relative loss of styrene yield after
4 h time-on-stream, RLSY(4) = Y1 −Y4/Y1.
3. Results
Table 1 summarizes the catalytic behaviors of
alumina-supported vanadium oxide and V–Sb ox-
ide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH reaction at 595 ◦C.
For this reaction, styrene is a main product. Only
small amounts of benzene and toluene are obtained
as by-products in the condensate along with traces
of methane in gaseous products. All catalysts stud-
ied demonstrate high selectivity to styrene (>95%).
The V/Al catalyst exhibits initially high styrene yield
(Y1 ∼71%). As the reaction proceeds, catalytic
activity decreases signiﬁcantly. This was mainly
due to coke formation, as evidenced by intense
COx-evolution to give the recovered activity during
the reoxidation of the used catalyst in an air stream
at more than 550 ◦C; over-reduction of vanadium
oxidation state also takes place. The addition of
antimony oxide, which is almost inactive by itself
[26], into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene
yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable cat-
alytic performance. Among the VSb/Al systems, the
V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is found to be the best one.
The XRD patterns of fresh and used V/Al and
VSb/Al catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. Besides the
weak diffraction lines of Al2O3, the distinct reﬂec-
tions of the V2O5-phase, shcherbinaite (41–1426 ﬁle
in the JCPDS database), are observed in the fresh
V/Al. After catalytic testing, V2O5-type phase trans-
forms into V2O3, karelianite (34–0187). On the other

hand, the fresh VSb/Al catalysts do not contain crys-
talline V2O5-type phases, but the XRD pattern of the
fresh V0.43Sb0.57/Al points to the presence of a mixed
vanadium–antimony oxide phase, which is assignable
to V1.1Sb0.9O4 by the appearance of the most inten-
sive peak 2Θ = 26.687◦(47–1496 ﬁle in the JCPDS
database). This phase remains in the used catalyst.

and Sb components and results of deconvolution of

The BEs of V 2p3/2 (517.2–517.6 eV) for the fresh
V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts are corresponded to V5+
species [36,37]; the incorporation of antimony into
V/Al increases the BE (and the oxidation state) of
surface vanadium species. All VSb/Al catalysts show
almost the same BEs for Sb 3d3/2, identifying as the

these samples remain unchanged after catalytic runs.
BEs of V 2p3/2 peaks for the VSb/Al catalysts remain
almost unchanged after catalytic measurement, but
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the V 2p3/2
for the used V/Al catalyst is signiﬁcantly increased
relative to the fresh one, i.e., from 1.90 to 3.16 eV,
revealing the notable reduction of surface vanadium
species during the reaction. To interpret the change of
FWHM of the V 2p3/2 peaks after reaction, they were
ﬁtted for V5+, V4+ and V3+ components using the
same method performed by the previous work [30].
The results of deconvolution point out that the incor-
poration of antimony into the V/Al catalyst increases
the content of V5+ species very much as compared

to that of the V/Al catalyst and, moreover, the used
V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst practically does not contain
V3+ species as the deeply reduced oxidation state.
H2-TPR proﬁles of the V/Al and V0.43Sb0.57/Al
catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The reduction pat-
tern of V/Al sample comprises three peaks, i.e., two
intense and sharp high-temperature peaks centered at
663 and 783 ◦C and a low-temperature peak centered
at 500 ◦C. The high-temperature peaks are similar to
those detected in the literature [38–40], which are
attributed to the reduction of bulk vanadium pentox-
ide to V6O13 at 663 ◦C and to V2O4 at 783 ◦C. The
low-temperature peak is analogous to the one that was
assigned to the reduction of supported V2O5-phase
in the VOx/-Al2O3 system [41]. Judging from the

result, it is reasonable that the high-temperature peaks
correspond to the reduction of three-dimensional
V2O5, whereas the low-temperature peak corresponds
to the surface vanadium oxide dispersed on the sup-
port. For the H2-TPR proﬁle of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al
catalyst, the highest-temperature peak at 783 ◦C dis-
appears completely and the intensity of the second
one centered at 655 ◦C decreases greatly. Instead,
the low-temperature peak becomes the dominant one.
The broadening of this peak implies a higher hetero-
geneity and reducibility of vanadium species. These
H2-TPR data clearly reveal that incorporation of the
antimony promoter into V/Al increases the reducibil-
ity of surface vanadium oxide and the amount of
mobile oxygen species.
The amounts of CO produced according to se-
quential injections of CO2 pulses at 600 ◦C onto the
pre-reduced catalysts are plotted in Fig. 3. The re-
activity of the catalysts for the CO2 pulse reaction
reﬂects the re-oxidizability of the reduced surfaces.
The formation of CO over the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst
is notably large during the ﬁrst several CO2 pulses
compared with that over the V/Al catalyst, implying
that the partially reduced V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is
much easily interacted with CO2 compared with the
partially reduced V/Al catalyst. Moreover, when the
total amount of CO produced up to 45 CO2 pulses
is estimated on the basis of the content of V2O5 in
the catalysts, the data clearly point out the much
high re-oxidizability of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst,
i.e., 0.268 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V0.43Sb0.57/Al vs.
0.041 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V/Al.
4. Discussion
Catalytic results of Table 1 reveal that the catalytic
activity is mainly determined by supported vanadium
oxide species while the catalyst stability is controlled
by antimony oxide. Although the initial styrene yields
over Al2O3-supported V–Sb oxide catalysts contain-
ing a medium level of Sb-content are slightly higher,
their activities do not differ substantially when they
are compared among themselves and with VOx/Al2O3.
However, the catalyst stability is much improved by
the addition of the antimony promoter and its stabil-
ity is much dependent on the V/Sb ratio in the cat-
alysts. Among the supported V–Sb oxide catalysts,
V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 is the most active and stable one.
XRD data shows the difference between the dis-
persion of the supported VOx-component in the V/Al
and VSb/Al catalysts. The fresh V/Al sample contains
crystalline V2O5-phase, but this phase is transformed
into V2O3 phase during the reaction. However, active
210
M.-S. Park et al. / Catalysis Today 87 (2003) 205–212
VOx-component in the fresh and used VSb/Al cata-
lysts is amorphous. The VOx species was consistently
observed only in a V0.9Sb0.1Ox/Al2O3 system with
high V-concentration by means of laser Raman spec-
troscopy [42], which is very sensitive to the presence
of VOx species [43]. Raman spectra (not presented
here) of the fresh sample showed a high background
and only the bands corresponding to V2O5-phase with
very low intensity [42]. However, after the catalytic
test, no such a band was detected in the spectrum of
the used sample, implying that the VOx-phase looses
its crystallinity and the oxide becomes spread on the
surface as amorphous vanadium oxides. Therefore, it
is concluded that VOx active component of the VSb/Al
catalysts is well dispersed on the support surface dif-
ferent from the V/Al catalyst.
Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vana-
dium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox
properties of vanadium species [28,29,44–46]. It is
generally accepted that active sites for these systems
are to be the surface vanadium cations operating ac-
cording to a Mars–van-Krevelen redox mechanism.
It can consequently be suggested that the easier re-
dox cycle is an important factor to design the more
effective catalyst [35]. The results of the study of
oxidative dehydrogenation of lower parafﬁns over
VOx/Al2O3 and V0.9Sb0.1Ox/Al2O3 catalysts by dif-
ferential scanning calorimetry show that reaction
occurs via a stepwise redox mechanism with the par-
ticipation of lattice oxygen from the catalyst [47].
When the supported VOx-component is modiﬁed with
antimony, the amount of reactive oxygen is increased
and reduction–reoxidation cycles of vanadium ion
proceed more efﬁciently. At the same time, the addi-
tion of antimony decreases the rate of coke formation
[30,47,48], which explains the observed improvement
in catalytic stability.
There is no doubt about redox nature of catalytic
action of our V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts in the
CO2-EBDH reaction. The surface and even the bulk
of unstable V/Al catalyst are reduced strongly under
reaction conditions: V2O5-type phase transforms into
V2O3, and the latter is able to be reoxidized to V2O5
in a ﬂow of air restoring its yellow color and initial
activity. It is worthwhile to note that V2O3 was the
only vanadium species observed in XRD patterns of
both fresh and used samples of vanadium oxide/active
carbon catalyst, which showed very low stability in
the CO2-EBDH [13]. Deep vanadium reduction ex-
tent from V5+ to V3+ also seems to be one of the
main reasons of the deactivation of our V/Al catalyst
because the reoxidation of these strongly reduced
active sites can become the rate-limiting step. This
was conﬁrmed by pulse and DSC techniques for
the V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst for oxydehydrogenation of
ethane [49]. In propane ammoxidation on V–Sb oxide
catalysts, Centi et al. [50,51] also reported the rela-
tively low re-oxidizability of the reduced supra-surface
vanadium oxide species which is responsible for the
unselective conversion of propane to carbon oxides,
forming usually from strongly adsorbed organic in-
termediates similar to coke precursors. Datka et al.
[52] suggested that carboxylate species are formed
as coke precursor in carbon oxides atmosphere on
alumina surface. Taking into account the fact that EB
is much stronger reductant than ethane or propane
[45], adsorption of EB on the non-properly regener-
ated active sites could hamper the redox cycle and
become the reason of decreasing of activity of the
V/Al catalyst. The observed enhancement of the cat-
alytic behavior as a result of the addition of antimony
oxide seems to be related with the improved catalyst
reducibility (H2-TPR of Fig. 2) and re-oxidizability
by CO2 (Fig. 3).
The role of antimony in the Sb-poor VSbOx/Al2O3
catalysts could be interpreted as a ‘spillover oxygen
donor’ in the frame of the ‘remote control mechanism’
theory elaborated by Delmon [53]. A key to maximize
catalytic performance of active reducible oxides, such
as MoO3 [54,55] or V2O5 on alumina in the present
work is to stabilize oxide surfaces at high or only
slightly reduced suboxide oxidation state allowing
the reduction–oxidation cycles of catalytic surfaces to
proceed rapidly and smoothly. Addition of ‘spillover
oxygen donor’ phases, like antimony oxide, to the
reducible oxides (‘spillover oxygen acceptor’) con-
tributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which
may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxy-
gen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with
high efﬁciency [54,55]. And it could suppress the
formation of polymeric residues, which are hard to
remove and often become precursors to complete oxi-
dation products [55] and coke [47,48]. The formation
of active oxygen species with the similar nature could
occur during the dissociative adsorption of CO2 [56].
The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component
M.-S. Park et al. / Catalysis Today 87 (2003) 205–212
211
on the support surface also contributed to the better
stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier re-
ducible spread active VOx-component with increased
amounts of mobile lattice oxygen. The most sta-
ble V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst with the XRD-detectable
V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase practically does not contain after
catalytic test (XPS data) deeply reduced vanadium
ion, V3+. This is consistent with the fast reoxidation of
the similar reduced vanadium antimonate phase [51].
5. Conclusions
Antimony oxide was found to be an effective
co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide
catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its
activity and especially on-stream stability. Incorpora-
tion of antimony into VOx/Al2O3 increases dispersion
of the active VOx-component, enhances redox prop-
erties of the systems and forms a new mixed V–Sb
oxide phase V1.1Sb0.9O4 in the most efﬁcient binary
V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 catalyst.
