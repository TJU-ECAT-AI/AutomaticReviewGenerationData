SOMETHING ABOUT SILVER.

pute the enormous quantity of the precious metal that must 
be contained in the oceans of the world; but since the origi­
nal discovery nothing further has been said on the subject. 
In 1849 silver was also found in the blood of several animals, 
especially of the ox, but in aU of these caees the occurrence 
is generally considered to be accidental.

EASY PREPARATION OF CHLORATE OF RARYTA. 
Pure silver can be distilled the same as zinc, but requires 
The production of silver was stated by Wagner; in 1868, to 
It is sometimes important to be able to prepare chloricacid 
for use in the arts, and the most convenient salt for the pur­
pose is chlorate of baryta, as that can be easily decomposed 
by sulphuric acid and ,the chloric acid liberated. Moritz Bran­
dau propoaes the following simple method of procedure: 49 
parts by weight of sulphuric acid, 333 parts of sulphate of 
alumina, 122t parts chlorate of potash are mixed to a thin 
paste in water and gently warmed. The prod 
uct is a solution 
of chloric acid with alum, and excess of SUlphuric acid and 
8ulphate of alumina. When it is entirely cool it is mixed 
with about an equal volume of alcohol and then filtered. The 
alcoholic filtrate is then neutralized with caustic baryta which 
gives us chlorate of baryta in solution, while SUlphate of ba­
ryta is precipitated. 
The chlorate is 
decanted from the 
precipitate and evaporated to expel the excess of alcohol, and 
is then ready for use. 
It could be employed in the prepara­
tion of oxygen gas, but for this purpose would be more ex­
pensive than chlorate of potash. The uses of chl.oric acid 
are not well understood, and a cheap method like the above 
for its production may lead to a more general application of 
this highly interesting compound.

The temperature of fusion of silver is'also a question that 
ha@ occupied the time and attention of chemists for a long 
period and scarcely any two agree; Becquerel puts it at 916° 
Cent. (1680° Fah.) 
The specific gravity of silver ranges between 10'424 and 
10'511, and the mean of 13 determinations was found to be 
10'468-generally it is stated at 10'5. 
It is softer than copper 
and harder than gold; its absolute resistance per cubic centi­
meter is, for cast silver, 5760 Ibs.
, for wire, 6310 to 8270 Ibs.
, 
and for heated wire 3600 to 3900 Ibs. The tenacity of silver 
has been studied by Matthiessen, and can be stated for com­
parison, as follows: alloy of tin and copper, 1 
; gold, 3'6 to 
4'3; copper, 4'3 
; silver, 7'2 
; platinum, 7'2 
; iron, 13 ; steel, 30. 
lt is so ductile that a grain of it can be drawn out 400 feet, 
and it can 
'be hammered into leaves so thin that it would reo 
quire 100,000 of them to IIi.ake a pile an inch in hight. 
Its 
conductivity for heat is to copper in the ratio of 100 to 73'6; 
and for electricity as 1000 to 954. 
Cast silver expands, ac­
cording to Calvert, between 0° and 100° Cent.
, 0'001991 ; and 
its specific heat is 0'05701. 
Although silver is a remarkably 
good conductor of heat, its power of radiation is very small, 
so that a silver vessel ret 
.. 
ins the heat of a liquid contained 
in it longer than any other metal. 
According to Elsner, a mass of silver at thp heat of a porce· 
lain furnace, was entirely volatilized. 
Nearly all of the oxidizable metals precipitate silver from 
its solution. 
Green vitriol or sulphate of iron precipitates it 
readily, and if the liquid be boiled, some of the silver is dis­
solved, but again falls down when the liquid cools. 
Tin and lead act rapidly in a solution of nitrate of silver to 
precipitate the metal; more slowly act osmium, zinc, copper, 
bismuth, antimony, and quicksilver. Phosphorus also reo 
duces salts of silver the same as it does solutions or copper. 
Cadmium is a good metal to substitute for zinc in the reduc­
tion of silver. 
Peroxide of hydrogen at once attacks silver and converts it 
into a s'.lboxide. Cane sugar 
precipitates silver from the nitrate 
upon the addition of ammonia and boiling, but g.ape sugar 
is preferable for this purpose. Silver can be made to take the 
place of potash in ordinary alum, and the double sulphate of 
alumina and silver be produced. 
And this reminds us to 
state that modern chemists call silver a monad and place it in 
the same family with potasshlm and sodium. 
Some years 
ago Dr. Torrey, of New York, discovered a compound of car­
bon and hydrogen with copper, which was produced by the 
passing of ordinary illuminating gas for a long time through 
copper tubes, and was shown to be highly explosive; it has 
recently been found that a similar compound with silver can 
be formed by passing illuminating gas through an ammonia­
cal solution of nitrate of silver; a brown black flocculent pre­
cipitate settles, which, on an anvil, or hee.ted, explodes with 
great violence, leaving finely.divided carbon and metallic sil· 
ver as a residue. 
The analogous 
compound {of copper can be prepared 
in the same way by passing the gas through nitrate of cop­
per. 
It is now kIlown that the explosive powder is a com 
pound of ace-tylene. It is possible that by passing the gas 
issuing from oil wells through the nitrates of silver or cop­
per, this interesting substance could be formed. 
Some years ago there was a report that all of the copper­
bottomed ships brought home silver from the salt water of

places where growth is not going on. Thus much about the 
growth of bone has been learnt by feeding pigs with madder, 
whereby it has been fO"ll.l
d that bones grow chiefly at the 
ends of the shafts, and not at the Cf.>nter of the bone, or at 
the joints. After the age of twenty-five has been passed, the 
bones will give on examination little or no clue to the age at 
death of the individual whQ owned them, so in the recent 
case of the murder of a woman at Norwich, the medical men 
we.re not so much to blame as the newspapers supposed, 
when they were unable to give a clue as to the age of the 
deceased, from an examination of the bones.

WHAT ARE CONDIMENTS' 
Professor Fonssagriv8s, in his new treatise upon dietetics, 
gives us some curious information upon the use of condi­
ments in France and in England, and includes under that 
term a somewhat surprising list of things; as, for example, 
magnesia, Vichy waters, bicarbonate of soda, and Gregory's 
powder. 
He assures his readers that this last mixture is

habitually 
used 
in 
England as a 
condi. 
ment, and universally 
enjoys a high reputa­
tion. 
A writer III
 the 
Medical T'me8, 
com· 
menting upon the dif­
ficulty of accurately 
defining a condiment, 
observes: "We recol. 
lect hearing a hospital 
nlirse 
remark, whell 
a patient complained 
that he did not like 
his beef-tea out of the 
same unwashed cup which had just held his medicine, that it 
was impossible for the authorities to provide him with a sep­
arate receptacle for e'l.ch of his condiments.
" 
The professor's 
list does not comprise what, according to the medieval adage, 
is the truest condiment-hunger; but for the comfort of read­
ers who gave no appetite, he conclusively proves the benefit 
which would arise in their case from the habitual use of pep­
aine.
