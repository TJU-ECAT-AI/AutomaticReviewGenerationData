The electronic structure of oxygen and nickel vacancies at the surface of NiO(100) has been investigated theoretically by means of density functional theory (DFT) comparing plane wave density functional theory with the Hubbard correction DFT+U with atomic-orbital-hybrid-functional (20% exact-exchange) calculations. The two approaches provide a similar description of the nature of the oxygen vacancy. At variance with the same defect center in MgO, where two electrons are trapped in the vacancy, on NiO the charge is more delocalized, partly over the Ni ions around the vacancy, the rest either trapped in the vacancy or delocalized over other Ni ions. Concerning the nickel vacancy, both methods clearly show that the removal of a neutral Ni atom does not result in the oxidation of other nickel ions from
Ni
2
+
to
Ni
3
+
but rather in the formation of two holes in the O
2
p
valence band. However, the description is slightly different with the approaches, the hybrid functional indicates that the holes are essentially localized on the oxygen ions nearest to the vacancy, while they result much more delocalized from the

U
calculation. Comparison with the corresponding results, obtained with the two methods for the case of the Mg vacancy in MgO, suggests that the
DFT
+
U
approach does not adequately correct for the self-interaction of the unpaired electrons in this case. However, the overall picture that emerges clearly from the present calculations is that both defects affect the electronic structure in a much wider region in NiO than in MgO.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nickel oxide is a material of considerable technological importance for its chemical and electronic properties and it is also of fundamental interest as the prototype of magnetic insulators. As other transition metal oxides, it finds applications in a variety of fields, from spintronics to surface chemistry and catalysis. Recently, the theoretical interest towards this oxide has been extended to its surface and even to ultrathin films grown on a metal support.1–3 However, very little attention has been given to its defect structure, and, in particular, to the nature of vacancies, both cationic and anionic. In an experimental study of NiO(100) single crystals scanning tunnelling microscopy images of point defects have been reported and interpreted as due to Ni vacancies.4 To the best of our knowledge, among the few studies reported so far on the electronic structure of vacancies at the NiO(100) surface, only one is theoretical. In a pioneering work, the nature of the oxygen vacancy in NiO(100) was studied using cluster models and correlated wave functions based on the complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach.5 It was concluded that the electrons associated to the missing oxygen are not localized in the center of the vacancy, as in MgO, but are distributed over the Ni ions around the cavity. This result was used to interpret x-ray photoemission spectra of a NiO surface, where O vacancies were created by
Ar

sputtering.6,7 The present computational investigation, aimed at the characterization of the O and Ni vacancies at the NiO(100) surface, fills therefore a gap of information on a subject of topical interest. The scarce theoretical attention given in the past to this problem may appear surprising if we consider that (1) NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with a composition
Ni
0.999
O
(Ref. 8) and is, therefore, intrinsically defective, and (2) that literally hundreds of papers have been dedicated to point defects in MgO. MgO is an oxide strictly related to NiO, since it has the same NaCl-type structure, a very similar lattice constant, and forms with NiO a wide range of solid solutions (see, e.g., Ref. 9 and references therein). The main reason is that an accurate quantum mechanical simulation of NiO is a difficult task. The narrow
3
d
band of transition metal compounds such as NiO corresponds to a strong on-site Coulomb repulsion that cannot be properly described with standard spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) approaches. Only the use of hybrid functionals,10,11 of the so called
DFT
+
U
method,12,13 or of sophisticated many-body approaches14 leads to a correct solution corresponding to a localization of the Ni
3
d
states, to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering, and to an insulating ground state of NiO. The former two techniques are those used in this work.
To introduce the subject, it can be useful to make reference to the two types of vacancy at the MgO (100) surface, whose electronic and structural properties are well known from the literature. The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves in that case a cavity with two trapped electrons (neutral F center);9,15 that of a neutral magnesium atom leads to the formation of two
O
−
radical anions next neighbors of the vacancy in front of each other.15,16 This result is related to the high ionicity of the material, hence to the high value of the Madelung potential and to the nonreducible character of the oxide. The parallel processes in NiO can follow a similar route or completely different mechanisms. As other transition metal oxides, NiO is a reducible system where the
Ni
2
+
(
3
d

)
ion can easily change to
Ni
+
(
3
d
9
)
configuration. The removal of a neutral oxygen atom can therefore result in electrons trapped in the cavity, as in MgO, in the reduction of two or more Ni ions, or in a combination of the two. Symmetrically, the removal of a neutral nickel atom can involve either the oxidation of oxide anions close to the vacancy, as in MgO, or of other Ni ions which could change their oxidation state from
Ni
2
+
(
3
d

)
to
Ni
3
+
(

)
⁠, or a mixing of the two.
In order to shed light on these points we have performed DFT calculations using two periodic supercell approaches, the
DFT
+
U
method as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulating package (VASP) code17,18 and the hybrid DFT approach as implemented in the CRYSTAL06 code.19 The same set of combined approaches,
DFT
+
U
and hybrid DFT, has been used recently to study
Ni
O
∕
Ag
(

)
thin films.1 The use of the two methods is justified by the fact that they tackle the problem of an incorrect description of electron localization using different strategies, and only if the indications provided are univocal the results can be accepted with some confidence. The importance of including a fraction
α
of exact exchange to properly account for the properties of NiO has been recently underlined,10 and the standard choice
(
α
≈
20
%
)
has been shown to perform satisfactorily. On the other hand, the appropriate
α
to be used in DFT calculations for magnetic systems depends to some extent on the peculiar problem to be solved. In a recent study of
Cu

(a long-lived species in the gas phase) Poater et al.20 compared the order of stabilities of the different electronic states of that dication, as resulting from hybrid-exchange DFT calculations with different
α
’s, with that obtained from accurate post-Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations, and found that
α
values as large as 50% had to be used in order to obtain good overall agreement; with
α
⩽
20
%
⁠, delocalization of the electron hole was excessively favored, resulting in a wrong order of stabilities of the electronic states. This question is reconsidered below.
It is shown that while for some aspects the two methods provide univocal indications, for others (notably the distribution of the holes around the Ni vacancy) the results are still controversial. However, the overall picture that emerges clearly from the present calculations is that both defects affect the electronic structure in a much wider region in NiO than in MgO.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
The
DFT
+
U
approach12,21,22 combines the standard DFT Hamiltonian with a Hubbard Hamiltonian. In the approach of Dudarev et al.,12 the latter depends on the difference
U
eff
=
U
−
J
⁠, the parameter
U
describing the energy increase for an extra electron on a particular site, and the parameter
J
representing the screened exchange energy.13 Here we used
U
=
6.3
eV
⁠, which leads to reasonable values of the physical parameters of interest, and
J
=
1.0
eV
⁠, so to obtain an effective Hubbard parameter,
U
eff
=
5.3
eV
⁠. The
DFT
+
U
calculations have been performed with the VASP code,17,18 which uses a periodic approach with plane waves as a basis set. The electron-ion interaction is described by the projected augmented wave method.23 The approach of Dudarev et al. in the generalized gradient approximation and the Perdew-Wang 91 (PW91) functional24 have been adopted. The kinetic energy cutoff has been set to
400
eV
⁠. Four-layer slabs in
2
×
2
and
4
×
4
supercells containing 32 and 128 atoms, respectively, with a vacuum of
12
Å
to separate the slabs, have been used for the calculations of the NiO(100) surface, which allows AFM ordering to be maintained. The lattice parameter of the unit cell is the bulk’s optimization one,
a
0
=
4.19
Å
(⁠
4.17
Å
is the experimental value). Integrations in the first Brillouin zone were performed using a Monkhorst-Pack grid of
(
3
×
3
×
1
)
k
points; for the total energy calculations, we used a Gaussian smearing with
σ
=
0.2
eV
⁠. The two surface layers were relaxed until the forces were less than
0.01
eV
∕
Å
⁠.
The hybrid-exchange calculations were performed with CRYSTAL06 (Ref. 19) which adopts a basis set of Gaussian-type functions (GTFs). The semi-infinite NiO(100) surface has been modeled by a slab periodic in the
x
and
y
directions and of finite thickness (four layers as in VASP calculations) with the vacancy site only at one side of the slab. The same
2
×
2
and
4
×
4
supercells have been used as in VASP calculations. While the same all-electron 8-511G functions have been used to describe the
O
2
−
ion as in previous studies of epitaxial NiO on the Ag(100) and Pd(100) surfaces,25,26 the basis set for Ni has been slightly modified. In the new basis set, the Hay-Wadt small core pseudopotential for Ni (Ref. 27) has been associated with a
2
s
∕
2
p
∕
2
d
contraction of GTFs: this is derived from the standard Hay-Wadt double-zeta basis by removing the most diffuse
s
and
p
functions, and reoptimizing for
Ni
+
the
d
and
p
exponent of the outermost Gaussian (⁠
α
p
=
0.25
and
α
d
=
0.2836
⁠). This modification has been found necessary since the nickel basis set used in previous calculations, tailored for perfect
Ni
2
+
O
2
−
ionic systems, does not allow changes in configuration and delocalization of electron density. For the O vacancy case, a
2
s
p
basis set was placed at the center of the vacancy to favor the description of electron localization. Further details can be found in the CRYSTAL database.28 The standard Becke hybrid-exchange functional29 with 20% of exact Fock exchange, together with a Perdew-Wang correlation functional30 (B3PW) adequately describe the NiO electronic structure.10 For the reasons exposed in the Introduction, test calculations have been performed in selected cases with larger percentages of exact exchange, up to 50%. Geometry optimizations have been carried out using analytical gradients, but only for the oxygen vacancy in the ferromagnetic (FM) phase. The AFM wave function has been determined on the optimized FM structure because of the heavy computational cost required to perform an AFM optimization. All the first and second neighbor atoms around the oxygen vacancy have been allowed to relax. All other atomic coordinates have been kept fixed at the optimized bulk values (lattice parameter
4.19
Å
⁠). No relaxation has been performed for the Ni vacancy with CRYSTAL06 because the large supercell
(

⁠, the almost complete absence of symmetry, and the complex electronic structure make the optimization prohibitive in terms of computational costs.
For further reference, the geometric and magnetic structures of the perfect and the defective slabs are schematically shown in Fig. 1, with the indication of some atoms of interest.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. The perfect NiO surface
Let us briefly recall the basic features of the electronic structure of the perfect NiO(100) surface as calculated in our previous work.1 Experimentally, bulk NiO is an AFM insulator with a band gap
E
g
between 4.0 and
4.3
eV
⁠.31–34 The local magnetic moment of the Ni (111) planes is
(
1.64
–
1.77
)
μ
B
at saturation.31,32 Except for the band gap, these properties are well reproduced by both
DFT
+
U
and B3PW approaches which predict a correct lattice parameter and a magnetization of about
1.7
μ
B
per Ni ion for the AFM phase (the FM phase is
0.10
eV
per NiO unit higher in energy). The
DFT
+
U
approach, however, gives an energy gap of about
3
eV
⁠, too small compared to the experiment, while the hybrid B3PW method slightly overestimates this quantity (⁠
4.49
eV
with the present basis set).
The NiO(100) surface preserves the same magnetic arrangement as in the bulk, as recently shown employing slabs of 1–4 layers of thickness.1 On the NiO(100) surface of the four-layer slab, the
Ni
2
+
ions assume the same
d
(
z
2
)
1
d
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
1
configuration of the bulk (the Ni–O bonds being aligned along the
x
and
y
directions), although on the surface the two orbitals are no longer equivalent. Both surface relaxation and surface rumpling are very small. The energy gap,
2.66
eV
in
DFT
+
U
⁠, is smaller than in the bulk because the film has two surfaces where the atoms are undercoordinated. This is found also at the B3PW level where the gap is
3.93
eV
⁠, i.e. about
0.5
eV
smaller than in the bulk. For the AFM ordering, the magnetization of the inner layers converges to
(
1.68
–
1.69
)
μ
B
per Ni ion at the
DFT
+
U
level, and to
1.64
μ
B
per Ni ion at the B3PW level (similar to the bulk). In the surface layer the magnetization is only slightly higher. For further reference it can be recalled that in each layer the Ni ions form parallel alternating rows of
α
and
β
spins along the
x
-
y
direction (to be indicated in the following as
α
-
Ni
or
β
-
Ni
⁠, respectively), see Fig. 1. Surface oxygens have thus two neighbor surface
α
-
Ni
ions at one side and two
β
-
Ni
ions at the other side; they can sit either above
α
-
Ni
or
β
-
Ni
ions in the plane below. For this reason, the formation of a surface vacancy of both types always results in rupture of the magnetic symmetry. We have considered in the following the removal of a surface O ion above
α
-
Ni
⁠, and of a surface
β
-
Ni
ion.
The projected densities of states (PDOSs) for the four-layer NiO(100) slab obtained at the B3PW level, reported in Fig. 2, show that the top of the valence band is dominated by the O
2
p
states strongly mixed with the Ni
3
d
states. The opposite is true for the bottom of the conduction band, which is largely formed by the
Ni
2
+
empty
3
d
states [of the two peaks, the one higher in energy has mainly
d
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
character], with contributions from the O
2
p
levels. The two spin components are here symmetric, as expected.

B. Oxygen vacancy
We computed the electronic structure of an oxygen vacancy using a
2
×
2
supercell and starting from the most stable AFM ordering. The cost to remove an O atom, determined with respect to
1
2
O
2
⁠, is about
4.4
eV
with both
DFT
+
U
and B3PW methods, see Table I. If referred to atomic oxygen, the formation energy becomes about
7
eV
⁠, i.e., considerably smaller than in MgO(100) where it is more than
9
eV
⁠.35–38 The relaxation accompanying the vacancy formation is relatively small. All the nearest Ni and next-nearest O ions in the surface plane move inward by 0.02 and
0.05
Å
respectively, while the Ni atom below moves upward by
0.06
Å
(⁠
DFT
+
U
results). Similar relaxations are obtained with the B3PW approach (Ni ions move outward by
0.02
Å
⁠).

  The removal of a surface O atom is accompanied by the appearance of new states in the gap of the material, at about
1.2
eV
above the top of valance band (B3LYP), as is evident from the PDOSs and the band structure of defective NiO shown in Fig. 3 (only results from B3PW calculations are reported, the ones obtained at the
DFT
+
U
level being almost identical). At neighboring Ni ions, the previously unoccupied
3
d
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
states are more stabilized than the
3
d
z
2
ones, although the latter are slightly higher in energy in the perfect slab. As a consequence, in the
α
-band structure [Fig. 3(b), left panel], the newly occupied states in the gap arise from a combination of the
α
-
3
d
(
x
2
−

)
orbitals of the
β
-
Ni
ions around the vacancy with states of the vacancy itself, as shown schematically in the inset. An approximately symmetric structure is recognizable in the
β
-band structure [Fig. 3(b), right panel]. However, the rupture of magnetic symmetry is evident. The
β
defect state is lower in energy than the
α
one due to reduced Fermi interaction with the electron distribution of the
α
-
Ni
ion which is left below the vacancy.

Further information on the electronic structure around the O vacancy is provided by the charge and spin density plots. Figure 4 (B3PW results) shows the electron density associated with the two occupied bands in the main gap. It is seen that the two electrons left over by the removed O are partially distributed inside the cavity, but to a larger extent are localized over the Ni atoms at the vacancy. The spin density map of Fig. 5 shows

results obtained with the

The “quenching” of the spin density of the four Ni ions around the vacancy in the directions of the missing O ion is clearly visible. The “superexchange” distortion of the spin density at the O ions is also recognizable (⁠

Another way to recognize the localization of the defect states at the Ni ions around the vacancy is provided by their net Mulliken charges and magnetic moments, which are expected to decrease in absolute value. As reported in Table I, the magnetic moment changes from

(from 0.94 to 0.88) for the one below the vacancy (B3PW results). The changes in electron and spin populations are very similar with
DFT
+
U
⁠.
The present results are consistent with those of the embedded cluster CASSCF study of Pettersson and Pacchioni.5 The charge density plot reported in that study (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 5) is similar to that of Fig. 5, even considering that a
C
4
v
symmetry was imposed in that case to the system.
Let us finally comment on the stability of the results with respect to the density of vacancies at the surface. In the
2
×
2
supercell (coverage
θ
=
0.25
⁠) two O vacancies share an O ion second neighbor to the vacancy (⁠
O
′
and
O
″
in Fig. 1). This could affect the electronic structure because of direct interaction among the vacancies. We have repeated the calculations using the
DFT
+
U
approach and a larger supercell (⁠
4
×
4
⁠, corresponding to
θ
=
0.125
⁠). The vacancy formation energy is essentially the same
(
4.35
eV
)
⁠, and the electronic structure is also very similar. Therefore, the results obtained with the
2
×
2
supercell can be extrapolated also to lower densities of oxygen vacancies at the NiO(100) surface.
C. Nickel vacancy
Before discussing the electronic structure of a Ni vacancy at the NiO(100) surface, we briefly summarize what is known for the equivalent defect in MgO, the so called V center. This has been investigated in some detail at the HF level using both embedded cluster models and periodic supercells.15,16 In this latter case the calculations were done with CRYSTAL, i.e., the same code used here for NiO. Embedded cluster and periodic supercell calculations give essentially the same picture, valid for a Mg vacancy at the surface and in the bulk. The extraction of a magnesium atom leads to a localization of the two holes in the O
2
p
valence band on two oxygen atoms at opposite sides of the vacancy, with formation of
O
−
radicals. This localization is possible only if the
C
4
v
symmetry constraint is removed and the system is allowed to relax along one of the O–V–O axes. On the contrary, for a V center in bulk MgO the local density approximation approach generates a pair of holes delocalized over six oxygen atoms,16 in contradiction with the experimental evidence which shows localization on two oxygens only39 (a similar experimental evidence for the surface vacancy is missing). This result is a consequence of the self-interaction problem which affects standard DFT calculations.40 The Mg vacancy at the MgO(100) surface is then a good test of the validity of the
DFT
+
U
or hybrid approaches. We have performed DFT (PW91) calculations for the V center at the MgO(100) surface. We always found that the two holes are delocalized over five oxygen atoms, even when distortions in the lattice are introduced. The same result is obtained with the hybrid B3PW functional
(
α
=
20
%
)
for the same defect in bulk MgO and at MgO(100). Only by increasing
α
up to 45%–50% the two holes become localized on the two opposite O ions. The surface relaxes in a rhombic distortion resulting in a lower symmetry, in agreement with previous theoretical studies16 and with experimental evidence for the bulk.39 This suggests that a similar problem could be encountered with NiO(100) when the
DFT
+
U
and standard hybrid functionals are used. We shall discuss this possibility in the following.
In the case of the Ni vacancy, the use of a
(

×

)
supercell is not adequate. In fact, with this cell size the vacancies interact among themselves leading to an unphysical localization of the holes on the specific Ni ion which is midway among them (⁠
Ni
′
in Fig. 1). Also the defect formation energy changes significantly when a lower density of Ni vacancies is considered. This is true for both
DFT
+
U
and hybrid DFT approaches. For this reason, the following discussion is based on a
4

supercell, where the interaction between the vacancies is negligible. Note that the formation of the vacancy leads to a lowering of the symmetry from

At variance with the O vacancy case, considerable relaxation accompanies the formation of the Ni vacancy. According to
DFT
+
U
calculations, the four nearest Ni ions in the top plane move towards the center of the vacancy by
0.11
Å
⁠, while the four O ions move outward by
0.19
Å
⁠. The O atom in the second layer moves down by
0.10
Å
⁠. As anticipated, no geometry optimization was performed with CRYSTAL, and the results reported below are referred in this case to the unrelaxed geometry. The formation energy of a surface Ni vacancy following the removal of a neutral gas-phase Ni atom from the perfect NiO(100) slab, evaluated with the B3PW functional, is
11.8
eV
⁠. This is considerably higher than the estimate obtained with the VASP code,
9.3
eV
⁠. This difference is in part due to the absence of relaxation energy in the B3PW result, which amounts to about
1
eV
⁠, and in part to the fact that the
DFT
+
U
estimate was obtained using as a reference the energy of a free Ni atom evaluated with the same technique. In any case, the formation energies are similar, actually smaller, than those of a Mg vacancy at the MgO(100) surface, which is about
13.5
eV
⁠.16 
Let us discuss first the electronic structure obtained with the B3PW approach. There is a clear indication that the missing electrons are removed from the O anions and not from the Ni cations (this latter process would formally correspond to a change of oxidation state from
Ni
2
+
3
d
8
to
Ni
3
+
3
d
7
⁠). In fact only the two Ni ions labeled as
Ni
′
in Fig. 6 (the second neighbors to the vacancy with magnetization opposite to that of the removed Ni atom) exhibit a modest reduction in magnetization, from 1.68 to 1.60. On the contrary, a considerable spin density appears on the oxygens, especially those closest to the vacancy, consistently with the PDOSs and band structure of Fig. 7. The removal of the positive ion pushes up four
α
bands in the main gap, only two of which are filled. They are principally associated with
α
-
p
orbitals on first-neighbor oxygens at the surface. The two most destabilized bands (the unoccupied ones) which give these oxygens their negative magnetization are a combination of
p
x
and
p
y
α
-atomic orbitals pointing towards the vacancy. This appears clearly in the spin density maps of Fig. 6. It can be noticed that each of the four O ions around the vacancy [for instance
O
(
1
)
], still contributes to the stabilization of the magnetic order because of the super-exchange interaction they mediate between the two neighboring Ni ions of opposite spin in front of each other (simply labeled as
α
and
β
in Fig. 6). The conservation of this interaction opposes to a rhombohedral distortion of the structure. Note finally that the high concentration of
β
electrons at the surface around the vacancy induces by contrast a slightly prevailing
α
character to the oxygen below the removed Ni ion
[
O
(
5
)
]
⁠. The reduction of the ionicity of the oxygens closest to the vacancy is confirmed by their Mulliken net charges, which change, with respect to the perfect slab, from
−
0.95
to
−
0.72
[
O
(
1
)
,
O

]
⁠, from

to
−
0.72
[

]
⁠, and from
−
0.97
to
−
0.82
[
O
(
5

]
⁠, while those of the Ni ions are hardly affected.
While this picture is similar for many aspects to that of the V center in MgO, the question can be asked if removal of the
C
s
symmetry constraint may induce also in the present case further localization of the holes on only two oxygens along one of the O–V–O axes. We explored this possibility, but without success. This failure could represent a real physical difference between the two systems or might be due to inadequacy of the B3PW approach, as previously discussed. On the other hand, when we performed hybrid DFT no-symmetry calculations on the NiO slab using higher percentage of the Fock exchange (high
α
values), we never observed a stable electronic configuration of the kind observed in MgO. This seems to indicate that the two systems behave really in a different way as far as their V centers are concerned. This may be due both to the lower ionicity of NiO (which reduces the stability of
O
2
−
ions), and to the AFM character of the structure (which favors conservation of the
C
s
symmetry).
We can now discuss the results obtained with the
DFT
+
U
approach. The electronic structure of the film appears to be the same already shown in Fig. 7 for B3PW approach. Both the DOS plots and the band structure (not reported for brevity) show the presence of four spin
α
-bands in the main gap (only two are filled), providing evidence that the electrons are mainly removed from the O
2
p
states; furthermore the density spin plot is similar to that obtained at the B3PW level, Fig. 6. Despite these similarities, a closer look to the data reported in Table II shows a different behavior in the localization of holes, which are appreciably more delocalized. As found with the B3PW method, the five O ions nearest neighbor to the vacancy are involved, but in the
DFT
+
U
case we observed also a change in the magnetization of all the five Ni atoms directly bound to them. Therefore the electrons are partially removed from
3
d
Ni states too. Not surprisingly, any attempt to obtain further localization by allowing a rupture of the
C
s
symmetry was unsuccessful.
For a comparison with the unrelaxed structure of B3PW approach, we performed a truncated bulk calculation at
DFT
+
U
level, Table II. The magnetic order and the magnetization of all the atoms are basically the same to that found in the relaxed geometry, with the only exception of Ni(1), which is unperturbed. Furthermore, in this structure, the energy formation of the vacancy is closer to that found at B3PW level.
There are no experimental data available to compare with and to conclude which is the most realistic description of the electronic structure, either fully delocalized or partially delocalized holes. Based on the fact that the DFT solution for a V center in MgO is at variance with the experiment, we are lead to suppose that even on NiO the situation where the holes are more localized, as found with the hybrid functional, is more realistic. However, a firm conclusion would require a direct comparison with observable properties. Unfortunately, electron paramagnetic resonance data are not accessible given the AFM nature of NiO.
As we mentioned in the Introduction, very few experimental and theoretical studies exist on the electronic structure of point defects at the NiO surface. One of these studies is a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) investigation of NiO single crystals performed at about
200
°
C
(STM imaging at room temperature was unsuccessful).4 Imaging of empty and filled states in correspondence of a point defect on a NiO(100) terrace has been possible but only from different regions of the sample. From the analysis of the brightness of the spots and of their distance it was concluded4 that what is imaged is the Ni
(
1
×
1
)
sublattice, i.e., a Ni vacancy. We have attempted to simulate the STM images corresponding to a Ni vacancy at both positive bias (empty states) and negative bias (filled states) using the Tersoff-Hamann approximation41 and the density obtained at the
DFT
+
U
level. However, while the experimental bias for the filled states,4
V
=
−
1.3
V
⁠, corresponds to valence band states in both B3PW and
DFT
+
U
calculations, the bias applied for empty states,
V
=
+
1.3
V
⁠,4 is too big, and does not correspond to any clearly identified state in our DOS (also due to the too low energy gap in
DFT
+
U
calculations). Therefore, we report and discuss only the simulated image obtained for
V
=
−
1.3
V
⁠, Fig. 8. The first image, Fig. 8(a), shows a dark spot at the center of the vacancy, while the spots in the squares centers are oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the image being due to filled O
2
p
states, although these are strongly mixed with the Ni
3
d
states, see Fig. 2. This image, however, has only a qualitative resemblance with the experimental one, Fig. 8(b), since the vacancy appears as a dark region while the neighboring oxygens appear as bright spots.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have studied the electronic structure of neutral oxygen and nickel vacancies at the surface of NiO(100). To this end we have employed two methods, using two different techniques to compensate for the inadequacy of standard spin-polarized DFT in the description of localized spin densities. One is the
DFT
+
U
approach making use of plane wave basis sets, the other a hybrid B3PW approach based on atomic orbital basis sets. Since the creation of anion and cation vacancies can lead to new states with various degree of electron or hole localisation, this comparison is important to reach a more accurate representation of the nature of these defect centers.
The two approaches provide a similar description of the nature of an oxygen vacancy. The charge is more delocalized than for the corresponding defect in MgO: less than one of the two electrons is trapped in the vacancy, the other being distributed over the neighboring Ni ions. This result is clearly a consequence of the lower degree of ionicity of NiO compared to MgO and of the fact that NiO is a reducible oxide while MgO is not, and is consistent with the picture provided several years ago by an embedded cluster CASSCF calculation.5 
The nickel vacancy is described slightly differently in
DFT
+
U
and hybrid functional approaches. Both methods clearly show that the removal of a neutral Ni atom does not result in the oxidation of nickel from
Ni
2
+
to
Ni
3
+
but rather in the formation of holes in the O
2
p
valence band; however, the B3PW approach indicates that the holes are mainly localised on the O ions closest to the vacancy, while they are distributed over a larger region according to the
DFT
+
U
calculations. In neither case, even allowing for geometrical distortion or introducing higher percentage of exact exchange in the hybrid functional, were we able to localize the two holes on two specific oxygen atoms, as is the case for the Mg vacancy in bulk MgO or at MgO(100) surface. We believe that this result is physically reasonable, and is related not only to the lower ionicity of NiO with respect to MgO, but also to the magnetic order in NiO which favors conservation of the
C
s
symmetry.
