<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information specifically about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on CO oxidation catalyzed by doped TiO2 surfaces, particularly those doped with V, Cr, Mo, W and Mn. It does not discuss nickel oxide catalysts, ethylbenzene to styrene conversion, or ethane to ethylene reactions. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this document.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on CO oxidation catalyzed by doped TiO2 surfaces, specifically rutile TiO2(110) doped with V, Cr, Mo, W, and Mn. It does not discuss nickel oxide catalysts, ethylbenzene to styrene conversion, or ethane to ethylene reactions. The literature also does not address the specific challenges mentioned in the question regarding theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity and safety for those catalytic systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
