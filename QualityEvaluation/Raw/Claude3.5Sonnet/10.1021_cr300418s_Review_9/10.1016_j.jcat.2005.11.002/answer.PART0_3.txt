[1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The incorporation of niobium as a dopant in nickel oxide dramatically improves catalytic performance. Even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111) double the reactivity compared to pure NiO. The optimal Nb/Ni atomic ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18.

Niobium incorporation affects the electronic structure by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies in the nonstoichiometric NiO surface. This reduces the material's nonstoichiometry and the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species (O-), which are responsible for total oxidation to CO2. Nb acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in NiO.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host lattice.
2. Process optimization to achieve the ideal balance of dopant concentration for maximum performance.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity, as the catalysts must activate ethane while preserving ethylene from further oxidation.
4. Ensuring safety in handling and using these materials, particularly given their high reactivity at relatively low temperatures.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其电子结构和在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

将铌作为掺杂剂引入氧化镍中可大幅提高催化性能。即使少量的Nb(Nb/Ni比为0.111)也能使反应活性比纯NiO提高一倍。催化性能最佳的Nb/Ni原子比范围为0.11-0.18。

铌的引入通过取代镍原子和/或填充非化学计量NiO表面的阳离子空位来影响电子结构。这减少了材料的非化学计量性和亲电氧物种(O-)的浓度，后者负责完全氧化为CO2。Nb作为电子给体，降低了NiO中正电荷空穴的浓度。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主晶格之间复杂相互作用进行理论建模。
2. 优化工艺以达到最佳掺杂浓度，实现最大性能。
3. 平衡效率和选择性，因为催化剂必须活化乙烷，同时防止乙烯进一步氧化。
4. 确保这些材料在处理和使用过程中的安全性，特别是考虑到它们在相对较低温度下的高反应活性。
