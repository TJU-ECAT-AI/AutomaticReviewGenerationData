[5] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."

[6] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide dramatically improves the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity. Even small amounts of Nb doping (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111) double the per-weight reactivity compared to pure NiO. The optimal Nb/Ni ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18.

The substitution of Ni2+ cations by Nb5+ cations in the NiO lattice creates charge imbalances that generate acidic centers. This substitution also reduces the electrical conductivity of the material, consistent with the principle of controlled valence for dissolution of higher-valence ions in p-type host oxides.

Pure NiO is nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies that can accommodate excess electrophilic oxygen radicals. These strong oxidizing species are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. However, when Nb is incorporated, its cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute for Ni atoms in the lattice. This process reduces the nonstoichiometry and cationic defects on the surface, leading to fewer unselective oxygen species and enhanced ethane ODH activity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host oxide lattice.
2. Process optimization to maximize yield and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity with safety concerns, particularly when dealing with highly reactive oxygen species.
4. Scaling up laboratory results to industrial-scale production while maintaining performance.
5. Developing more sophisticated characterization techniques to better understand the surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms.

Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance, and to overcome these challenges in developing improved ODH catalysts.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能产生显著影响。

将铌掺入氧化镍中可大幅提高催化剂的反应活性和选择性。即使少量的Nb掺杂（Nb/Ni比为0.111）也能使每重量反应活性比纯NiO提高一倍。最佳催化性能的Nb/Ni比在0.11-0.18范围内。

NiO晶格中Ni2+阳离子被Nb5+阳离子取代会产生电荷不平衡，从而形成酸性中心。这种替代还降低了材料的电导率，与p型主体氧化物中高价离子溶解的受控价原理一致。

纯NiO是非化学计量的，具有阳离子空位，可容纳过量的亲电氧自由基。这些强氧化物种负责乙烷完全氧化成CO2。然而，当掺入Nb时，其阳离子填充阳离子空位和/或替代晶格中的Ni原子。这一过程减少了表面的非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致非选择性氧物种减少，从而增强了乙烷ODH活性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主体氧化物晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化工艺以最大化产率和选择性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性。
3. 平衡效率和选择性与安全考虑，特别是在处理高反应性氧物种时。
4. 将实验室结果扩大到工业规模生产，同时保持性能。
5. 开发更先进的表征技术，以更好地理解表面化学和反应机理。

需要进一步研究以充分理解催化剂组成、结构和性能之间的关系，并克服开发改进的ODH催化剂过程中的这些挑战。
