[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most benefi-cial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."

[2] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[3] "Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conduc-tivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence [25] for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep-tor."

[4] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the re-duction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The preparation method, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Doping NiO with niobium improves reactivity towards ethane by over 50% while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is achieved through the incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice, either by substituting nickel atoms or filling cationic vacancies. This process reduces the material's nonstoichiometry and the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2.

Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in the NiO acceptor. This leads to a decrease in electrical conductivity and a reduction in unselective oxygen species on the surface, enhancing ethane ODH activity.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopant concentrations and vacancy formation on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and CO2 production.

4. Safety: Controlling the highly exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure safe operation.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining catalyst performance and stability.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

用铌掺杂NiO可以提高对乙烷的反应性50%以上，同时保持高的乙烯选择性。这是通过将Nb掺入NiO晶格实现的，可以替代镍原子或填充阳离子空位。这个过程减少了材料的非化学计量比和负责完全氧化成CO2的亲电氧物种的浓度。

铌作为电子给体，减少了NiO受体中正电荷空穴的浓度。这导致电导率降低，表面上非选择性氧物种减少，从而提高了乙烷ODH活性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂浓度和空位形成对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：平衡催化剂反应性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2产生。

4. 安全性：控制氧化脱氢反应的高度放热性，防止失控反应，确保安全操作。

5. 可扩展性：将实验室结果转化为工业规模的过程，同时保持催化剂的性能和稳定性。
