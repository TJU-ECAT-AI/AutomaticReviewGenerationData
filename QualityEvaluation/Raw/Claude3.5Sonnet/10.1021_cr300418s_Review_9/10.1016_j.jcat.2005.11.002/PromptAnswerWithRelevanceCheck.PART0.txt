[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most benefi-cial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."

[2] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[3] "Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conduc-tivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence [25] for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO accep-tor."

[4] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the re-duction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The preparation method, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Doping NiO with niobium improves reactivity towards ethane by over 50% while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is achieved through the incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice, either by substituting nickel atoms or filling cationic vacancies. This process reduces the material's nonstoichiometry and the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation to CO2.

Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in the NiO acceptor. This leads to a decrease in electrical conductivity and a reduction in unselective oxygen species on the surface, enhancing ethane ODH activity.

The key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Accurately predicting the effects of dopant concentrations and vacancy formation on electronic structure and catalytic performance.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the trade-offs between reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and CO2 production.

4. Safety: Controlling the highly exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure safe operation.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining catalyst performance and stability.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

用铌掺杂NiO可以提高对乙烷的反应性50%以上，同时保持高的乙烯选择性。这是通过将Nb掺入NiO晶格实现的，可以替代镍原子或填充阳离子空位。这个过程减少了材料的非化学计量比和负责完全氧化成CO2的亲电氧物种的浓度。

铌作为电子给体，减少了NiO受体中正电荷空穴的浓度。这导致电导率降低，表面上非选择性氧物种减少，从而提高了乙烷ODH活性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：准确预测掺杂浓度和空位形成对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 工艺优化：平衡催化剂反应性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和CO2产生。

4. 安全性：控制氧化脱氢反应的高度放热性，防止失控反应，确保安全操作。

[1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Preparation method: The study uses an evaporation method to prepare NiNbO mixed oxides with varying Nb/Ni atomic ratios.

Dopant concentrations: Small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO cause a 100% increase in reactivity. The optimum catalytic performance is achieved with Nb/Ni ratios in the range of 0.11-0.18.

Vacancy formation and electronic structure: NiO is naturally nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies. Incorporating Nb into the NiO lattice reduces this nonstoichiometry by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies. This modification decreases the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) responsible for total oxidation.

Catalytic performance: The incorporation of Nb significantly improves the selectivity towards ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Nb acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in NiO and eliminating electrophilic oxygen species that cause total oxidation.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb dopants and the NiO lattice, and how these affect oxygen species formation and reactivity.

2. Process optimization: Balancing Nb dopant concentrations to achieve optimal activity and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing total oxidation to CO2.

4. Safety: Controlling the highly exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to prevent runaway reactions and maintain catalyst stability.

The incorporation of niobium as a dopant in nickel oxide dramatically improves catalytic performance. Even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111) double the reactivity compared to pure NiO. The optimal Nb/Ni atomic ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18.

Niobium incorporation affects the electronic structure by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies in the nonstoichiometric NiO surface.

2. Process optimization to achieve the ideal balance of dopant concentration for maximum performance.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity, as the catalysts must activate ethane while preserving ethylene from further oxidation.
4. Ensuring safety in handling and using these materials, particularly given their high reactivity at relatively low temperatures.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The incorporation of niobium into nickel oxide dramatically improves the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity. Even small amounts of Nb doping (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111) double the per-weight reactivity compared to pure NiO. The optimal Nb/Ni ratio for catalytic performance is in the range of 0.11-0.18.

The substitution of Ni2+ cations by Nb5+ cations in the NiO lattice creates charge imbalances that generate acidic centers. This substitution also reduces the electrical conductivity of the material, consistent with the principle of controlled valence for dissolution of higher-valence ions in p-type host oxides.

Pure NiO is nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies that can accommodate excess electrophilic oxygen radicals. These strong oxidizing species are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. However, when Nb is incorporated, its cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute for Ni atoms in the lattice. This process reduces the nonstoichiometry and cationic defects on the surface, leading to fewer unselective oxygen species and enhanced ethane ODH activity.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the host oxide lattice.
2. Process optimization to maximize yield and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity with safety concerns, particularly when dealing with highly reactive oxygen species.
4. Scaling up laboratory results to industrial-scale production while maintaining performance.
5. Developing more sophisticated characterization techniques to better understand the surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms.

Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance, and to overcome these challenges in developing improved ODH catalysts.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能产生显著影响。

将铌掺入氧化镍中可大幅提高催化剂的反应活性和选择性。即使少量的Nb掺杂（Nb/Ni比为0.111）也能使每重量反应活性比纯NiO提高一倍。最佳催化性能的Nb/Ni比在0.11-0.18范围内。

NiO晶格中Ni2+阳离子被Nb5+阳离子取代会产生电荷不平衡，从而形成酸性中心。这种替代还降低了材料的电导率，与p型主体氧化物中高价离子溶解的受控价原理一致。

纯NiO是非化学计量的，具有阳离子空位，可容纳过量的亲电氧自由基。这些强氧化物种负责乙烷完全氧化成CO2。然而，当掺入Nb时，其阳离子填充阳离子空位和/或替代晶格中的Ni原子。这一过程减少了表面的非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致非选择性氧物种减少，从而增强了乙烷ODH活性。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对掺杂剂、空位和主体氧化物晶格之间复杂相互作用的理论建模。
2. 优化工艺以最大化产率和选择性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性。
3. 平衡效率和选择性与安全考虑，特别是在处理高反应性氧物种时。
4. 将实验室结果扩大到工业规模生产，同时保持性能。
5. 开发更先进的表征技术，以更好地理解表面化学和反应机理。

需要进一步研究以充分理解催化剂组成、结构和性能之间的关系，并克服开发改进的ODH催化剂过程中的这些挑战。
