          [1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

[5] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."

[6] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene.

1. Preparation method: NiNbO mixed oxides are prepared using an evaporation method, allowing for the formation of a NiNb solid solution.

2. Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111-0.18) lead to optimal catalytic performance, with a 100% increase in reactivity compared to pure NiO.

3. Vacancy formation and electronic structure: NiO is naturally nonstoichiometric with cationic vacancies. Incorporating Nb into the NiO lattice reduces this nonstoichiometry by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies. This modification decreases the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) responsible for total oxidation.

4. Catalytic performance: The incorporation of Nb significantly improves the selectivity towards ethylene in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Nb acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive hole concentration in NiO and eliminating electrophilic oxygen species that cause total oxidation.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb dopants and the NiO lattice, and how these affect oxygen species formation and reactivity.

2. Process optimization: Balancing Nb dopant concentrations to achieve optimal activity and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethylene yield while minimizing total oxidation to CO2.

4. Safety: Controlling the highly exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to prevent runaway reactions and maintain catalyst stability.

5. Scalability: Translating laboratory results to industrial-scale processes while maintaining catalyst performance and stability.

          镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能在氧化脱氢反应（如乙烷到乙烯）中的影响显著：

1. 制备方法：NiNbO混合氧化物通过蒸发法制备，这种方法允许形成NiNb固溶体。

2. 掺杂浓度：少量Nb（Nb/Ni比例为0.111-0.18）导致最佳催化性能，与纯NiO相比，反应活性提高100%。

3. 空位形成和电子结构：NiO本身是非化学计量的，具有阳离子空位。将Nb掺入NiO晶格中通过替代镍原子和/或填充阳离子空位来降低这种非化学计量性。这种改变减少了导致完全氧化的亲电氧物种（O-）的浓度。

4. 催化性能：掺入Nb显著提高了乙烷氧化脱氢生成乙烯的选择性。Nb作为电子给体，降低了NiO中正电荷空穴的浓度，消除了导致完全氧化的亲电氧物种。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解Nb掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用，以及这些相互作用如何影响氧物种的形成和反应性。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb掺杂浓度以实现最佳活性和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率，同时最小化CO2的完全氧化。

4. 安全性：控制氧化脱氢反应的高度放热性质，以防止失控反应并保持催化剂稳定性。

5. 可扩展性：将实验室结果转化为工业规模的过程，同时保持催化剂的性能和稳定性。
