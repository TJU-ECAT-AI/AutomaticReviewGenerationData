[1] "The incorporation of even small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni = 0.111) in NiO causes a 100% increase in the per weight reactivity compared with the pure nickel oxide."

[2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[3] "The key component for the excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon the introduction of niobium in NiO, evidenced by the contraction of the NiO lattice constant, since even small amounts of Nb effectively converted NiO from a total oxidation catalyst (80% selectivity to CO2) to a very efficient ethane ODH material."

[4] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "The developed NiNbO catalysts for ethane ODH presented in this study appear to be clearly superior, combining high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels (66% C2H6 conversion and 70% C2H4 selectivity at 400 C), with very stable catalytic performance."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethane to ethylene:

1. Preparation method: The NiNbO mixed oxides were prepared by the evaporation method, which allowed for the formation of a NiNb solid solution.

2. Dopant concentration: Small amounts of Nb (Nb/Ni ratio of 0.111-0.18) led to optimal catalytic performance, with a 100% increase in reactivity compared to pure NiO.

3. Vacancy formation: Nb incorporation reduced the nonstoichiometry of NiO by filling cationic vacancies and/or substituting nickel atoms in the NiO lattice.

4. Electronic structure: The introduction of Nb modified the electronic properties of NiO, reducing the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation.

5. Catalytic performance: The NiNbO catalysts showed superior performance in ethane ODH, with high activity at low temperatures and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Understanding the complex interactions between Nb dopants and the NiO lattice, and their effects on electronic structure and catalytic properties.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the Nb/Ni ratio to achieve optimal performance while maintaining catalyst stability and longevity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Maximizing ethene yield while minimizing CO2 production, which requires fine-tuning of the catalyst composition and reaction conditions.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe operation at high conversion levels and maintaining catalyst stability over extended periods.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能在氧化脱氢反应（如乙烷到乙烯）中的影响显著：

1. 制备方法：NiNbO混合氧化物通过蒸发法制备，这种方法允许形成NiNb固溶体。

2. 掺杂浓度：少量Nb（Nb/Ni比例为0.111-0.18）导致最佳催化性能，与纯NiO相比，反应活性提高100%。

3. 空位形成：Nb的引入通过填充阳离子空位和/或替代NiO晶格中的镍原子，降低了NiO的非化学计量比。

4. 电子结构：Nb的引入修改了NiO的电子性质，降低了负责完全氧化的亲电氧物种的浓度。

5. 催化性能：NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH中表现出优越的性能，在低温下具有高活性，在高转化率下具有高乙烯选择性。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：理解Nb掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用，以及它们对电子结构和催化性能的影响。

2. 过程优化：平衡Nb/Ni比例以实现最佳性能，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

3. 效率和选择性：最大化乙烯产率同时最小化CO2产生，这需要对催化剂组成和反应条件进行精细调整。

4. 安全性：确保在高转化率下的安全操作，并在长期使用中保持催化剂的稳定性。
