[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods: The study describes preparing solid solutions of NixMg1-xO at 1200°C, where magnesium ions are interposed between nickel ions without changing the structure. This method allows for the isolation of nickel ions, which influences their chemisorption properties and catalytic activity.

Dopant concentrations: The activity per nickel ion increases as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1% nickel. This suggests that the concentration of dopants plays a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance.

Vacancy formation: While not explicitly mentioned for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the study discusses the formation of oxygen vacancies during outgassing at high temperatures, which can affect subsequent chemisorption experiments.

Electronic structure: The research indicates that p-type semiconductivity in NiO, arising from the drift of charge across Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, is less relevant for catalysis than the nature of the octahedral complex formed by chemisorbed oxygen at the surface.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the behavior of isolated nickel ions in the magnesium oxide matrix and their interaction with reactants.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the concentration of nickel ions to achieve maximum catalytic activity while maintaining stability and selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Optimizing the reversible oxygen adsorption that develops as nickel ions are diluted, which parallels catalytic activity.

4. Safety: Ensuring safe handling of catalysts and reactants, particularly when working with high temperatures and potentially reactive species.

While the study focuses on N2O decomposition rather than oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the insights gained regarding the influence of preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and surface chemistry on catalytic performance are likely applicable to other catalytic systems, including oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：研究描述了在1200°C下制备NixMg1-xO固溶体，其中镁离子被插入镍离子之间而不改变结构。这种方法允许镍离子的隔离，从而影响其化学吸附性质和催化活性。

掺杂浓度：随着镍离子被镁离子稀释，每个镍离子的活性增加，在约1%镍含量时达到最大值。这表明掺杂剂浓度在优化催化性能中起着关键作用。

空位形成：虽然没有明确提到氧化脱氢反应中的空位形成，但研究讨论了在高温脱气过程中形成的氧空位，这可能影响后续的化学吸附实验。

电子结构：研究表明，NiO中由Ni2+/Ni3+离子电荷漂移引起的p型半导体性对催化作用的影响不如表面化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质重要。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发精确模型以预测镁氧化物基质中隔离镍离子的行为及其与反应物的相互作用。

2. 工艺优化：平衡镍离子浓度以实现最大催化活性，同时保持稳定性和选择性。

3. 效率和选择性：优化随镍离子稀释而发展的可逆氧吸附，这与催化活性相平行。

4. 安全性：确保催化剂和反应物的安全处理，特别是在高温和潜在反应性物质工作时。

虽然该研究主要关注N2O分解而非氧化脱氢反应，但关于制备方法、掺杂浓度和表面化学对催化性能影响的见解可能适用于其他催化系统，包括氧化脱氢反应。
