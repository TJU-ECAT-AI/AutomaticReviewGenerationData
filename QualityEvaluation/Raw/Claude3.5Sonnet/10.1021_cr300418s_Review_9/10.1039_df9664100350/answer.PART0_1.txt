[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods: The study describes preparing solid solutions of NixMgl-xO at 1200°C, allowing for the isolation of nickel ions within a magnesium oxide matrix. This method enables the investigation of how chemisorption properties and catalytic activity are affected by the isolation of transition metal ions.

Dopant concentrations: The activity per nickel ion increases as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1% nickel concentration. This suggests that the optimal dopant concentration for catalytic performance is relatively low.

Electronic structure: The research indicates that the drift of charge across Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which causes p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is less important for catalysis than the nature of the octahedral complex formed by chemisorbed oxygen at the surface. This implies that the local electronic structure around the active sites is more crucial than bulk electronic properties.

Catalytic performance: The catalytic activity is closely related to a reversible type of oxygen adsorption that develops as nickel ions are diluted. This suggests that the ability to form and break oxygen bonds is key to the catalytic process.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing models that accurately represent the complex interplay between dopant concentration, electronic structure, and surface chemistry.

2. Process optimization: Finding the optimal balance between dopant concentration, preparation methods, and reaction conditions to maximize catalytic performance.

3. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety: Ensuring high catalytic activity while maintaining product selectivity and process safety, especially given the involvement of oxygen in the reactions.

4. Understanding the role of surface complexes: Further investigation into the nature and behavior of the octahedral complexes formed by chemisorbed oxygen, which appear to be crucial for catalytic activity.

5. Scaling up: Translating the insights gained from studying isolated nickel ions in a magnesium oxide matrix to practical, large-scale catalytic systems for industrial applications.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：研究描述了在1200°C下制备NixMgl-xO固溶体，使镍离子在氧化镁基质中被隔离。这种方法能够研究过渡金属离子的隔离如何影响化学吸附性质和催化活性。

掺杂浓度：随着镍离子被镁离子稀释，每个镍离子的活性增加，在约1%的镍浓度时达到最大值。这表明催化性能的最佳掺杂浓度相对较低。

电子结构：研究表明，Ni2+/Ni3+离子阵列中的电荷漂移（导致NiO的p型半导体性）对催化作用的重要性不如表面化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质。这意味着活性位点周围的局部电子结构比体相电子性质更为重要。

催化性能：催化活性与镍离子稀释时产生的可逆氧吸附类型密切相关。这表明形成和断裂氧键的能力是催化过程的关键。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发能够准确表示掺杂浓度、电子结构和表面化学之间复杂相互作用的模型。

2. 过程优化：找到掺杂浓度、制备方法和反应条件之间的最佳平衡，以最大化催化性能。

3. 平衡效率、选择性和安全性：确保高催化活性的同时保持产品选择性和过程安全性，特别是考虑到氧在反应中的参与。

4. 理解表面络合物的作用：进一步研究化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质和行为，这些络合物似乎对催化活性至关重要。

5. 规模扩大：将从研究氧化镁基质中隔离的镍离子获得的见解转化为实际的大规模催化系统，以应用于工业生产。
