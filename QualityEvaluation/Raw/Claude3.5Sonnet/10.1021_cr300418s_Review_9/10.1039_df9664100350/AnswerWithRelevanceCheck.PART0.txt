          [1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods: The study describes preparing solid solutions of NixMg1-xO at 1200°C, where magnesium ions are interposed between nickel ions without changing the structure. This method allows for the isolation of nickel ions, which influences their chemisorption properties and catalytic activity.

Dopant concentrations: The activity per nickel ion increases as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1% nickel. This suggests that the concentration of dopants plays a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance.

Electronic structure: The research indicates that p-type semiconductivity in NiO, arising from the drift of charge across Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, is less relevant for catalysis than the nature of the octahedral complex formed by chemisorbed oxygen at the surface.

Catalytic performance: The catalytic activity is closely related to a reversible type of oxygen adsorption that develops as nickel ions are diluted. This suggests that the ability to form and break oxygen bonds is key to the catalytic process.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the behavior of isolated nickel ions in the magnesium oxide matrix and their interaction with reactants.

2. Process optimization: Finding the optimal balance between dopant concentration, preparation methods, and reaction conditions to maximize catalytic performance.

3. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety: Ensuring high catalytic activity while maintaining product selectivity and process safety, especially given the involvement of oxygen in the reactions.

4. Understanding the role of surface complexes: Further investigation into the nature and behavior of the octahedral complexes formed by chemisorbed oxygen, which appear to be crucial for catalytic activity.

5. Scaling up: Translating the insights gained from studying isolated nickel ions in a magnesium oxide matrix to practical, large-scale catalytic systems for industrial applications.

While the study focuses on N2O decomposition rather than oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the insights gained about the influence of nickel ion isolation and concentration on catalytic activity could be relevant to other reactions, including oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene.

          在氧化脱氢反应中，氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：研究描述了在1200°C下制备NixMg1-xO固溶体，其中镁离子被插入镍离子之间而不改变结构。这种方法允许镍离子的隔离，从而影响其化学吸附性质和催化活性。

掺杂剂浓度：随着镍离子被镁离子稀释，每个镍离子的活性增加，在镍含量约为1%时达到最大值。这表明掺杂剂的浓度在优化催化性能中起着关键作用。

电子结构：研究表明，NiO中由Ni2+/Ni3+离子电荷漂移引起的p型半导体性对催化作用的影响不如表面化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质重要。

催化性能：催化活性与镍离子稀释时产生的可逆氧吸附类型密切相关。这表明形成和断裂氧键的能力是催化过程的关键。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论建模：开发能够准确预测镁氧化物基质中隔离镍离子行为及其与反应物相互作用的模型。

2. 过程优化：找到掺杂浓度、制备方法和反应条件之间的最佳平衡，以最大化催化性能。

3. 平衡效率、选择性和安全性：确保高催化活性的同时保持产品选择性和过程安全性，特别是考虑到氧在反应中的参与。

4. 理解表面络合物的作用：进一步研究化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质和行为，这些络合物似乎对催化活性至关重要。

5. 规模扩大：将从研究氧化镁基质中隔离的镍离子获得的见解转化为实际的大规模催化系统，以应用于工业生产。

虽然该研究集中在N2O分解而不是氧化脱氢反应，但关于镍离子隔离和浓度对催化活性影响的见解可能与其他反应相关，包括乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
