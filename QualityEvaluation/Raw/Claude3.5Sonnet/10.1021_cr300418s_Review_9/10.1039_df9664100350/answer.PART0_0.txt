[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "Several forms of oxygen chemisorption are discussed, including a strong form which occurs on lithium-containing specimens and inhibits the catalysis."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

The study shows that preparing solid solutions of NixMg1-xO at high temperatures (1200°C) allows for the isolation of nickel ions within a stable magnesium oxide matrix. This isolation influences the chemisorption properties and catalytic activity of the nickel ions. 

The activity per nickel ion increases as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1% nickel concentration. This suggests that the electronic structure of the catalyst is optimized at this concentration, likely due to the isolation of nickel ions preventing unwanted interactions.

Oxygen chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and the catalytic activity correlates with a reversible type of oxygen adsorption that develops as nickel ions are diluted. This indicates that the electronic structure of the isolated nickel ions facilitates a specific type of oxygen adsorption that is beneficial for catalysis.

The addition of lithium as a dopant introduces a strong form of oxygen chemisorption that inhibits catalysis. This demonstrates how dopant concentrations can significantly alter the electronic structure and, consequently, the catalytic performance of the material.

Key challenges in this field include:

1. Theoretical modeling of the complex interactions between isolated metal ions, dopants, and adsorbed species.
2. Optimizing the preparation process to achieve the desired level of ion isolation and dopant distribution.
3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity by finding the optimal dopant concentrations and preparation conditions.
4. Ensuring safety in the use of these catalysts, particularly when dealing with oxygen activation in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully controlling the preparation methods and dopant concentrations to achieve the desired electronic structure and catalytic performance in nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能在氧化脱氢反应中有显著影响。

研究表明，在高温(1200°C)下制备NixMg1-xO固溶体可以将镍离子隔离在稳定的氧化镁基质中。这种隔离影响了镍离子的化学吸附性质和催化活性。

每个镍离子的活性随着镍离子被镁离子稀释而增加，在约1%的镍浓度时达到最大值。这表明在这个浓度下催化剂的电子结构得到了优化，可能是由于镍离子的隔离防止了不必要的相互作用。

氧气优先在镍离子上发生化学吸附，催化活性与镍离子被稀释时产生的可逆氧吸附类型相关。这表明隔离的镍离子的电子结构有利于某种特定类型的氧吸附，这种吸附对催化有益。

添加锂作为掺杂剂会引入一种强烈的氧化学吸附形式，抑制催化作用。这表明掺杂剂浓度能显著改变材料的电子结构，从而影响催化性能。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 对隔离金属离子、掺杂剂和吸附物种之间复杂相互作用进行理论建模。
2. 优化制备过程，以达到所需的离子隔离和掺杂剂分布水平。
3. 通过找到最佳掺杂剂浓度和制备条件来平衡效率和选择性。
4. 确保这些催化剂使用的安全性，特别是在氧化脱氢反应中处理氧活化时。

这些发现强调了在镍氧化物基催化剂用于氧化脱氢反应时，需要仔细控制制备方法和掺杂剂浓度，以达到所需的电子结构和催化性能。
