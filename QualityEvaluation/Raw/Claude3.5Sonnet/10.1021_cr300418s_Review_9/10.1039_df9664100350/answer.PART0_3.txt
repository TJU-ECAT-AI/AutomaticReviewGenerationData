[1] "By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, where ions of stable valency (Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced by isolation."

[2] "Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O have also been investigated."

[3] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."

[4] "Chemisorption occurs preferentially on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as nickel ions are diluted."

[5] "The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ ions, which gives rise to p-type semiconductivity in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

Preparation methods: The study describes preparing solid solutions of NixMg1-xO at 1200°C, where magnesium ions are interposed between nickel ions without changing the structure. This method allows for the isolation of nickel ions and the study of how this isolation affects chemisorption properties and catalytic activity.

Dopant concentrations: The activity per nickel ion increases as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1% nickel. This suggests that the concentration of dopants plays a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance.

Vacancy formation: While not explicitly discussed in the given text for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the study mentions that the nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen is more relevant for catalysis than the drift of charge across Ni2+/Ni3+ ions.

Key challenges in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Developing accurate models to predict the behavior of isolated nickel ions in the magnesium oxide matrix and their interaction with reactants.

2. Process optimization: Balancing the concentration of nickel ions to achieve maximum catalytic activity while maintaining selectivity.

3. Efficiency and selectivity: Understanding the relationship between the reversible oxygen adsorption that develops as nickel ions are diluted and the catalytic activity to improve both efficiency and selectivity.

4. Safety: Ensuring that the preparation methods and operating conditions for these catalysts are safe, especially considering the high temperatures used in preparation (1200°C).

While the study focuses on N2O decomposition rather than oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the insights gained about the influence of nickel ion isolation and concentration on catalytic activity could be relevant to other reactions, including oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene.

在氧化脱氢反应中，氧化镍基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。

制备方法：研究描述了在1200°C下制备NixMg1-xO固溶体，其中镁离子被插入镍离子之间而不改变结构。这种方法允许镍离子的隔离，并研究这种隔离如何影响化学吸附性质和催化活性。

掺杂剂浓度：随着镍离子被镁离子稀释，每个镍离子的活性增加，在镍含量约为1%时达到最大值。这表明掺杂剂的浓度在优化催化性能中起着关键作用。

空位形成：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确讨论氧化脱氢反应中的空位形成，但研究提到表面化学吸附氧形成的八面体络合物的性质比Ni2+/Ni3+离子间的电荷漂移对催化更为相关。

这些催化系统的主要挑战包括：

1. 理论模型：开发精确的模型来预测镁氧化物基体中孤立镍离子的行为及其与反应物的相互作用。

2. 过程优化：平衡镍离子的浓度，以在保持选择性的同时实现最大的催化活性。

3. 效率和选择性：理解镍离子稀释时发展的可逆氧吸附与催化活性之间的关系，以提高效率和选择性。

4. 安全性：确保这些催化剂的制备方法和操作条件是安全的，特别是考虑到制备中使用的高温（1200°C）。

虽然该研究集中在N2O分解而不是氧化脱氢反应，但关于镍离子隔离和浓度对催化活性影响的见解可能与其他反应相关，包括乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
