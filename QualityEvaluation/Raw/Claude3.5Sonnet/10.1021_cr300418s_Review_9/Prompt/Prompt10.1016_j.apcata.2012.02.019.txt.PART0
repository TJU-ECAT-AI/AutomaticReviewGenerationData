 to  hydrogen

 Introduction
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 ethylbenzene
 to
 styrene
 with
 CO2 is
 an
alternative
 process
 option
 for
 the
 styrene
 production.
 It
 has
 several
advantages
 over
 the
 normal
 production
 route
 via
 the
 steam-aided
dehydrogenation.
 This
 new
 process
 has
 an
 improved
 conversion,
higher
 selectivity,
 is
 safer,
 and
 is
 less
 energy
 consuming
 [16].
The
 steam-aided
 dehydrogenation
 process
 is
 responsible
 for
about
 85%
 of
 the
 worldwide
 production
 of
 styrene.
 This
 process
uses
 a
 potassium
 promoted
 iron
 oxide
 catalyst
 and
 requires
 a
 high
molar
 ratio
 of
 steam
 to
 ethylbenzene
 of
 710.
 Steam
 is
 an
 essential
part
 of
 the
 process.
 Several
 functions
 have
 been
 attributed
 to
 H2O
in
 the
 process
 [7,8]:
• provides
 the
 energy
 for
 the
 endothermic
 dehydrogenation
 reac-
tion
 (125
 kJ/mol
 at
 600 C);
• acts
 as
 a
 diluent,
 improving
 the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 of
 the
reaction;
• brings
 the
 catalyst
 to
 the
 right
 active
 oxidation
 state;
• cleans
 the
 catalyst
 from
 coke
 deposits
 by
 coke
 gasification;

 (M.

• provides
 easy
 separation
 of
 diluent
 and
 product
 stream.
Carbon
 dioxide
 is
 believed
 to
 act
 in
 a
 similar
 way,
 with
 some
additional
 advantages.
 Its
 heat
 capacity
 is
 higher,
 requiring
 less
diluent
 from
 an
 energetic
 point
 of
 view.
 Under
 the
 dehydrogena-
tion
 conditions,
 CO2 is
 considered
 to
 be
 a
 mild
 oxidant
 like
 steam
and
 is
 able
 to
 re-oxidize
 the
 catalyst.
 It
 is
 claimed
 that
 coke
 can
 be
removed
 by
 the
 reverse
 Boudouard
 reaction.
 Carbon
 dioxide
 is
 a
permanent
 gas,
 making
 the
 separation
 of
 the
 product
 stream
 eas-
ier.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 CO2 can
 react
 with
 the
 formed
 H2 via
the
 reverse
 watergas-shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
 and,
 thereby,
 shifting
the
 equilibrium
 conversion
 to
 higher
 values
 [16].
The
 RWGS
 reaction
 is
 a
 mildly
 endothermic
 reaction
 (36
 kJ/mol
at
 600 C)
 and
 makes
 the
 process
 more
 endothermic,
 but
 the
increased
 conversion
 per
 pass
 easily
 makes
 up
 for
 those
 additional
costs
 [2].  The
 RWGS
 reaction
 and
 its
 counterpart,
 the
 watergas-
shift
 (WGS)
 reaction,
 are
 well
 known
 and
 widely
 practiced.
 The
WGS
 reaction
 is
 used
 in
 hydrogen
 production
 e.g.
 for
 the
 ammo-
nia
 production,
 the
 methanol
 synthesis,
 and
 the
 Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis.
 For
 the
 WGS
 reaction
 there
 is
 a
 high
 temperature
 and
 a
low
 temperature
 process
 with
 different
 catalysts.
 The
 low
 tempera-
ture
 WGS
 process
 (210240 C)
 is
 most
 favorable
 for
 H2 production,
a
 copper
 based
 catalyst
 (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3)
 is
 used
 here
 [9]. A
 low
temperature
 does
 not
 always
 match
 with
 the
 desired
 process
 con-
ditions,
 and
 as
 copper
 is
 not
 stable

 The
 high
 temperature
 (300500 C)
 WGS
process
 uses
 an
 iron
 oxide
 based
 catalyst
 (Fe2O3/Cr2O3),
 but
 the
conversions
 are
 lower
 because
 of
 the
 equilibrium
 limitations
 [9].
The
 mechanism
 of
 (R)WGS
 can
 be
 either
 an
 associative
 or
 redox
type
 [9].  In
 the
 associative
 mechanism,
 the
 reactants
 adsorb,
 form
an
 intermediate,
 break
 into
 the
 products,
 and
 desorb
 [11,12].
 The
redox
 mechanism
 consists
 of
 adsorption,
 reduction
 of
 the
 catalyst
by
 H2 or
 CO,
 and
 oxidation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 by
 CO2 or
 H2O,
 and
desorption
 [1216].  In
 the
 associative
 mechanism,
 CO
 can
 only
 be
formed
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 hydrogen.
 With
 the
 redox
 mechanism,
the
 CO
 production
 or
 H2O
 production
 should
 be
 observed
 without
the
 presence
 of
 the
 other
 reactant.
The
 dehydrogenation
 process
 in
 CO2 can
 be
 considered
 as
two
 consecutive
 reactions:
 a
 dehydrogenation
 (1)
 followed
 by
 the
RWGS
 (2);
 or
 as
 a
 direct
 dehydrogenation
 by
 CO2 (3)
 [2,6,17].
 These
two
 variations
 are
 comparable
 to
 the
 associative
 and
 redox
 mecha-
nism
 in
 (R)WGS.
 Carbon
 dioxide
 will
 oxidize
 the
 catalyst,
 or
 form
 a
reactive
 intermediate.
 Ethylbenzene,
 or
 hydrogen
 for
 that
 matter,
will
 reduce
 the
 catalyst,
 or
 it
 reacts
 with
 the
 intermediate
 species
on
 the
 catalyst.
 Both
 pathways
 are
 discussed
 in
 literature
 and
 both
seem
 to
 be
 possible.
 The
 two-step
 pathway,
 where
 both
 hydrogen
and
 CO
 are
 produced
 is
 most
 favorable
 from
 a
 thermodynamic
 point
of
 view
 and
 will
 give
 the
 highest
 theoretical
 styrene
 yield.

The
 role
 of
 the
 RWGS
 reaction
 has
 already
 been
 subject
 of
 previ-
ous
 research
 [2,6,17].
 However,
 the
 RWGS
 experiments
 were
 often
done
 under
 different
 reaction
 conditions,

son

compared
 the
 CO2 conversions
 of
 the
 different
 catalysts
 in
 the
presence
 and
 absence
 of
 dehydrogenation
 (Fig.
 1).
 Catalysts,
 con-
taining
 iron
 or
 chromium,
 were
 quite
 active
 for
 the
 RWGS
 alone,
but
 the
 vanadium
 containing
 catalysts
 performed
 much
 better
 in
combination
 with
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 Vanadium
 cata-
lysts
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 yield
 higher
 CO2 conversions
 than
the
 iron
 or
 chromium
 catalysts.
 This
 was
 explained
 by
 a
 differ-
ence
 in
 mechanism
 for
 vanadium
 and
 other
 catalysts.
 Vanadium
would
 follow
 more
 the
 one-step
 pathway
 with
 the
 involvement
 of
atomic
 hydrogen;
 whereas
 the
 other
 catalysts
 would
 follow
 more
the
 two-step
 pathway
 with
 molecular
 hydrogen
 (Fig.
 2).
 Conditions
in
 those
 experiments
 were
 not
 exactly
 the
 same
 for
 dehydrogena-
tion
 and
 RWGS:
 the
 contact
 time
 was
 doubled
 for
 dehydrogenation
experiments,
 and
 EB
 was
 never
 completely
 converted
 making
 the
amount
 of
 hydrogen
 produced
 deficient
 compared
 to
 the
 RWGS
reaction
 conditions.
 An
 absolute
 comparison
 of
 the
 CO2 conversions
is,
 therefore,
 extremely
 difficult
 [17].
The
 goal
 of
 this
 study
 is
 to
 investigate
 the
 role
 of
 the
 RWGS
 reac-
tion
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2.
 This
 systematic
 study
 applies
the
 most
 used
 catalysts
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation:
 iron,
 vanadium,
and
 chromium,
 supported
 on
 alumina;
 un-promoted
 and
 promoted
with
 potassium
 or
 magnesium.
 RWGS
 experiments
 are
 done
 in
 the
presence
 and
 absence
 of
 the
 dehydrogenation
 under
 comparable
conditions
 for
 good
 comparison.
 Based
 on
 our
 recent
 insights
 into
dehydrogenation
 catalysis
 [18],
 also
 coked
 catalysts
 and
 support
are
 included.
 Based
 on
 the
 results,
 the
 reaction
 pathway
 of
 the
dehydrogenation
 in
 CO2 and
 the
 mechanism
 of
 RWGS
 is
 discussed.

The
 dehydrogenation
 experiments
 were
 performed
 under
 the
same
 temperature
 and
 pressure
 as
 the
 RWGS
 studies.
 The
 test-
ing
 was
 done
 in
 a
 parallel
 fixed
 bed
 setup
 with
 six
 reactors.
 Each
reactor
 had
 an
 independent
 gas
 (CO2 or

 feed
 and
 liquid
 feed
(ethylbenzene).
 The
 temperature
 and
 the
 pressure
 of
 all
 reactors
were
 set
 at
 600 C
 and
 atmospheric
 pressure.
 The
 amount
 of

alyst
 loaded
 was
 1000
 mg,
 in
 a

 quartz
 tube
(about
 12

 The
 catalyst
 bed
 was
 held
 between
 lay-
ers
 of
 SiC
 (10

 to
 hold
 it
 in
 position
 and
 to
 preheat
 the
 feed.
 The
liquid
 EB

 rate
 was
 1
 g/h
 (3.6

 rate
 was

 resulting
 in
 a

 Catalyst
 characterization
After
 each

 a
 sample
 of
 the
 catalyst
 was
 ana-
lyzed
 to
 determine
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
 by
 a
 TGA
 (MettlerToledo

 20
 mg  sample
 of

 using
 a
 ramp
 of
 3 C/min
 from

 to

 and

 were
 determined
 of
 both
 fresh
and
 spent
 catalyst
 samples
 by
 N2 adsorption
 at
 196 C
 (Quan-

 The
 samples
 were
 pre-treated
 overnight
in
 nitrogen
 at
 250 C.
Temperature
 programmed
 reduction
 (TPR)
 was
 carried
 out
 in
 a
fixed
 bed
 reactor
 system
 connected
 to
 a
 TCD
 and
 a
 MS  for
 mon-
itoring
 the
 hydrogen
 consumption
 and
 the
 methane
 formation
(only
 detected
 >
 650 C).
 The
 heating
 rate
 was
 5 C/min,
 the
 sample
amount
 was
 200
 mg  for
 each
 run.
 The
 flows
 of
 H2 and
 Ar
 were
 set
to
 2.6
 and
 25.2
 ml/min,
 giving
 a
 9.3

 The
 TPR
 was
calibrated
 with

 Ethylbenzene
 dehydrogenation,

Six
 of
 the
 nine
 supported
 catalyst
 samples
 were
 tested
 for
 their
performance
 in
 the
 ethylbenzene
 dehydrogenation,
 in
 both
 car-
bon
 dioxide
 (CO2)
 and
 nitrogen
 (N2)
 diluent.
 Their
 ethylbenzene
conversion
 and
 styrene
 selectivities
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.
 3.
 All
 six
catalysts
 initially
 show
 a
 difference
 in
 conversion
 for
 the
 CO2 and
N2 diluent,
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 CO2 diluent.
 The
 differences
 in
 selectiv-
ities
 are
 rather
 small,
 in
 CO2 there
 is
 a
 little
 more
 surplus
 H2 and
CO
 (than
 expected
 from
 styrene
 yield).
 In
 the
 first
 hours,
 all
 the
selectivities
 increase
 to
 stable
 and
 high
 levels
 of
 9295%.
 The
 dif-
ferences
 in
 the
 catalyst
 activity
 are
 clearly
 present,
 especially
 for
the
 KV
 catalyst.
 In
 CO2 diluent
 the
 EB
 conversion
 is
 about
 10%
higher
 than
 that
 in
 N2.
 For
 the
 Cr
 catalyst
 the
 difference
 is
 about
 5%,
initially.
 All
 catalysts
 show
 a
 decreasing
 conversion,
 only
 the
 iron
catalysts
 in
 CO2 exhibit
 a
 maximum
 in
 the
 ethylbenzene
 conversion
after
 24
 h
 time
 on
 stream.
With
 an
 increase
 in
 time
 on
 stream,
 all
 the
 catalysts
 deactivate.
The
 conversions
 after
 20
 h
 time
 on
 stream
 are
 down
 to
 4050%,
while
 initially
 they
 had
 an
 EB
 conversion
 between
 7090%.
 The
 dif-
ferences
 between
 the
 experiments
 using
 CO2 and
 N2 diluent
 are
also
 decreasing
 in
 time.
 For
 most
 catalysts,
 the
 performance
 in
 CO2
or
 N2 is
 almost
 identical
 after
 1520
 h.
 The

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene), and what are the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
