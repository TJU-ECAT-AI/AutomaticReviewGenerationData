Abstract
The effects of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of the ceria(111) surface are studied using first-principles density
functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interaction. The atomic structures, electronic structure, and the vacancy forma-
tion energies of the Zr-doped and undoped ceria(111) surfaces are compared. It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of
the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show
much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr
dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on
the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure
modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared
to the pure ceria.

1. Introduction
Ceria plays very important roles in various catalytic
reactions [1], for example, the water gas shift (WGS) reac-
tion, CO oxidation reaction or automotive exhaust abate-
ment reactions, soot removal reaction from diesel engines
and other redox and electrochemical reactions. The most
critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs)
in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under
fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich
conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and
Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen
storage capacity (OSC). The thermal deactivation of TWCs
at high temperature is believed to be related to the loss of
the OSC of ceria. It is therefore an important challenge
to develop new CeO2-based materials with both high redox
activity (large OSC) and high thermal resistance, as demon-
strated by the many studies on this subject in the literature.
For example, it has been shown that the redox properties
and the thermal stability of CeO2 can be greatly enhanced
with the addition of zirconium, leading to the formation of
a CeO2ZrO2 solid solution [516]. With such special prop-
erties, the ceria/zirconia mixed oxides have, therefore, re-
placed pure ceria in TWCs.
A decade ago, a small number of theoretical studies of
Zr-doped ceria appeared using force-field simulation meth-
ods to model bulk [17] or surface [18] of the CeO2ZrO2 so-
lid solutions in the full composition range. The results in
Ref. [17] suggested that even a small addition of ZrO2 to
bulk ceria decreases the bulk reduction energy to values
comparable to those for surface reduction of pure ceria.
Moreover, the oxygen migration in the material was found
to decrease almost monotonically with the concentration of
ZrO2. Ref. [18] found that the addition of zirconia

decreased the reduction energy at the (111) and (110)
surfaces.
After a few very early first-principles studies of bulk cer-
ia using density functional theory (DFT) [19] and periodic
HartreeFock calculations [20,21] many new first-principle
studies have appeared in the last 5 years especially. The
vast majority of these have focused on the bulk and sur-
faces of pure ceria [2226]. First-principles studies for Zr-
doped ceria and its reduction properties are very few, how-
ever. Rodriguez et al. [26] used plane wave pseudopotential
DFT calculations to study the bulk properties of ceria with
different Zr dopant concentrations and reproduced the X-
ray diffraction-determined contraction of the cell parame-
ters with increasing Zr content. Yang et al. [27] elaborated
in detail on the differences in atomic structure, electronic
structure, and reduction properties between undoped and
Zr-doped CeO2 bulk using DFT methodology with the
inclusion of an on-site Coulomb interaction (the DFT + U
method [28,29]) and came to the conclusion that the Zr
doping enhances the formation of the oxygen vacancy in
the vicinity of the Zr centers.
It is clear that in heterogeneous catalysis the redox char-
acter at the surface is of essential importance. In fact, dif-
ferent faces (surface structures) of the same material
often demonstrate different catalytic activities. Recent stud-
ies [30,31] from Metius group showed that doping the
TiO2(110) or CeO2(111) surfaces with some kind of for-
eign metal atoms (e.g. Au, Ag, Cu, etc.) can weaken the
bond between the surface oxygen atoms and the doped
oxide, making it more reactive and suggesting that doping
is a general method for modifying the reactivity of oxide-
based catalysts. In the present paper, we study the redox
properties of a Zr-doped CeO2(111) surface. The goal of
this study is to pinpoint how Zr doping affects the oxygen
vacancy formation energy at the surface and to what extent
this effect differs from the bulk. We thus make comparisons
between surface and bulk and between doped and undoped
systems.
We will also briefly discuss the electron density distribu-
tion related to the electrons left by the departing O atom on
reduction. The features of the electron redistribution occur-
ring when an oxygen atom is released by CeO2 are a ques-
tion which has lately been under intense discussion in the
literature. Experimentally, valence band photoemission
studies [3235], e.g. the X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
have shown that a new state appears in the energy gap be-
tween the top of the valence band and the bottom of the
unoccupied Ce 4f band for partially reduced Ceria systems
(either undoped or doped), which was suggested to bring
about partial occupation of the Ce 4f states in connection
with the formation of the Ce3+. DFT calculations with
the
on-site
Coulomb
interaction
(DFT + U)
method
[28,29] was used to study reduced CeO2 bulk or surfaces
[25,36,37] and Zr-doped CeO2 bulk [27] and showed also
the appearance of a new gap state between the valence
and the empty Ce 4f band and the localization of this
gap state on two Ce3+ ions neighboring the oxygen va-
cancy. This localization was also confirmed by wave-func-
tion based calculations at the MP2 level [38]. However, no
such state is found in standard DFT calculations for re-
duced ceria [24,25,39], where instead the Ce 4f states are
found to cross the Fermi level and the excess electrons left
by the removed oxygen atom delocalize over many cerium
ions. In the present paper, we study the Zr-doped
CeO2(111) surface by using the DFT + U method and a
ceriazirconia solid solution model with a Zr concentration
of 0.25 (i.e., Ce0.75Zr0.25O2).
The computational details are presented in Section 2.
The calculated results are presented in Section 3, where
the effects of Zr doping are discussed by comparing the dif-
ferences in atomic structures, electronic structures and
reduction energies for undoped and Zr-doped CeO2. A
conclusion is given in Section 4.
2. Methodology
2.1. Calculations
As mentioned in the introduction, the standard DFT
formulation with local-density approximation (LDA) or
GGA functionals usually fails to describe strongly corre-
lated electrons because of a deficient treatment of electron
correlation, combined with an incomplete cancellation be-
tween the self-interaction in the Coulomb interaction with
the exchange interaction [40]. In the current paper, we have
used the DFT + U method [28,29], where a Hubbard
parameter U is introduced for the Ce 4f electrons to de-
scribe the on-site Coulomb interaction. This modifies the
self-interaction error and enhances the description of corre-
lation effects. We have chosen a U value of 5.0 eV accord-
ing to the results of Nolan et al. [39], who reported that for
U P 5.0 eV, the electronic structure was essentially con-
verged with respect to localization.
Spin-polarized DFT + U [28,29] calculations were per-
formed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP) [41,42]. The electron exchange and correlation
interactions were treated within the GGA using the Per-
dewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE) functional [43]. The projec-
tor-augmented
wave
method
(PAW)
[44,45]
with
gradient-corrected functions were applied to treat the core
electrons. The cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f, 6s electrons, oxygen 2s,
2p electrons, and zirconium 5s, 4d, 5p electrons were trea-
ted as valence electrons. The KohnSham orbitals were ex-
panded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoffof
30 Ry. The Brillouin-zone integrations were performed
using Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grids [46] and a Gaussian
smearing [46] of SIGMA = 0.2 eV. The final results were
extrapolated to those of SIGMA=0 eV. MP grids of
8  8  8 k-points were used for the bulk unit cells (i.e.
the stoichiometric ceria bulk and the Zr-doped ceria bulk)
and MP grids of 4  4  1 k-points for the surfaces [i.e. the
1200

(111) surfaces of CeO2 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2], based on con-
vergence studies.
2.2. Description of the model systems
Calculations for bulk CeO2 were performed for a 12-
atom unit cell. Our optimized lattice constant for stoichi-
ometric CeO2 is 5.48 A
 (the experimental value [47] is
5.41 A
 ). A solid solution of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 was simulated
by introducing a Zr dopant atom into the bulk cubic cell
of CeO2. The cubic cell of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 was then opti-
mized with respect to both the cell parameter and the atom-
ic positions until the force on each atom was less than
0.02 eV/A
and the stress tensor on the cell less than
0.1 GPa. Our calculated lattice constant is 5.42 A
 , i.e. we
obtain a cell axis contraction of 0.06 A
 . Experimental stud-
ies also clearly indicate that the cell parameter decreases
when Zr is mixed into ceria [3,26,48]. For the present com-
position, experiments give a cell parameter of approxi-
mately 5.37 A
 , i.e. a contraction of 0.04 A
 .
The (111) surfaces were created by cleaving the opti-
mized bulk cells. The CeO2(111) and the Ce0.75Zr0.25-
O2(111) surfaces were modeled as slabs, periodically
repeated (in z), consisting of 12 atomic layers. The doped
system contains 25% Zr ions in each of the cation layers.
The p(2  2) lateral cell for the undoped material is the
equivalent of the p(1  1) lateral cell for the doped material
and these cells are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (note that the fig-
ures also indicate the sites of the vacancy so, strictly speak-
ing, the cells as shown are p(1  1) in all cases). The x and y
dimensions of the unit cells were fixed at the calculated
equilibrium lattice parameters for the respective bulk sys-
tems. The bottom six atomic layers were fixed at their bulk
position to mimic the bulk. The positions of the ions in the
remaining layers were fully optimized in x, y and z (under
the restriction of fixed cell parameters). A vacuum layer of
13 A
 was introduced on top of the free surface to separate
the films.
The reduced systems were created by removing one oxy-
gen atom from ones side of the CeO2(111) and Ce0.75Z-
r0.25O2(111)
slabs
and
the
six
upper
layers
were
reoptimized. Two different locations for the vacancy at
the surface were considered in the doped case.
The closest ZrZr and vacancyvacancy distances in the
doped surface systems are 7.651 A
 . For the bulk systems,
the corresponding distances are 10.90 A
 [27].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The effect of Zr doping on the structure of unreduced
CeO2(111) surface
Ceria has a cubic fluorite structure with eight oxygen
neighbors for each cerium ion. The (111) surface of this
structure constitutes the most dense lattice plane, and as
a result it can be expected to be the lowest-energy surface,
as was verified in previous calculations (see, for example
Refs. [22,24]). From a somewhat different point of view,
when forming from bulk, the (111) surface for the fluorite
lattice breaks the least number (only one) of CeO bonds
of bulk ceria, as a result, the (111) surface should be the
most stable surface compare to other surfaces.
The relaxed CeO2(111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) slabs
are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. As mentioned al-
ready in the 2004 papers [24,39], the relaxation of
CeO2(111) surface is quite small and the addition of the
Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria has no sig-
nificant consequences, as seen in Ref. [37]. In agreement
with the LDA and GGA results of Refs. [24,39] and with
the early HartreeFock results of Ref. [20], we thus find
that, compared to the bulk-terminated structure, there is
a slight contraction in the four atomic layers from the sur-
face (i.e. the interlayer distances contract by less than
0.003 A
 ). The CeO bond lengths between the uppermost
O layer and the next Ce layer exhibit a very slight shorten-
ing (by less than 0.003 A
 ) compared to the value in the bulk
(2.369 A
 ). This value is smaller as compared with that
(0.03 A
 ) reported in the earlier papers (Refs. [24,39]).
In contrast, the relaxation on the (111) surface of the
Zr-doped ceria is found to be so large that the structure
is significantly disturbed, especially in the vicinity of the
Zr doping centers. The largest change takes place in
the top layers, where the three oxygen atoms nearest to
the Zr move towards the Zr center by 0.192 A
 as shown
in
Fig.
2.
As
a
result,
the
ZrO
bond
length
of
Ce0.75Zr0.25-O2(111) surface is reduced to 2.089 A
 in the
top layers; the optimized Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 bulk value is
2.281 A
 . In contrast, the CeO distances around the Zr
dopant (2.4582.459 A
 ) in the top layers are elongated by
about 0.089 A
 as compared with the CeO distance in the
ceria bulk (2.369 A
 ).
Such a large perturbation induced by the Zr dopant
leads to nonequivalent O atoms in the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)
surface, which might be connected to the high oxygen
mobility as seen in ceriazirconia mixed oxide [48,49].
3.2. The effect of Zr doping on the structure of partially
reduced CeO2(111) surface
The partially reduced (111) surfaces of CeO2 and
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 were simulated by removing an oxygen atom
from the topmost layer of the optimized slabs. The opti-
mized CeO2(111) slab contains four equivalent oxygen
ions in the top layer (coordinated by three Ce ions in the
layer below) as shown in Fig. 1a and therefore only one re-
duced
structure
results.
For
the
optimized
Ce0.75Z-
r0.25O2(111) surface, however, the four O ions in the top
layer of the periodic are not all equivalent: one of these
oxygens is surrounded by three Ce neighbors, while three
of the oxygens are each coordinated by two Ce ions and
one Zr ion. Creating an O vacancy at the former type of
site (Va) or at the latter site (Vb) will therefore result in
two different reduced structures. The two types of vacancy
sites are labeled in the picture of the optimized unreduced
structure in Fig. 1b.
Thus an O atom was removed from the CeO2(111) sur-
face (an arbitrary surface O ion, labeled V in Fig. 1a)
and from the Va and Vb sites at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)
surface. The structures were reoptimized and the ionic dis-
placements around the oxygen vacancy are shown in Figs.
3 (undoped system) and 4 (Zr doping and the Vb site).
The
relaxed
structure
of
the
reduced,
undoped
CeO2(111) surface is shown in Fig. 3, where the position
of the vacancy is labeled by a V. Upon full relaxation,
the surface structure is severely perturbed and thus the ini-
tial symmetry of the three Ce ions around the vacancy is
broken as found by Nolan et al. [25]. The main features
of this perturbation as shown in Fig. 3b are that the nearest
neighbor Ce cations move away from the center of the va-
cancy by 0.100 A
 and 0.163 A
 , respectively. The smaller
displacement refer to the cerium cations which are reduced
as shown below and are denoted as Ce3+, and the larger
displacements correspond to the unreduced cerium cation
(denoted as Ce4+). The next nearest neighbor O anions
(in the subsurface layer) displace by 0.116 A
 (the O ions
coordinated to the two Ce3+ ions) and 0.228 A
 (the O ions
coordinated to both Ce3+ and Ce4+) toward the center of
the vacancy. This is in agreement with the rearrangement
pattern observed by Esch et al. in the high-resolution scan-
ning
tunneling
microscope
(STM)
images
on
the
CeO2(111) surface [50].
An important contributing factor to the structural rear-
rangement on reduction is the positive electric field gener-
ated by the vacancy and resulting in the cations being
repelled away from it and the anions being attracted to it.
In addition, compared to the calculated CeO bond length
in stoichiometric surface (2.369 A
 ), the surface CeO dis-
tances involving Ce4+ ion are contracted by 0.10 A
 and
the CeO distances (involving the Ce3+ ions) are slightly
elongated 0.03 A
 . This slight elongation of Ce3+O dis-
tances can be attributed, on the one hand, to the increased
ionic radius of the Ce3+ ions, and, on the other hand, to the
reduced Coulomb attraction compared to Ce4+O.
For the Zr-doped CeO2(111) slab with an O vacancy,
we find that the relaxed atomic structure of the Va model
is very similar to that of the undoped reduced CeO2(111)
slab. The main features of the structural perturbation are
that two nearest neighbor Ce cations displace away the va-
cancy by 0.119 A
 and one by 0.194 A
 . The smaller displace-
ment refer to reduced Ce3+ ions, and the larger
displacements corresponds to the unreduced Ce4+ ions.
1202
Z. Yang et al. / Surface Science 602 (2008) 11991206
It is the Ce ion opposite to the Zr4+ ion which remains
unreduced.
The relaxed structure of the Vb model (Fig. 4) shows a
quite different relaxation pattern as compared with that
of the undoped reduced surface. The oxygen anion neigh-
boring the vacancy but residing far from the Zr dopant
moves away from the vacancy instead of moving towards
the vacancy. It will be shown that this O ion is neighboring
two reduced Ce3+ cations. The oxygen anions neighboring
both the vacancy and the Zr dopant move towards the va-
cancy, similar to the undoped surface, but with much larger
displacements (0.53 A
 ). The ZrO bond lengths involving
the subsurface oxygens neighboring the vacancy (see
Fig. 4b) are shortened by 0.419 A
 (from 2.529 A
 for the
unreduced Zr-doped surface to 2.111 A
 when the vacancy
is introduced), while the Ce3+O bond lengths are elon-
gated by about 0.0500.148 A
 compared to their counter-
parts in the unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface (from
2.288 to 2.294 A
 ).
3.3. The effects of Zr doping on vacancy formation energies
As mentioned in the introduction, it has been found that
the reducibility of CeO2(111) surface is greatly enhanced

clarity.

by Zr doping [18,51], and the very recent DFT + U results
of Yang et al. [27] for Zr-doped bulk ceria showed that the
oxygen vacancy is more easily created at sites close to the
Zr centers and that the two electrons left by the released
oxygen localize on two Ce ions neighboring the vacancy.
In this section, we will study the effects of Zr doping on
the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy at the Ce0.75Z-
r0.25O2(111) and CeO2(111) surfaces. Here, the vacancy
formation energy (Evac) is calculated by
Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab
1
where E(slabvac) and E(slab) are the total energies of the
slabs with and without a vacancy, and E(O2) is the calcu-
lated total energy for the ground state of an optimized oxy-
gen molecule in the gas phase (calculated using a large unit
cell with the dimensions of 8  8  10 A
 3). A positive value
for Evac means that energy is needed to create an oxygen
vacancy.
The calculated results for the undoped and doped
CeO2(111) surfaces are shown in Table 1. The calculated
value of Evac for the undoped CeO2(111) surface is
2.87 eV per vacancy, close to the corresponding DFT + U
result of Nolan et al. (2.60 eV). On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)
surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation en-
ergy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy
is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb). For Va,
we obtain an Evac value of 2.78 eV, approximately 0.10 eV
below the undoped value.
Considering that in the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) system,
there are many Zr doping centers (25% of the cations sites),
which offer many sites (75% of the surface oxygen anions)
like Vb with lower reduction energies, the integral effects in
enhancing the reducibility will be very appreciable.
3.4. The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure
The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structures has
been analysed via the electronic density of states (DOS)
(Fig. 5) and electron density distribution (Fig. 6) for re-
duced and unreduced CeO2(111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)
surfaces. The DOS for the unreduced CeO2(111) surface
given in Fig. 5a shows a typical peak structure of bulk
CeO2, suggesting that the stoichiometric surface has insula-
tor properties as well. The highest occupied valence band
exhibits significant O 2p character mixed with some contri-
bution from Ce 4f5d, while the narrow band situated just
above the Fermi level consists primarily of Ce 4f states.
The states situated above the empty Ce 4f states (not shown
here) are mostly due to Ce 5d and 6s. The energy gap be-
tween the top of the valence band and the bottom of unoc-
cupied
Ce
4f
states
has
the
width
of
1.9 eV,
the
experimental value [52] is 3.0 eV.
Fig. 5b presents the DOS of the reduced CeO2(111) sur-
face. In agreement with the previous DFT + U results
[25,27,36,39], it is found that a new peak appears between
the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccu-
pied Ce 4f states in our calculated electronic density of
states, and the Fermi level locates in the gap between this
new peak and the empty Ce 4f states. This is consistent
with the previous experimental conclusions that the reduc-
tion of CeO2 surfaces results in partial occupation of the Ce
4f and the formation of Ce3+ ions, as shown by XPS,
XANES measurements [32,34,35,51]. In addition, analysis
of the partial electron density (corresponding to the elec-
trons which give rise to the new gap state) shows that the
electrons occupying the Ce 4f gap states are localized on
two of the Ce ions next to the oxygen vacancy (Fig. 6a).
The integration of the gap DOS peak using the Bader anal-
ysis [53] for the partial charge density gives a total of al-

most exactly two electrons. Each of the two reduced Ce
ions receives about 0.94 electrons, which confirms that
the two excess electrons are mostly transferred to two
Ce4+ ions that are reduced to Ce3+ cations. This asymmet-
ric electron distribution thus perturbs the surface symmetry
around the vacancy and causes an asymmetric atomic dis-
placement in the surface layers, as discussed in the former
section.
The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure can
be seen in the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) (the Vb model) in Fig. 5c and d. It is
found that the DOSs for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and the
CeO2(111) systems are very similar, which suggests that
the Zr doping has no obvious effect on the electronic struc-
ture when the O vacancy is created: the two excess electrons
left by the released oxygen still localize on two Ce ions
neighboring the vacancy, in agreement with the experimen-
tal results [12,51]. The electrons left upon O loss go to Ce
ions. There is no empty Zr state appropriate to localize
the left-over electrons, and the Zr ion is not reducible. Sim-
ilar to the DOS for the unreduced CeO2(111) as shown in
Fig. 5a, the DOS in Fig. 5c shows that the unreduced
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) also has the properties of insulator.
The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above
the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is
shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives
again the total number of two electrons, which are almost
completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cat-
ions of the vacancy. Also in this case, each of the two Ce
cations receives about 0.94 electrons and is reduced to a
Ce3+. The electron localization is clearly seen from the par-
tial charge density plots for the new DOS peak as shown in
Fig. 6b.
4. Conclusions
The structure and electronic properties of CeO2(111)
and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces were investigated in detail
applying DFT + U method which ensures a better descrip-
tion for the strong electron correlation effects in the Ce4f
states. It is found that the formation of an oxygen vacancy
is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close
to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy
by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy. The formation of each
oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations
neighboring the O vacancy. The effect of Zr doping on
the electronic structures of the unreduced system is very
mild,
with
no
obvious
difference
between
Ce0.75Z-
r0.25O2(111) and CeO2(111). On the other hand Zr doping
induces a large perturbation on the atomic structures of re-
duced and unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces and en-
hances the generation of nonequivalent oxygen anions and
the displacement of oxygen around the Zr centers. This
may be the reason that is responsible for the big reduction
in the oxygen formation energy. For a ceriazirconia solid
solution like our model system of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111), the
Zr doping centers are as many as 25% of the cations sites,
which thus offer active oxygen sites up to 75% of the total
number of the surface oxygen anions. All of these active
oxygen sites have lower reduction energies as compared
to the pure ceria surface; therefore, the integral effects of
enhancing the reducibility should be appreciable, in agree-
ment with the experimental results that the redox proper-
ties and the thermal stability of CeO2 can be greatly
enhanced with the addition of zirconium due to forming
CeO2ZrO2 solid solution [516]. The effects of Zr doping
in enhancing the reactivity of CeO2 are in agreement with
Metius finding that doping can modify the reactivity of
oxide-based catalysts [30,31].
