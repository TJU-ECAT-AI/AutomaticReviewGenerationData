Abstract
The catalytic performance of a series of LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts with different vanadium loadings was investigated for the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as oxidant. The addition of La3+ has an effect of hindering carbon deposition and enhancing the stability of the
catalysts. The 10%La2O315%V2O5/SBA-15 (wt%) catalyst exhibited the best activity and stability, giving a styrene yield of 74%. According to
the results of characterization, the good performance of the catalyst could be related to the mono-dispersion of the VO4
3 species and the
synergistic action of lanthanum and vanadium.

1. Introduction
Styrene monomer is mainly produced via the catalytic
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) over potassium-doped
hematite catalyst at 600700 8C [1]. It is known that the EB
conversion is low due to thermodynamic equilibrium limita-
tion. The introduction of a promoter such as Cr, Ce, Mg or Mo
to the catalyst can enhance EB dehydrogenation and styrene
selectivity [2]. Due to the strong endothermic effect, a large
amount of superheated steam has to be added to reduce the
reactant partial pressure and to avoid coke formation [1,3].
Besides being energy consuming (constitute to ca. 10%
production cost), the introduction of superheated steam induces
potassium loss and leads to rapid deactivation of catalyst.
The dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of an oxidant
such as oxygen and nitrous oxide appears to be a better method.
The process with the direct use of oxygen leads to significant
decline of styrene selectivity due to formation of carbon oxides
and oxygenates [2,4]. Recently, CO2 has been investigated
extensively as a mild oxidant for EB dehydrogenation (EBDH)
[49]. Despite advantages such as low energy consumption and
less extent of coke formation, the use of CO2 over the
commercial FeCrK catalyst has been found to be unsatis-
factory. A number of novel materials such as vanadium or
vanadiumantimony oxide supported on MgO [10] and on
alumina [11], as well as vanadium [12] or CeO2ZrO2 [13]
supported on SBA-15 have been developed to catalyze the
process. Despite the high initial activity, the catalysts are
useless for the industry because they deactivate rapidly within
hours.
With uniform hexagonal ( p6mm) channels, narrow pore
size distribution (49 nm), and large internal surface area
(ca. 600920 m2/g [14]), the SBA-15 material is ideal for the
dispersion of catalytically active entities. Due to the low cost
and thick pore walls (3.16.4 nm) as well as the high
hydrothermal and thermal stability, SBA-15 has been con-
sidered to be a good support material for catalysts [1517]. In
the reported investigation, we used LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts
for the oxidation dehydrogenation of EB to styrene using CO2
as oxidant. We studied the influence of lanthanumvanadium
loading on catalytic performance, and characterized the
properties of catalysts before and after reaction by means
of XRD, BET, TPR, CO2-TPD and TG/DTA techniques
respectively.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation and regeneration of catalysts
Mesoporous SBA-15 was synthesized according to the
procedure reported by Zhao et al. [15]. Typically, 4 g Pluronic
P123 was dispersed in 150 ml of HCl (1.6 M) with stirring, then
9 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added drop by drop
to the aforementioned solution with vigorous stirring. After
further stirring of the sol mixture for 20 h at 40 8C, the mixture
was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal
treatment at 80 8C for 24 h. The resulted white solid was filtered
out, washed with DI water, and dried at room temperature (RT)
for 2 days. After that, the solid was heated from RT to 550 8C
(1 8C/min) and calcined at 550 8C for 6 h.
The series of LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by
means of incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-15 with a
solution of NH4VO3, La(NO3)36H2O, and oxalic acid, a way
similar to that described by Beck et al. [18]. The mixture was
stirred for 20 h at RT before being dried at 80 8C and calcined in
air at 550 8C for 5 h. The as-prepared 10%La2O310 to
20%V2O5/SBA-15 (wt%) samples are referred to as 10La10
20V/SBA-15 hereinafter. The regeneration of catalyst was by
means of heating in air at 550 8C for 3 h.
2.2. Catalysts evaluation
The EBDH reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz
reactor under atmospheric pressure in the 500600 8C range.
For each run, 0.3 g of catalyst was charged into the reactor. The
EB (5 mmol/h) was introduced by an evaporator at 62.5 8C with
a total flow rate of 15 ml/min (molar ratio of CO2/EB = 10:1).
Molecules such as styrene, benzene, toluene, and EB in the
effluent were condensed (ice/water trap) and analyzed by a
CP3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector and a CP Sil43CB capillary column. The gaseous
products (H2, CO2, CO, CH4) were analyzed on-line by gas
chromatograph (102G) equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) and a packed column of TDX-01. The EB
conversion and styrene selectivity were calculated according to
the procedure reported elsewhere [19].
2.3. Characterization of catalysts
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried
out on a Rigaku automatic Diffractometer (Rigaku D-MAX,
40 kV, 70 mA) with monochromatic Cu Ka radiation. The
specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore
diameter of samples were measured by N2 adsorption
desorption procedure using a NOVA 1200 instrument. The
samples were first out-gassed at 350 8C for 2 h in a flow of
nitrogen prior to measurement. TG/DTA analysis of the used
catalyst was performed in air on a ZRY-2P thermogravimetric
analyzer using an alumina pan from RT to 800 8C at a heating
rate of 10 8C/min.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) investigation
was carried out on a GC system. Approximately, 60 mg of
sample was charged into a quartz tube reactor, and in an 8%H2/
N2 flow (rate of 60 ml/min), the sample temperature was raised
to 800 8C at a heating rate of 10 8C/min. The amount of
hydrogen consumed was monitored by means of a TCD.
CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) of
LaVOx/SBA-15 was performed on a home-made system. The
sample of ca. 70 mg was charged into a quartz reactor and
pretreated at 350 8C in helium (25 ml/min) for 30 min. The
sample was then exposed to CO2 (25 ml/min) at RT for 1 h.
After helium purging (to remove gas-phase and physically
adsorbed CO2) to reach a stable baseline of CO2, the sample
was heated from RT to 800 8C at a heating rate of 10 8C/min
and the amount of desorbed CO2 was monitored by means of a
TCD.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. BET analysis
As shown in Fig. 1A, the N2 adsorptiondesorption
isotherms of SBA-15 and the LaVOx/SBA-15 samples are
type-IV in nature and exhibit H1 hysteresis loops, revealing the
Fig. 1. (A) Nitrogen adsorption isotherms and (B) pore size distribution of
different samples: (a) SBA-15, (b) 10La10V/SBA-15, (c) 10La15V/SBA-15, (d)
10La20V/SBA-15, and (e) used 10La20V/SBA-15.

mesoporous character
of
the
samples. The adsorption
desorption isotherm of SBA-15 exhibits a steep curve
(Fig. 1A (a)) at a relative pressure of 0.7 which is characteristic
of capillary condensation in uniform pores [20]. For the
hysteresis loops of the LaVOx/SBA-15 samples, there is clear
deviation
(Fig.
1A
(bd))
from
that
of
SBA-15.
The
phenomenon is attributed to the presence of LaVOx species
on the pore walls and/or the partial blockage of the SBA-15
pores. This is reflected in the decline in both specific surface
area (417.3467.6 m2/g) and pore volume (0.620.68 ml/g) of
the LaVOx/SBA-15 samples in comparison with that (697.1 m2/
g, 0.89 ml/g) of SBA-15. For a used 10La20V/SBA-15 sample,
the hysteresis loop (Fig. 1A (e)) appears to be H4-type,
attributable to the existence of slit pores. This could be an
indication that the deposition of carbon occurs mainly inside
the pores on the internal wall rather than at the pore openings.
As shown in Fig. 1B (a), the SBA-15 sample shows narrow pore
size distribution. With La and V loading, the LaVOx/SBA-15
samples show slightly wider pore size distribution (57 nm)
due to the non-uniform distribution of La2O3 and V2O5 species
on the wall of pores.
3.2. XRD
Fig. 2A shows the small-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and
LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts. The SBA-15 material exhibits a
relatively intense diffraction peak at 2u = 0.778 and two weak
peaks between 1.58 and 28, attributable to the diffraction of
(1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) planes, respectively [15], similar to
that observed by Li et al. [21]. These peaks are characteristics of
the hexagonally ordered structure of SBA-15. Compared to the
XRD patterns of SBA-15 reported by Liu et al. [22], there is a
significant decline in peak intensity possibly due to the
difference in synthesis procedure and/or P123 reagent. With the
successive loading of LaVOx species on SBA-15, there is the
gradual disappearance of the d1 0 0, d1 1 0 and d2 0 0 peaks. The
phenomenon can be attributed to the notable loss of long-range
order of hexagonally arranged porosity [21,23,24] due to partial
blocking of mesopores by the LaVOx species. From the N2
adsorptiondesorption isotherms and pore size distribution of
the LaVOx/SBA-15 samples, one can deduce that with the
loading of vanadium and lanthanum oxide, the hexagonal
arrangement of the SBA-15 framework is not destroyed. The
LaVOx/SBA-15 samples still display uniform pore size
distribution (Fig. 1B) and relatively big pore volume except
for the used LaVOx/SBA-15 sample. The wide-angle XRD
patterns of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2B.
In the case of low-LaVOx loading (Fig. 2B (b)), only diffraction
peaks of LaVO4 and/or VO4
3 at 2u = 20.38, 248, 26.28 and
27.88 are observed [JCPDS card no. 25-427]. Over 10La10V/
SBA-15, there are no diffraction peaks attributable to La2O3 or
V2O5 crystallites. Nevertheless, with further increase in
vanadium loading, diffraction peaks of V2O5 (JCPDS 41-
1426) appear and gradually increase in intensity.
3.3. TPR analysis
The TPR profiles of SBA-15 and LaVOx/SBA-15 are shown
in Fig. 3. In the case of 10La/SBA-15 (Fig. 3(a)), there is no
hydrogen consumption, indicating that the 10La/SBA-15
sample is irreducible in the temperature range of investigation
(up to 800 8C). For a 15V/SBA-15 sample (Fig. 3(b)), a big
peak at 498 8C with a shoulder at 600 8C was observed

plausibly due to the reduction of highly dispersed tetrahedral
vanadium (VO4
3) and polymeric VO4
3 or V2O5-like species,
respectively, similar to that reported (Tm = 554, 590 8C) by
Solsona et al. [25]. The difference in reduction temperature
could be caused by the interaction of VO4
3 with support and/
or a result of discrepancy in catalyst calcination conditions. The
LaVOx/SBA-15 samples exhibit two sharp peaks at approxi-
mately 560 and 650 8C (Fig. 3(ce)) and the peak maxima
locate at higher temperature in response to the introduction of
lanthanum oxide. Li et al. [26] observed two reduction peaks
over LaVO4, a small one at 550 8C and a much bigger one at
800 8C, plausibly due to the low reducibility of the LaO
species. Nonetheless, due to the low La/V molar ratio (0.28
0.56), the existence of LaVO4 species in LaVOx/SBA-15 is
unlikely. In addition, with rise in vanadium loading, there is the
appearance of reduction peaks in the high temperature range of
600680 8C, indicating the formation of vanadium dimers or
V2O5-like
species
on
the
support.
The
high-reduction
temperature (Fig. 3(g)) of crystalline V2O5 is due to the poor
accessibility of lattice vanadium entities in the bulk of V2O5.
From the intensity of the reduction peak, it can be deduced that
at high vanadium loadings, V2O5 is abundant in LaVOx/SBA-
15 (Fig. 3(ce)). The TPR profiles of the LaVOx/SBA-15
samples confirmed the existence of partial polymeric VO4
3 or
V2O5-like species even in the case of low vanadium loading
(Fig. 3(c)). A comparison between a fresh and used LaVOx/
SBA-15 catalyst does not show much discrepancy in TPR
profiles (Fig. 3(d and f)).
3.4. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of carbon deposition
As shown in Fig. 4, the significant weight loss (26.6%)
observed over the used 15V/SBA-15 sample is due to the
combustion of deposited carbon. Over the used LaVOx/SBA-15
samples, the weight loss is significantly less. With a rise of La/V
molar ratio (from 0.37 to 0.56), there is a trend of decrease in the
extent of carbon removal (from 20.5 to 11.5%). It is apparent that
the addition of La2O3 can effectively hinder the formation of
coke on the surface of the catalysts, similar to the phenomena
observed over La2NiO4 and La2NiO4/ZSM-5 catalysts in CH4/
CO2 reforming [27,28]. After 28 h of EBDH over 10La15V/
SBA-15, the weight loss is 20.9% (Fig. 4(c), TG), indicating that
prolonged reaction does not result in severe coking. However, we
observed that the gradient of the weight-loss curves become
smoother with a rise in temperature, implying that there is the
transform of active and/or hydrogenated carbon to more stable
carbon species such as amorphous carbon or inert graphitic
carbon. In our studies on CH4 dehydroaromatization over Ga
Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts [29,30], we detected the deposition of
active andinertcarbonspecies.Theexothermalpeaksofthe DTA
curves in Fig. 4 corroborate the presence of various types of
carbon species. The shapes of the DTG profiles (Fig. 4) indicated
that there is a close relationship between the type of carbon
deposition andthe compositionof phasesonthe SBA-15 support.
The deposition of a large amount of active carbon species
removable at temperatures below 400 8C on 15V/SBA-15 could
be related to the acidic sites of VO4
3 species whereas the
formation of a small amount of inert carbon on 10La10V/SBA-
15 to the basic properties of lanthanum (La3+). According to the
report of Bautista et al. [31] and Mathew et al. [32], the oxidative
dehydrogenation of EB proceeds mainly on acidbase pair

sites capable of forming active coke. Apparently, the presence of
acidbase pair sites is favorable for the formation of styrene.
3.5. CO2-TPD analysis of catalysts
When CO2 is used as oxidant, the adsorption of CO2
becomes an essential issue. Fig. 5 shows the CO2-TPD spectra
of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts. One can see that there are three
modes of CO2 adsorption, i.e. weak (desorption occurred in the
60170 8C range), medium (desorption occurred in the 180
350 8C range) and strong (desorption occurred above 600 8C)
adsorption. Over the 10La/SBA-15 catalyst in the 200300 8C
range, there is no CO2 desorption (Fig. 5(e)). Hence, the CO2
that desorbs from the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in the 200
300 8C can be correlated to the CO2 that interacts with the
VO4
3 entities (a way similar to that of water interaction with
VO4
3). In addition, with a rise of relative lanthanum contents,
the intensity of CO2 desorption at temperature below 180 8C
increases, and there is a gradual shift to higher temperature for
maximum desorption, plausibly a result of CO2 interaction with
La2O3 (forming species such as La2O2CO3). As for CO2
desorption above 400 8C, the peak intensity rises with a decline
of vanadium loading. Over 10La10V/SBA-15 (Fig. 5(d)), the
amount of CO2 desorption above 400 8C is higher than that
observed over 10La/SBA-5. For the 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst
of highest catalytic performance (see later in Section 3.6); the
desorption of CO2 is significant (Fig. 5(c)). It is apparent that
CO2 adsorption is favorable on the LaVxO/SBA-15 catalysts.
3.6. Catalytic performance of LaVOx/SBA-15
The conversion of EB and CO2, the yield of styrene over the
LaVOx/SBA-15 and 15V/SBA-15 catalysts as a function of
time on stream are depicted in Fig. 6. The EB conversion over
10La10V/SBA-15 is ca. 63% at the initial stage and ca. 45%
after 8 h whereas those over 10La15V/SBA-15 are 80 and 73%
(Fig. 6A (c)), respectively. The results demonstrated that a
suitably large amount of VO4
3 on SBA-15 is a key factor for
retaining the activity and stability of a catalyst. Similarly, the
conversion of CO2 over 10La15V/SBA-15 (Fig. 6B (c)) was
Fig. 5. CO2-TPD profile of (a) 15V/SBA-15 (70.3 mg), (b) 10La20V/SBA-15
(69.3 mg), (c) 10La15V/SBA-15 (69.1 mg), (d) 10La10V/SBA-15 (72.4 mg),
and (e) 10La/SBA-15 (68.3 mg).

higher than that over the other catalysts. The initial conversion
of CO2 over 10La15V/SBA-15 was 5.3% whereas that over
10La10V/SBA-15 was only 4.1%, and the conversion of CO2
decreases with time on stream across the catalysts, in concord
with the trend of catalytic activity over the LaVOx/SBA-15
catalysts (Fig. 6A). The observation revealed that the rate of
reverse water gas shift (RWGS) (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O)
reaction, to a large extent, depends on the rate of hydrogen
formation during the EBDH reaction.
CO2g  Cs  2COg;
DH298 K  173 kJ=mol
CO2g  H2g  COg  H2Og;
DH298 K  29:68 kJ=mol
According to the thermodynamic data, the RWGS reaction is
more favorable than the reaction involving the interaction of
CO2 with deposited carbon. It is interesting to note that despite
the initial EB conversion over 10La20V/SBA-15 is above 80%,
the corresponding styrene yield is only ca. 65% (Fig. 6C (d)),
much lower than that over the 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst.
Therefore, too high or too low a vanadium loading was
unfavorable for EBDH when CO2 was employed as oxidant.
The experiment also verified that the catalytic performance of
10La12V/SBA-15 sample was slightly lower than that of
10La15V/SBA-15 (not show in Fig. 6). TPR results suggested
that the 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst contains the highest amount
of isolated tetrahedral vanadium oxide species (Fig. 3(d)) which
are considered as active sites for the selective oxidative
dehydrogenation of EB. During the EBDH reaction, the alkyl
hydrogen atoms of EB interact with the VO bonds of
10La15V/SBA-15 via hydrogen bonding, and then nucleophilic
attack of EB towards the V5+ sites occurs, resulting in the
formation of styrene. With a rise of vanadium loading, there is a
decline in the amount of isolated tetrahedral vanadium oxide
species due to the gradual formation of polymeric VO4
3 and/
or V2O5-like species. The existence of V2O5 can result in
cracking of styrene and EB and a decline of styrene yield.
Furthermore, the specific surface area of 10La20V/SBA-15
(467.6 m2/g) is significantly lower than that of SBA-15
(697 m2/g) which is another reason for the decline of styrene
production over the 10La20V/SBA-15 sample. For the purpose
of comparison, the catalytic performance of 15V/SBA-15 was
also investigated. The EB conversion and styrene yield over
15V/SBA-15 (curve a of Fig. 6) are significantly lower than
those over 10La15V/SBA-15 (curve c of Fig. 6). The results
suggest that the introduction of lanthanum to 15V/SBA-15 can
explicitly improve the activity and stability of LaVOx/SBA-15
catalysts plausibly via the formation of the La2O2CO3 species.
And the catalytic performance of 10La/SBA-15 can be
neglected due to the EB conversion of lower than 5% as
recorded in a blank experiment. As depicted in the CO2-TPD
spectra (Fig. 5), the amount of CO2 adsorption on LaVOx/SBA-
15 is significant, and that would promote the occurrence of
RWGS reaction and the removal of carbon deposition. In the
meantime, the TPR results of the LaVOx/SBA-15 samples
verified that the existence of La2O3 species would lower the
reducibility of the VO4
3 species (Fig. 4cf). We propose that
the synergistic action of lanthanum and vanadium sustains the
activity and long term stability of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts.
Similar effects of synergistic action of lanthanum and nickel in
the case of CH4/CO2 reforming over La2NiO4 has been reported
before [33].
The conversion of EB and selectivity to styrene over
10La15V/SBA-15at different reactiontemperatures are depicted
in Fig. 7. The results indicated that the EB conversion increases
markedly (Fig. 7(a, b and d)) with a rise in reaction temperature.
The EB conversion and selectivity to styrene at 500 8C was 39
and 97%, respectively. At 550 and 600 8C, EB conversion
reached 58 and 80%, respectively, and the latter is higher than
that (ca. 59% at 600 8C) observed over CeO2ZrO2/SBA-15
reported recently by Burri et al. [9]. Nevertheless, the styrene
selectivity (ca. 90%) decreased slightly due to the cracking of EB
and styrene (forming benzene, toluene, and COx, etc.). The
conversion of EB and selectivity to styrene over regenerated
10La15V/SBA-15 are shown in Fig. 7(c). There is no obvious
difference in catalytic performance of the fresh and regenerated
10La15V/SBA-15 sample. One may envision that the deactiva-
tion of LaVOx/SBA-15 is mainly due to coke formation on the
surface of the catalyst. The TG and DTG profiles of a used
LaVOx/SBA-15 sample verified the existence of carbon species
(Fig. 4). If time on stream was prolonged to 28 h under similar
conditions,the EB conversionover10La15V/SBA-15 was below
50%. It should be noted that the extent of carbon deposition
(Fig. 4) on 10La15V/SBA-15 is almost the same as that observed
after 8 h where EB conversion was 70%. It means that the
deactivation of catalystdepends strongly onthe type of carbonon
the catalyst. The deposition of amorphous carbon or more inert
graphitic carbon should be the main cause for catalyst
deactivation. The addition of La2O3 can effectively hinder the
accumulation of carbon species on LaVOx/SBA-15 prior to the
possible formation of inert graphitic carbon.
4. Conclusion
The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts

on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between
the lanthanum and vanadium entities. The 10La15V/SBA-15
catalyst exhibits high activity due to the effective mono-
dispersion of the vanadium species and the absence of V2O5-
like clusters. The addition of La3+ can hinder coke formation on
LaVOx/SBA-15 and hence sustain the stability of the catalysts.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
