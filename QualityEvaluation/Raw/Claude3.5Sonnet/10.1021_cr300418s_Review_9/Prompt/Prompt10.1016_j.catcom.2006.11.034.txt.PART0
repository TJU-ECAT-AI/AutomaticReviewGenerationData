1. Introduction
Styrene is an important monomer for synthetic poly-
mers. It is commercially produced mainly by the vapor
phase catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) on
potassium-promoted iron oxide catalysts in the presence
of large excess of superheated steam at 823923 K [1].
However, the present industrial process is thermodynami-
cally limited and, moreover, it is very energy consuming
due to the required excess of superheated steam and higher
reaction temperatures. Recently, the dehydrogenation of
EB in the presence of CO2 has attracted increasing interest
[2]. This new process is energy-saving and environmentally
friendly. It was estimated that the energies required for
producing 1 t of styrene by a present commercial process
using steam and by a new process using CO2 were
1.5 · 109 and 1.9 · 108 cal, respectively [3]. The develop-
ment of catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity
for the new process is required, since the commercial K-
promoted iron oxide catalysts do not work effectively for
EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. A variety of
metal oxide catalysts, such as iron oxide [4,5], vanadia
[6,7], chromia [8,9], ceria [8] and zirconia [10] have been
studied.
Propene is an important raw material for the production
of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of
increasing significance due to the growing demand for pro-
pene. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reac-
tion that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a
high yield of propene. However, the high reaction temper-
ature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light
alkanes, resulting in a decline in product yield and an
increase in catalyst deactivation. Although the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed
as an alternative to the process, the propene selectivity of
the catalytic reaction remains an unsolved problem due
to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide.
Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by
carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give
rather high propene selectivity [2,11]. Since CO2 is one of

the major greenhouse gases, the use of CO2 is attractive not
only economically but also ecologically. Propane dehydro-
genation in the presence of CO2 has been studied over var-
ious catalysts, such as Cr2O3 [12,13], rare earth vanadates
[14] and Ga2O3 [1517].
It is interesting to compare dehydrogenation of EB and
propane in the presence of CO2. In this work, dehydroge-
nation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 cat-
alysts has been investigated and compared. The catalysts
were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman
spectroscopy, ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance spec-
troscopy (UVVis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectros-
copy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spec-
troscopy (FTIR), temperature programmed desorption of
NH3 and CO2 (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD) and N2 adsorp-
tion methods. The catalytic activities are correlated with
the results of surface acidity and basicity measurements.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Ga2O3ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by a
coprecipitation method. An aqueous solution of ammonia
was added dropwise under vigorous stirring to a mixed
solution of Ga(NO3)3 and ZrOCl2 until the final pH =
8.5 was attained. The precipitate was then filtered, washed
with distilled water and dried at 383 K overnight. After cal-
cination in static air at 923 K for 4 h, the catalysts were
obtained. They are denoted as nGZ, where n represents
the weight percentage of Ga2O3 in the catalysts. Pure
ZrO2 catalyst is designated as Z.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by
N2 adsorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000
instrument. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/
MAX-IIA diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation
operated at 30 kV and 20 mA. Laser Raman spectra in the
100800 cm1 range were taken on a Dilor LabRam-1B
spectrometer using a laser at 632.8 nm line as the excitation
source. DRS spectra in the 190600 cm1 range were
recorded on a JASCO V-550 spectrometer. The data were
acquired and analyzed by a computer at the rate of
100 nm min1. XPS spectra were obtained with Al Ka radi-
ation (1486.6 eV) on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESAC
system at a base pressure of 1 · 109 Torr. All binding
energy values were referenced to the C(1s) peak at
284.6 eV. SEM and EDX analysis were performed on a
Philips XL30 microscope. In situ FTIR spectra of pyridine
adsorption were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR
spectrometer which was furnished with an in situ sample
cell. A self-supporting disk of the sample (13.6 mg) was
pretreated at 573 K for 4 h under a vacuum of 102 Pa
and then cooled to room temperature. After the pyridine
adsorption at room temperature for 30 min and evacuation
at 423 K for 1 h, IR spectra were recorded. Surface acidity
was measured by NH3-TPD in a flow-type fixed-bed reac-
tor at ambient pressure. The sample (100 mg) was pre-
heated at 773 K for 3 h, and then cooled to 393 K in
flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of NH3
were injected until adsorption saturation, followed by
purging with He for 2 h. The temperature was then raised
from 393 to 773 K at a rate of 10 K min1, and the NH3
was collected in a liquid N2 trap and detected by gas chro-
matography. Surface basicity was measured by CO2-TPD
with the same apparatus, and the method is similar to that
of NH3-TPD except that the adsorption temperature of
CO2 was 353 K.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 was
carried out in a flow-type fixed-bed microreactor at ambi-
ent pressure. To supply the reactant, a gas mixture of N2
and CO2 (19:1 molar ratio) at a flow rate of 60 ml min1
was passed through a glass evaporator filled with liquid
EB maintained at 273 K. The molar ratio of N2 to CO2
to EB was 361:19:1. The catalyst load was 100 mg and
the reaction temperature was 873 K. Prior to the reaction,
the catalyst was pretreated at 873 K in N2 for 2 h. The
hydrocarbon products were analyzed using an on-line gas
chromatograph equipped with a 2-m packed column of
DNP and a flame ionization detector (FID). The gas com-
ponents, such as N2, CO and CO2, were analyzed by
another gas chromatograph equipped with a 2-m packed
column of carbon molecular sieve 601 and a thermal con-
ductivity detector (TCD).
Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was
performed at 873 K in a flow-type fixed-bed microreactor
at ambient pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it
was activated at 873 K in N2 for 2 h prior to the reaction.
The gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% car-
bon dioxide and balancing nitrogen. The total flow rate
of gas reactant was 20 ml min1. The hydrocarbon reaction
products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromato-
graph equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q
and a FID. The gas components, such as N2, CO and
CO2,
were
analyzed
by
another
gas
chromatograph
equipped with a 2-m packed column of carbon molecular
sieve 601 and a TCD.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD and textural characterization
XRD patterns of GZ catalysts calcined at 923 K are
shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that both tetragonal and
monoclinic ZrO2 are present in pure ZrO2. Moreover, the
fraction of monoclinic zirconia, estimated by the formula
proposed by Toraya et al. [18], is obviously higher than that
of tetragonal zirconia. For GZ catalysts, the transformation
1318
H. Li et al. / Catalysis Communications 8 (2007) 13171322
from the metastable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic
phase is retarded. The tetragonal phase persists alone in these
catalysts at 923 K. As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the
intensity of diffractive peaks for GZ catalysts is weakened,
suggesting that the degree of crystalline ZrO2 order is
decreased. The characteristic peaks of Ga2O3 are not
observed in all the catalysts, implying that Ga2O3 is rather
homogeneously mixed with zirconia.
After calcination at 923 K, the specific surface area of
ZrO2 is 19.0 m2 g1. The incorporation of Ga2O3 into
ZrO2 leads to significant increment in surface area, as
shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the surface area of GZ cat-
alysts increases with an increase in Ga2O3 content.
3.2. Raman spectroscopy
Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of GZ catalysts calcined
at 923 K. The bands at 178, 189, 221, 306, 332, 345, 380,
475, 500, 536, 556, 615 and 635 cm1 are the characteristic
of the monoclinic ZrO2, while the bands at 149, 269, 317,
462 and 645 cm1 are indicative of the tetragonal ZrO2
[1921]. For pure ZrO2, both tetragonal and monoclinic
ZrO2 were observed, and the monoclinic phase is domi-
nant. For 10GZ, 15GZ and 20GZ catalysts, only the
tetragonal ZrO2 phase is detected. These observations are
in good agreement with the XRD results. However, the
Raman spectrum of 5GZ catalyst reveals the co-existence
of tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, which is different from
the XRD observation. This discrepancy could be due to the
fact that Raman spectroscopy is more surface-sensitive
than XRD. The above result also indicates that the surface
phase is different from the bulk phase for the 5GZ catalyst.
The sharpness of all Raman peaks and, in particular, the
resolution of two bands at 269 and 317 nm indicates that
ZrO2 and Ga2O3ZrO2 mixed oxides are highly crystalline.
As the Ga2O3 content is increased, both the intensity of
Raman peaks and the resolution of the above two bands
become lower, suggesting a decrease in degree of crystalline
ZrO2 order. This is in line with the XRD observation.
3.3. UVVis DRS study
Fig. 3 shows UVVisible diffuse reflectance spectra of
GZ catalysts calcined at 923 K. For the ZrO2 catalyst,
two intense adsorption maxima are observed at 210 and
228 nm. A broad shoulder peak with a maximum at ca.
305 nm, extending from 260 up to 400 nm, is also observed.
For GZ catalysts, the band at 228 nm disappears. All
bands may be attributed to charge transfer transitions.
The bands at 210 and 228 nm are associated with the nor-
mal energy gap transition in crystalline ZrO2, and the
shoulder peak at ca. 305 nm is related to transitions involv-
ing localised levels near the valence and conduction bands,
due to defects and non-stoichiometry [2224]. The occur-
rence of two bands at 210 and 228 nm is probably related
to two different crystalline ZrO2 phases. The former band
is related to the tetragonal ZrO2 and the latter band to

the monoclinic ZrO2 [25]. Thus, it can be concluded from
the DRS results that pure ZrO2 exists in two crystalline
phases after calcination at 923 K: a metastable tetrago-
nal phase and a thermodynamically favoured monoclinic
phase. For GZ catalysts, only the tetragonal phase appears.
The above observation is in consistence with the XRD
results.
3.4. XPS study
The XPS spectra for 15GZ were recorded, and the
deconvoluted spectra in the Ga(3d) region are shown in
Fig. 4. Only two peaks appear in the spectrum of 15GZ
at 24.2 and 21.3 eV, respectively, which can be assigned
to O(2s) and Ga3+(3d) band according to the literature
[26]. The Ga 3d banding energy of pure b-Ga2O3 is
20.8 eV [16]. This shift in binding energy (0.5 eV) can be
attributed to a strong interaction between the Ga2O3 spe-
cies and ZrO2. The strong interaction was also observed
in our recent work when gallium oxide was supported on
ZrO2 or Al2O3 [17].
3.5. SEM and EDX analysis
The SEM image of 15GZ is given in Fig. 5. It is clear
that the catalyst is made up of particles with identical mor-
phology, specifically spheres. Aggregates of such spheres
were also observed. The EDX analysis at different particles
has clearly shown homogeneous distribution of Ga in the
particles.
3.6. Acidbase properties
The surface acidity of GZ catalysts was measured by the
NH3-TPD method, and the results are listed in Table 1.
The number of medium to strong acid sites (expressed as
the amount of NH3 desorbed at 623773 K) present on
GZ catalysts increases with the Ga2O3 content up to
15%, and then decreases as the Ga2O3 content is further
increased. The same variation trend for the number of
weak and total acid sites with the Ga2O3 content was
observed. The acidity of ZrO2 is enhanced after the incor-
poration of appropriate amount of Ga2O3 into ZrO2.
The nature of acid sites present on the 15GZ catalyst as
a representative was measured in situ by FTIR spectra of
pyridine adsorption (not shown). It can be seen that Lewis
(characteristic at 1445, 1490 and 1606 cm1) acid sites are
present on the catalyst. In general, the band at 1490 cm1
can be assigned to chemisorbed pyridine adsorbate com-
plexes bonded to both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites. When
Lewis acid sites are exclusively present in the sample, the
1490 cm1
band
intensity
is
one-third
that
of
the
1445 cm1 band. This is the case for our sample. Moreover,
no band occurs at about 1540 cm1 (pyridinium ion) show-
ing that no Brnsted acidity is detectable. The above results
indicate that only Lewis acid sites are present on the 15GZ
catalyst.
The surface basicity of GZ catalysts was measured by
the CO2-TPD method, and the results are summarized in
Table 2. As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the number
of total base sites present on GZ catalysts first increases
and then decreases. A maximum value appears at a
Ga2O3 content of 15%. The number of weak base sites
(expressed as the amount of CO2 desorbed at 353623 K)
follows the same variation trend. The basicity of ZrO2 is
enhanced after the addition of appropriate amount of
Ga2O3 into ZrO2. There is a much smaller number of base
sites than acid sites on GZ catalysts, suggesting that
Ga2O3ZrO2 mixed oxides are primarily acid catalysts.
3.7. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane
The dehydrogenation of EB was carried out in the
presence of CO2 at 873 K. Styrene is the major product
of the reaction, whereas benzene and toluene are minor

by-products. As the reaction goes on, a decline in EB con-
version is observed and meanwhile the selectivity to sty-
rene increases slightly. The yield of styrene decreases
progressively with time on stream. As an example, the
typical time course of EB dehydrogenation over the
15GZ catalyst is depicted in Fig. 6. The reaction data
after 30 min on stream are compared, and the results
are listed in Table 3. The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is
enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium
oxide, whereas the selectivity to styrene declines to some
extent. The activity of GZ catalysts is ca. 2 times as high
as that of ZrO2. As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the
conversion of EB on GZ catalysts first increases and then
decreases. A maximum of 36.9 conversion appears at a
Ga2O3 content of 15%. The selectivity to styrene at the
maximum conversion is 93.0%. The same variation trend
was observed for the yield of styrene, since the selectivity
to styrene is similar.
It has been suggested by various authors [2730] that the
oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with O2 or CO2 proceeds
through the following steps: the adsorption of EB on an
acid site, the abstraction of a-hydrogen from EB by a basic
OH group adjacent to the acid site, the formation of an
anion vacancy via desorption of water, the filling of the
vacancy site by O species formed from adsorbed O2 or
CO2 and the abstraction of b-hydrogen from EB by the
O species to give styrene and basic OH group. According
to this reaction mechanism, both acid and base sites are
necessary for the reaction. The medium to strong acid sites
would enhance the adsorption and activation of EB mole-
cules, and the availability of adjacent basic OH groups on
the catalyst would promote the abstraction of a-hydrogen
from EB molecules to form water. This means that one
may correlate the catalytic activity of GZ catalysts for
EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 with acidbase
properties. The same variation trend of GZ catalysts for
EB dehydrogenation activity, the number of medium to
strong acid sites and total base sites with the Ga2O3 content
is observed. Wu [31] also observed that the catalytic activ-
ities of EB dehydrogenation correlate well with the acidity
and basicity of ZrO2Fe2O3 catalysts.
The dehydrogenation of propane was performed in the
presence of CO2 at 873 K. The major product formed in
the reaction is propene, and the major by-products are meth-
ane, ethane and ethylene. The effect of reaction time on the
catalytic performance of 15GZ as a representative catalyst
is given in Fig. 6. The catalysts deactivate rather fast in the
first 1 h, followed by a relatively slow decease in activity.
Meanwhile, the selectivity to propene increases progres-
sively with time on stream. Comparison between two dehy-
drogenation reactions shows that the catalysts deactivate
more seriously in propane dehydrogenation than in EB
dehydrogenation. Moreover, the selectivity to propene is
lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction
of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of
propane. The reaction data for propane dehydrogenation
after 10 min on stream are compared, and the results are
listed in Table 4. The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is very
low. After the incorporation of gallium oxide into ZrO2,
the catalyst becomes much more active, suggesting that
Ga2O3 is the major active component for propane dehydro-
genation in the presence of CO2. This may be the reason why
the propane conversion on GZ catalysts increases with
increasing the Ga2O3 content. The propene yield rises
slightly due to the decline in propene selectivity. The different
catalytic behavior of GZ catalysts in EB dehydrogenation
and propane dehydrogenation with varying the Ga2O3 con-
tent could be related to the fact that the former reaction is
easier to proceed than the latter one.
In order to understand the role of CO2 in the reaction, the
amount of CO in the reaction product on 15GZ as a repre-
sentative catalyst was measured. For EB dehydrogenation,

the amount of CO formed is 1.5 as much as that of hydrocar-
bon products (styrene, benzene and toluene) after 30 min on
stream. For propane dehydrogenation, the amount of CO
formed is 2.8 as much as that of hydrocarbon products (pro-
pene, methane, ethane and ethene) after 10 min on stream.
In the absence of CO2, EB conversion and propane conver-
sion over the 15GZ catalyst are 32.3% and 26.1%, respec-
tively, lower than those in the presence of CO2. Therefore,
one role of CO2 is to promote the dehydrogenation reaction
through the reverse watergas shift reaction. The other role
of CO2 could be the elimination of coke by the Boudouard
reaction.
4. Conclusions
In the present work we have shown that the transforma-
tion from the metastable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic
phase is retarded after the incorporation of Ga2O3 into
ZrO2. A strong interaction between the Ga2O3 species and
ZrO2 was observed. Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts display different
catalytic behavior for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
and propane in the presence of CO2, which is probably
caused by the fact that the former reaction is easier to pro-
ceed than the latter one. Correlation between catalytic activ-
ity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 and
surface acidity and basicity of GZ catalysts has been found.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
