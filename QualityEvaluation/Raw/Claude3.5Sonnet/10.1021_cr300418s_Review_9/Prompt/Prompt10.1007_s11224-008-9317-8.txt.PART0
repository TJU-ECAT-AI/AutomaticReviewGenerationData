I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Biotechnology, one of the most important scientific technologies of the twenty-first century, is the commercial application of living organisms like bacteria, fungi, plant cells, viruses, yeasts, and mammalian cells or their products, which involves the deliberate manipulation of their DNA molecules. Biochemical engineering employs biotechnologys methods for the industrial production and processing of chemical substances, food and feed, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other materials, and it deals with the design of apparatus and vessels suitable for carrying out biochemical reactions.
This two-volume collection is based on the latest online edition of the critically acclaimed standard reference source, Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, and includes articles that have not yet been published in print, e.g., a cutting-edge survey of biorefineries (Article 17). Although, as might be expected from an anthology from Ullmanns, almost half (38) of the books 74 academic and industrial contributors are German, it is an international enterprise with world-renowned authorities from the United States (13), United Kingdom (seven), Switzerland (six), Japan, and the Netherlands (four each), and Australia and Austria (one each).
The 18 articles are divided into numbered sections, subsections, subsubsections, and subsubsubsections, each with bibliographies, including thousands of articles, books, and Internet sites as recent as 2006. Hundreds of figures as well as chemical and mathematical equations and tables are provided.
Both volumes contain lists of symbols and units, conversion factors, abbreviations, country codes, and a periodic table of the elements. A 23 double-column-page index in small type from Alkaloids to Zymomonas mobilis makes location of material very easy.
An idea of the scope of the collection can be gleaned from the following list:
Volume 1 (xviii + 455 pp.)
Biotechnology (155 pp., 821 references)
Nucleic Acids (38 pp., 353 references)
Techniques for DNA Analysis (19 pp., 11 references)
Polymerase Chain Reaction (38 pp., 93 references)
Amino Acids (60 pp., 422 references)
Peptide Synthesis (15 pp., 37 references)
Peptide and Protein Hormones (114 pp., the longest article; 2025 references)
Monoclonal Antibodies (13 pp., 45 references)
Volume 2 (xviii + 399 pp.)
Genetic Engineering (35 pp., 251 references)
Mutagenic Agents (9 pp., 5 references)
Enzymes (81 pp., 431 references)
Enzymes and Immunoassays (28 pp., 96 references)
Biochemical Engineering (70 pp., 75 references)
Immobilized Biocatalysts (52 pp., 296 references)
Non-immobilized Biocatalysts in Industrial Fine Chemical Synthesis (21 pp., 75 references)
Biochemical Separations (28 pp., 89 references)
Biorefineries-Industrial Processes and Products (33 pp., 196 references)
Biomass Chemicals (7 pp., the shortest article; 21 references)
I heartily recommend this one-stop resource to everyone involved in biotechnology and biochemical engineering, both newcomers to the field as well as advanced practitioners. It should also find a place in technical libraries. Its inclusion of up-to-date material should make it definitive for many years.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene), and what are the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
