[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[3] "Results showed that 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion and 99.2% styrene selectivity were acquired when V2K/Al catalyst was used."

[4] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[5] "Catalyst calcined at 250 C had the largest surface area and the highest catalytic behavior."

[6] "There are several possible causes for deactivation of the catalyst: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2) active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3) active species are gradually poisoned with water generated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi H2O+CO2)."

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or theoretical modeling challenges for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some insights into vanadium-based catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, which can be used to partially answer the question:

The preparation method described is impregnation, using alumina as a support. Promoters (particularly potassium) and calcination temperature strongly influence catalyst activity. The best performance was achieved with a V2K/Al catalyst calcined at 250°C, which had the largest surface area.

Key challenges include:
1. Balancing conversion and selectivity - the best result achieved 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion with 99.2% styrene selectivity.
2. Catalyst deactivation - caused by reduction of active species, coke deposition, and poisoning by water.
3. Optimizing promoters and preparation conditions to maximize surface area and catalytic activity.

The paper does not address theoretical modeling or safety concerns. For nickel oxide catalysts specifically, further research would be needed on their preparation, electronic structure, and performance in these reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或氧化脱氢反应的理论建模挑战。然而，它确实提供了一些关于二氧化碳存在下乙苯脱氢反应中钒基催化剂的见解，这些可以用来部分回答问题：

描述的制备方法是浸渍法，使用氧化铝作为载体。助剂（特别是钾）和煅烧温度强烈影响催化剂活性。最佳性能是通过在250°C煅烧的V2K/Al催化剂实现的，该催化剂具有最大的比表面积。

主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡转化率和选择性 - 最佳结果达到15.2%的乙苯转化率和99.2%的苯乙烯选择性。
2. 催化剂失活 - 由活性物种的还原、积碳沉积和水的毒化引起。
3. 优化助剂和制备条件以最大化表面积和催化活性。

该论文没有涉及理论建模或安全问题。对于氧化镍催化剂，需要进一步研究其制备、电子结构以及在这些反应中的性能。
