          [1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[3] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[4] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[5] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[6] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

[7] "The reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

[8] "Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vanadium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox properties of vanadium species [15]."

[9] "There are several possible causes for deactivation of the catalyst: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2) active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3) active species are gradually poisoned with water generated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi H2O+CO2)."

          While the literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts, it provides insights into vanadium oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, which can be used to partially answer the question:

1. Preparation methods: Catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina as a support.

2. Dopant concentrations: Alkali metals (K, Li, Na) and alkaline earth metal (Mg) were used as promoters. K and Li increased ethylbenzene conversion to 15.2% and 14.7% respectively, while Mg had little effect and Na decreased activity.

3. Electronic structure and catalytic performance: The redox properties of vanadium species are related to catalytic behavior. The reaction follows a redox cycle mechanism.

4. Influence on catalytic performance: 
   - Calcination temperature significantly affects activity, with lower temperatures (250°C) yielding higher conversion than higher temperatures (550°C).
   - Promoters (especially K) strongly influence catalyst activity.

5. Key challenges:
   - Balancing conversion and selectivity (best result: 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion with 99.2% styrene selectivity)
   - Catalyst deactivation due to reduction of active species, coke deposition, and water poisoning
   - Optimizing promoters and preparation conditions to maximize surface area and catalytic activity

The study does not address theoretical modeling or safety considerations. While focused on vanadium oxide catalysts, similar principles may apply to nickel oxide systems in terms of preparation methods, dopant effects, and redox behavior influencing catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          虽然该文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂，但它提供了关于乙苯脱氢反应中钒氧化物催化剂的见解，可以用来部分回答问题：

1. 制备方法：催化剂通过浸渍法制备，使用氧化铝作为载体。

2. 掺杂剂浓度：使用碱金属（K、Li、Na）和碱土金属（Mg）作为促进剂。K和Li分别将乙苯转化率提高到15.2%和14.7%，而Mg影响很小，Na则降低了活性。

3. 电子结构和催化性能：钒物种的氧化还原性质与催化行为相关。反应遵循氧化还原循环机制。

4. 对催化性能的影响：
   - 煅烧温度显著影响活性，较低温度（250°C）比较高温度（550°C）产生更高的转化率。
   - 促进剂（特别是K）强烈影响催化剂活性。

5. 主要挑战：
   - 平衡转化率和选择性（最佳结果：15.2%的乙苯转化率和99.2%的苯乙烯选择性）
   - 由于活性物种还原、积碳沉积和水毒化导致的催化剂失活
   - 优化促进剂和制备条件以最大化表面积和催化活性

该研究没有涉及理论建模或安全性考虑。虽然重点是钒氧化物催化剂，但在制备方法、掺杂剂效应和氧化还原行为影响氧化脱氢反应催化性能方面，类似的原理可能适用于氧化镍系统。
