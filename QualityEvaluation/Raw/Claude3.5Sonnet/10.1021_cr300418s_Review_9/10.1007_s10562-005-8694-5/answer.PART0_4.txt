[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[3] "In the case of industrial EBDH catalysts, potassium is added to Fe2O3-based catalyst [1], in this article, c-Al2O3 supported vanadia catalysts were modified with alkali metal (Li, Na, K) and alkaline earth metal (Mg)."

[4] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[5] "Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vanadium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox properties of vanadium species [15]."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights on vanadium oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, which can be extrapolated to answer parts of the question:

Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina as a support.

Dopants: Alkali metals (Li, Na, K) and alkaline earth metal (Mg) were used as promoters/dopants. Potassium was found to be particularly effective.

Calcination temperature: Lower calcination temperatures (250°C) resulted in higher catalytic activity compared to higher temperatures (550°C).

Electronic structure and catalytic performance: The redox properties of vanadium species are related to the catalytic behavior for selective oxidation. The oxidation state of vanadium was found to change during the reaction.

Key challenges:
1. Catalyst stability and deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active species.
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity - high styrene selectivity was achieved, but ethylbenzene conversion was relatively low.
3. Optimizing promoter effects and calcination conditions to enhance catalytic performance.

The study does not address theoretical modeling or safety concerns. While the research focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts rather than nickel oxide, similar principles may apply in terms of preparation methods, dopant effects, and redox behavior influencing catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

虽然这篇文献并没有直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂的所有方面，但它确实提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂用于乙苯脱氢的相关见解，这些见解可以推广到回答部分问题：

制备方法：催化剂是通过浸渍法制备的，使用氧化铝作为载体。

掺杂剂：碱金属（Li、Na、K）和碱土金属（Mg）被用作促进剂/掺杂剂。钾被发现特别有效。

煅烧温度：较低的煅烧温度（250°C）比较高的温度（550°C）产生更高的催化活性。

电子结构和催化性能：钒物种的氧化还原性质与选择性氧化的催化行为有关。发现钒的氧化态在反应过程中会发生变化。

主要挑战：
1. 由于积碳沉积和活性物种还原导致的催化剂稳定性和失活问题。
2. 平衡转化率和选择性 - 实现了高苯乙烯选择性，但乙苯转化率相对较低。
3. 优化促进剂效果和煅烧条件以提高催化性能。

这项研究没有涉及理论建模或安全问题。虽然研究重点是钒氧化物催化剂而不是氧化镍，但在制备方法、掺杂剂效果和氧化还原行为影响氧化脱氢反应的催化性能方面，可能适用类似的原理。
