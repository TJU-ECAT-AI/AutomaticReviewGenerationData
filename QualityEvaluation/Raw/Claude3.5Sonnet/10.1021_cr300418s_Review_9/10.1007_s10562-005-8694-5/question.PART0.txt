Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by
impregnation method. During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these
two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts. Dehydrogenation reaction with CO2 was happened in the fixed-
bed reactor at 450 C. Results showed that 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion and 99.2% styrene selectivity were acquired when V2K/
Al catalyst was used.
KEY WORDS: dehydrogenation; ethylbenzene; styrene; carbon dioxide; supported catalyst.
1. Introduction
At present, the commercial process of the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene (EBDH) to styrene (ST) is
widely running over iron oxide catalysts at 873973 K,
which is thermodynamically limited and, moreover, it is
a very energy consuming process because of the required
excess of superheated steam [13]. Thus, it is highly
desirable to develop new process and catalysts that can
decrease the reaction temperature.
The EBDH process was improved in the ways of
common
oxidation,
oxidative
dehydrogenation
of
ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene-selec-
tive-oxidation of hydrogen. However, none of these
processes has been commercially produced so far.
Recent years, carbon dioxide being used as a soft oxi-
dant in the selective catalytic oxidehydrogenation of
hydrocarbons has been extensively involved in. The
EBDH with CO2 (CO2EBDH) process could be effec-
tive in respect of utilization of CO2 resource, being
energy saving and environmentally friendly [4,5]. Since
FeK-based catalysts used for present commercial
dehydrogenation process do not work effectively in the
presence of CO2, a high performance catalyst for EBDH
in the presence of CO2 need be further developed.
Some researchers have reported their catalysts for the
CO2EBDH. Suzaki and co-workers [6,7] reported that
active carbon-supported vanadium catalysts exhibit high
catalytic activity, afforded high styrene yield at 550 C
in EBDH to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide.
However, it suffered from severe catalyst deactivation
due to coke deposition. Carbon dioxide behaved as an
oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface
vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state
with carbon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reac-
tion. The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less
reactive sites for the dehydrogenation. Vislovskiy et al.
[8] investigated the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to
styrene with carbon dioxide using various vanadia
alumina catalysts, found that redox behavior of vana-
dium oxide played a key role in the dehydrogenation,
revealing that the addition of the antimony oxide leads
to the easier redox cycle between fully oxidized and
reduced vanadium species. Sun et al. [9] examined the
performances of various Fe and V supported catalysts
on the EBDH in the presence/absence of CO2 under
550 C and investigated the role of CO2 by means of
TPD.
In this paper, we further investigated the effect of the
promoter and the calcined temperature on the CO2
EBDH reaction and the stability of the catalyst, the aim
of this work was to find a better catalyst for the CO2
EBDH
process
at
a
lower
reaction
temperature
(450 C) with a higher selectivity to styrene and higher
ethylbenzene conversion.
2. Experimental

method,
c-Al2O3
with
a
specific

area
of
141.22 m2/g was used as support. The active component

(NH4VO3) with oxalic acid. The impregnation lasted for
24 h with stirring and then the catalysts were dried at

120 C in air for 12 h. After that, the catalysts were
calcined at a certain temperature for 4 h under ambient
air .The obtained sample was named as V2/Al, here, 2
stands for the content of V in mmol unit per 2 g c-Al2O3
carrier.
In the case of industrial EBDH catalysts, potassium is
added to Fe2O3-based catalyst [1], in this article, c-Al2O3
supported vanadia catalysts were modified with alkali
metal (Li, Na, K) and alkaline earth metal (Mg). The
promoted catalysts named as V2Me/Al were prepared by
co-impregnation with aqueous solutions of metavana-
date (NH4VO3) and the corresponding salts of promoter
such as LiC2O4, Na2CO3, CH3COOK, Mg(CH3COO)2 
4H2O in oxalic acid (0.25 mol/L) in the molar ratio
Me:V = 0.1.
2.2. Evaluation of catalytic dehydrogenation
The EBDH with CO2 was performed in a U6 mm i.d.
quartz tube fixed-bed reactor; in each run, a catalyst of
200 mg was placed in the center of the reactor using a
quartz glass wool plug. The catalyst was maintained at
reaction temperature in a carbon dioxide atmosphere for
10 min before introducing ethylbenzene, the flow rate of
feed gas is 50 mL/min and the molar ratio of CO2 to EB
was fixed at 10. The reaction was operated at 450 C
under atmospheric pressure, the reaction products were
collected in a U-tube cooled with the mixture of ice and
water, then dehydrated and analyzed with HP 6890 gas
chromatograph equipped with a FID detector, using a
0.53 mm  30 m capillary column HP-PLOT Q .The
main product of the CO2EBDH is styrene and the
benzene and toluene is by-products.
After EBDH, the used V2K/Al catalyst was regener-
ated for 1 h by introducing air toward the quartz tube,
the flow rate of air was 50 mL/min; and then we repe-
ated the experiment using the regenerated catalyst.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The
crystal
structures
of
the
catalysts
were
determined using a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray powder
diffractometer with monochromated CuKa radiation in
40 kV/100 mA over a 2h range from 5 to 85.
The
specific
surface
area
of
the
sample
was
determined by the BET method, N2 adsorption at 77 K
in an SORPTMATIC 1990, CE instruments. The
obtained isotherms were analyzed by ADP software and
pore size distributions were calculated on the basis of
BJH method. The TG/DTG analysis was made with a
TA instruments from Netzsch, Germany, STA 409C
thermogravimetric analyzer. The temperature was pro-
grammed to increase at a rate of 10 K/min from room
temperature to 1173 K under circulation of dried air in
order to investigate the carbon deposition over the
catalysts.
The X-Ray photoelectron spectra data were obtained
with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from
VG Scientific using 300 W AlKa radiation. Samples
were analyzed as powders dusted onto double-sided
sticky tape in an analysis chamber, the base pressure was
about 3  10)9 mbar. The binding energy values (BE)
were reference to the C1s line at 284.6 eV.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Catalytic tests
Alkali metals are often mentioned as promoters for
industrial catalysts for selective oxidation processes
since they afford higher selectivity for partial oxidation
reactions [10]. Table 1 displays the effect of various
promoters on the catalytic activity in the V2Me/Al. It is
clear that type of additives affects the catalyst activity.
The addition of promoters can all increase the selectivity
of ST but have different influence on the conversion of
EB. The addition of K and Li increase the EB conver-
sion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of
Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the
addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/
Al. Cortez et al. [10] deemed that the addition of
potassium to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts affected the structure
and properties of surface vanadium oxide species,
potassium removed surface acid sites, generated basic
sites through its co-ordination with surface vanadia
species. In our experiments, the effect of promoters on
the catalytic behavior is not remarkable, this maybe
attribute to the lower reaction temperature. Badstubes
results [11] can account for this: when the reaction
temperature is 623 and 723 K, the effect of promoters is
not obvious but when at 823 K, the promotion with
alkali or alkali-earth ions lead to a strong increase in ST
yield.
Table 2 presents the effect of calcined temperature on
the EBDH with a V2K/Al catalyst. As a function of
calcined temperature, the catalysts show different cata-
lytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined
temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maxi-
mum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only
8.0% at 550 C. At all calcined temperature the selec-
tivity of ST are high (>
99.0%). Figure 1 shows the

XRD pattern of the catalysts after different calcined
temperature, we did not find the peak corresponding to
other materials except the peak of c-Al2O3. It can be
explained that vanadium species have a good dispersion
in the support surface, smaller V2O5 crystallites may
also be present, but they cannot be detected by diffrac-
tion methods because of their low concentration, poor
crystallinity, or small numbers of unit cells [12]. The
BET specific surface area values presented in table 2
indicate that the change of catalytic behavior may
attribute to the different specific surface area and pore
size of catalysts after different calcined temperature.
Catalyst calcined at 250 C had the largest surface area
and the highest catalytic behavior.
3.2. Catalysts stability
Based on the catalytic activities of different catalysts,
V2K/Al calcined 250 C was chosen to be evaluated
further. Figure 2 shows EB conversion, ST selectivity as
a function of reaction time at a reaction temperature of
450 C in the presence of carbon dioxide over V2K/Al
catalyst. The ST selectivity kept a high value(>
98%),
the initial EB conversion during the reaction for 1 h was
highest (15.2%), with an increasing reaction time, it
decreased to 8.5%, after a run of 11 h the ST yield
decreased to 6.6%. Table 3 shows the specific surface
area of the catalysts before and after the reaction, it is
clearly showed the decrease of the surface area and pore
volume after the catalytic reaction, it seems to be due to
the coke deposition during the dehydrogenation, and
such deposition may be a cause of deactivation of the
catalyst.
Figure 3 presents the TG/DTG profile of V2K/Al
from 1 and 11 h reactions. There is two weight loss
peaks occurring in TG/DTG profile, the first one is
corresponding to the loss of water and the second one
can be attributed to the weight of carbonaceous deposit
during the dehydrogenation, the weight loss percent of
V2K/Al catalyst after dehydrogenation of 1 and 11 h
were 6.5% and 7.0%, respectively. We also detected that
the color of used catalysts were black, after TG/DTG
analysis the catalyst became green again like fresh cat-
alyst, so we further investigated the activity of regener-
ated V2K/Al catalyst used for 1 h. After regeneration by
air, the catalytic activity of V2K/Al was resumed, 13.5%
EB conversion and 97.6% ST selectivity were received.
This indicated that the catalyst could be regenerated
easily.
The XRD pattern of fresh and used catalyst are
compared in figure 4. The used V2K/Al catalysts present

distinct peak of VO2 crystallites and the intensity of
V2K/Al used for 1 h are higher than that for 11 h, these
imply that part of the oxidized vanadium species on the
surface were reduced into VO2 phase and the vanadium
species migrated and aggregated during the catalytic
reaction.
The corresponding XPS spectra of V2K/Al catalyst
before and after the CO2EBDH reaction are shown in
figure 5 and table 4. For the fresh V2K/Al catalysts, its
binding energy for V 2p3/2 (517.2  517.6 eV) is corre-
sponded to V5
+ species [13], revealing that the fresh
catalyst possess the highest oxidation states of V, the
result of the used (1 h) V2K/Al shows that the corre-
sponding parameters of V 2p3/2 are similar to the fresh
catalyst, but full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the V 2p3/2 for the catalysts is increased relative to the
fresh V2K/Al, from 3.23 to 3.52, indicating the reduction
of surface vanadium species during the reaction. From
the data of the used (11 h) catalyst, the binding energy
value is shifted from 517.40 to 516.68 eV, the corre-
sponding FWHM increases from 3.23 to 3.56 eV, sug-
gesting that the catalyst surface undergo reduction of
vanadium oxides. Moreover, we calculated the C/Al and
V/Al atomic ratio, result showed that the C/Al increased
and the V/Al decreased after reaction for 1 and 11 h.
Increase of C/Al implied that the producing of coke
deposited in the dehydrogenation, increase of V/Al
suggested the migration of active vanadium species, and
these results are agreed with the TG and XRD analysis.
There are several possible causes for deactivation of
the catalyst [14]: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation
(hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active
species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2)
active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3)
active species are gradually poisoned with water gener-
ated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi
H2O+CO2). In our present study, we assumed that the
deactivation of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation
of EB in the presence of carbon dioxide might be caused
by the evidence (1) and (2).

Catalytic behavior for selective oxidation on vana-
dium oxide-based catalysts is related with the redox
properties of vanadium species [15]. Sakurai et al. [6]
and Park et al. [16] studied the performance of V/AC,
V/MgO and V/Al2O3 catalysts in the CO2EBDH and
proposed that the reaction proceeded according to the
redox mechanism. Sun et al. [9] also showed that over
V/Al2O3 the redox cycle is crucial for the CO2 activa-
tion. Based on our above discussions, it can be con-
cluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed
the redox cycle.
4. Conclusions
Alumina-supported vanadium oxides (V2K/Al) were
found to be an effective catalyst for the CO2EBDH in a
lower temperature. The promoters have effect on the
activity of V2/Al at 450 C, and V2K/Al calcined at
250 C had a better catalytic reactivity than that calcined
at higher temperature. The catalyst stability was also
discussed, the reduction of surface vanadium species and
coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst
deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of
V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one.
