[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[3] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[4] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[5] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or theoretical modeling challenges for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information on vanadium oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation:

The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina support. Dopants like K, Li, Na, and Mg were added, with K and Li showing the most improvement in ethylbenzene conversion. Calcination temperature significantly affected catalytic activity, with lower temperatures (250°C) yielding higher conversion than higher temperatures (550°C). 

The reaction is believed to follow a redox cycle mechanism. Key challenges appear to be maintaining catalyst stability and preventing deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active vanadium species.

While not addressing all aspects of the question, this information provides some insights into preparation methods, dopant effects, and reaction mechanisms for supported metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Further research would be needed to address the specific aspects related to nickel oxide catalysts, theoretical modeling, and process optimization challenges.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或氧化脱氢反应的理论建模挑战。但是,它确实提供了一些关于乙苯脱氢反应中钒氧化物催化剂的相关信息:

催化剂是通过浸渍法制备的,使用氧化铝作为载体。添加了K、Li、Na和Mg等掺杂剂,其中K和Li表现出最显著的乙苯转化率提升。煅烧温度显著影响催化活性,较低温度(250°C)比较高温度(550°C)产生更高的转化率。

反应被认为遵循氧化还原循环机制。主要挑战似乎是保持催化剂稳定性,并防止由于积碳沉积和活性钒物种还原而导致的失活。

虽然没有涉及问题的所有方面,但这些信息为氧化脱氢反应中负载金属氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂效应和反应机理提供了一些见解。还需要进一步研究来解决与氧化镍催化剂、理论建模和工艺优化挑战相关的具体方面。
