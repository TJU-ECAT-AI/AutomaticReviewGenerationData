[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "Results showed that 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion and 99.2% styrene selectivity were acquired when V2K/Al catalyst was used."

[3] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[4] "As a function of calcined temperature, the catalysts show different catalytic activity. EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[5] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant information on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of alumina support with vanadium and promoter precursors.

2. Dopant effects: Addition of K and Li promoters increased ethylbenzene conversion, while Mg had little effect and Na decreased activity. This shows dopants can significantly influence catalytic performance.

3. Calcination temperature: Lower calcination temperatures (250°C) resulted in higher catalytic activity compared to higher temperatures (550°C), likely due to differences in surface area and pore structure.

4. Performance: The best catalyst (V2K/Al) achieved 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion with 99.2% styrene selectivity at 450°C.

5. Reaction mechanism: The reaction appears to follow a redox cycle mechanism involving vanadium species.

Key challenges include optimizing promoter type and concentration, controlling calcination conditions to maximize surface area and activity, and maintaining high selectivity while increasing conversion. The study did not address theoretical modeling or safety considerations.

While this information pertains to vanadium rather than nickel oxide catalysts, similar principles may apply in terms of preparation methods, promoter effects, and the importance of redox properties in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

虽然文献并未直接回答关于氧化镍基催化剂的所有问题，但它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2进行乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的钒氧化物基催化剂的相关信息：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将钒和促进剂前体浸渍到氧化铝载体上制备的。

2. 掺杂剂效果：添加K和Li促进剂可以提高乙苯转化率，而Mg影响不大，Na则降低了活性。这表明掺杂剂可以显著影响催化性能。

3. 焙烧温度：较低的焙烧温度（250°C）比较高的温度（550°C）产生更高的催化活性，这可能是由于表面积和孔结构的差异造成的。

4. 性能：最佳催化剂（V2K/Al）在450°C下实现了15.2%的乙苯转化率和99.2%的苯乙烯选择性。

5. 反应机理：反应似乎遵循涉及钒物种的氧化还原循环机制。

主要挑战包括优化促进剂类型和浓度、控制焙烧条件以最大化表面积和活性，以及在提高转化率的同时保持高选择性。这项研究没有涉及理论建模或安全性考虑。

虽然这些信息涉及的是钒而非氧化镍催化剂，但在制备方法、促进剂效果和氧化还原性质对氧化脱氢反应的重要性方面，可能适用类似的原理。
