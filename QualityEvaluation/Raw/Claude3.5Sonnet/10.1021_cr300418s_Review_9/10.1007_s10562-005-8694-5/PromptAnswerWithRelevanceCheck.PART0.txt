[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method."

[2] "During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[3] "Results showed that 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion and 99.2% styrene selectivity were acquired when V2K/Al catalyst was used."

[4] "The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method, c-Al2O3 with a specific surface area of 141.22 m2/g was used as support."

[5] "Catalyst calcined at 250 C had the largest surface area and the highest catalytic behavior."

[6] "There are several possible causes for deactivation of the catalyst: (1) by-products of the dehydrogenation (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and so on) reduce active species to inactive species that adhere to the catalyst; (2) active species are covered by deposited coke; and (3) active species are gradually poisoned with water generated by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2+CO fi H2O+CO2)."

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or theoretical modeling challenges for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some insights into vanadium-based catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, which can be used to partially answer the question:

The preparation method described is impregnation, using alumina as a support. Promoters (particularly potassium) and calcination temperature strongly influence catalyst activity. The best performance was achieved with a V2K/Al catalyst calcined at 250°C, which had the largest surface area.

Key challenges include:
1. Balancing conversion and selectivity - the best result achieved 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion with 99.2% styrene selectivity.
2. Catalyst deactivation - caused by reduction of active species, coke deposition, and poisoning by water.
3. Optimizing promoters and preparation conditions to maximize surface area and catalytic activity.

The paper does not address theoretical modeling or safety concerns. For nickel oxide catalysts specifically, further research would be needed on their preparation, electronic structure, and performance in these reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或氧化脱氢反应的理论建模挑战。然而，它确实提供了一些关于二氧化碳存在下乙苯脱氢反应中钒基催化剂的见解，这些可以用来部分回答问题：

描述的制备方法是浸渍法，使用氧化铝作为载体。助剂（特别是钾）和煅烧温度强烈影响催化剂活性。最佳性能是通过在250°C煅烧的V2K/Al催化剂实现的，该催化剂具有最大的比表面积。

主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡转化率和选择性 - 最佳结果达到15.2%的乙苯转化率和99.2%的苯乙烯选择性。
2. 催化剂失活 - 由活性物种的还原、积碳沉积和水的毒化引起。
3. 优化助剂和制备条件以最大化表面积和催化活性。

该论文没有涉及理论建模或安全问题。对于氧化镍催化剂，需要进一步研究其制备、电子结构以及在这些反应中的性能。

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or theoretical modeling challenges for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information on vanadium oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation:

The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina support. Dopants like K, Li, Na, and Mg were added, with K and Li showing the most improvement in ethylbenzene conversion. Calcination temperature significantly affected catalytic activity, with lower temperatures (250°C) yielding higher conversion than higher temperatures (550°C). 

The reaction is believed to follow a redox cycle mechanism. Key challenges appear to be maintaining catalyst stability and preventing deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active vanadium species.

While not addressing all aspects of the question, this information provides some insights into preparation methods, dopant effects, and reaction mechanisms for supported metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Further research would be needed to address the specific aspects related to nickel oxide catalysts, theoretical modeling, and process optimization challenges.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或氧化脱氢反应的理论建模挑战。但是,它确实提供了一些关于乙苯脱氢反应中钒氧化物催化剂的相关信息:

催化剂是通过浸渍法制备的,使用氧化铝作为载体。添加了K、Li、Na和Mg等掺杂剂,其中K和Li表现出最显著的乙苯转化率提升。煅烧温度显著影响催化活性,较低温度(250°C)比较高温度(550°C)产生更高的转化率。

反应被认为遵循氧化还原循环机制。主要挑战似乎是保持催化剂稳定性,并防止由于积碳沉积和活性钒物种还原而导致的失活。

虽然没有涉及问题的所有方面,但这些信息为氧化脱氢反应中负载金属氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂效应和反应机理提供了一些见解。还需要进一步研究来解决与氧化镍催化剂、理论建模和工艺优化挑战相关的具体方面。

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant information on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of alumina support with vanadium and promoter precursors.

2. Dopant effects: Addition of K and Li promoters increased ethylbenzene conversion, while Mg had little effect and Na decreased activity. This shows dopants can significantly influence catalytic performance.

3. Calcination temperature: Lower calcination temperatures (250°C) resulted in higher catalytic activity compared to higher temperatures (550°C), likely due to differences in surface area and pore structure.

4. Performance: The best catalyst (V2K/Al) achieved 15.2% ethylbenzene conversion with 99.2% styrene selectivity at 450°C.

5. Reaction mechanism: The reaction appears to follow a redox cycle mechanism involving vanadium species.

Key challenges include optimizing promoter type and concentration, controlling calcination conditions to maximize surface area and activity, and maintaining high selectivity while increasing conversion. The study did not address theoretical modeling or safety considerations.

While this information pertains to vanadium rather than nickel oxide catalysts, similar principles may apply in terms of preparation methods, promoter effects, and the importance of redox properties in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

虽然文献并未直接回答关于氧化镍基催化剂的所有问题，但它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2进行乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的钒氧化物基催化剂的相关信息：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将钒和促进剂前体浸渍到氧化铝载体上制备的。

2. 掺杂剂效果：添加K和Li促进剂可以提高乙苯转化率，而Mg影响不大，Na则降低了活性。这表明掺杂剂可以显著影响催化性能。

3. 焙烧温度：较低的焙烧温度（250°C）比较高的温度（550°C）产生更高的催化活性，这可能是由于表面积和孔结构的差异造成的。

4. 性能：最佳催化剂（V2K/Al）在450°C下实现了15.2%的乙苯转化率和99.2%的苯乙烯选择性。

5. 反应机理：反应似乎遵循涉及钒物种的氧化还原循环机制。

主要挑战包括优化促进剂类型和浓度、控制焙烧条件以最大化表面积和活性，以及在提高转化率的同时保持高选择性。这项研究没有涉及理论建模或安全性考虑。

虽然这些信息涉及的是钒而非氧化镍催化剂，但在制备方法、促进剂效果和氧化还原性质对氧化脱氢反应的重要性方面，可能适用类似的原理。

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights on vanadium oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, which can be extrapolated to answer parts of the question:

Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina as a support.

Dopants: Alkali metals (Li, Na, K) and alkaline earth metal (Mg) were used as promoters/dopants. Potassium was found to be particularly effective.

Calcination temperature: Lower calcination temperatures (250°C) resulted in higher catalytic activity compared to higher temperatures (550°C).

Electronic structure and catalytic performance: The redox properties of vanadium species are related to the catalytic behavior for selective oxidation. The oxidation state of vanadium was found to change during the reaction.

Key challenges:
1. Catalyst stability and deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active species.
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity - high styrene selectivity was achieved, but ethylbenzene conversion was relatively low.
3. Optimizing promoter effects and calcination conditions to enhance catalytic performance.

The study does not address theoretical modeling or safety concerns. While the research focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts rather than nickel oxide, similar principles may apply in terms of preparation methods, dopant effects, and redox behavior influencing catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
