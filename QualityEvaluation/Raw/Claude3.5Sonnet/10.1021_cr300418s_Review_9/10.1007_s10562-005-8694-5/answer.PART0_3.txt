[1] "Alumina supported vanadia catalysts (V/Al) for selective oxidehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 were prepared by impregnation method. During preparation the effect of promoters and calcined temperature was investigated, it was found these two items had a strong influence on the activity of V/Al catalysts."

[2] "The addition of K and Li increase the EB conversion to 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively, the addition of Mg has little increase on the EB conversion, but the addition of Na deteriorated the catalytic activity of V/Al."

[3] "EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."

[4] "The reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation:

1. Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method using alumina as a support.

2. Dopant effects: Adding promoters like K and Li increased ethylbenzene conversion, while Na decreased activity. Mg had little effect.

3. Calcination temperature: Lower calcination temperatures (e.g. 250°C) resulted in higher ethylbenzene conversion compared to higher temperatures (e.g. 550°C).

4. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration: The main causes of deactivation were reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition. Regeneration could restore about 87% of the original catalytic activity.

5. Key challenges: The study highlights balancing conversion and selectivity, preventing catalyst deactivation, and optimizing preparation conditions as important challenges.

The paper does not address theoretical modeling or safety considerations for these catalytic systems. While the focus is on vanadium rather than nickel oxide catalysts, some of the principles regarding dopant effects, preparation methods, and deactivation mechanisms may be relevant to nickel oxide systems as well.

该文献并未直接涉及镍氧化物基催化剂的所有方面。但是，它确实提供了一些关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于乙苯脱氢的相关见解：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过浸渍法制备的，以氧化铝为载体。

2. 掺杂剂效应：添加K和Li等促进剂可以提高乙苯转化率，而Na则降低了活性。Mg的影响很小。

3. 焙烧温度：较低的焙烧温度（如250°C）比较高的温度（如550°C）能获得更高的乙苯转化率。

4. 催化剂失活和再生：失活的主要原因是表面钒物种的还原和积碳。再生可以恢复约87%的原始催化活性。

5. 关键挑战：研究强调了平衡转化率和选择性、防止催化剂失活以及优化制备条件是重要的挑战。

该论文没有涉及这些催化系统的理论建模或安全性考虑。虽然重点是钒而不是镍氧化物催化剂，但关于掺杂剂效应、制备方法和失活机制的一些原理可能与镍氧化物系统相关。
