The Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane 
Jack H. Lunsford" 
One of the great challenges in the field of 
heterogeneous catalysis is the conver- 
sion of methane to more useful chemi- 
cals and fuels. A chemical of particular 
importance is ethene, which can be ob- 
tained by the oxidative coupling of 
methane. In this reaction CH, is first 
oxidatively converted into C,H,, and 
then into C,H,. The fundamental as- 
pects of the problem involve both a het- 
erogeneous component, which includes 
the activation of CH, on a metal oxide 
surface, and a homogeneous gas-phase 
component, which includes free-radical 
chemistry. Ethane is produced mainly 
by the coupling of the surface-generated 
CH; radicals in the gas phase. The yield 
of C,H, and C,H, is limited by sec- 
ondary reactions of CH; radicals with 
the surface and by the further oxidation 
of C,H,, both on the catalyst surface 
and in the gas phase. Currently, the best 
catalysts provide 20 % CH, conversion 
with 80% combined C,H, and C,H, se- 
lectivity in a single pass through the re- 
actor. Less is known about the nature of 
the active centers than about the reac- 
tion mechanism; however, reactive oxy- 
gen ions are apparently required for the 
activation of CH, on certain catalysts. 
There is spectroscopic evidence for sur- 
face 0- or 0;- ions. In addition to the 
oxidative coupling of CH,, cross-cou- 
pling 
reactions, 
such as 
between 
methane and toluene to produce 
styrene, have been investigated. Many 
of the same catalysts are effective, and 
the cross-coupling reaction also appears 
to involve surfacegenerated radicals. 
Although a technological process has 
not been developed, extensive research 
has resulted in a reasonable understand- 
ing of the elementary reactions that oc- 
cur during the oxidative coupling of 
methane.

1. Introduction 
Methane, a principal component of natural gas, is an abun- 
dant hydrocarbon resource that is mainly used as a relatively 
inexpensive and clean-burning fuel. Certain chemicals such as 
methanol are indirectly derived from methane through a re- 
forming reaction, in which methane reacts with water at elevat- 
ed temperatures to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Be- 
cause of the enormous proven reserves of natural gas in the 
world (1.4 x l O I 4  m3),[11 
there is a strong economic incentive to 
develop a process that would convert methane into more valu- 
able chemicals and fuels. The quest for such a process and the 
associated scientific challenge has stimulated a large amount of 
research over the last decade on methods for the direct conver- 
sion of methane into ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, etc. 
This research has focused on gas-phase reactions (noncatalytic 
and usually at high pressures),[2.

 as well as on catalytic reac- 
tions in solution and on solid surfaces. The recent report by Lin 
and Senc4] 
describes one of the few homogeneous catalytic sys- 
tems in which methane has been converted into another organic 
molecule. In this case, methane was converted into acetic acid 
over a rhodium complex.

Most of the research on the direct conversion of methane has 
been devoted to the oxidative coupling reaction, which involves 
the catalytic conversion of methane and oxygen to ethane and 
water. The ethane is converted in situ into ethylene, and other 
sequential reactions produce small amounts of higher hydrocar- 
bons. The hydrocarbon products (ethane, ethylene, and higher 
hydrocarbons) often are reported as C, + products. The target 
molecule is ethylene, not only because of price but because of the 
size of the market. Ethylene is by far the largest volume organic 
chemical; 6 x lo1' kg was produced in 1992. 
In addition to these 
desirable products, COX 
(CO and CO,) products are formed 
nonselectively. The conversion of CH, to COX 
is undesirable 
since it represents a reduced yield of hydrocarbons. Moreover 
the formation of CO, is a highly exothermic reaction, and the 
dissipation of heat would be a formidable engineering problem 
for commercial operation. The goal of the technical research is 
to produce, in a single pass through a catalyst, high ethylene 
selectivity at moderate levels of methane conversion. One might 
hope to achieve, for example, 90% selectivity for ethylene at 
40 YO 
methane conversion. As the subsequent sections will show, 
this goal has certainly not been achieved. 
At a more fundamental level the research on the oxidative 
coupling of methane has provided insight into an unusual type 
of oxidation catalysis, which involves both surface and gas- 
phase free-radical chemistry. In many cases the catalysts are 
uncommon in oxidation catalysis, as they do not contain transi-

tivity. 
In this introduction to oxidative coupling, attention will be 
given to the mechanistic details and the nature of the centers 
that are responsible for the activation of methane. The scope of 
oxidative coupling will be broadened somewhat to include a 
limited amount of material on cross-coupling reactions; that is, 
reactions in which a methyl radical couples with another type of 
hydrocarbon radical. At least two other recent reviews provide 
a detailed summary of the catalysts that have been employed 
and the results  b t a i n e d . [  -  ]  
Likewise, other reviews and at 
least one book address other aspects of the research and provide 
alternative viewpoints on oxidative coupling.['- 
2. Catalysts and Catalytic Results 
The possibility of attaining reasonable C, yields through oxi- 
dative coupling of CH, first became evident with the publication 
of Baerns and co-workers in 1984["] and those of Ito et al. in 
1985."" Baerns achieved 58% C, selectivity at 5% CH, con- 
version over a PbO/AI,O, catalyst, whereas Ito et al. reported 
that a lithium-promoted MgO catalyst (Li/MgO) resulted in 
50% C, selectivity at 28 % conversion. Since these early results 
were reported, hundreds of catalysts have been found to be 
more or less active and selective for the coupling reaction. Sev- 
eral of the better catalysts are listed in Table 1, along with the 
conversions and selectivities that have been achieved. 
In earlier studies the goal of the applied research was often to 
maximize C, yield by varying catalyst composition, reagent par- 
tial pressures, etc.; however, economic evaluations have shown 
that C, selectivity is more important than yield, provided, of 
course, one can obtain a modest level of CH, conversion. The 
maximum selectivity and conversion that can be achieved are 
related, and it is often useful to consider the sum of the two. For 
the best catalysts known at this time the sum of selectivity and 
conversion is about 100. Specific activity is a less important 
factor because of the problems associated with heat removal. 
Moreover, it often is difficult to ascertain specific activities from 
published results, because the reactions are carried out under 
severely oxygen-limited conditions to maximize selectivity. Nev- 
ertheless, from the specific flow rates listed in Table 1, one can 
qualitatively 
judge the activity. Still another factor in evaluating 
a catalyst is the need of a diluent. The conversion and selectivity 
generally increases as the partial pressure of the reagents de- 
creases, but the separation of C,H, from a large excess of a 
diluent gas is undesirable. Therefore, the better catalysts are 
capable of promoting high C,, selectivities in the absence of a 
diluent. 
The more effective catalysts may be divided into five groups: 
a) highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the 
lanthanide oxide series (excluding CeO,) are the best; b) Group 
IA or IIA ions supported on basic oxides (for example, Li/MgO, 
Ba/MgO and Sr/La,O,); c) monophasic oxides; d) a few transi- 
tion metal oxides that contain Group IA ions; and e) any of 
these materials that are promoted with chloride ions. Dubois 
and Cameron["] have concluded that good oxidative coupling 
catalysts are strongly basic oxides that are p-type semiconduc-

Moreover, they are free of reducible surface cations. Many ex- 
ceptions to the requirement of strong basicity are now known. 
For example, the Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst 
does not react with CO, at elevated temperatures, 
which usually 
is taken as measure of strong basicity. It also is surprising that 
this catalyst is highly selective, because transition metal oxides 
usually favor the formation of COX.

pressure from 1 to 4 atm (1 atm =101.3 kPa). The mass flow 
rate was varied so that the residence time of the feed gas in the 
catalyst bed remained constant at all pressures. This is believed 
to be the first example of a catalytic system that provides favor- 
able conversions and selectivities at elevated pressures. 
The NaMnOJMgO catalyst, developed by Sofranko and co- 
workers,[Ly1 
is interesting, because it can be operated either in 
the usual co-feed or in a cyclic mode. In the latter mode the 
catalyst is oxidized with air, which eliminates the need for an 
oxygen separation facility. Moreover, for a given level of con- 
version, one can achieve approximately 10% greater C,, selec- 
tivity. The specific activity for CH, conversion, however, is 
much less in the cyclic mode. 
Several mixed-metal monophasic oxides have been studied as 
coupling catalysts, but these materials are subject to phase sep- 
aration under the severe conditions employed in the coupling 
reaction. Of the Ba-Pb. Ba-Bi, and Ba-Sn perovskites that 
were examined by Dissanayake et al.,[231 
only the Ba-Sn per- 
ovskite resisted phase separation, and this material was not 
selective. With the other two catalysts, barium segregated to the 
surface, and this presumably was the active component. Surface 
transformation is a common problem with all but the pure ox- 
ides, and the loss of an active component can adversely affect 
the performance. The loss of lithium from Li/MgO or lead from 
PbO/Al,O, would be a serious impediment to the use of these 
catalysts in commercial operation. 
3. Mechanism 
3.1. Methane Activation 
Product distributions as a function of residence time in the 
reactor show that most, if not all, of the initial hydrocarbon 
produced is C,H,, which suggests that ethane is formed by the 
coupling of CH; radicals. This hypothesis is strongly supported 
by results obtained with a mixture of CH, and CD, in the 
reagent stream. Both Nelson et al.[241 
and Mims et al.[25] 
showed 
that the main product of the coupling reaction was CH,CD, . 
Moreover, there is both qualitative and quantitative evidence 
for the coupling of the methyl radicals in the gas phase, after 
activation of CH, on the catalyst. Using a matrix isolation elec- 
tron spin resonance (MIESR) system, we have detected surface- 
generated, gas-phase radicals over Li/Mg0,[261 
Li-Mg0-C1,[271 
Na/CaO,['*I 
Na/Ce0,,[2y1 Sr/La,0,,[301 LiNi0,,[311 Li/ 
Zn0,[321 
La,03,[331 
and other lanthanide oxide catalysts.[341 
The results of Figure 2 are typical of the agreement between the 
CH; radical production rate and that of C, product formation. 
Although the MIESR system normally operates 
at pressure of 
about 2 Torr (1 Torr = 
133 Pa), it was modified so that both the 
CH; radical production rate and the C, production rate over a 
catalyst could be determined simultaneously at 760 Torr. By 
locating a leak into the MIESR system at the exit side of a thin 
catalyst bed, it was possible to minimize coupling within the 
voids of the bed. The results demonstrated that over a Li/MgO 
catalyst more than 40% of the C,H, was derived from the 
coupling of CH; radicals in the gas phase.[351 
Using an entirely 
different system based on mass spectrometric detection and 
photoionization of CH; radicals, Gutman and c o - w o r k e r     
concluded that greater than 75 YO 
of the C,H, resulted from the 
coupling of CH; radicals in the gas phase when the catalyst was 
Sr/La,O,. It may seem unlikely that the gds-phase coupling 
would exceed the surface coupling; however, one should recall 
that the binding energy (that is, heat of adsorption) of CH; 
radicals on a closed shell oxide would be small and the entropy 
factor would favor desorption at the high temperatures used in 
these reactions. 
These results convincingly show the importance of gas-phase 
reactions in the oxidative coupling reaction. A number of fac- 
tors influence the production rate of CH; radicals, and likewise, 
the conversion of CH, to C, products. The results of Figure 2 
demonstrate maxima at about 3 wt '

Li, whereas in a previous 
study we reported a maximum at about 13 wt% Li.[261 
The 
difference between the two studies was the temperature 
at which 
the Li/MgO was calcined prior to forming CH; radicals. By 
calcining the catalyst at a higher temperature (750 "C) 
the lithi- 
um was apparently more evenly distributed on and in MgO. 
Thus, less lithium was required to achieve maximum activity. 
Carbon dioxide likewise has a strong negative effect 0

radical production, but this will be discussed in more detail in 
Section 3.2. 
Once the CH; radicals enter the gas phase, they may either 
couple or enter into chain branching reactions that ultimately 
result in the formation of COX. 
Several groups have attempted 
to model these heterogeneous- homogeneous reaction systems 
with modest  u c c e s s . [   -     
A major difficulty in constructing 
such a model is in accounting for reactions of radicals or other

well as relevant gas-phase  reaction.''] Reactions (3) and (7) 
account for the inhibiting effect that CH, has on N,O decompo- 
sition. At a given level of conversion, much greater C,, selectiv- 
ities were observed with N,O than with 0,. 
One might think 
that this was due to differences in the gas-phase chemistry; 
however. the model indicates that surface reactions are largely 
involved. The ozonide ion, formed by reaction (8) or the reverse 
of reaction (9). might be responsible for the nonselective oxida- 
tion of C,H, (see Section 3.3). In general, at temperatures less 
than 700 C and at CH,/O, ratios greater than 2, most of the 
chemistry occurs on the catalytic surface except for the coupling 
of the CH; radicals. 
There have been attempts to model the reaction in terms of 
Langmuir- Hinshelwood kinetics, which assumes that adsorbed 
CH, reacts with some form of surface oxygen,[421 
or that CH; 
radicals couple on the surface.[431 
But several studies involving 
transients have confirmed that CH, is not adsorbed on coupling 
catalysts in the temperature range of i n t e r e  t . [ ,  -   ]  
With the 
small amount of C,H, and C,H, formed in these transient ex- 
periments, it is more difficult to make definitive conclusions 
about these hydrocarbons, and hence the location for CH; rad- 
ical coupling. Peil et al.[,,] found evidence for a delay in C,H, 
evolution from Li/MgO at 645"C, but van der Wide and co- 
w o r k e r  [   ]  
concluded that no C,H, was adsorbed on Li/MgO 
at 800C. Recent studies by Baerns and co-worker,[' 
who 
used a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, confirm 
that over Sm,O, methyl radicals are formed by the direct reac- 
tion of gaseous CH, with surface oxygen species in an Eley- 
Rideal type of mechanism. 
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies, first carried out by Cant 
et al.[481 
and more recently by others as 
521 indicate that 
a C-H bond is broken in the rate-limiting step [reaction (3)], 
with 0, as the oxidant. We have found, however, that the KIE 
for methane conversion over a Li/MgO catalyst was a function 
of the CH,/O, ratio and perhaps the total pressure.t401 
Thus, 
there is no unique rate-limiting step; reactions (3) and ( 5 )  have 
comparable rates. Only when N,O is the oxidant is it possible to 
find evidence for a clearly defined rate-limiting step. At a ratio 
of CH,/N,O = 0.33, a value of KIE = 
1 .I was observed, which 
confirms that reaction (6) was rate-limiting.[411 
Our model calculations for the reaction of CH, and 0, over 
Li/MgO indicate that the orders of reaction are determined by 
the forward and reverse rates of reaction (5) 
relative to the rate 
of reaction (3)."'] One may show analytically that the reaction 
is first order with respect to CH, and half order with respect to 
0, if reaction (3) is rate-limiting and reaction (5) is at equilibri- 
um. As the forward and reverse rates of reaction (5) decrease 
with respect to the rate of reaction (3), the orders can become 
half with respect to CH, and 1 with respect to 0,. 
In the limit 
as the forward reaction ( 5 )  
becomes rate limiting, the orders will 
become 0 with respect to CH, and 1 with respect to 0, 
(or other 
oxidant). Again, the latter case has been observed only with 
N,O as the 
Another controversial mechanistic question concerns the 
mode of C-H bond activation. According to reaction (3), the 
C-H bond is broken homolytically by the abstraction of a hy- 
drogen atom. Other investigators153- 
561 focus on the basicity of 
the Catalyst, and propose that the C-H bond is broken het- 
erolytically as indicated in (10) where CH, is the acid. Forcer- 
tain catalysts the relationship between C, formation and basic- 
ity appears to correlate;[561 
however, there are many examples 
for which it does not. 
Since hydrogen -deuterium isotopic exchange of reactions 
among alkanes is believed to occur by heterolytic dissociation of 
C-H and C-D bonds, the isotopic exchange reaction between 
973 
J. H. Lunsford 
REVIEWS 
CH, and CD, can be used independently to probe the circum- 
stances under which the heterolytic dissociation might occur. 
Lapszewicz and Jiang[' 
followed the isotopic exchange reac- 
tion between D, and CH, over Sm,O,, MgO, and y-Al,O, , 
and 
concluded that no direct correlation exists between C-H bond 
activation and methane conversion. Moreover, Nelson et aI.I5 
'I 
found that during the oxidative coupling with CH,/CD, mix- 
tures very little hydrogen isotope exchange occurred over a Li/ 
MgO catalyst. We have recently studied both the extent of hy- 
drogen isotope exchange between CH, and CD, and the 
conversion of CH, during the oxidative coupling reaction over 
a Ba/MgO catalyst that contained 0.5 mol% Ba.['*] The results 
of Figure 3 show that the addition of CO,, which poisons basic 
sites, has a much greater effect on the exchange reaction than on 
the activation of CH, for coupling. This catalyst apparently 
contains at least two distinguishable kinds of surface sites. One 
type is sufficiently basic to promote the heterolytic C-H bond 
cleavage, but under normal oxidative coupling conditions these 
would be poisoned by CO,. The less basic set of sites is capable 
of catalyzing only the homolytic C-H bond cleavage in 
methane, directly producing CH; radicals that result in C,H, 
formation.

3.2. Ethene Formation 
As noted previously, ethene is the desired product in the 
oxidative coupling of methane, although most mechanistic stud- 
ies demonstrate that ethane is the initial C, product. Hutchings 
and co-workers['] have reported that small amounts of C,H, 
are observed, even at short residence times, but the direct forma- 
tion of C,H,, for example by coupling of CH,, would only be 
a minor pathway. Several of the better oxidative coupling cata- 
lysts also have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogena- 
tion (OXD) of ethane, and in each case the catalyst has been 
shown to be effective for this r e a c t i  n . [ '  -     
In fact, the best 
OXD catalysts are also good methane oxidative coupling cata- 
lysts. The initial activation step for both CH, and C,H, is be- 
lieved to be the same-the 
formation of alkyl radicals. The 
C,H; radicals also have been identified with the MIESR sys- 
The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and 
ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of 0, 
reaction (1 1) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of 
C,H; + 0, --f C,H, + HO; 
(11) 
H'. For CH; radicals there is no analogous route to the forma- 
tion of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C,H, from 
the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from 
oxidative coupling of CH,. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing 
chloride ions a C,H, selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a 
C,H, conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 
58 %.[,,I 
Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C,H, 
(422 kJ mol- ') is less than that in CH, (439 kJ mol- I ) ,  the rates 
of reaction are substantially greater with C,H,. 
3.3. The Origin and Effects of CO, 
Since the development of a practical oxidative coupling pro- 
cess for methane is limited largely by the undesirable formation 
of CO,, it is of interest to determine its origin. Both CO and 
CO, are produced as by-products during CH, coupling, but CO 
is converted into CO, over most of the catalysts. These oxides 
of carbon, which will be collectively referred to as COX, 
may be 
derived from all of the three hydro- 
carbons according to the generalized 
Scheme 1. 
The 
three 
hydrocarbons 
in 
Scheme 1 compete for a common set 
of sites; it is therefore misleading to 
consider the oxidation of each hydro- 
carbon separately. The most defini- 
tive experiments to determine the 
origin of COX 
have been carried out by adding I3C,H, or 
"C,H, 
to the "CH, 
reagent and observing the fraction of 
I3CO, that appears as a product. Ekstrom et al.[631 
were the first 
to use this method to demonstrate that oxidation of C,H, and 
C,H, were responsible for much of the COX 
formed over a 
Sm,O, catalyst. Nelson and 
carried out similar experi- 
ments over Li/MgO catalysts and concluded that at T> 
740 "C, 
most of the COX 
is derived from C, oxidation, and at T< 
700 "C 
most is derived directly from CH,. In evaluating these results it 
is important to recognize that both the rate constants (kc, 
k,, or 
k,) and the respective hydrocarbon concentrations affect the 
rate of COX 
production. 
It would be useful to separate out the intensive and the exten- 
sive factors in the formation of COX. 
In an effort to achieve this, 
we have defined a parameter R as the ratio of the percentage of 
I3C 
in the COX 
products to that in the feed gas.[651 
If the amount 
of COX 
derived from C,H, is small (that is, the conversion of 
C,H, to C,H, is very selective), R is approximately the ratio of 
k,/k,. In Table 2 values of R are compared for several catalysts 
over a range of temperatures. Clearly, the values of R are signif- 
icantly greater than 1 .  Even at 650C over Li/MgO a value of 
R = 3.4 was obtained. Thus, at all temperatures studied COX 
would be derived mainly from C,H,, provided the partial pres- 
sures of CH, and C,H, are comparable. Higher temperatures, 
however, increase the formation of COX 
from C,H,, probably as 
a result of increased gas-phase oxidation.

Nevertheless, when operating at low conversions to achieve 
high C, selectivities, much of the COX 
would be derived directly 
from CH,. The mechanism for this direct oxidation should 
therefore be considered. A simple calculation shows that a CH; 
radical would collide with the surface of the catalyst approxi- 
mately 10' times before it reacts with another CH; radical in the 
gas phase. Some radicals react with species on the surface. By 
using a modified form of the MIESR system it has been found 
that for this interaction of CH; radicals with selected metal 
oxides, the reactive sticking coefficients may range between 
1 x lo-' and 2 x 10-5.[661 
Moreover, the reactive sticking coef- 
ficients may be directly related to the 0, 
pressure.[671 
The larger 
sticking coefficients are found with oxides that have multiple 
oxidation states, making them accessible to reduction by CH; 
radicals. Thus, reaction may occur through electron transfer, 
with the concomitant formation of a methoxide ion [Eq. (12)].

Methoxide ions function as surface intermediates in forma- 
tion of COX 
under oxidative coupling conditions. Even on 
nonreducibie oxides, which constitute most of the oxidative cou- 
pling catalysts, the electron may be transferred to oxide ion 
vacancies on the surface, forming F-type centers. In the presence 
of O,, electron transfer may result in the formation of surface 
oxide or superoxide ions. 
The catalytic behavior of a nonselective oxide (for example, 
CeO,) may be completely altered by the addition of an alkali 
metal ion which forms a surface oxide/carbonate phase. In the 
case of CeOz, 
which reacted extensively with CH; radicals and 
produced only CO, during oxidation, the addition of a mono- 
layer of Na2C0, resulted in an active and reasonably selective 
coupling catalyst.[29. 
6 8 1  Apparently the Na,O/Na,CO, 
layer 
inhibits electron transfer from CH; to the CeO,, and thus pre- 
vents CH; radicals from reacting with the surface. 
Since the early work of Lin et al.[33*69' 
it has been suggested 
that CH,O; radicals in the gas phase, formed in the equilibrium 
reaction (13). may be responsible for CO, formation. This 
CH; + O2 ;

hypothesis is attractive, because the equilibrium CH,O; concen- 
tration decreases with increasing temperature, and up to a 
certain point, the selectivity for C, formation increases with 
temperature. Our model calculation, however, demonstrated 
that the role of CH,O; in the homogeneous component of the 
reaction is not important,[371 
but it is possible that reactions of 
CH,O; with the surface may be significant.[641 
Even so, it is 
difficult to understand the effect of 0, on the reactive sticking 
coefficient at the low partial pressures of the MIESR experi- 
ment. We have suggested that a surface oxygen species, such as 
O;, may be responsible for the conversion of CH; to 
but it also is possible that an electron transfer reaction, 
analogous to reaction (12), may be involved, but with the reduc- 
tion of 0, instead of metal oxide according to reaction (14). 
Indeed, there was ESR evidence for the 0; ions on CeO, after 
the sample had been exposed to CH; radicals and 0,

At this point we turn our attention to the effect that CO, has 
on activity and selectivity during the catalytic oxidation of 
methane. The extent of the CO, effect depends very much on the 
basicity of the catalyst. Marcelin and c-workers[' 
found that 
methane conversion over Li/MgO decreased dramatically with 
the addition of CO,; however, CO, had less effect on methane 
conversion over Sm,O, . Similarly, differences were observed 
over these same two catalysts with respect to CH; radical forma- 
tion.["I In poisoning the centers responsible for CH, activation, 
CO, has a profound effect on the kinetics of the coupling reac- 
tion. For example, over Li/MgO the order of reaction with 
respect to 0, is largely determined by the increased amount of 
CO, that is formed.[721 
As the 0, partial pressure is increased, 
more CO, is produced. Moreover, the poisoning effect of CO, 
is manifested in the apparent activation energy for CH; radical 
formation and CH, conversion over basic oxide catalysts. Be- 
cause co, 
is a poison, the rate equation for CH; radical forma- 
tion may be expressed as shown in Equation

is the heat of adsorption of CO, . Upon increasing the amount 
of added CO, from 0 Torr to 0.75 Torr, the activation energy for 
CH; formation increased from 96 kJmol-' to 201 kJmol-',

similar increase in E, from 134 kJmol-' to 218 kJmol-' was 
found for methane conversion when CO, was added to the 
reagents during oxidative coupling. 
The role of CO, in improving C, selectivity from CH,, or 
C,H, selectivity from C,H,, is illustrated by the results in 
Table 3. At a constant level of 5% CH, conversion, the C, 
selectivity increased from 45 % to 64 % upon the addition of

As the conversion level is increased by increasing the 
amount of catalyst, and a larger fraction of the CO, is derived 
from C,H,, one might expect that the positive effect of CO, on 
C, selectivity would become less evident. However, the results of 
Table 3 clearly show that CO, also enhanced the selectivity for 
C,H, during the OXD of C,H,. The origin of this effect is not 
obvious, but the results suggest that CO, may poison sites that 
are uniquely capable of promoting the further oxidation of 
C,H, to CO,. 
One of the manifestations of this role of CO, is the effect of 
residence time on selectivity. Usually in oxidation catalysis the 
conversion increases, but selectivity to a partial oxidation 
product decreases as the residence time in the catalyst bed in- 
creases. But in the oxidative coupling reaction it is often found 
that short residence times result in low C, selectivity because an 
insufficient amount of CO, has been formed. As a result of this 
effect, comparisons between results obtained in integral and 
differential reactors can be misleading. 
4. Nature of the Active Center 
4.1. Surface Oxygen Ions 
The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reac- 
tion makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible 
for the activation of CH,. Therefore, the potential active centers 
will be discussed with respect to classes of catalysts. Li/MgO is 
the most thoroughly investigated. One of the challenges in iden- 
tifying active centers results from the fact that most characteri- 
zation methods are applicable only at conditions far removed 
from those used in the actual catalytic reaction. Nevertheless, 
rational hypotheses can be made concerning the species that 
might exist on the surface of a functioning catalyst. With one 
notable exception, which will be discussed subsequently, the 
attention has focused on different types of oxygen ions, for 
example, 0-, 
O;, Oz-, or 0,- in a state of low coordination. 
This attention to oxygen ions results because only metal oxides 
are effective in the coupling reaction and because the CH, reac- 
tivity is generally much greater in the presence of a gas-phase 
oxidant (0, 
or N,O). Even those catalysts that function in a 
cyclic mode are much more active when CH, and 0, are co-fed 
to the system. 
The effect of the simultaneous presence of CH, and 0, over 
the catalyst is illustrated by the results of Figure 5, which were 
obtained over a Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst

and a NaMn0,(5 wt%)/MgO catalyst.[221 
The latter is similar 
to the one used in the cyclic experiments described above.[lgl 
The catalysts were first treated with pure 0, at 800C and 
briefly flushed with a stream of He. The first results, corre- 
sponding to zero time, were obtained by passing a pulse of CH, 
and 0, 
in a 5: 
1 ratio over the catalysts. Thereafter a pulse of 0, 
was followed by a pulse of CH,. The periods between the 0, 
pulse and the CH, pulse are indicated by the times given on 
the abscissa. During the initial CH,/O, 
pulse over the 
NaMnO,(5 %)/MgO catalyst, 23 YO 
of the CH, was converted 
with a 69 % selectivity into C, + products. When the delay be- 
tween the 0, pulse and the CH, pulse was only one second, the 
CH, conversion decreased to 6%. After a delay of five seconds 
the conversion decreased to 1 
Yo and remained constant at this 
level. Similar results were obtained for the Mn(2 wt YO)/ 
Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst. When the CH,/O, mixture was 
added after several sequential CH, and 0, pulses, the conver- 
sion increased to its original high value. These results indicate 
that a surface form of oxygen is responsible for the activation of 
CH,. Bulk lattice oxygen may participate, 
but it does so at a rate 
that is slow compared to the rate of CH, activation by oxygen 
derived from the gas phase. 
The early discovery of Li/MgO as an effective oxidative cou- 
pling catalyst focused attention on [Li+O-] 
centers as possible 
sites for the activation of CH,.[26] These centers were known to 
be present in Li-doped MgO crystals at high temperatures, and 
they form only in an 0, atmosphere.[741 
Subsequent ESR stud- 
ies on quenched catalyst samples revealed that [Li'O-] centers

REVIEWS 
Oxidative Methane Coupling 
were present. but they were mainly in the bulk of the crystal- 
lite.['] 
It was proposed that surface 0- ions, in equilibrium 
with bulk [Li '0-1 
centers, were responsible for the activation of 
CH,. The [Li'O-] centers have also been observed in Li/ZnO 
catalysts, and the analogous [Na+O-] centers have been found 
in Na/CaO.[". h91 All three of these catalysts function well at the 
lower end of the temperature range for oxidative coupling. At 
least two groups[76. 
7 7 1  have carried out theoretical studies on 
the interaction of [Li'O-] 
centers with CH,, and the most 
refined calculation indicates a barrier height of only 25 kJ mol 
for the hydrogen atom abstraction reaction, which is consider- 
ably less than the experimental value of 96 kJmol-' for CH; 
radical formation.[731 
The small barrier height is consistent with 
the gas-phase reaction of 0- 
ions with CH, to form CH; radi- 
cals and OH 
ions, which occurs with an 8 % probability at 
25 C.[781 
Thus, while [Li'O-] centers and 0, ions undoubtedly 
exist in and on the surface of Li/MgO catalysts, and they are 
capable of activating CH,, it remains to be demonstrated that 
they are present in sufficient concentrations to account for the 
oxidative coupling results. 
Based upon high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy 
(HREELS) of model Li/MgO catalysts, Goodman and co- 
worker"] 
concluded that F-centers (an oxide ion vacancy with 
two trapped electrons) or F-center aggregates function as the 
active centers on LiiMgO. Their model catalysts consisted of 20 
monolayers of Li/MgO formed on a Mo(l00) crystal. After 
heating the films to progressively higher temperature from 1000 
to 1300 K and then cooling to 900 K for the catalytic measure- 
ments or 80 K for the HREELS measurements, they found that 
the activity for C,H, production correlated better with the for- 
mation of F-centers and F-center aggregates than with that of 
[Li'O-] 
centers. It is important to note, however, that the 
HREELS spectra were obtained after heating the model catalyst 
in only 5 x lo-' Torr 0,, whereas the catalytic experiments 
were carried out in 1 Torr of 0,. Since the [Li'O-] concentra- 
tion is a function of the 0, 
pressure,[741 
a comparison of spectro- 
scopic and catalytic results obtained after exposing the samples 
to very different O2 pressures is problematic. 
There also is considerable evidence that peroxide ions play a 
role in the activation of CH, over certain catalysts. It was point- 
ed out by Sinev et al.'"l 
and Otsuka et al.['ll that Na,O, and 
BaO, are capable of converting CH, into C,H, at temperatures 
above 500 C. The reactions were stoichiometric rather than 
catalytic, because both sodium and barium form stable carbon- 
ates at these temperatures. Nevertheless the results show that 
peroxide ions, if they existed at considerably higher tempera- 
tures, could activate CH,. Because of the propensity of sodium 
to form a stable peroxide, the catalytic behavior of the Na/CeO, 
catalyst, as well as other sodium-promoted lanthanide oxide 
catalysts, has been explained by the existence of a supported 
Na20, phase.r68. 
821 But there was no spectroscopic evidence to 
confirm the presence of this phase. 
More recently, both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
and Raman spectroscopy have been used to support the role of 
BaOz in the activation of CH,. The initial XPS experiment to 
characterize a barium-containing coupling catalyst was carried 
out by ydmashita et al.[831, 
who studied Ba/La,O,. From the 
O( 
1 s) binding energy they concluded that BaO, was present on 
the surface and 0:- 
ions, or 0 -  
ions derived from the peroxide, 
were responsible for the catalytic activity. We subsequently 
demonstrated that phase separation occurs during catalysis over 
BaPbO, and BaBiO, perovskites (see Section 3) and that the 
barium-enriched surface contains peroxide ions.[231 
Since the 
O(1s) binding energies in Oi-, C0:- and OH- are very similar, 
care must be taken in distinguishing between the three surface 
species. The contribution from C0:- ions can be determined by 
separately measuring the carbonate C( 
1 
s) signal and then evalu- 
ating the amount of oxygen from this species. Hydroxide ions 
generally are removed by a thermal treatment at elevated tem- 
peratures, but this may

The use of XPS to detect peroxide ions suffers from the fact 
that it is an ex situ method. By contrast, with Raman spec- 
troscopy results can be obtained in the presence of the reagents

presence of CH, and 0, 
at temperatures greater than 700 '.C, the 
carbonate bands quickly formed as a result of CO, produced 
during reaction, and the peroxide signal decreased below detec- 
tion limits. 
The involvement of peroxide ions in the oxidative coupling of 
CH, over these supported barium catalysts is reasonably con- 
vincing; however, the more general role of these ions has yet to 
be demonstrated. Earlier we reported the presence of a Rainan 
band at 863 cm-' on La,O,, which we attributed to 0;- 
ions, 
but subsequent experiments in an externally heated fused- 
quartz cell failed to reproduce this result.[s61 Similarly. XPS 
results indicate the presence of only oxide ions on La,O,. pro- 
vided the 0, used to treat the sample is entirely free of H,O. 
4.2. Chloride-Containing Catalysts 
The addition of chloride ions to an oxidative coupling catalyst 
can have a marked effect on its properties, particularly with 
respect to the C,H,/C,H, 
product ratio. The chlorine may be 
introduced either initially as part of the catalyst or through 
organo chlorine compounds that are added to the reagents. 
Thomas et aI.["] studied a family of alkali-metal bismuth oxy- 
chloride catalysts, of which LiCa,Bi,O,CI, 
was an example, 
and they found C,H,/C,H, 
ratios as great as 35. However, these 
materials generally lost activity within a few hours, which is a 
common problem with many of the chlorided catalysts. Typical- 
ly, the properly chlorided catalysts give C,H,/C,H, 
ratios be- 
tween 3 and 5, which is still attractive since C,H, is the desired 
product. 
Because chlorine is known to dehydrogenate C,H, in the gas 
phase. it has been suspected that homogeneous reactions may be 
responsible for the large C,H,/C,H, 
ratios that are observed in 
these chlorine-containing systems.[87. 
Perhaps the most 
definitive evidence against a substantial gas-phase component is 
found in the transient studies of Burch and o-workers,[I 
who 
observed that the positive effect of chlorine addition to a cata- 
lyst persisted long after the flow of CH,C1 over the catalyst had 
ceased. Moreover, we have shown that there is no correlation 
between the rate of chlorine loss from a Li+-MgO-CI- catalyst 
and its ethane OXD activity.[901 
Most of the chlorine is lost as HCI in the reaction of water 
with the catalyst. The rate of chlorine loss can be minimized by 
operating a catalyst at lower temperatures. For example, Hin- 
son et al.[yll 
found that a Li+-MgO-CI- catalyst prepared by a 
sol-gel process was effective for periods up to 238 h at 640C; 
C, yields up to 20% and C2H4/C2H6 
ratios of about 5 were 
achieved. 
The favorable C,H,/C,H, 
ratio over the Li +-MgO-CI- cata- 
lyst, and presumably over all of the effective chlorided catalysts, 
results from the fact that the OXD of C,H, is faster than the 
oxidative coupling of CH,. In a series of studies on this catalyst 
we have demonstrated that a separate set of sites is largely re- 
sponsible for the OXD reaction.2790-"1 
It has been postulated 
that these sites consist of Li,O on a molten film of LiCI. The 
LiCl modifies the basicity of the catalyst in such a way that 
neither the CH, conversion nor the C,H, conversion is affected 
by CO,. This is a particularly nice system with which to obtain 
kinetic data, because the CO, poisoning effect does not compli- 
cate the results (Section 3.3). With respect to selectivity, CI- ions 
appear to play the same role as CO, did on the Li/MgO catalyst. 
The unique behavior of the chlorided Li/MgO is found only at 
Cl/Li ratios20.9. At lower CI/Li ratios Li,CO, is formed and 
the characteristics of a typical Li/MgO catalyst are observed. 
Ruckenstein and KhanL931 
found that the addition of pairs of 
alkali metal chlorides to MgO resulted in good oxidative cou- 
pling catalysts; the best additive was 5 mol '
Y
O
 
NaCl + 5 mol% 
CsCl on MgO. At 750 "C a C, yield of 20% and a C,H,/C,H, 
ratio of 2.2 was attained. Because of the higher reaction temper- 
ature, there was a modest decrease in C, yield with time on 
stream. Contrary to the results obtained with the Li+-MgO-CI- 
catalysts, these authors found that the catalysts promoted with 
alkali metal chlorides adsorbed CO, strongly, and therefore 
were highly basic. The reason for this large difference in basicity 
is not evident.

 Cross-Coupling 
If one considers cross-coupling, the scope of methane cou- 
pling reactions is considerably expanded. Perhaps the most im- 
portant of these, and certainly the most thoroughly studied, is

Oxidative Methane Coupling 
REVIEWS 
the oxidative coupling of methane with toluene to produce 
ethylbenzene. While in the catalyst bed, a portion of the ethyl- 
benzene is converted into the desired product, styrene. In addi- 
tion, small amounts of stilbene, biphenyl, propylbenzene, and 
xylene are also detected. The initial experiments were carried out 
by Khcheyan. et a1.;[94-961 
ho 
wever. other investigators have 
continued to pursue the problem.'97- 'Ool Many. though not all, 
of the CH, coupling catalysts are effective for this cross-cou- 
piing reaction. For example. Sm,O, is a nonselective catalyst. 
whereas Li]Sm,O, gave a C, (ethylbenzene plus styrene) yield of 
16.5'X1, based on the amount of toulene converted.[991 
Khan and 
Ruckenstein' i"O1 found that the same (Na + Cs)/MgO catalyst 
that was effective in the CH, oxidative coupling reaction also 
produced the largest C, yield (24.2%) in the cross-coupling 
reaction. They concluded that the superior performance of this 
catalyst was related to its high (super)basicity. 
Although most investigators point out that the mechanism 
involves the coupling of methyl and benzyl radicals, it is not 
certain whether the reaction occurs on the surface or in the gas 
phase. Using the MIESR system, we have identified gas-phase 
benzyl radicals that were formed when toluene and nitrous ox- 
ide were passed over a Li/MgO catalyst.['0i1 
The experimental 
spectrum and a simulated spectrum are compared in Figure 9. 
In view of the nonselective reaction over Sm,O,, it is significant 
that mainly CH; radicals were produced when toluene and oxy- 
gen were passed over this catalyst. Apparently, Sm,O, pro- 
motes the breaking of the C-C bond, rather than the abstrac- 
tion of hydrogen from the methyl group. 
6. Summary and Conclusions 
Although research on the oxidative coupling of methane has 
not resulted in a commercial process, it has provided insight into 
an interesting class of heterogeneous - 
homogeneous radical re- 
actions. Catalysts have been developed which are capable of 
generating methyl and other hydrocarbon radicals, but which 
do not react extensively with these radicals once they are 
formed. The mechanism for the formation and reactions of 
these radicals is reasonably well understood ; however. less is 
known about the sites that are responsible for the activation of 
CH, and the hydrocarbon products. The identification of the 
active forms of surface oxygen on the Group IA and IIA metal 
oxides remains as one of the significant 
challenges in this area of 
research. At a practical level, the oxidation of the desired 
product, ethylene, must be overcome before larger ethylene 
yields can be attained. Advances in catalyst development are 
continuing, but additional research is needed to integrate ad- 
vanced separation technology with novel reactor designs.

Yet another potentially important cross-coupling reaction oc- 
curs when methyl radicals react with ally1 radicals formed from 
propylene. Sodesawa et al.['"21 
studied the production of C, 
hydrocarbons during the reaction of methane and propylene 
over several catalysts. including Na/La,O,. They concluded 
that the mechanism involved the oxidative methylation of 
propylene. followed by the loss of a hydrogen atom. Since the 
oxidative coupling catalysts are also capable of generating ally1 
radicals from prpylene,['" 
it seems more likely that the C, 
products are formed by a radical coupling mechanism. In the 
ally1 radical most of the spin density is on the terminal carbons. 
Thus it is not surprising that the major C, products were linear 
butenes and butadiene, rather than isobutylene.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
