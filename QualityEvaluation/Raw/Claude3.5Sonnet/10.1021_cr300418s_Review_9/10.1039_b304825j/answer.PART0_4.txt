[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid."

[2] "Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."

[3] "The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability."

[4] "The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity."

[5] "The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57/Al contains a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase. Centi et al. claimed that a non-stoichiometric rutile-type vanadium antimonate phase facilitates the redox transformation of vanadium."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts. However, it provides relevant insights on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, which can be extended to answer parts of the question:

1. Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of alumina support with aqueous solutions of vanadium and antimony precursors.

2. Dopant concentrations: The study found that the optimal ratio of V/Sb was 0.43/0.57, which exhibited the highest activity and stability.

3. Electronic structure influence: The addition of antimony to vanadium oxide catalysts facilitated the redox cycle, enhancing both activity and stability. This was attributed to the formation of a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase, which promotes easier redox transformation of vanadium ions.

4. Catalytic performance: The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst showed improved activity and stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant.

5. Key challenges: While not explicitly stated, the study implies challenges in balancing catalyst composition to optimize redox properties, activity, and stability. Theoretical modeling of the new mixed oxide phase and its role in catalysis could be a challenge.

The study does not address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene conversion. It also does not discuss process optimization or safety concerns specific to these reactions.

该文献并未直接涉及氧化镍基催化剂的所有方面。然而，它提供了关于钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的相关见解，这些见解可以扩展用来回答部分问题：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将氧化铝载体浸渍在钒和锑前体的水溶液中制备的。

2. 掺杂浓度：研究发现，V/Sb的最佳比例为0.43/0.57，表现出最高的活性和稳定性。

3. 电子结构影响：向钒氧化物催化剂中添加锑促进了氧化还原循环，提高了活性和稳定性。这归因于新的V1.1Sb0.9O4相的形成，该相促进了钒离子更容易的氧化还原转化。

4. 催化性能：V0.43Sb0.57/Al催化剂在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯反应中表现出改进的活性和稳定性。

5. 主要挑战：虽然没有明确指出，但研究暗示了在平衡催化剂组成以优化氧化还原性能、活性和稳定性方面存在挑战。对新的混合氧化物相及其在催化中的作用进行理论建模可能是一个挑战。

该研究没有涉及氧化镍基催化剂或乙烷制乙烯转化。它也没有讨论这些反应的过程优化或安全问题。
