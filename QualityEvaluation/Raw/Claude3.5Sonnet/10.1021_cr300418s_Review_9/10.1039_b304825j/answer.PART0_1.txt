[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid."

[2] "The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%"

[3] "Addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."

[4] "The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability."

[5] "The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity."

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of alumina support with aqueous solutions of vanadium and antimony precursors, followed by drying and calcination.

2. Dopant concentrations: The total metal oxide loading was about 20 wt%. The optimal ratio of vanadium to antimony was found to be V0.43Sb0.57/Al, which exhibited the highest activity and stability.

3. Influence on catalytic performance: Addition of antimony oxide to vanadium oxide catalysts significantly improved both activity and stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant. This was attributed to enhanced redox properties of the active vanadium sites.

4. Electronic structure: The improved performance was linked to the formation of a mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) that facilitated redox transformations of vanadium ions.

Key challenges mentioned include balancing catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. The study focused on optimizing the vanadium-antimony ratio to achieve this balance. Theoretical modeling aspects were not explicitly discussed in this literature.

该文献没有直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂或乙烷制乙烯的反应。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯脱氢制苯乙烯的相关见解：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将氧化铝载体浸渍在钒和锑前体的水溶液中制备的，然后进行干燥和煅烧。

2. 掺杂浓度：总金属氧化物负载约为20重量%。发现钒与锑的最佳比例为V0.43Sb0.57/Al，该比例表现出最高的活性和稳定性。

3. 对催化性能的影响：在以CO2为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯反应中，向氧化钒催化剂中添加氧化锑显著提高了活性和稳定性。这被归因于活性钒位点的氧化还原性能增强。

4. 电子结构：性能的改善与混合钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成有关，该相促进了钒离子的氧化还原转变。

提到的主要挑战包括平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该研究重点关注优化钒-锑比例以实现这种平衡。文献中没有明确讨论理论建模方面。
