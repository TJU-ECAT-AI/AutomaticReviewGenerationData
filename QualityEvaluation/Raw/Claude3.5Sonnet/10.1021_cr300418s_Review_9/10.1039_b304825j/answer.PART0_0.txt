The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide relevant information about vanadium-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant, which can be used to draw some parallels.

Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of metal precursors, followed by drying and calcination.

Dopant concentrations: The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%. Various dopants were studied, including Mg, P, Cr, Mo, and Sb. The optimal V/Sb ratio was found to be 0.43/0.57.

Influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance: The addition of antimony to vanadium catalysts facilitated the redox cycle, enhancing both catalyst stability and activity. This was attributed to the formation of a mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) that promoted easier redox transformation of vanadium ions.

Key challenges:
1. Balancing efficiency and stability: While some dopants (MgO, P2O5, MoO3) did not affect initial yields, they deteriorated on-stream catalytic activity.
2. Optimizing dopant ratios: The effect of antimony addition was maximized at a specific V/Sb ratio, highlighting the importance of precise dopant concentrations.
3. Understanding structure-activity relationships: The formation of new mixed oxide phases (e.g., V1.1Sb0.9O4) played a crucial role in catalyst performance, emphasizing the need for in-depth structural characterization.

While the study focuses on vanadium-based catalysts rather than nickel oxide-based ones, it demonstrates the importance of dopant selection, concentration optimization, and understanding of electronic and structural changes in developing efficient and stable catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献并未直接涉及镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的所有方面。然而，它提供了有关钒基催化剂在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯反应中的相关信息，可以用来做一些类比。

制备方法：催化剂是通过将活性氧化铝浸渍在金属前体的水溶液中，然后干燥和煅烧制备而成。

掺杂剂浓度：负载的金属氧化物总量约为20重量%。研究了各种掺杂剂，包括Mg、P、Cr、Mo和Sb。最佳的V/Sb比例被发现为0.43/0.57。

对电子结构和催化性能的影响：向钒催化剂中添加锑促进了氧化还原循环，提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。这归因于形成了混合的钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4），促进了钒离子更容易的氧化还原转化。

主要挑战：
1. 平衡效率和稳定性：虽然某些掺杂剂（MgO、P2O5、MoO3）不影响初始产率，但它们降低了催化剂的在线活性。
2. 优化掺杂剂比例：锑添加的效果在特定的V/Sb比例下最大化，突显了精确控制掺杂剂浓度的重要性。
3. 理解结构-活性关系：新的混合氧化物相（如V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成在催化剂性能中起关键作用，强调了深入结构表征的必要性。

虽然该研究主要关注钒基催化剂而非镍氧化物基催化剂，但它展示了在开发高效稳定的氧化脱氢反应催化剂时，掺杂剂选择、浓度优化以及理解电子和结构变化的重要性。
