Abstract
This work shows that carbon dioxide, which is a main contributor to the global warming effect, could be utilized as a selective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The modification of the catalytically active vanadium oxide component with appropriate amounts of antimony oxide led to more stable catalytic performance along with a higher styrene yield (76%) at high styrene selectivity (>95%). The improved catalytic behavior was attributable to the enhanced redox properties of the active V-sites.
Green ContextThe use of CO2 as an oxidant has received little attention, despite its great abundance. Here it is shown that CO2 can be activated over a VSb catalyst and dissociates to give an active oxygen. This oxygen then is capable of dehydrogenating ethylbenzene to styrene in good yield.DJM
1 Introduction
The utilization of carbon dioxide, which is known to be a main contributor to the greenhouse effect, has been of global interest from both fundamental and practical viewpoints in green chemistry.1 The application of supercritical CO2 is one of the most exciting ideas to replace volatile organic solvents in a green chemistry approach2 as well as the usage of carbon dioxide as a carbon source through catalytic reduction processes.1 As another way of utilization, it is worthwhile to note that carbon dioxide could be used as an oxygen source or oxidant and can be considered as a nontraditional mild oxidant and oxygen transfer agent.3,4 It has been proposed that carbon dioxide plays a role as a soft oxidant to abstract hydrogen from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons through the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.5,6 Possible reactions are the oxidative conversions of alkanes, alkenes, alcohols5,7 and alkylaromatics, especially ethylbenzene.6,822 The role of CO2 in catalytic reactions can give several merits in catalysis such as acceleration of the reaction rate, enhancement of product selectivity, alleviation of chemical equilibrium, suppression of the total oxidation, and prevention of hot spots on the catalyst surface.6,8,11,23 Taking into account its unique characteristics, it is anticipated that this concept might lead to emerging new chemistry of carbon dioxide as the oxidant.
Vapor-phase dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EBDH) is a representative process to produce styrene, an important monomer for synthetic polymers. This is one of the ten most important industrial processes. However, EBDH is thermodynamically limited and, moreover, it is a very energy-consuming process because of the required excess of superheated steam (steam/EB = 712 mol/mol). As an alternative method, the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB has been proposed to be free from thermodynamic limitations regarding conversion, operating at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction.24 However, this process with use of a strong oxidant, oxygen, suffers from loss of selectivity for styrene due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates.
Recently, the utilization of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the EBDH has been attempted to explore new technology for producing styrene selectively.6,922 Several catalytic systems were found to be efficient for the CO2-EBDH reaction. Among them, V-containing catalysts exhibited good performance in the reaction.1416,2022 These catalysts were actually known to be active and selective in partial oxidation, oxidative dehydrogenation, and ammoxidation of hydrocarbons.2334 Suzuki and co-workers reported that active carbon-supported vanadium catalysts afforded high catalytic activity in the EBDH to give styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide.1416 However, it suffered from severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition. Recently we reported high activity and selectivity of VOx/Al2O3 and VMO/Al2O3 (M = Mg, P, Cr, Mo, Sb) systems in the CO2-EBDH.22 Here we present the catalytic and redox properties of an alumina-supported vanadiumantimony oxide system as a highly active, selective and stable catalyst for the CO2-EBDH reaction.
2 Experimental
Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide (V/Al) and vanadiumantimony binary oxide (VSb/Al) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina (Aldrich, SBET = 121 m2 g1) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride along with tartaric acid. Numbers in the formulae of alumina-supported V-Sb oxides denote the relative atomic percentage of the element in this binary system. The impregnated samples were dried at 100 C and then calcined in air at 600 C for 4 h. The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%
Calcined samples were characterized by means of XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, and CO2 pulse methods. X-Ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-3B diffractometer using monochromatic CuKα radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB MK II spectrometer provided with a hemispherical electron analyzer and Al anode X-ray exciting source (AlKα = 1486.6 eV). The binding energies (BE) were referred to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Temperature-programmed reduction of the catalysts with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was performed from 100 to 800 C at a heating rate of 10 C min1 with a 5% H2 in helium flow in a conventional flow system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector for monitoring of H2-consumption. The samples (100 mg) were previously calcined in a flow of air at 500 C for 1 h and then cooled down to 100 C. In order to estimate the re-oxidizability with carbon dioxide of the catalysts previously partially reduced at 600 C in H2He flow for 30 min, CO2 pulse experiments were conducted at 600 C in the 1/4-inch outer diameter quartz reactor with 200 mg of the catalyst. Pulses of carbon dioxide (250 μl CO2) were injected into an inert helium flow (30 ml min1) using a gas sampling valve incorporated between the sample inlet and the GC column.
The CO2-EBDH reaction was carried out at 595 C in a micro-activity test unit (Zeton, MAT 2000) with a fixed bed isothermal reactor under atmospheric pressure. A catalyst sample of 1 g was placed into the reactor on a quartz wool support. Ethylbenzene was introduced with a feed rate of 8.2 mmol h1 by a syringe pump and supplied into the reactor together with a carrier gas mixture of CO2 and N2 (total flow rate 45 ml min1). Nitrogen was used as a diluent as well as an internal standard for gas analysis. Gas components of the reaction mixture (H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2) were analyzed by the TCD of the on-line gas chromatograph (GC). Liquid products such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and styrene were collected each 30 min and analyzed by the FID of the GC. Catalytic performances were characterized by EB conversion, X(EB), selectivity to styrene, S(ST), yield of styrene, Y(ST), and a loss of styrene yield after 4 h on stream relative to that after 1 h on stream, RLSY(4) = (Y1  Y4)/Y1; Y1 and Y4 are the yields of styrene after 1 and 4 h on stream, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
The catalytic properties of V/Al and VSb/Al for the CO2-EBDH to styrene are summarized in Table 1. In the reaction, styrene and water are predominantly observed together with the unreacted EB in the condensate and CO, hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the gas phase. Only small amounts of benzene and toluene along with methane are obtained as by-products. The V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts studied here exhibit very high conversion (7480%) and high selectivity (>95%) at an initial stage, while Sb/Al shows only 19.4% conversion for EB. This result indicates that a vanadium species, probably containing V5+, is a main active component for the reaction. V/Al displays initially high styrene yield (Y1 = 70.7%), but its catalytic activity decreases significantly. It was clear from previous work that the type of additives has a stronger influence on the catalyst stability than on the initial catalytic activity or selectivity.22 Addition of MgO, P2O5 and MoO3 practically did not influence initial styrene yield, but deteriorated the on-stream catalytic activity of V/Al.22 The main reason for deactivation of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts was ascribed to coke formation as well as deep reduction of V5+ into V3+. However, a much improved result is achieved with an antimony promoter, as illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Thus, addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability. EB conversions over the VSb/Al catalysts, except V0.25Sb0.75/Al, are 5% higher than that of V/Al after 1 h on stream. The CO2-EBDH reaction over VSb/Al catalysts is not sensitive to the vanadium content. Thus a decrease in vanadium content does not diminish the initial EB conversion. It is worth noting that the stability of VSb/Al catalysts is much better than that of the unmodified one. The effect of antimony addition on the catalyst stability is maximized at V/Sb = 0.75. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability. This stability is also confirmed by the unchanged specific surface area after reaction. Re-oxidation of the used VSb/Al catalysts is accompanied by much less COx evolution than the used V/Al catalyst, implying that less coke is formed during the reaction. The catalyst activity could be easily reactivated without a loss of styrene yield by means of short-term treatment in an air stream.

Crystalline vanadium phases of the V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts obtained from XRD analysis are listed in Table 1. The XRD patterns of V/Al before and after reaction show the presence of vanadium oxide crystallites such as V2O5 in the fresh sample and V2O3 in the used one (not presented here). However, the XRD patterns of the VSb/Al catalysts do not reveal crystalline vanadium oxides. Instead, an intermediate phase of mixed vanadiumantimony oxide, V1.1Sb0.9O4, is newly appeared in the XRD pattern of V0.43Sb0.57/Al. These results imply that vanadium oxides are well dispersed in the Sb-promoted catalysts and the mixed phase of VSb oxide can be formed at an optimal ratio of V/Sb. The V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase has been reported to be the main component in the crystalline VSbOx bulk oxide with the atomic ratio V/Sb = 1.29
The H2-TPR profiles of the V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2. The TPR profile of the V/Al catalyst is very different from those of the VSb/Al catalysts. The H2-TPR of the V/Al catalyst reveals two strong high-temperature peaks centered at 663 and 783 C with a weak peak at 500 C. However, in the reduction patterns of the VSb/Al catalysts the high-temperature reduction peaks above 600 C are very weak, while the low-temperature reduction peak at 500 C becomes dominant. These results strongly indicate that the addition of antimony to the V/Al catalyst increases the reducibility of vanadium oxide.

The cumulative amounts of CO produced according to repetitive injections of CO2 pulses at 600 C over the pre-reduced V/Al and V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalysts are plotted in Fig. 3. It is confirmed from these pulse experiments that the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the reduced vanadium oxide of the catalysts produces CO and surface oxygen. One can see that the formation of CO over V0.43Sb0.57/Al is much more intensive than over V/Al. For V0.43Sb0.57/Al, the total amount of CO formed after injections of 40 CO2 pulses corresponds to 0.268 mol-CO/mol-V2O5 whereas over V/Al it is only 0.041 mol-CO/mol-V2O5. This result strongly suggests that re-oxidizability of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst with oxygen species originated from CO2 is much higher than that of the V/Al catalyst.

Table 2 summarizes binding energies and peak widths of V and Sb components taken from XPS of V/Al and V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalysts before and after reaction. For fresh V/Al and V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalysts, their BEs for V 2p3/2 (517.2517.6 eV) and Sb 3d3/2 (540.2 eV) correspond to V5+ and Sb5+, respectively, implying that the fresh catalysts possess the highest oxidation states of V and Sb. The parameters both of Sb 3d3/2 and V 2p3/2 peaks for the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst remain almost unchanged after catalytic reaction, but peak width of the V 2p3/2 for the used V/Al significantly increases relative to that for the fresh one, i.e., from 1.90 to 3.16 eV, pointing to the significant reduction of surface V-component during the reaction.

Among the factors determining the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, the redox behavior of vanadium oxide is known to play a key role in oxidative dehydrogenation, oxidation, and ammoxidation of hydrocarbons in accordance with the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism.23,2530,34,35 It can be proposed that the facile redox cycle between fully oxidized and reduced vanadium species yields the more effective catalyst.25 Likewise, the CO2-EBDH is expected to follow the same mechanism. Actually, the studied catalysts, especially Sb-containing ones, easily undergo reduction (H2-TPR data) and re-oxidation by carbon dioxide. As seen from CO2 pulse results, in the CO2-EBDH, carbon dioxide may act as an oxidant to provide oxygen species on the reduced catalyst surface and, consequently, re-oxidize the reduced vanadium species into an active (high) oxidation state. Adsorption of ethylbenzene, a strong reductant, on non-properly regenerated active sites may lead to strongly adsorbed organic intermediates similar to coke precursors and, consequently, to catalyst deactivation. The introduction of antimony oxide into the V/Al catalyst facilitated the redox cycle, resulting in enhancement of the catalyst stability as well as the catalytic activity. The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57/Al contains a new V1.1Sb0.9O4 phase. Centi et al. claimed that a non-stoichiometric rutile-type vanadium antimonate phase facilitates the redox transformation of vanadium.28 Therefore, the presence of a mixed vanadiumantimony oxide phase in V0.43Sb0.57/Al could promote catalyst stability for the CO2-EBDH reaction via the easier redox transformation of the vanadium ion. Additionally, the better dispersion of the active vanadium oxide component due to modification with antimony could be one of the reasons for the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts in the CO2-EBDH reaction.
The EBDH reaction in the presence of CO2 over the supported vanadium oxide catalysts would be carried out via two possible pathways: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with carbon dioxide as an oxidant that produces styrene and carbon monoxide along with water in one step and (ii) non-oxidative dehydrogenation of EB that produces styrene and hydrogen (in this case CO2 is inert). It is not easy to distinguish the above mentioned type of oxidative CO2-EBDH from the reverse watergas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O, ΔH = 41.6 kJ mol1 at 25 C), in which CO2 as an oxidant reacts with hydrogen dissociated from EB under the non-oxidative EBDH. Stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and styrene are detected in the non-oxidative EBDH reaction without CO2 over the V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts. However, carbon monoxide (with the stoichiometric amount of water) and hydrogen are simultaneously observed the CO2-EBDH reaction. These observations imply that the non-oxidative and oxidative pathways coexist under the conditions of the CO2-EBDH reaction. However, it is evident that V/Al and VSb/Al activities are increased by 1018% upon the addition of carbon dioxide to the reaction mixture. For V0.43Sb0.57/Al, the molar ratio of H2O/H2 in the product stream is estimated to be 1.4 and conversion of CO2 into CO is 41.8%. The formation of water along with carbon monoxide in the CO2-EBDH reaction and formation of CO in the course of CO2-pulse interaction with the pre-reduced catalysts (Fig. 3) strongly support that the CO2 molecule dissociates into CO and active surface oxygen, which can abstract hydrogen atoms from EB, and then results in the generation of water. Judging from these results, it is concluded that high activity and stability of the alumina-supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalysts under CO2 atmosphere would be mainly ascribed to the one-step oxidative route with participation of CO2 as an oxidant.
4 Conclusion
Alumina-supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalysts have been found to be very active, selective and relatively stable catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction to styrene. The most efficient V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst contains a new mixed vanadiumantimony oxide phase, V1.1Sb0.9O4, and reveals an enhanced redox property. The improved catalyst activity and stability is likely to arise from the presence of the latter VSb phase, which induces a facile redox transformation of vanadium ions.
