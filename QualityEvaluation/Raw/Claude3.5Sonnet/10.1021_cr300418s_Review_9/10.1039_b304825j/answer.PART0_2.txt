The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene reactions. However, it does provide insights into vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant. 

The preparation method described involves impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride. Dopant concentrations, specifically the ratio of vanadium to antimony, significantly influence catalyst performance. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst (V/Sb ratio of 0.75) showed the highest activity and stability.

The formation of a new mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) was observed to enhance the redox properties of the catalyst. This facilitated the redox cycle, improving both activity and stability. The presence of antimony oxide promoted better dispersion of the active vanadium oxide component.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:
1. Balancing conversion and selectivity - while high conversion (74-80%) and selectivity (>95%) were achieved, further optimization may be needed.
2. Maintaining catalyst stability - the addition of antimony significantly improved stability, but further research may be needed for long-term performance.
3. Understanding the complex interactions between vanadium and antimony species and their impact on catalytic performance.

While the document doesn't directly address theoretical modeling, it's clear that understanding the formation and properties of mixed oxide phases is crucial for catalyst design and optimization.

该文献并未直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂或乙烷制乙烯的反应。然而，它提供了关于使用CO2作为氧化剂的钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的见解。

所描述的制备方法涉及将活性氧化铝与偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑的水溶液进行浸渍。掺杂剂浓度，特别是钒与锑的比例，显著影响催化剂性能。V0.43Sb0.57/Al催化剂（V/Sb比例为0.75）显示出最高的活性和稳定性。

新的混合钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成被观察到可以增强催化剂的氧化还原性能。这促进了氧化还原循环，提高了活性和稳定性。氧化锑的存在促进了活性钒氧化物组分的更好分散。

该催化体系的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡转化率和选择性 - 虽然达到了高转化率（74-80%）和选择性（>95%），但可能需要进一步优化。
2. 维持催化剂稳定性 - 添加锑显著提高了稳定性，但可能需要进一步研究长期性能。
3. 理解钒和锑物种之间的复杂相互作用及其对催化性能的影响。

虽然文档没有直接涉及理论建模，但显然理解混合氧化物相的形成和性质对催化剂设计和优化至关重要。
