The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some insights into vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant, which may be relevant:

1. Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride, along with tartaric acid.

2. Dopant concentrations: The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%. Different ratios of vanadium to antimony were tested, with V0.43Sb0.57/Al showing the best performance.

3. Influence on catalytic performance: The addition of antimony oxide to vanadium oxide/alumina catalysts significantly improved both activity and stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Electronic structure: The improved performance was attributed to enhanced redox properties of the active V-sites, facilitated by the introduction of antimony oxide.

The study does not address the specific challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, or balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety for nickel oxide-based systems. However, it demonstrates the importance of understanding and optimizing the redox properties and stability of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并未直接讨论氧化镍基催化剂或问题中提到的特定氧化脱氢反应。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于以CO2为氧化剂的乙苯到苯乙烯氧化脱氢反应的见解，这些可能具有相关性：

1. 制备方法：催化剂是通过将活性氧化铝浸渍在偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑的水溶液中制备的，同时加入酒石酸。

2. 掺杂浓度：负载的金属氧化物总量约为20 wt%。测试了不同的钒与锑比例，其中V0.43Sb0.57/Al表现最佳。

3. 对催化性能的影响：向氧化钒/氧化铝催化剂中添加氧化锑显著提高了氧化脱氢反应的活性和稳定性。

4. 电子结构：性能的改善归因于活性V位点的氧化还原性能得到增强，这是由引入氧化锑促进的。

这项研究没有涉及氧化镍基系统的理论建模、工艺优化或平衡效率、选择性和安全性的具体挑战。然而，它展示了理解和优化金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的氧化还原性质和稳定性的重要性。
