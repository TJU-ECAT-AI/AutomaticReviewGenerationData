The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question about nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide relevant information about vanadium-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant, which can be used to draw some parallels.

Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of metal precursors, followed by drying and calcination.

Dopant concentrations: The total amount of supported metal oxides was about 20 wt%. Various dopants were studied, including Mg, P, Cr, Mo, and Sb. The optimal V/Sb ratio was found to be 0.43/0.57.

Influence on electronic structure and catalytic performance: The addition of antimony to vanadium catalysts facilitated the redox cycle, enhancing both catalyst stability and activity. This was attributed to the formation of a mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) that promoted easier redox transformation of vanadium ions.

Key challenges:
1. Balancing efficiency and stability: While some dopants (MgO, P2O5, MoO3) did not affect initial yields, they deteriorated on-stream catalytic activity.
2. Optimizing dopant ratios: The effect of antimony addition was maximized at a specific V/Sb ratio, highlighting the importance of precise dopant concentrations.
3. Understanding structure-activity relationships: The formation of new mixed oxide phases (e.g., V1.1Sb0.9O4) played a crucial role in catalyst performance, emphasizing the need for in-depth structural characterization.

While the study focuses on vanadium-based catalysts rather than nickel oxide-based ones, it demonstrates the importance of dopant selection, concentration optimization, and understanding of electronic and structural changes in developing efficient and stable catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献并未直接涉及镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的所有方面。然而，它提供了有关钒基催化剂在使用CO2作为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯反应中的相关信息，可以用来做一些类比。

制备方法：催化剂是通过将活性氧化铝浸渍在金属前体的水溶液中，然后干燥和煅烧制备而成。

掺杂剂浓度：负载的金属氧化物总量约为20重量%。研究了各种掺杂剂，包括Mg、P、Cr、Mo和Sb。最佳的V/Sb比例被发现为0.43/0.57。

对电子结构和催化性能的影响：向钒催化剂中添加锑促进了氧化还原循环，提高了催化剂的稳定性和活性。这归因于形成了混合的钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4），促进了钒离子更容易的氧化还原转化。

主要挑战：
1. 平衡效率和稳定性：虽然某些掺杂剂（MgO、P2O5、MoO3）不影响初始产率，但它们降低了催化剂的在线活性。
2. 优化掺杂剂比例：锑添加的效果在特定的V/Sb比例下最大化，突显了精确控制掺杂剂浓度的重要性。
3. 理解结构-活性关系：新的混合氧化物相（如V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成在催化剂性能中起关键作用，强调了深入结构表征的必要性。

虽然该研究主要关注钒基催化剂而非镍氧化物基催化剂，但它展示了在开发高效稳定的氧化脱氢反应催化剂时，掺杂剂选择、浓度优化以及理解电子和结构变化的重要性。

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights on vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene:

1. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of alumina support with aqueous solutions of vanadium and antimony precursors, followed by drying and calcination.

2. Dopant concentrations: The total metal oxide loading was about 20 wt%. The optimal ratio of vanadium to antimony was found to be V0.43Sb0.57/Al, which exhibited the highest activity and stability.

3. Influence on catalytic performance: Addition of antimony oxide to vanadium oxide catalysts significantly improved both activity and stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant. This was attributed to enhanced redox properties of the active vanadium sites.

4. Electronic structure: The improved performance was linked to the formation of a mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) that facilitated redox transformations of vanadium ions.

Key challenges mentioned include balancing catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. The study focused on optimizing the vanadium-antimony ratio to achieve this balance. Theoretical modeling aspects were not explicitly discussed in this literature.

The literature does not directly address nickel oxide-based catalysts or ethane to ethylene reactions. However, it does provide insights into vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as an oxidant. 

The preparation method described involves impregnation of activated alumina with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate and antimony(iii) chloride. Dopant concentrations, specifically the ratio of vanadium to antimony, significantly influence catalyst performance. The V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst (V/Sb ratio of 0.75) showed the highest activity and stability.

The formation of a new mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase (V1.1Sb0.9O4) was observed to enhance the redox properties of the catalyst. This facilitated the redox cycle, improving both activity and stability. The presence of antimony oxide promoted better dispersion of the active vanadium oxide component.

Key challenges in this catalytic system include:
1. Balancing conversion and selectivity - while high conversion (74-80%) and selectivity (>95%) were achieved, further optimization may be needed.
2. Maintaining catalyst stability - the addition of antimony significantly improved stability, but further research may be needed for long-term performance.
3. Understanding the complex interactions between vanadium and antimony species and their impact on catalytic performance.

While the document doesn't directly address theoretical modeling, it's clear that understanding the formation and properties of mixed oxide phases is crucial for catalyst design and optimization.

该文献并未直接讨论基于氧化镍的催化剂或乙烷制乙烯的反应。然而，它提供了关于使用CO2作为氧化剂的钒-锑氧化物催化剂用于乙苯氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的见解。

所描述的制备方法涉及将活性氧化铝与偏钒酸铵和三氯化锑的水溶液进行浸渍。掺杂剂浓度，特别是钒与锑的比例，显著影响催化剂性能。V0.43Sb0.57/Al催化剂（V/Sb比例为0.75）显示出最高的活性和稳定性。

新的混合钒-锑氧化物相（V1.1Sb0.9O4）的形成被观察到可以增强催化剂的氧化还原性能。这促进了氧化还原循环，提高了活性和稳定性。氧化锑的存在促进了活性钒氧化物组分的更好分散。

该催化体系的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡转化率和选择性 - 虽然达到了高转化率（74-80%）和选择性（>95%），但可能需要进一步优化。
2. 维持催化剂稳定性 - 添加锑显著提高了稳定性，但可能需要进一步研究长期性能。
3. 理解钒和锑物种之间的复杂相互作用及其对催化性能的影响。

虽然文档没有直接涉及理论建模，但显然理解混合氧化物相的形成和性质对催化剂设计和优化至关重要。
