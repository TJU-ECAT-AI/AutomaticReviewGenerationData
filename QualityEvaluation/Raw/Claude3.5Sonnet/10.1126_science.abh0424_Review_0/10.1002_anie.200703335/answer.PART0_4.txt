[1] "To enhance the ease of migration of the reactants to the active sites and improve the selectivity of this consecutive reaction we have designed a novel bifunctional catalyst with a core/shell structure where the core and shell components independently catalyze the different reactions."

[2] "This core/shell bifunctional catalyst is expected to show high selectivity in a consecutive reaction as it improves the collision possibility between intermediates and active sites significantly."

[3] "The zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst was used for the direct synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas to investigate the effect of the core/shell structure."

[4] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the core/shell catalyst described in this literature, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by:

1. Enhancing reactant migration and improving selectivity through a novel bifunctional catalyst design.

2. Increasing the collision probability between intermediates and active sites, leading to higher selectivity in consecutive reactions.

3. Creating a confined reaction environment that promotes spatially confined effects and shape selectivity.

4. Allowing for independent catalysis of different reactions by the core and shell components.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization include:

1. Improved product selectivity, as demonstrated by the suppression of heavy paraffins and increased production of middle isoparaffins in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis example.

2. Reduced need for separate reaction steps, as multiple reactions can occur within a single catalyst structure.

3. Enhanced control over reaction pathways and product distributions.

4. Potential for tailoring catalyst designs to specific reaction requirements across various consecutive reactions.

While the literature does not directly discuss the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, the principles of the core/shell catalyst design could potentially be applied to similar tandem catalysis processes to improve efficiency and selectivity.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念，如本文献中所描述的核壳催化剂，通过以下方式解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战：

1. 通过新型双功能催化剂设计，增强反应物迁移并提高选择性。

2. 增加中间体与活性位点之间的碰撞概率，从而在连续反应中获得更高的选择性。

3. 创造一个受限的反应环境，促进空间受限效应和形状选择性。

4. 允许核心和壳层组件独立催化不同的反应。

对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响包括：

1. 提高产品选择性，如费托合成示例中所展示的抑制重质石蜡和增加中等异构烷烃的生产。

2. 减少对单独反应步骤的需求，因为多个反应可以在单一催化剂结构中进行。

3. 增强对反应途径和产品分布的控制。

4. 有潜力为各种连续反应的特定需求定制催化剂设计。

虽然文献没有直接讨论In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，但核壳催化剂设计的原理可能适用于类似的串联催化过程，以提高效率和选择性。
