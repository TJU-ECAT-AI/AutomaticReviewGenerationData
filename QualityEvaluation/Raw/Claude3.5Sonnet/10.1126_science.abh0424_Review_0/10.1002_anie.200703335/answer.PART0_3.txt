[1] "To enhance the ease of migration of the reactants to the active sites and improve the selectivity of this consecutive reaction we have designed a novel bifunctional catalyst with a core/shell structure where the core and shell components independently catalyze the different reactions."

[2] "This core/shell bifunctional catalyst is expected to show high selectivity in a consecutive reaction as it improves the collision possibility between intermediates and active sites significantly."

[3] "The zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst was used for the direct synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas to investigate the effect of the core/shell structure."

[4] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the core/shell catalyst described in this literature, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by:

1. Enhancing reactant migration and improving selectivity through a novel bifunctional catalyst design with a core/shell structure.

2. Increasing the collision probability between intermediates and active sites, leading to higher selectivity in consecutive reactions.

3. Creating a confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity.

4. Allowing for independent catalysis of different reactions by the core and shell components.

This approach has potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization by:

1. Enabling direct synthesis of desired products (e.g., isoparaffins from syngas) in a single step, eliminating the need for separate reaction stages.

2. Improving product selectivity and distribution, potentially reducing unwanted byproducts and increasing overall process efficiency.

3. Providing a flexible catalyst design that can be extended to various consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and core catalyst.

4. Offering a simple preparation method with great potential for practical applications in industrial settings.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, the core/shell concept presented here could potentially be applied to similar tandem catalysis processes to improve efficiency and selectivity.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念，如本文献中描述的核壳催化剂所示，通过以下方式解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战：

1. 通过具有核壳结构的新型双功能催化剂设计，增强反应物迁移并提高选择性。

2. 增加中间体和活性位点之间的碰撞概率，从而提高连续反应的选择性。

3. 创造一个受限的反应环境，产生空间受限效应和形状选择性。

4. 允许核心和壳层组件独立催化不同的反应。

这种方法对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响包括：

1. 能够在单一步骤中直接合成所需产品（例如，从合成气中合成异构烷烃），消除了对单独反应阶段的需求。

2. 改善产品选择性和分布，可能减少不必要的副产品并提高整体过程效率。

3. 提供灵活的催化剂设计，可以通过修改壳层膜和核心催化剂来扩展到各种连续反应。

4. 提供一种简单的制备方法，在工业环境中具有巨大的实际应用潜力。

虽然该文献没有具体讨论In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，但这里提出的核壳概念可能适用于类似的串联催化过程，以提高效率和选择性。
