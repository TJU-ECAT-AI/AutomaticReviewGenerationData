[1] "To enhance the ease of migration of the reactants to the active sites and improve the selectivity of this consecutive reaction we have designed a novel bifunctional catalyst with a core/shell structure where the core and shell components independently catalyze the different reactions."

[2] "This core/shell bifunctional catalyst is expected to show high selectivity in a consecutive reaction as it improves the collision possibility between intermediates and active sites significantly."

[3] "The zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst was used for the direct synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas to investigate the effect of the core/shell structure."

[4] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the core/shell catalyst described in this literature, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by:

1. Enhancing reactant migration and improving selectivity through a novel bifunctional catalyst design with core/shell structure.

2. Increasing the collision probability between intermediates and active sites, leading to higher selectivity in consecutive reactions.

3. Creating a confined reaction environment that provides spatially confined effects and shape selectivity.

4. Allowing for independent catalysis of different reactions by the core and shell components.

This approach has potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization by:

1. Enabling the direct synthesis of desired products (e.g., isoparaffins from syngas) in a single step, eliminating the need for separate reaction stages.

2. Improving product selectivity and distribution, potentially reducing the need for downstream separation processes.

3. Offering a flexible design that can be extended to various consecutive reactions by modifying the shell membrane and core catalyst.

4. Potentially lowering energy requirements by combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst system.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, the principles of the core/shell catalyst design could potentially be applied to similar tandem catalysis processes for improved efficiency and selectivity.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the core/shell catalyst described in this literature, addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by creating a confined reaction environment where different catalytic components are spatially arranged to optimize reactant flow and product selectivity. 

This approach improves energy efficiency and process optimization in several ways:

1. It enhances the migration of reactants to active sites and improves selectivity in consecutive reactions.

2. The core/shell structure increases the collision probability between intermediates and active sites, leading to higher selectivity.

3. It provides spatial confinement effects and shape selectivity, allowing for better control of product distribution.

4. The design allows for independent optimization of different catalytic components while maintaining their proximity.

5. It can potentially reduce the number of separate reaction steps required in a process, leading to more efficient overall systems.

While the literature focuses on a Co/Al2O3 catalyst coated with H-beta zeolite for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the principles could be extended to other reaction systems. The potential implications include more efficient production of desired products, reduced energy consumption through process integration, and improved atom economy in chemical processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念，如文献中所描述的核壳催化剂，通过创建一个受限的反应环境来解决整合多个反应步骤的挑战，在这个环境中，不同的催化组分在空间上被安排以优化反应物流动和产物选择性。

这种方法通过以下几种方式提高了能源效率和过程优化：

1. 它增强了反应物向活性位点的迁移，并提高了连续反应的选择性。

2. 核壳结构增加了中间体与活性位点之间的碰撞概率，从而提高了选择性。

3. 它提供了空间限制效应和形状选择性，允许更好地控制产物分布。

4. 该设计允许独立优化不同的催化组分，同时保持它们的邻近性。

5. 它可能减少过程中所需的单独反应步骤数量，从而导致更高效的整体系统。

虽然这篇文献主要关注用于费希尔-托罗普合成的包覆H-beta沸石的Co/Al2O3催化剂，但这些原理可以扩展到其他反应系统。潜在的影响包括更高效地生产所需产品，通过过程集成减少能源消耗，以及改善化学过程中的原子经济性。
