Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions to occur within a single condition. This approach helps minimize energy consumption and economic costs associated with multiple unit operations.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This tandem catalyst utilizes a porous overcoating structure to coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates between different catalytic sites.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By enabling instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, the catalyst can drive the catalytic dehydrogenation process forward, overcoming thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This approach could lead to more efficient production of propylene from propane, addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market.

Overall, tandem catalysis at the nanoscale offers a promising strategy for integrating multiple reaction steps, potentially leading to more energy-efficient and economically viable chemical engineering processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过在单一条件下实现连续反应来解决化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法有助于最小化与多个单元操作相关的能源消耗和经济成本。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧来exemplify这一概念。这种串联催化剂利用多孔包覆结构来协调不同催化位点之间的反应中间体的传输。

对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是显著的。通过实现H2的即时去除和选择性燃烧，催化剂可以推动催化脱氢过程向前进行，克服非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这种方法可能导致更高效的丙烯从丙烷生产，解决烯烃市场的供需缺口。

总的来说，纳米尺度上的串联催化为整合多个反应步骤提供了一种有前景的策略，可能导致更加节能和经济可行的化学工程过程。
