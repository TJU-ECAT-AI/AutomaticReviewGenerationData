Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions to occur within one condition. This approach aims to minimize energy consumption and economic costs associated with traditional multi-step processes.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This tandem catalyst features a porous overcoating structure that coordinates the transport of reactive intermediates between catalytic sites, which is crucial for manipulating the process of tandem catalysis.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By enabling the instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, the catalytic dehydrogenation process can be pushed forward, breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This approach can lead to more efficient production of propylene from propane, addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market while potentially reducing energy consumption and improving overall process efficiency.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过在单一条件下允许顺序反应发生，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法旨在最小化与传统多步骤过程相关的能源消耗和经济成本。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧exemplifies了这一概念。这种串联催化剂具有多孔的覆盖结构，协调反应中间体在催化位点之间的传输，这对于操纵串联催化过程至关重要。

对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是显著的。通过实现H2的即时去除和选择性燃烧，可以推动催化脱氢过程向前发展，打破非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这种方法可以实现更高效的丙烷到丙烯的生产，解决烯烃市场的供需缺口，同时潜在地减少能源消耗并提高整体过程效率。
