Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions to occur within a single condition. This approach is particularly effective for emerging chemical industries as it helps minimize energy consumption and economic costs.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The porous overcoating structure of this catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the propane dehydrogenation reaction forward.

The key to successful tandem catalysis lies in the careful design of catalysts that can coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among different catalytic sites. This coordination allows for control over reaction sequences and selectivity, even when reactants, intermediates, and products coexist in the same environment.

In the case of propane dehydrogenation, the instant removal of H2 through selective combustion helps overcome thermodynamic limitations of the non-oxidative catalytic reaction. This process optimization has significant implications for energy efficiency, as it allows the reaction to proceed under more favorable conditions and potentially reduces the overall energy input required.

By integrating multiple reaction steps into a single process, tandem catalysis at the nanoscale offers a promising approach to improving the efficiency and sustainability of chemical engineering processes, particularly in industries where process optimization is crucial for economic and environmental reasons.

纳米尺度上的串联催化通过允许在单一条件下进行顺序反应来解决化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法对新兴化学工业特别有效，因为它有助于最小化能源消耗和经济成本。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧相结合，exemplifies了这一概念。这种催化剂的多孔覆盖结构调节了氢物种的传输，促进了选择性H2燃烧，从而推动了丙烷脱氢反应的进行。

成功的串联催化的关键在于仔细设计能够协调不同催化位点之间反应中间体传输的催化剂。这种协调允许在反应物、中间体和产物共存的同一环境中控制反应序列和选择性。

在丙烷脱氢的情况下，通过选择性燃烧即时去除H2有助于克服非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这种过程优化对能源效率有重大影响，因为它允许反应在更有利的条件下进行，并可能减少所需的总体能源输入。

通过将多个反应步骤整合到一个单一过程中，纳米尺度上的串联催化为提高化学工程过程的效率和可持续性提供了一种有前景的方法，特别是在那些过程优化对经济和环境原因至关重要的行业中。
