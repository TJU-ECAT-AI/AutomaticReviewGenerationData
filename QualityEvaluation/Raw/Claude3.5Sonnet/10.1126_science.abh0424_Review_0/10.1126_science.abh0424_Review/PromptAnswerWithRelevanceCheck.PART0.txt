Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions to occur within a single condition. This approach is particularly effective for emerging chemical industries as it helps minimize energy consumption and economic costs.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The porous overcoating structure of this catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward.

The key to successful tandem catalysis lies in the careful design of catalysts that can coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among different catalytic sites. This coordination allows for control over reaction sequence and selectivity, even when reactants, intermediates, and products coexist in the same environment.

In terms of energy efficiency and process optimization, tandem catalysis offers significant potential. By enabling the instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, it can push catalytic dehydrogenation forward and overcome thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This approach could lead to more efficient chemical processes, reducing energy consumption and improving overall process performance.
