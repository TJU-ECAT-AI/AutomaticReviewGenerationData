Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions to occur within a single condition. This approach minimizes energy consumption and economic costs by coordinating the transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. Its porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species, promoting selective H2 combustion and driving the propane dehydrogenation reaction forward.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By enabling instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, tandem catalysis can overcome thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This allows the process to move forward more efficiently, potentially reducing energy requirements and improving overall process performance in chemical industries.

纳米尺度的串联催化通过在单一条件下允许顺序反应的发生来解决化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法通过协调催化位点之间反应中间体的传输，最大限度地减少了能源消耗和经济成本。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，例证了这一概念。其多孔覆盖层结构调节氢物种的传输，促进选择性H2燃烧，并推动丙烷脱氢反应向前进行。

对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是显著的。通过实现通过选择性燃烧即时去除H2，串联催化可以克服非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这使得过程能够更有效地向前推进，可能减少能源需求并提高化学工业的整体过程性能。
