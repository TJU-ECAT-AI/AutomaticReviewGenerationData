Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by allowing sequential reactions to occur within a single condition. This approach is particularly effective for emerging chemical industries as it helps minimize energy consumption and economic costs.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The porous overcoating structure of this catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward.

The key to successful tandem catalysis lies in the careful design of catalysts that can coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among different catalytic sites. This coordination allows for control over reaction sequence and selectivity, even when reactants, intermediates, and products coexist in the same environment.

In terms of energy efficiency and process optimization, tandem catalysis offers significant potential. By enabling the instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, it can push catalytic dehydrogenation forward and overcome thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This approach could lead to more efficient chemical processes, reducing energy consumption and improving overall process performance.

纳米尺度的串联催化通过在单一条件下允许顺序反应的发生，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法对新兴化学工业特别有效，因为它有助于最小化能源消耗和经济成本。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧来例证这一概念。这种催化剂的多孔覆盖结构调节氢物种的传输并促进选择性H2燃烧，从而推动催化丙烷脱氢向前进行。

成功的串联催化的关键在于仔细设计能够协调不同催化位点之间反应中间体传输的催化剂。这种协调允许在反应物、中间体和产物共存的同一环境中控制反应顺序和选择性。

在能源效率和过程优化方面，串联催化提供了巨大的潜力。通过实现H2的即时去除和选择性燃烧，它可以推动催化脱氢向前进行，克服非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这种方法可能导致更高效的化学过程，减少能源消耗并提高整体过程性能。
