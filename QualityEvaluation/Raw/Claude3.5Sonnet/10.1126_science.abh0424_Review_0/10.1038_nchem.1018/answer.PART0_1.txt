The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by introducing nanocrystal catalysts with multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces. This approach allows for the catalysis of sequential reactions on a single nanostructured catalyst.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By combining multiple reaction steps on a single catalyst, the need for separate reactors or intermediate product isolation can be reduced, potentially leading to more streamlined and efficient processes. The example given in the literature demonstrates how methanol decomposition and ethylene hydroformylation can be combined in a single catalytic system, producing propanal from methanol and ethylene.

While the specific In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is not mentioned in this literature, the general principle of tandem catalysis could be applied to similar systems. The ability to rationally design and assemble nanocrystal bilayers with multiple built-in metal-metal oxide interfaces opens up possibilities for creating high-performance, multifunctional catalysts for various multiple-step chemical reactions.

This approach represents a powerful new method for designing catalysts that can potentially improve energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering by combining multiple reaction steps in a single, well-designed catalytic system.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过引入具有多个金属-金属氧化物界面的纳米晶催化剂，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法允许在单个纳米结构催化剂上进行顺序反应的催化。

对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是显著的。通过在单个催化剂上结合多个反应步骤，可以减少对单独反应器或中间产物分离的需求，潜在地导致更精简和高效的过程。文献中给出的例子展示了如何在单个催化系统中结合甲醇分解和乙烯氢甲酰化，从甲醇和乙烯生产丙醛。

虽然文献中没有提到特定的In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，但串联催化的一般原理可以应用于类似的系统。能够理性设计和组装具有多个内置金属-金属氧化物界面的纳米晶双层，为创造各种多步化学反应的高性能、多功能催化剂开辟了可能性。

这种方法代表了设计催化剂的一种强大的新方法，通过在单个精心设计的催化系统中结合多个反应步骤，可能改善化学工程中的能源效率和过程优化。
