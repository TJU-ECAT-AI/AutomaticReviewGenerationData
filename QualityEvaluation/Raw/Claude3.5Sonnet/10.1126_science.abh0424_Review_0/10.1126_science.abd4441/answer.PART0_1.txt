[1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."

[2] "We translated these macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for ODHP-like propane to propylene."

[3] "The overcoated, tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."

[4] "Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by coupling different catalytic functions within a single nanostructured particle. This approach allows for precise control over reactive intermediates and enables the sequencing of reactions that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in conventional reactor designs.

In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it combines the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) function of platinum with the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) capability of indium oxide. This nanoscale integration allows for the direct transfer of hydrogen atoms between catalytic domains, effectively coupling the two reactions and driving the overall process forward.

The implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst particle, this approach can minimize the need for intermediate separations and reduce the overall energy requirements of the process. The tandem catalyst design also allows for better control over selectivity and yield, as demonstrated by its ability to exceed the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of traditional PDH processes.

Furthermore, this nanoscale tandem catalysis concept opens up new possibilities for process intensification and the development of more efficient chemical production routes. It provides a way to overcome limitations in selective oxidations and other challenging reactions by precisely controlling the spatial and temporal aspects of catalytic transformations at the nanoscale.

Overall, this approach represents a promising direction for improving the efficiency and selectivity of complex chemical processes, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable production methods for important industrial intermediates like propylene.

这对能源效率和过程优化的影响是显著的。通过在单个催化剂粒子中结合多个反应步骤，这种方法可以最大限度地减少中间分离的需求，并降低过程的整体能源需求。串联催化剂设计还允许更好地控制选择性和产率，正如它能够超越传统PDH过程的热力学平衡转化所证明的那样。

此外，这种纳米尺度串联催化概念为过程强化和更高效化学生产路线的开发开辟了新的可能性。它通过精确控制纳米尺度上催化转化的空间和时间方面，提供了一种克服选择性氧化和其他具有挑战性反应限制的方法。

总的来说，这种方法代表了提高复杂化学过程效率和选择性的有前景的方向，有可能为重要的工业中间体（如丙烯）带来更可持续和经济可行的生产方法。
