[1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."

[2] "We translated these macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for ODHP-like propane to propylene."

[3] "The overcoated, tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."

[4] "Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by combining different catalytic functions into a single nanostructured particle. This approach allows for precise control over reactive intermediates and enables the coupling of multiple reactions in a spatially and temporally controlled manner.

In the case of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, this concept is applied to couple catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This nanoscale tandem catalyst design offers several advantages:

1. Improved efficiency: By combining two reaction steps (dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion) in a single catalyst particle, the process becomes more efficient, eliminating the need for separate reaction stages or complex reactor designs.

2. Enhanced selectivity and yield: The intimate contact between the Pt dehydrogenation sites and the In2O3 selective hydrogen combustion sites allows for better control of reactive intermediates, leading to improved selectivity and higher propylene yields that exceed the thermodynamic equilibrium of conventional propane dehydrogenation.

3. Process intensification: The tandem catalyst design enables the integration of multiple reaction steps in a single reactor, potentially simplifying process engineering and reducing equipment costs.

4. Stability: The overcoat structure of the catalyst helps stabilize metal nanoparticles, leading to improved catalyst longevity and performance over time.

5. Biomimetic approach: The direct transfer of reactive intermediates between different catalyst functions mimics the efficiency of biological systems, potentially opening new avenues for catalyst design in other chemical processes.

The implications of this approach for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By achieving higher yields and selectivity in a single step, the overall energy consumption of the process can be reduced. Additionally, the ability to overcome thermodynamic limitations of conventional processes suggests that similar tandem catalyst designs could be applied to other challenging reactions, potentially revolutionizing chemical production methods and improving the sustainability of industrial processes.

纳米尺度的串联催化概念通过将不同的催化功能结合到单个纳米结构颗粒中，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法允许对反应中间体进行精确控制，并能够以空间和时间可控的方式耦合多个反应。

在In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂的案例中，这一概念被应用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧。这种纳米尺度的串联催化剂设计提供了几个优势：

1. 提高效率：通过在单个催化剂颗粒中结合两个反应步骤（脱氢和选择性氢燃烧），该过程变得更加高效，消除了对单独反应阶段或复杂反应器设计的需求。

2. 增强选择性和产率：Pt脱氢位点和In2O3选择性氢燃烧位点之间的紧密接触允许更好地控制反应中间体，从而提高选择性和丙烯产率，超过了常规丙烷脱氢的热力学平衡。

3. 过程强化：串联催化剂设计使得在单个反应器中整合多个反应步骤成为可能，potentially简化了过程工程并降低了设备成本。

4. 稳定性：催化剂的覆盖层结构有助于稳定金属纳米颗粒，从而提高催化剂的寿命和长期性能。

5. 仿生方法：不同催化功能之间反应中间体的直接转移模仿了生物系统的效率，potentially为其他化学过程的催化剂设计开辟了新途径。

这种方法对能源效率和过程优化的影响是显著的。通过在单一步骤中实现更高的产率和选择性，可以降低过程的整体能耗。此外，克服传统过程热力学限制的能力表明，类似的串联催化剂设计可以应用于其他具有挑战性的反应，potentially革新化学生产方法并提高工业过程的可持续性。
