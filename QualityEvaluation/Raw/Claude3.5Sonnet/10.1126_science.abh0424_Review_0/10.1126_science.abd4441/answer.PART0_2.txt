[1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."

[2] "We translated these macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for ODHP-like propane to propylene."

[3] "The overcoated, tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."

[4] "Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions."

Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by coupling reactions and controlling reactive intermediates at a precise level. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by combining propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) into a single nanostructured catalyst particle.

This approach has significant implications for energy efficiency and process optimization:

1. Improved yields: The tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) catalysts and exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion for non-oxidative PDH, demonstrating its potential to enhance process efficiency.

2. Better reaction control: The nanoscale design allows for tight coupling of reactions, balancing activity and selectivity by facilitating the direct transfer of reactive intermediates between different catalyst functions.

3. Increased stability: The overcoat structure stabilizes metal nanoparticles, potentially extending catalyst lifetime and reducing the need for frequent regeneration or replacement.

4. Process intensification: By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst particle, this approach can potentially simplify reactor designs and reduce the need for separate unit operations.

5. Biomimetic approach: The direct transfer of reactive intermediates between catalyst functions mimics biological systems, potentially opening new avenues for highly efficient and selective catalytic processes.

These advancements in nanoscale tandem catalysis have the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering, leading to more sustainable and economical industrial processes.

纳米尺度的串联催化通过在精确水平上耦合反应和控制反应中间体，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过将丙烷脱氢（PDH）和选择性氢气燃烧（SHC）结合到单个纳米结构催化剂颗粒中，例证了这一概念。

这种方法对能源效率和过程优化有重要意义：

1. 提高产率：串联催化剂的性能优于最先进的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）催化剂，并超过了非氧化PDH的热力学平衡转化率，展示了其提高过程效率的潜力。

2. 更好的反应控制：纳米尺度设计允许反应紧密耦合，通过促进不同催化剂功能之间反应中间体的直接转移，平衡活性和选择性。

3. 增加稳定性：覆盖层结构稳定了金属纳米粒子，可能延长催化剂寿命并减少频繁再生或更换的需求。

4. 过程强化：通过在单个催化剂颗粒中结合多个反应步骤，这种方法可能简化反应器设计并减少对单独单元操作的需求。

5. 仿生方法：催化剂功能之间反应中间体的直接转移模仿了生物系统，可能为高效和选择性催化过程开辟新途径。

这些纳米尺度串联催化的进展有潜力显著提高化学工程中的能源效率和过程优化，从而导致更可持续和经济的工业过程。
