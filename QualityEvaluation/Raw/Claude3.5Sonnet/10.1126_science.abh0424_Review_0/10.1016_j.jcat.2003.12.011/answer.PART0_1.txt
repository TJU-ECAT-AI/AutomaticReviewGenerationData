[1] "Thermodynamic constraints were removed by selective combustion of H2 using O2 coreactants. More than 90% of the O2 introduced was used to form H2O from H2, even when hydrocarbons were the predominant available reactants."

[2] "A previous study reported C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions coupled with H2 combustion in a three-stage process designed to increase C3H6 yields above equilibrium values"

[3] "Staging strategies, however, avoid the cyclic operation required in multistage systems, while using a single catalysts for selective combustion of H2 and dehydrogenation of alkanes; these features markedly decrease process complexity and costs."

[4] "Staged O2 introduction can be implemented using multiple injectors in large-scale packed-bed or fluid-bed reactors. It can also be achieved using ceramic membranes as reactor walls, which can additionally separate pure O2 from ambient air."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by combining different catalytic functions in a single system. In this case, the Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst integrates propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This approach improves energy efficiency and process optimization in several ways:

1. It removes thermodynamic constraints by selectively combusting H2, allowing higher alkene yields than equilibrium limitations.

2. It achieves high selectivity for H2 combustion (>90%) even with hydrocarbons as predominant reactants.

3. It simplifies the process by using a single catalyst for both dehydrogenation and H2 combustion, avoiding the need for multi-stage systems.

4. It can be implemented in large-scale reactors using staged O2 introduction through multiple injectors or ceramic membranes.

These improvements lead to higher product yields, simplified processes, and potentially lower energy requirements compared to traditional multi-step processes. The tandem catalysis approach demonstrates the potential for nanoscale catalyst design to integrate multiple functions and optimize complex chemical processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过在单一系统中结合不同的催化功能来解决整合多个反应步骤的挑战。在这种情况下，Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂将丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧相结合。这种方法通过以下几种方式提高了能源效率和过程优化：

1. 它通过选择性地燃烧H2来消除热力学限制，使烯烃产率高于平衡限制。

2. 即使在碳氢化合物为主要反应物的情况下，它也能实现高选择性的H2燃烧（>90%）。

3. 它通过使用单一催化剂进行脱氢和H2燃烧来简化过程，避免了多阶段系统的需求。

4. 它可以通过多个喷射器或陶瓷膜进行分段O2引入，在大规模反应器中实现。

这些改进导致了更高的产品产率、简化的过程，并可能降低能源需求，相比传统的多步骤过程。串联催化方法展示了纳米尺度催化剂设计在整合多种功能和优化复杂化学过程方面的潜力。
