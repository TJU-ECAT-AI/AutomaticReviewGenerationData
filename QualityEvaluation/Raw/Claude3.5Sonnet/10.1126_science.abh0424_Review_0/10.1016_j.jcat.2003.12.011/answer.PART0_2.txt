[1] "Previous studies of O2 staging during C3H8 dehydrocyclodimerization reactions on cation-exchanged H-[Al]ZSM5 [41] led to significant increases in aromatic yields over those achieved with pure C3H8 reactants."

[2] "A previous study reported C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions coupled with H2 combustion in a three-stage process designed to increase C3H6 yields above equilibrium values [25]. In this scheme, the first and third stages contained 0.7 wt% PtSn[AL]ZSM5 (2 g) and the intermediate stage contained 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 (0.1 g), which provided lattice oxygen atoms for selective combustion of H2 formed in the first stage."

[3] "Staging strategies, however, avoid the cyclic operation required in multistage systems, while using a single catalysts for selective combustion of H2 and dehydrogenation of alkanes; these features markedly decrease process complexity and costs."

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps by combining different catalytic functions in close proximity. As exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, this approach offers several advantages:

1. Improved energy efficiency: By selectively removing H2 through combustion, the equilibrium limitations of the dehydrogenation reaction are overcome, allowing for higher yields at lower temperatures.

2. Process optimization: The use of a single catalyst for both dehydrogenation and H2 combustion simplifies the reactor design and operation compared to multi-stage systems.

3. Reduced complexity and costs: Tandem catalysis eliminates the need for separate reactors or cyclic operations, leading to more streamlined and cost-effective processes.

4. Enhanced selectivity: The close proximity of catalytic sites allows for better control over reaction pathways, potentially reducing unwanted side reactions.

5. Improved heat management: The exothermic H2 combustion reaction can provide heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, potentially improving overall energy efficiency.

The implications of this approach for chemical engineering processes are significant, as it offers a path to more efficient, compact, and integrated reaction systems. This could lead to reduced energy consumption, smaller plant footprints, and potentially lower capital and operating costs for many industrial processes.

纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过在近距离结合不同的催化功能来解决集成多个反应步骤的挑战。以In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧为例，这种方法提供了几个优势：

1. 提高能源效率：通过选择性地通过燃烧去除H2，克服了脱氢反应的平衡限制，允许在较低温度下获得更高的产率。

2. 过程优化：使用单一催化剂同时进行脱氢和H2燃烧，相比多级系统简化了反应器设计和操作。

3. 降低复杂性和成本：串联催化消除了对单独反应器或循环操作的需求，导致更精简和成本效益的过程。

4. 提高选择性：催化位点的紧密邻近允许更好地控制反应路径，可能减少不必要的副反应。

5. 改善热管理：放热的H2燃烧反应可以为吸热的脱氢反应提供热量，可能提高整体能源效率。

这种方法对化学工程过程的影响是显著的，因为它为更高效、紧凑和集成的反应系统提供了一条路径。这可能导致许多工业过程的能源消耗减少、工厂占地面积缩小，以及潜在的资本和运营成本降低。
