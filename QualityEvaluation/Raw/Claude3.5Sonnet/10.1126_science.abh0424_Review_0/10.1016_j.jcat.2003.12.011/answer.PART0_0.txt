[1] "Staged introduction of O2 coreactants during C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation led to selective combustion of H2 products and to the substantial removal of thermodynamic constraints."

[2] "Thermodynamic constraints were removed by selective combustion of H2 using O2 coreactants. More than 90% of the O2 introduced was used to form H2O from H2, even when hydrocarbons were the predominant available reactants."

[3] "The O2 staging approach reported here requires only one reactor and one catalytic composition; thus, it decreases significantly process complexity and cost."

[4] "A previous study reported C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions coupled with H2 combustion in a three-stage process designed to increase C3H6 yields above equilibrium values"

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the staged O2 introduction approach for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, addresses several challenges in integrating multiple reaction steps:

1. It removes thermodynamic constraints by selectively combusting H2 products, allowing for higher alkene yields than equilibrium would normally permit.

2. It achieves high selectivity for H2 combustion (>90%) even in the presence of predominantly hydrocarbon reactants, demonstrating efficient integration of dehydrogenation and combustion steps.

3. It simplifies process complexity and reduces costs by using a single reactor and catalyst composition, rather than separate stages for each reaction step.

4. It provides better control over reaction conditions, allowing for precise O2 introduction rates that match H2 formation and avoid undesired side reactions.

The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization include:

1. Higher product yields from a given amount of feedstock, improving overall process efficiency.

2. Reduced separation and recycling costs due to higher single-pass conversions.

3. Lower capital and operating costs from using a simpler, single-stage process.

4. Improved catalyst stability and longevity through controlled reaction conditions.

5. Potential for process intensification by combining multiple steps in a single reactor.

This approach demonstrates how nanoscale catalyst design can enable more efficient, integrated processes that overcome traditional thermodynamic and kinetic limitations in chemical engineering.
