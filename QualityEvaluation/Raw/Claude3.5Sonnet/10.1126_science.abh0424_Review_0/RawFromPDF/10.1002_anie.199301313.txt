Graphical Abstract
Simple, efficient, highly selective, and resource saving are syntheses of complex organic compounds in which several transformations are combained to sequences like domino, tandem, or cascade reactions, and for which intermediates need not be isolated. The tandem Knoevenagel hetero-Diels–Alder reaction of aldehyde 1 with Meldrum's acid 2 via 3 to 4 is an example of the sequential transformations which are systematically classified in this review.

Abstract
Organic-chemical synthesis has always fascinated chemists and will not lose its importance in the future. It is a truism that all chemists—and others too—are dependent on the synthesis of those compounds with which they want to work. As a result, organic-chemical synthesis today is more than ever before the cutting edge of organic chemistry, biology, biochemistry, medicine, physics, and material science. Synthesis is also the basis of the chemical industry. For the passionate synthetic chemist, however, synthesis is much more than just a method for obtaining compounds; it is the expression of his creativity, intelligence, ability, and also his perseverance.
