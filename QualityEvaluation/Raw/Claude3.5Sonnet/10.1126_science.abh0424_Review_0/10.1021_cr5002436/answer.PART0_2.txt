The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the given literature. The document does not contain information about integrating multiple reaction steps or the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The literature primarily focuses on various catalyst types for alkane dehydrogenation, their mechanisms, and industrial applications, but does not discuss tandem catalysis or its implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the context mentioned in the question.
