The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the given literature. The document does not contain information about integrating multiple reaction steps or the specific In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The literature primarily focuses on various catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, including platinum-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, but does not discuss tandem catalysis or its implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the context described in the question.
