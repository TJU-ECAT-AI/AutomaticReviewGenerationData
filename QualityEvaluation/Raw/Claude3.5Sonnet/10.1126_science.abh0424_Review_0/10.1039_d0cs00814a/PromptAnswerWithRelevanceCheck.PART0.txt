<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the given literature. The document does not contain information about In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The literature focuses mainly on conventional propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes, without discussing integrated reaction steps or tandem catalysis approaches. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.
