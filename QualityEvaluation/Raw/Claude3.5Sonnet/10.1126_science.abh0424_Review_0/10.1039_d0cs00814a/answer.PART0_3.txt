The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the given literature. The document does not contain specific information about an In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The literature focuses mainly on conventional propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes, without mentioning this particular tandem catalysis approach. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question based solely on the information given in the document.

该文献中没有直接涉及纳米尺度串联催化的概念。文档中不包含关于将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合的In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂的具体信息。该文献主要关注传统的丙烷脱氢催化剂和工艺,没有提到这种特定的串联催化方法。因此,仅基于文档中给出的信息,我无法对这个问题给出准确的回答。
