The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the given literature. The document does not contain information about In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The literature focuses mainly on conventional propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes, without discussing integrated reaction steps or tandem catalysis approaches. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.

给定的文献中没有直接涉及纳米尺度上的串联催化概念。文档中不包含关于将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合的In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂的信息。该文献主要集中在传统的丙烷脱氢催化剂和工艺上,没有讨论集成反应步骤或串联催化方法。因此,仅基于所提供的文本无法充分回答这个问题。
