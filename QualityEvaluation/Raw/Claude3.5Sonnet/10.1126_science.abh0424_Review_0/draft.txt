1. The introduction, principles, and application of tandem catalysis in chemical engineering processes, with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs, exemplified by a novel nanoscale porous overcoating catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.

The introduction of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes. This approach involves the design and implementation of nanostructured catalysts that can perform sequential reactions within a single condition, offering improved efficiency and reduced costs in chemical processing [10.1126/science.abh0424].

The principles of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale are exemplified by various catalyst designs:

1. Nanocrystal catalysts with multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces: These catalysts enable the integration of different catalytic functions within a single nanostructured system. For example, a CeO2-Pt-SiO2 catalyst combines methanol decomposition and ethylene hydroformylation in one system [10.1038/nchem.1018].

2. Core/shell bifunctional catalysts: These catalysts feature a core and shell structure where each component independently catalyzes different reactions. This design enhances reactant migration, improves selectivity, and increases the collision probability between intermediates and active sites [10.1002/anie.200703335].

3. Overcoated tandem catalysts: Exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, these catalysts feature a porous overcoating structure that regulates the transport of reactive intermediates between different catalytic sites [10.1126/science.abd4441].

The application of tandem catalysis in chemical engineering processes offers several advantages:

1. Process intensification: By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst particle, tandem catalysis can simplify reactor designs and reduce the need for separate unit operations [10.1126/science.abd4441].

2. Improved yields: Tandem catalysts can achieve higher per-pass yields that exceed thermodynamic equilibrium limitations of conventional processes [10.1126/science.abd4441].

3. Enhanced selectivity: The coordinated transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites allows for better control over reaction sequences and product selectivity [10.1126/science.abh0424].

4. Reduced energy consumption and costs: By integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations, tandem catalysis minimizes energy consumption and economic costs associated with traditional multi-step processes [10.1126/science.abh0424].

5. Overcoming thermodynamic constraints: Selective combustion of byproducts (e.g., H2) can drive reactions forward, breaking thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2003.12.011].

The novel nanoscale porous overcoating catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion (In2O3-Pt/Al2O3) demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis for improving efficiency and reducing costs. This catalyst achieves rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields, exceeding the thermodynamic equilibrium of conventional propane dehydrogenation [10.1126/science.abd4441].

The porous overcoating structure of this catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward [10.1126/science.abh0424]. This approach not only improves yields but also simplifies the process by using a single reactor and catalytic composition, significantly decreasing process complexity and cost [10.1016/j.jcat.2003.12.011].
