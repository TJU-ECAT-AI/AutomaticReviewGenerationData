[1] "We introduce here a new class of nanocrystal tandem catalysts that have multiple metalmetal oxide interfaces for the catalysis of sequential reactions."

[2] "The CeO2Pt interface catalysed methanol decomposition to produce CO and H2, which were subsequently used for ethylene hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby PtSiO2 interface."

[3] "This new concept of nanocrystal tandem catalysis represents a powerful approach towards designing high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts."

[4] "Although tandem catalysis was employed previously in homogenous catalytic systems, this study is the first attempt to use rationally designed and assembled nanocrystal bilayers with multiple built-in metalmetal oxide interfaces."

[5] "Sequential chemical reactions at two different neighbouring metalmetal oxide interfaces acted to produce propanal selectively."

[1] "To enhance the ease of migration of the reactants to the active sites and improve the selectivity of this consecutive reaction we have designed a novel bifunctional catalyst with a core/shell structure where the core and shell components independently catalyze the different reactions."

[2] "This core/shell bifunctional catalyst is expected to show high selectivity in a consecutive reaction as it improves the collision possibility between intermediates and active sites significantly."

[3] "The zeolite-coated Co/Al2O3 catalyst was used for the direct synthesis of isoparaffins from syngas to investigate the effect of the core/shell structure."

[4] "This core/shell membrane catalyst provides a tailor-made confined reaction environment that results in spatially confined effects and shape selectivity, which can be extended to various consecutive reactions as the shell and core components are independent catalysts of different reactions."

[1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."

[2] "We translated these macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for ODHP-like propane to propylene."

[3] "The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium."

[4] "The overcoated, tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."

[5] "Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions."

[1] "Staged introduction of O2 coreactants during C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation led to selective combustion of H2 products and to the substantial removal of thermodynamic constraints."

[2] "Thermodynamic constraints were removed by selective combustion of H2 using O2 coreactants. More than 90% of the O2 introduced was used to form H2O from H2, even when hydrocarbons were the predominant available reactants."

[3] "The O2 staging approach reported here requires only one reactor and one catalytic composition; thus, it decreases significantly process complexity and cost."

[4] "A previous study reported C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions coupled with H2 combustion in a three-stage process designed to increase C3H6 yields above equilibrium values"

[5] "Staging strategies, however, avoid the cyclic operation required in multistage systems, while using a single catalysts for selective combustion of H2 and dehydrogenation of alkanes; these features markedly decrease process complexity and costs."

[6] "Staged O2 introduction can be implemented using multiple injectors in large-scale packed-bed or fluid-bed reactors. It can also be achieved using ceramic membranes as reactor walls, which can additionally separate pure O2 from ambient air."

[1] "A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries"

[2] "To control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products, the design of tandem catalysts plays a crucial role in mediating the multiple reactions under the same condition"

[3] "The key to manipulating the process of tandem catalysis is to coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites"

[4] "The porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes the selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward."

[5] "Instant removal of H2 through selective combustion could force the catalytic dehydrogenation to move forward and break the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction"

[6] "To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations."
