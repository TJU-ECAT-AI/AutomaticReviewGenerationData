This approach aims to minimize energy consumption and economic costs associated with traditional multi-step processes.\n\nThe concept is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This tandem catalyst features a porous overcoating structure that coordinates the transport of reactive intermediates between catalytic sites, which is crucial for manipulating the process of tandem catalysis.\n\nThe key to successful tandem catalysis lies in the careful design of catalysts that can coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among different catalytic sites. This coordination allows for control over reaction sequences and selectivity, even when reactants, intermediates, and products coexist in the same environment.\n\nThe potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant. By enabling the instant removal of H2 through selective combustion, the catalytic dehydrogenation process can be pushed forward, breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions. This approach can lead to more efficient production of propylene from propane, addressing supply-demand gaps in the alkene market while potentially reducing energy consumption and improving overall process efficiency.\n\nBy integrating multiple reaction steps into a single process, tandem catalysis at the nanoscale offers a promising approach to improving the efficiency and sustainability of chemical engineering processes, particularly in industries where process optimization is crucial for economic and environmental reasons.", "Chinese": "纳米尺度上的串联催化通过在单一条件下允许顺序反应发生，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法旨在最小化与传统多步骤过程相关的能源消耗和经济成本。\n\nIn2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧exemplifies了这一概念。这种串联催化剂具有多孔的覆盖结构，协调反应中间体在催化位点之间的传输，这对于操纵串联催化过程至关重要。\n\n成功的串联催化的关键在于仔细设计能够协调不同催化位点之间反应中间体传输的催化剂。这种协调允许在反应物、中间体和产物共存的同一环境中控制反应序列和选择性。\n\n对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响是显著的。通过实现H2的即时去除和选择性燃烧，可以推动催化脱氢过程向前发展，打破非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。这种方法可以实现更高效的丙烷到丙烯的生产，解决烯烃市场的供需缺口，同时潜在地减少能源消耗并提高整体过程效率。\n\n通过将多个反应步骤整合到一个单一过程中，纳米尺度上的串联催化为提高化学工程过程的效率和可持续性提供了一种有前景的方法，特别是在那些过程优化对经济和环境原因至关重要的行业中。", "Doi": "10.1126/science.abh0424"},
