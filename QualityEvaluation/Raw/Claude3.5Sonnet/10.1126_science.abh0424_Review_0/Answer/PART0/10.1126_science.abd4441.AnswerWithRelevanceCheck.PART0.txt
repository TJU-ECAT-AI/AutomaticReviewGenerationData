          [1] "Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive."

[2] "We translated these macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for ODHP-like propane to propylene."

[3] "The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium."

[4] "The overcoated, tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."

[5] "Overall, this tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity (on Pt) and selectivity (on In2O3) for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions."

          The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by coupling different catalytic functions within a single nanostructured particle. This approach allows for precise control over reactive intermediates and enables the combination of multiple catalytic functions in a spatially organized manner.

The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this concept by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This nanoscale design overcomes limitations of traditional catalysts by allowing for rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving high per-pass yields that exceed the thermodynamic equilibrium of conventional propane dehydrogenation.

The implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are significant:

1. Improved yields: The tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) catalysts and exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion for non-oxidative PDH, demonstrating its potential to enhance process efficiency.

2. Better reaction control: The nanoscale design allows for tight coupling of reactions, balancing activity and selectivity by facilitating the direct transfer of reactive intermediates between different catalyst functions.

3. Increased stability: The overcoat structure stabilizes metal nanoparticles, potentially extending catalyst lifetime and reducing the need for frequent regeneration or replacement.

4. Process intensification: By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst particle, this approach can potentially simplify reactor designs and reduce the need for separate unit operations.

5. Biomimetic approach: The direct transfer of reactive intermediates between catalyst functions mimics biological systems, potentially opening new avenues for highly efficient and selective catalytic processes.

These advancements in nanoscale tandem catalysis have the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering, leading to more sustainable and economical industrial processes.

          纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过在单个纳米结构颗粒中耦合不同的催化功能，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战。这种方法允许对反应中间体进行精确控制，并能够以空间组织的方式结合多种催化功能。

In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧来例证这一概念。这种纳米尺度的设计克服了传统催化剂的局限性，实现了丙烷的快速和稳定的氧化脱氢，达到了超过常规丙烷脱氢热力学平衡的高单程产率。

对能源效率和过程优化的影响是显著的：

1. 提高产率：串联催化剂的性能优于最先进的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）催化剂，并超过了非氧化PDH的热力学平衡转化率，展示了其提高过程效率的潜力。

2. 更好的反应控制：纳米尺度设计允许反应紧密耦合，通过促进不同催化剂功能之间反应中间体的直接转移，平衡活性和选择性。

3. 增加稳定性：覆盖层结构稳定了金属纳米粒子，可能延长催化剂寿命并减少频繁再生或更换的需求。

4. 过程强化：通过在单个催化剂颗粒中结合多个反应步骤，这种方法可能简化反应器设计并减少对单独单元操作的需求。

5. 仿生方法：催化剂功能之间反应中间体的直接转移模仿了生物系统，可能为高效和选择性催化过程开辟新途径。

这些纳米尺度串联催化的进展有潜力显著提高化学工程中的能源效率和过程优化，从而导致更可持续和经济的工业过程。
