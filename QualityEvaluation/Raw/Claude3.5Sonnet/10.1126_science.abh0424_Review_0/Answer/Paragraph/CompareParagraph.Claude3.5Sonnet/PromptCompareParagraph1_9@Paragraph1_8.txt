Tandem catalysis at nanoscale
Chemical engineering processes are typically governed by multiple unit operations. To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations. A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries (1). On page 1257 of this issue, Yan et al. (2) present a tandem catalyst with porous overcoating structures, In2O3-Pt/Al2O3, for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.
To control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products, the design of tandem catalysts plays a crucial role in mediating the multiple reactions under the same condition (3). In principle, a tandem catalyst is composed of different types of catalytic sites, and a predetermined sequence of reactions occurs at each corresponding catalytic site. The key to manipulating the process of tandem catalysis is to coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites (4, 5). Random physical mixtures of catalysts cannot effectively mediate the reaction sequence. Therefore, the proximity (6, 7) and hierarchy (8) of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst must be carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates.
Tandem catalysis with porous overcoating structurePropane dehydrogenation makes propylene, which is an important feedstock for polymers. The porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes the selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The relative location of the alumina-supported platinum and the indium oxide ceramic is important for tandem catalysis.GRAPHIC: V. ALTOUNIAN/SCIENCE BASED ON C. PEI AND J. GONG
The research on the tandem coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation to selective H2 combustion bridges the fundamental philosophy to the industrial application. The on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane is a highly desired process to fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market (9, 10). The catalytic propane dehydrogenation process as an endothermic reaction is restricted by the thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as sintering and coking under high temperatures (11, 12). Instant removal of H2 through selective combustion could force the catalytic dehydrogenation to move forward and break the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction (13). However, to avoid the combustion of carbon species, the catalytic dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion must be properly regulated in sequence by the tandem catalyst.

The introduction of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes. This approach involves the design of nanocrystal catalysts with multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces capable of performing sequential reactions within a single catalyst system [10.1038/nchem.1018]. The concept of tandem catalysis promises to improve chemical processing by coupling multiple reactions, although precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains a challenge [10.1126/science.abd4441].

One of the key principles of tandem catalysis is the coordination of reactive intermediate transport among catalytic sites [10.1126/science.abh0424]. This is achieved through careful catalyst design, which plays a crucial role in mediating multiple reactions under the same conditions. The development of core/shell structures and porous overcoatings has been instrumental in enhancing reactant migration, improving selectivity, and creating confined reaction environments [10.1002/anie.200703335].

The application of tandem catalysis is exemplified by the novel In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion [10.1126/science.abd4441]. This catalyst demonstrates how nanoscale design can overcome limitations of traditional catalysts by allowing for rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving high per-pass yields that exceed the thermodynamic equilibrium of conventional propane dehydrogenation.

The potential for improving efficiency and reducing costs through tandem catalysis is significant. By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst, this approach can reduce the number of separate process units required, minimize intermediate product separation and purification steps, and improve overall process efficiency [10.1038/nchem.1018]. The instant removal of H2 through selective combustion drives the catalytic dehydrogenation forward, breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions [10.1126/science.abh0424].

Furthermore, the use of staged O2 introduction in tandem catalysis processes allows for the selective combustion of H2 products, substantially removing thermodynamic constraints. This approach requires only one reactor and one catalytic composition, significantly decreasing process complexity and cost [10.1016/j.jcat.2003.12.011].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in nanoscale tandem catalysis present exciting opportunities for future research and development in chemical engineering. The ability to design and control reactions at the nanoscale opens up possibilities for creating highly efficient and selective processes that mimic biological systems. Future research may focus on expanding the application of tandem catalysis to other industrially relevant reactions, such as CO2 conversion or biomass valorization.

Additionally, the development of in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamics of reactive intermediates in these complex systems could lead to even more precise control over reaction pathways. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in catalyst design could accelerate the discovery of novel tandem catalysts with optimized performance.

Furthermore, the principles of nanoscale tandem catalysis could be extended to develop "smart" catalytic systems that can adapt to changing reaction conditions or feedstock compositions, potentially revolutionizing process control in chemical manufacturing. As we continue to push the boundaries of nanoscale engineering, the future of tandem catalysis holds great promise for creating more sustainable, efficient, and economical chemical processes.
