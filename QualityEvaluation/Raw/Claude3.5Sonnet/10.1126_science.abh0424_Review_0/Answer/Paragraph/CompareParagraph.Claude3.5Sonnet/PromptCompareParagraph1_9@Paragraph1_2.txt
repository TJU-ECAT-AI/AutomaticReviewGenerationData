Tandem catalysis at nanoscale
Chemical engineering processes are typically governed by multiple unit operations. To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations. A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries (1). On page 1257 of this issue, Yan et al. (2) present a tandem catalyst with porous overcoating structures, In2O3-Pt/Al2O3, for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.
To control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products, the design of tandem catalysts plays a crucial role in mediating the multiple reactions under the same condition (3). In principle, a tandem catalyst is composed of different types of catalytic sites, and a predetermined sequence of reactions occurs at each corresponding catalytic site. The key to manipulating the process of tandem catalysis is to coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites (4, 5). Random physical mixtures of catalysts cannot effectively mediate the reaction sequence. Therefore, the proximity (6, 7) and hierarchy (8) of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst must be carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates.
Tandem catalysis with porous overcoating structurePropane dehydrogenation makes propylene, which is an important feedstock for polymers. The porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes the selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The relative location of the alumina-supported platinum and the indium oxide ceramic is important for tandem catalysis.GRAPHIC: V. ALTOUNIAN/SCIENCE BASED ON C. PEI AND J. GONG
The research on the tandem coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation to selective H2 combustion bridges the fundamental philosophy to the industrial application. The on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane is a highly desired process to fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market (9, 10). The catalytic propane dehydrogenation process as an endothermic reaction is restricted by the thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as sintering and coking under high temperatures (11, 12). Instant removal of H2 through selective combustion could force the catalytic dehydrogenation to move forward and break the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction (13). However, to avoid the combustion of carbon species, the catalytic dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion must be properly regulated in sequence by the tandem catalyst.

The introduction of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes. This approach involves the design and implementation of nanostructured catalysts that can perform sequential reactions within a single condition, offering improved efficiency and reduced costs in chemical processing [10.1126/science.abh0424].

The principles of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale are exemplified by various catalyst designs:

1. Nanocrystal catalysts with multiple metal-metal oxide interfaces: These catalysts enable the integration of different catalytic functions within a single nanostructured system. For example, a CeO2-Pt-SiO2 catalyst combines methanol decomposition and ethylene hydroformylation in one system [10.1038/nchem.1018].

2. Core/shell bifunctional catalysts: These catalysts feature a core and shell structure where each component independently catalyzes different reactions. This design enhances reactant migration, improves selectivity, and increases the collision probability between intermediates and active sites [10.1002/anie.200703335].

3. Overcoated tandem catalysts: Exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, these catalysts feature a porous overcoating structure that regulates the transport of reactive intermediates between different catalytic sites [10.1126/science.abd4441].

The application of tandem catalysis in chemical engineering processes offers several advantages:

1. Process intensification: By combining multiple reaction steps in a single catalyst particle, tandem catalysis can simplify reactor designs and reduce the need for separate unit operations [10.1126/science.abd4441].

2. Improved yields: Tandem catalysts can achieve higher per-pass yields that exceed thermodynamic equilibrium limitations of conventional processes [10.1126/science.abd4441].

3. Enhanced selectivity: The coordinated transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites allows for better control over reaction sequences and product selectivity [10.1126/science.abh0424].

4. Reduced energy consumption and costs: By integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations, tandem catalysis minimizes energy consumption and economic costs associated with traditional multi-step processes [10.1126/science.abh0424].

5. Overcoming thermodynamic constraints: Selective combustion of byproducts (e.g., H2) can drive reactions forward, breaking thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2003.12.011].

The novel nanoscale porous overcoating catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion (In2O3-Pt/Al2O3) demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis for improving efficiency and reducing costs. This catalyst achieves rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields, exceeding the thermodynamic equilibrium of conventional propane dehydrogenation [10.1126/science.abd4441].

The porous overcoating structure of this catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward [10.1126/science.abh0424]. This approach not only improves yields but also simplifies the process by using a single reactor and catalytic composition, significantly decreasing process complexity and cost [10.1016/j.jcat.2003.12.011].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of nanoscale tandem catalysts represents a paradigm shift in chemical engineering, offering a powerful approach to designing high-performance, multifunctional catalysts. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various chemical processes by enabling more efficient, integrated, and sustainable production methods.

Future research in this field may focus on:

1. Expanding the application of tandem catalysis to other important industrial processes, such as CO2 conversion or biomass valorization.
2. Developing more advanced nanostructured catalysts with precisely controlled interfaces and pore structures to further optimize reactant transport and product selectivity.
3. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration methods for these complex catalysts under industrial conditions.
4. Exploring the integration of tandem catalysis with other emerging technologies, such as membrane reactors or microfluidic systems, to create even more efficient and flexible chemical processes.
5. Applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to accelerate the discovery and optimization of new tandem catalyst compositions and structures.

These advancements could lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency, resource utilization, and environmental sustainability across the chemical industry, potentially reshaping traditional manufacturing processes and enabling new, more sustainable chemical pathways.
