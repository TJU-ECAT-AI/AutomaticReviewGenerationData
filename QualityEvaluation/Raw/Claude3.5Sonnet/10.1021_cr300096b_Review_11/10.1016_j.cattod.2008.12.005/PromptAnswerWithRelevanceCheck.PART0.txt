<quotes>

[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[2] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells from renewable biomass sources.

2. The process can be CO2 neutral if using biomass-derived oxygenates, as the CO2 byproduct is consumed by future biomass growth. 

3. It has environmental and safety advantages due to the low toxicity and low reactivity of the oxygenate reactants.

4. The oxygenate feedstocks are compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers improved sustainability through renewable feedstocks and potential carbon neutrality. It also provides practical implementation benefits by utilizing existing infrastructure. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of product yields to traditional methods.
