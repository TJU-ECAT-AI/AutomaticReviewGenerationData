[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[2] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells, which is a clean energy carrier.

2. When using oxygenates from renewable biomass, the process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct is recycled through biomass growth.

3. The oxygenate reactants have low toxicity and reactivity, making them safer and easier to handle.

4. It is compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers advantages in environmental impact by potentially being carbon neutral. It also provides practical implementation benefits through compatibility with current infrastructure and safer handling of reactants. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of product yields to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整在几个关键方面为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它为燃料电池生产氢气，这是一种清洁的能源载体。

2. 当使用可再生生物质中的含氧化合物时，该过程可以实现CO2中和，因为CO2副产品可以通过生物质生长被再循环利用。

3. 含氧化合物反应物具有低毒性和低反应性，使其更安全、更易于处理。

4. 它与现有的运输和储存基础设施兼容。

与传统方法相比，选择性含氧化合物重整在环境影响方面具有潜在的碳中和优势。它还通过与当前基础设施的兼容性和反应物的更安全处理提供了实际实施的好处。然而，文献没有提供与传统方法的产品产量直接比较。
