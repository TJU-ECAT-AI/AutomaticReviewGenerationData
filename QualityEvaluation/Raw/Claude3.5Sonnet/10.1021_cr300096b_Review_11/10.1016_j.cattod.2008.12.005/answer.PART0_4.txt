[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[2] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells from renewable biomass sources.

2. The process can be CO2 neutral if using biomass-derived oxygenates, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. 

3. It uses reactants with low toxicity and reactivity, making them safer and easier to handle.

4. The reactants are compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

Key advantages compared to traditional methods include:

- Potentially carbon-neutral hydrogen production
- Use of renewable feedstocks 
- Improved safety due to less toxic/reactive reactants
- Ability to use existing infrastructure, easing implementation
- Production of clean hydrogen fuel for fuel cells

While the document does not provide specific yield comparisons, the process appears advantageous in terms of environmental impact and practical implementation compared to traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen production methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学品生产做出了以下几个方面的贡献：

1. 它从可再生生物质资源中生产用于燃料电池的氢气。

2. 如果使用生物质衍生的含氧化合物，该过程可以实现CO2中性，因为CO2副产品可以被未来的生物质生长所消耗。

3. 它使用低毒性和低反应性的反应物，使其更安全、更易于处理。

4. 反应物与现有的运输和储存基础设施兼容。

与传统方法相比的主要优势包括：

- 潜在的碳中性氢气生产
- 使用可再生原料
- 由于反应物毒性/反应性较低，安全性得到改善
- 能够利用现有基础设施，便于实施
- 为燃料电池生产清洁氢燃料

虽然文档没有提供具体的产率比较，但与传统的基于化石燃料的制氢方法相比，该工艺在环境影响和实际实施方面似乎更具优势。
