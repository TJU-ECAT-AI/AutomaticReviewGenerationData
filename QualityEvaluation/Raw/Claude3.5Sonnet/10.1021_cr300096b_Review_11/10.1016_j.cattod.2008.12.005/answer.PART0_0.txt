[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[2] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells from renewable biomass sources.

2. The process can be CO2 neutral if using biomass-derived oxygenates, as the CO2 byproduct is consumed by future biomass growth. 

3. It has environmental and safety advantages due to the low toxicity and low reactivity of the oxygenate reactants.

4. The oxygenate feedstocks are compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers improved sustainability through renewable feedstocks and potential carbon neutrality. It also provides practical implementation benefits by utilizing existing infrastructure. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of product yields to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学品生产做出了几个关键贡献：

1. 它从可再生生物质源中生产用于燃料电池的氢气。

2. 如果使用生物质衍生的含氧化合物,该过程可以实现CO2中和,因为CO2副产品可以被未来的生物质生长所消耗。

3. 由于含氧化合物反应物的低毒性和低反应性,它具有环境和安全方面的优势。

4. 含氧化合物原料与现有的运输和储存基础设施兼容。

与传统方法相比,选择性含氧化合物重整通过可再生原料和潜在的碳中和性提供了改善的可持续性。它还通过利用现有基础设施提供了实际实施的好处。然而,文献没有提供与传统方法的产品产量的直接比较。
