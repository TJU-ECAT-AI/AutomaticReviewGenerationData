[1] "The production of hydrogen from oxygenated compounds has been a topic of increasing interest as a way to alleviate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption."

[2] "Ethanol has attracted particular interest because it can be produced from biomass, and the distillation of ethanol from fermentation of corn is already practiced industrially."

[3] "Along with ethanol, ethylene glycol has been studied as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production and as a model compound for larger polyols that can be derived from biomass such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by producing hydrogen from biomass-derived compounds like ethanol and ethylene glycol, helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Key advantages include:

1. Renewable feedstocks: Using biomass-derived oxygenates as starting materials provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

2. Environmental benefits: The process helps alleviate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption by producing clean hydrogen fuel.

3. Industrial feasibility: Ethanol production from corn fermentation is already practiced industrially, indicating practical implementation potential.

4. Versatility: The process can utilize various oxygenated compounds, including larger biomass-derived polyols like glycerol and glucose.

5. Model compound studies: Using ethylene glycol as a model helps understand reforming of more complex biomass-derived molecules.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on product yields or direct comparisons to traditional methods, so these aspects cannot be definitively addressed based on the given information.
