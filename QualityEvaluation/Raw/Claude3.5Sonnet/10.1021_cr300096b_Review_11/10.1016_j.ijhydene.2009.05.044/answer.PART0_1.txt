[1] "The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]."

[2] "Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel. In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral, though in practice, the balance between CO2 uptake and release depends on various factors, including infrastructure, the type of crops and processing methods [1921]."

[3] "Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in fuel cell vehicles, which operate at low temperatures and have low CO tolerance.

2. It uses bio-ethanol as a feedstock, which is a renewable fuel obtained from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants.

3. The process is potentially carbon neutral, considering the whole cycle from crop growing to hydrogen production, although the actual carbon balance depends on various factors.

4. Ethanol has a high hydrogen/carbon ratio, which is advantageous for hydrogen production.

5. Ethanol is easily transported and relatively non-toxic, making it practical for widespread use.

Key advantages of this method include:

1. Product yield: The process can produce more hydrogen per mole of ethanol reformed, as hydrogen can also be extracted from steam.

2. Environmental impact: The potential for carbon neutrality and the use of renewable feedstock contribute to reduced environmental impact compared to fossil fuel-based methods.

3. Practical implementation: Ethanol's ease of transport and relatively low toxicity make it suitable for practical, large-scale implementation.

These advantages make ethanol steam reforming a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen production methods, contributing to more sustainable energy and chemical production systems.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它为燃料电池车辆提供了一种有吸引力的车载制氢方法，这些车辆在低温下运行并且对CO耐受性低。

2. 它使用生物乙醇作为原料，这是一种通过发酵富含碳水化合物的植物获得的可再生燃料。

3. 考虑到从作物种植到氢气生产的整个周期，这个过程可能是碳中和的，尽管实际的碳平衡取决于各种因素。

4. 乙醇具有较高的氢/碳比率，这对氢气生产有利。

5. 乙醇易于运输且相对无毒，使其适合广泛使用。

这种方法的主要优势包括：

1. 产品产量：该过程可以每摩尔乙醇重整产生更多的氢气，因为氢气也可以从蒸汽中提取。

2. 环境影响：碳中和的潜力和可再生原料的使用有助于减少环境影响，相比于基于化石燃料的方法。

3. 实际实施：乙醇易于运输和相对低毒性使其适合实际的大规模实施。

这些优势使乙醇蒸汽重整成为传统基于化石燃料的制氢方法的一个有前途的替代方案，为更可持续的能源和化学品生产系统做出贡献。
