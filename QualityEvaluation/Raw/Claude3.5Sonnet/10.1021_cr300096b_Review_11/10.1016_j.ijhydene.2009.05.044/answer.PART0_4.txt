[1] "Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic."

[2] "The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]."

[3] "The advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It uses ethanol, which has a high hydrogen/carbon ratio and can be derived from renewable biomass sources, making it more sustainable than fossil fuels.

2. The process generates hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier that can be used in fuel cells for various applications, including vehicles.

3. It allows for on-board hydrogen generation in fuel cell vehicles, addressing storage and transportation issues associated with hydrogen.

Key advantages include:

1. Higher product yield: More hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol compared to other methods, as hydrogen is extracted from both ethanol and steam.

2. Environmental impact: The process can be potentially carbon-neutral when using bio-ethanol, reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based methods.

3. Practical implementation: Ethanol is easily transported and relatively non-toxic, making it safer and more convenient to handle than other hydrogen sources.

4. Compatibility with existing infrastructure: The liquid nature of ethanol allows for easier integration with current fuel distribution systems.

5. Low-temperature operation: The process is suitable for use with proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, which operate at lower temperatures than other fuel cell types.

While the process shows promise, challenges such as catalyst efficiency and durability still need to be addressed for widespread commercial implementation.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它使用乙醇，乙醇具有较高的氢/碳比率，可以从可再生生物质资源中获得，比化石燃料更可持续。

2. 该过程生成氢气，氢气是一种清洁能源载体，可用于各种应用的燃料电池中，包括车辆。

3. 它允许在燃料电池车辆上进行车载制氢，解决了与氢气相关的储存和运输问题。

主要优势包括：

1. 更高的产品产率：与其他方法相比，每摩尔乙醇可以产生更多的氢气，因为氢气可以从乙醇和蒸汽中提取。

2. 环境影响：使用生物乙醇时，这个过程可能是碳中和的，与基于化石燃料的方法相比，可以减少温室气体排放。

3. 实际实施：乙醇易于运输且相对无毒，使其比其他氢源更安全、更方便处理。

4. 与现有基础设施兼容：乙醇的液态特性允许更容易地与当前的燃料分配系统集成。

5. 低温操作：该过程适用于质子交换膜燃料电池，后者比其他类型的燃料电池在更低的温度下运行。

虽然这个过程显示出前景，但要实现广泛的商业应用，仍需解决催化剂效率和耐久性等挑战。
