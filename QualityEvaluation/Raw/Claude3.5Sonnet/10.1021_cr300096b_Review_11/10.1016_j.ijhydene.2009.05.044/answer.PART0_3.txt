[3] "Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel. In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral, though in practice, the balance between CO2 uptake and release depends on various factors, including infrastructure, the type of crops and processing methods [1921]."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides a renewable pathway for hydrogen production, as bio-ethanol can be obtained from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants.

2. The process is potentially carbon neutral when considering the full lifecycle from crop growth to hydrogen production, though the actual carbon balance depends on various factors.

3. Ethanol has a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, allowing for efficient hydrogen production.

4. It offers practical advantages in terms of easy transportation and low toxicity of the feedstock.

5. It presents an alternative to conventional fossil fuel-based hydrogen production methods like natural gas reforming.

The key advantages of ethanol steam reforming include using a renewable feedstock, potential carbon neutrality, efficient hydrogen yield from the high H/C ratio of ethanol, and practical benefits in handling the fuel. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of product yields or environmental impacts to traditional methods, so those specific advantages cannot be definitively stated based on the given information.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它为氢气生产提供了一条可再生途径，因为生物乙醇可以通过碳水化合物丰富的植物发酵获得。

2. 当考虑从作物生长到氢气生产的全生命周期时，这个过程可能是碳中性的，尽管实际的碳平衡取决于各种因素。

3. 乙醇具有较高的氢碳比，允许高效的氢气生产。

4. 它在原料的易于运输和低毒性方面提供实际优势。

5. 它为传统的基于化石燃料的氢气生产方法（如天然气重整）提供了一种替代方案。

乙醇蒸汽重整的主要优势包括使用可再生原料、潜在的碳中性、由于乙醇高H/C比而带来的高效氢气产率，以及在燃料处理方面的实际优势。然而，文献并未提供与传统方法在产品产率或环境影响方面的直接比较，因此基于给定信息无法明确陈述这些具体优势。
