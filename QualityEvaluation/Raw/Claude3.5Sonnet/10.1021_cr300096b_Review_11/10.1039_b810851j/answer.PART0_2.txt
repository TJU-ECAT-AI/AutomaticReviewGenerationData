[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."

[2] "Production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."

[3] "Here, we show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."

[4] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C"

[5] "In summary, we present a new and effective method for production of hydrogenvia the electrochemical catalytic reforming of bio-oil over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst, giving good reforming performance including high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at low temperature."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of bio-oil, contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen, which is both an important chemical feedstock and a clean fuel that can help reduce environmental emissions.

2. It utilizes lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable and environmentally friendly feedstock, promoting the use of sustainable resources.

3. The process achieves high product yields, with hydrogen yields and carbon conversion both exceeding 90%, even at relatively low temperatures (below 500°C).

4. It operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, which typically require higher temperatures for effective reforming.

5. The use of electrochemical catalytic reforming allows for better control and enhancement of the reforming process through the application of electric current.

6. It provides a more efficient method for hydrogen production from bio-oil, addressing challenges faced by traditional steam reforming methods such as high temperature requirements and catalyst deactivation.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming via ECR a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, offering improved efficiency, higher yields, and potentially lower environmental impact compared to conventional reforming methods.
