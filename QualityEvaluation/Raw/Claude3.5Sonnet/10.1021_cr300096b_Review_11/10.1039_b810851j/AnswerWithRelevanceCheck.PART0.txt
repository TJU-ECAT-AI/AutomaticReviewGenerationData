          [1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."

[2] "Production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."

[3] "Here, we show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."

[4] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C"

[5] "In summary, we present a new and effective method for production of hydrogenvia the electrochemical catalytic reforming of bio-oil over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst, giving good reforming performance including high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at low temperature."

[6] "The energy efficiency in ECR was higher than that in the CSR process"

          Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of bio-oil, contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Product yield: The process achieves high hydrogen yields and carbon conversion rates, both exceeding 90% even at relatively low temperatures (500°C or below).

2. Environmental impact: It produces hydrogen, a clean fuel that can help reduce environmental emissions. The use of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock promotes the utilization of renewable resources, further enhancing environmental benefits.

3. Practical implementation: 
   - It operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing energy consumption and associated costs.
   - The use of a conventional Ni-based catalyst (18%NiO/Al2O3) makes practical implementation more feasible.

4. Energy efficiency: The ECR process demonstrates higher energy efficiency compared to conventional steam reforming (CSR), suggesting better utilization of input energy.

5. Process control: The electrochemical approach allows for better control of the reforming process through the application of electric current, enabling optimization of yields and conversion rates.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming via ECR a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, offering improvements in yield, energy efficiency, and environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

          选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是生物油的电化学催化重整（ECR），通过以下几种方式显著地促进了可持续能源和化学品生产：

1. 产品产率：该过程实现了高氢气产率和高碳转化率，即使在相对较低的温度下（500°C或以下），两者都超过90%。

2. 环境影响：
   - 它生产氢气，这是一种可以帮助减少环境排放的清洁燃料。
   - 使用木质纤维素生物质作为原料促进了可再生资源的利用，进一步增强了环境效益。

3. 实际实施：
   - 与传统方法相比，它在较低的温度下运行，可能减少能源消耗和相关成本。
   - 使用常规的镍基催化剂（18%NiO/Al2O3）使实际实施更加可行。

4. 能源效率：与常规蒸汽重整（CSR）相比，ECR过程表现出更高的能源效率，表明对输入能源的利用更好。

5. 过程控制：电化学方法允许通过施加电流来更好地控制重整过程，从而优化产率和转化率。

这些优势使得通过ECR进行选择性含氧化合物重整成为一种有前景的可持续氢气生产方法，与传统方法相比，在产率、能源效率和环境影响方面都有所改进。
