[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."

[2] "Here, we show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."

[3] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C"

[4] "In summary, we present a new and effective method for production of hydrogenvia the electrochemical catalytic reforming of bio-oil over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst, giving good reforming performance including high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at low temperature."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of bio-oil, contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. High product yield: The process achieves high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at relatively low temperatures. This high efficiency in hydrogen production makes it a promising method for sustainable energy generation.

2. Environmental impact: Hydrogen produced through this method is considered a clean fuel that can play an important role in reducing environmental emissions. Additionally, using bio-oil as a feedstock leverages renewable biomass sources, further enhancing the environmental benefits.

3. Practical implementation: The ECR process operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, which can lead to reduced energy requirements and potentially lower operational costs. The use of a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst also suggests that the process could be implemented using existing industrial infrastructure.

4. Energy efficiency: The ECR process demonstrates higher energy efficiency compared to common steam reforming (CSR), which is the traditional method for hydrogen production.

5. Versatility: The process can effectively reform bio-oil, which represents a potential source of renewable chemicals beyond just hydrogen production.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming via ECR a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, offering improvements in yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是生物油的电化学催化重整（ECR），通过以下几种方式显著地为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 高产品产率：该过程即使在相对较低的温度下也能实现高氢气产率（>90%）和高碳转化率（>90%）。这种高效的氢气生产使其成为一种有前景的可持续能源生产方法。

2. 环境影响：通过这种方法生产的氢气被认为是一种清洁燃料，可以在减少环境排放方面发挥重要作用。此外，使用生物油作为原料利用了可再生的生物质资源，进一步增强了环境效益。

3. 实际实施：与传统方法相比，ECR过程在较低的温度下运行，这可能导致能源需求减少和潜在的运营成本降低。使用常规的镍基重整催化剂也表明，该过程可以利用现有的工业基础设施来实施。

4. 能源效率：与传统的氢气生产方法——常规蒸汽重整（CSR）相比，ECR过程表现出更高的能源效率。

5. 多功能性：该过程可以有效地重整生物油，而生物油除了产氢外，还代表了一种潜在的可再生化学品来源。

这些优势使得通过ECR进行选择性含氧化合物重整成为一种有前景的可持续氢气生产方法，在产率、环境影响和实际实施方面相比传统方法都有所改进。
