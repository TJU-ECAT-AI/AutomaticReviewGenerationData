[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."

[2] "Production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."

[3] "We show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."

[4] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C"

[5] "We present a new and effective method for production of hydrogenvia the electrochemical catalytic reforming of bio-oil over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst, giving good reforming performance including high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at low temperature."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables the production of hydrogen, a clean fuel and important chemical feedstock, from renewable biomass sources like bio-oil. This reduces reliance on fossil fuels and decreases environmental emissions.

2. The process achieves very high product yields, with hydrogen yields and carbon conversion both exceeding 90% in optimal conditions. This high efficiency makes it an attractive method for hydrogen production.

3. It operates at relatively low temperatures (under 500°C) compared to traditional reforming methods, which typically require much higher temperatures. This lower temperature requirement improves energy efficiency.

4. The electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) approach allows for greater control over the reaction conditions by adjusting the electric current, enabling optimization of the process.

5. It utilizes bio-oil, a renewable resource derived from biomass, as the feedstock. This makes the process more environmentally friendly compared to reforming of fossil fuels.

6. The method uses conventional nickel-based catalysts, which are relatively inexpensive and widely available, making practical implementation more feasible.

Overall, this selective oxygenate reforming process offers a more sustainable, efficient, and potentially more economical approach to hydrogen production compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods, with significant environmental benefits.
