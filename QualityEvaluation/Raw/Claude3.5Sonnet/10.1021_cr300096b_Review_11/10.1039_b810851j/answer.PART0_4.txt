Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of bio-oil, contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen, which is both an important chemical feedstock and a potential clean fuel that can help reduce environmental emissions.

2. It utilizes lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable and environmentally friendly feedstock, opening new prospects for sustainable resource utilization.

3. The process achieves high product yields, with hydrogen yields and carbon conversion both exceeding 90%, even at relatively low temperatures (500°C or lower).

4. It operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, which typically require temperatures above 600°C. This lower temperature operation potentially reduces energy consumption and associated costs.

5. The method shows significantly improved performance over conventional steam reforming (CSR), with much higher carbon conversion and hydrogen yield at the same temperatures.

6. The ECR process demonstrates higher energy efficiency compared to CSR, suggesting better utilization of input energy.

7. The use of a conventional Ni-based catalyst makes practical implementation more feasible, as it doesn't rely on rare or expensive materials.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming via ECR a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, offering improvements in yield, energy efficiency, and environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是生物油的电化学催化重整（ECR），以多种方式显著地促进了可持续能源和化学品生产：

1. 它生产氢气，这既是重要的化学原料，也是一种潜在的清洁燃料，可以帮助减少环境排放。

2. 它利用木质纤维素生物质这种可再生和环保的原料，为可持续资源利用开辟了新的前景。

3. 该过程实现了高产品产率，即使在相对较低的温度下（500°C或更低），氢气产率和碳转化率都超过90%。

4. 与传统方法相比，它在较低的温度下运行，传统方法通常需要600°C以上的温度。这种较低温度的操作可能会减少能源消耗和相关成本。

5. 与传统的蒸汽重整（CSR）相比，该方法显示出显著改进的性能，在相同温度下具有更高的碳转化率和氢气产率。

6. ECR过程显示出比CSR更高的能源效率，表明对输入能源的利用更好。

7. 使用常规的镍基催化剂使实际实施更加可行，因为它不依赖于稀有或昂贵的材料。

这些优势使得通过ECR进行的选择性含氧化合物重整成为一种有前景的可持续氢气生产方法，与传统方法相比，在产率、能源效率和环境影响方面都有所改进。
