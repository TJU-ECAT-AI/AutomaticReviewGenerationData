[1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol, further studies suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."

[3] "The liquid phase reforming reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 200C and 20 bar pressure."

[4] "The rate of H2 formation increased from 1.5 μmol/ming Cat for Ni/Alnf to nearly 9 μmol/ming Cat for NiPt/Alnf."

[5] "The gas phase selectivity of H2 production was found to be highest for Pt/Alnf at 79.4% followed by NiPt/Alnf (75.6%) and NiPd/Alnf (66.7%)."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from biomass, which is a renewable resource. This provides an environmentally-friendly alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process can directly convert sugars and sugar alcohols derived from biomass into hydrogen, offering a more efficient route compared to traditional biomass conversion methods. 

3. It operates under relatively mild conditions (e.g. 200°C, 20 bar) compared to other thermochemical processes, potentially reducing energy requirements.

4. Using bimetallic catalysts like NiPt significantly improves hydrogen production rates and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. This increases product yield and efficiency.

5. The aqueous-phase nature of the process allows for using wet biomass directly, avoiding energy-intensive drying steps required in some other biomass conversion routes.

6. High selectivity toward hydrogen (up to ~80%) minimizes unwanted byproducts, improving atom economy and reducing waste.

The main advantages are the use of renewable feedstocks, improved efficiency and selectivity, milder operating conditions, and compatibility with wet biomass. These factors contribute to reduced environmental impact and improved practical implementation compared to traditional hydrogen production methods. However, more research is still needed to further optimize catalysts and scale up the technology for commercial use.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它能够从生物质中生产氢气，这是一种可再生资源。这为基于化石燃料的氢气生产提供了一种环境友好的替代方案。

2. 该过程可以直接将从生物质中提取的糖和糖醇转化为氢气，与传统的生物质转化方法相比，提供了一条更高效的路径。

3. 与其他热化学过程相比，它在相对温和的条件下运行（例如200°C，20巴），可能会降低能源需求。

4. 使用NiPt等双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂相比，显著提高了氢气产率和选择性。这提高了产品产量和效率。

5. 该过程的液相特性允许直接使用湿生物质，避免了某些其他生物质转化路线所需的能源密集型干燥步骤。

6. 对氢气的高选择性（高达约80%）最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品，提高了原子经济性并减少了废物。

主要优势在于使用可再生原料、提高效率和选择性、更温和的操作条件以及与湿生物质的兼容性。这些因素有助于减少环境影响，并与传统的氢气生产方法相比，改善了实际实施。然而，仍需要进行更多研究以进一步优化催化剂并将技术扩大到商业规模使用。
