[1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "Currently photovoltaic cells, however, are not a viable energy source for water electrolysis. The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."

[3] "From our previous studies and the literature we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst. It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability"

[4] "As a result, we demonstrate that the rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from biomass, which is a renewable and abundant feedstock. This provides an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. It allows for efficient conversion of biomass to hydrogen through liquid phase reforming, overcoming limitations of other thermochemical processes like gasification that are unsuitable for wet biomass.

3. The use of bimetallic catalysts significantly enhances catalyst activity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. This improves product yields and catalyst lifetimes.

4. It achieves much higher rates of hydrogen formation compared to traditional catalysts - up to 3-5 times higher in the case of sorbitol reforming with bimetallic vs monometallic catalysts.

5. The process has high selectivity for hydrogen production, with some catalysts achieving over 75% selectivity.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming offers an efficient and sustainable route for converting abundant biomass resources into valuable hydrogen fuel, with superior catalytic performance compared to conventional approaches. This makes it a promising technology for renewable energy and chemical production.
