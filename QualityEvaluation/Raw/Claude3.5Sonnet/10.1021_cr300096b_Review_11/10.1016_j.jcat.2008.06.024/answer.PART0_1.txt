[1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."

[3] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol, further studies suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."

[4] "As a result, we demonstrate that the rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from biomass, which is a renewable and abundant feedstock. This provides a more environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process can utilize biomass with high water content, which is unsuitable for other thermochemical conversion methods like gasification. This expands the range of usable biomass feedstocks.

3. It allows for direct hydrogen production from aqueous solutions of sugars and sugar alcohols derived from biomass. This provides a relatively simple pathway from biomass to hydrogen fuel.

4. The use of bimetallic catalysts significantly improves hydrogen production rates compared to monometallic catalysts, enhancing overall process efficiency.

5. As a liquid phase process, it likely requires less energy input compared to high-temperature gasification or steam reforming methods.

6. The production of hydrogen, a clean energy carrier, from biomass contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions when used in fuel cells or other applications.

While the document does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, the advantages in terms of renewable feedstocks, milder process conditions, and improved catalytic performance suggest selective oxygenate reforming offers benefits in sustainability, practical implementation, and potentially product yields compared to conventional hydrogen production approaches.

选择性含氧化合物重整技术通过以下几个关键方面对可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它能够从生物质中生产氢气，而生物质是一种可再生且丰富的原料。这为基于化石燃料的氢气生产提供了一种更环保的替代方案。

2. 该工艺可以利用含水量高的生物质，而这种生物质不适用于其他热化学转化方法，如气化。这扩大了可用生物质原料的范围。

3. 它允许直接从生物质衍生的糖和糖醇的水溶液中生产氢气。这提供了一种从生物质到氢燃料的相对简单的途径。

4. 双金属催化剂的使用显著提高了氢气产生率，相比单金属催化剂效率更高，提升了整体工艺效率。

5. 作为液相过程，与高温气化或蒸汽重整方法相比，它可能需要较少的能量输入。

6. 从生物质生产氢气这种清洁能源载体，在燃料电池或其他应用中使用时有助于减少温室气体排放。

虽然文档没有提供与传统方法的直接比较，但在可再生原料、较温和的工艺条件和改进的催化性能方面的优势表明，选择性含氧化合物重整技术在可持续性、实际实施和潜在的产品产率方面比传统氢气生产方法提供了更多优势。
