[1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol, further studies suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."

[3] "The liquid phase reforming reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 200C and 20 bar pressure."

[4] "The rate of H2 formation increased from 1.5 μmol/ming Cat for Ni/Alnf to nearly 9 μmol/ming Cat for NiPt/Alnf."

[5] "The gas phase selectivity of H2 production was found to be highest for Pt/Alnf at 79.4% followed by NiPt/Alnf (75.6%) and NiPd/Alnf (66.7%)."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the production of hydrogen from biomass-derived compounds like sugars and sugar alcohols. Its key advantages include:

1. Product yield: It allows direct production of hydrogen from aqueous solutions of biomass-derived compounds, with bimetallic catalysts showing significantly higher hydrogen formation rates compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Environmental impact: Hydrogen produced through this process is considered one of the best alternative fuels due to its environmental benefits. It enables the use of renewable biomass resources instead of fossil fuels.

3. Practical implementation: The process can be carried out in liquid phase at relatively moderate temperatures and pressures (e.g. 200°C and 20 bar), making it more practical than high-temperature gasification or steam reforming processes. 

4. Selectivity: Bimetallic catalysts like NiPt and NiPd show high selectivity for hydrogen production, with gas phase selectivities over 65-75%.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming allows for more efficient utilization of wet biomass feedstocks and milder operating conditions, potentially leading to lower costs and easier implementation at various scales.

选择性含氧化合物重整通过从生物质衍生化合物（如糖和糖醇）中生产氢气，为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献。其主要优势包括：

1. 产品产率：它允许直接从生物质衍生化合物的水溶液中生产氢气，双金属催化剂相比单金属催化剂显示出明显更高的氢气形成速率。

2. 环境影响：通过这一过程生产的氢气被认为是最好的替代燃料之一，因为其环境效益。它使得可以使用可再生生物质资源而不是化石燃料。

3. 实际应用：该过程可以在相对温和的温度和压力下（如200°C和20巴）在液相中进行，使其比高温气化或蒸汽重整过程更加实用。

4. 选择性：NiPt和NiPd等双金属催化剂在氢气生产方面表现出高选择性，气相选择性超过65-75%。

与传统方法相比，选择性含氧化合物重整允许更有效地利用湿生物质原料，并且操作条件更温和，可能导致更低的成本和更容易在各种规模上实施。
