Effect of Pt and Pd promoter on Ni supported catalystsA TPR/TPO/TPD and microcalorimetry study
Abstract
The promoting effect of Pt and Pd in bimetallic NiPt and NiPd catalysts supported on alumina nano-fibre (Alnf) were tested for the liquid phase reforming of sorbitol to produce hydrogen. The mono- and bimetallic catalysts were studied by different characterisation techniques such as: temperature programmed reduction, oxidation, CO desorption, microcalorimetry, TEM and STEM/EDX. Although bimetallic catalysts have long been the subject of great interest because of their exceptional properties compared to the monometallic catalysts, the reason behind their improved activity is still a question of debate. Experimental evidence showed that the addition of both Pt and Pdeven in a very small fractionto the Ni catalyst increases its reducibility significantly. The TEM and STEM/EDX analysis confirmed that Pt and Ni are present as alloys in nano-sized rod shaped particles. At the same time it was found that the CO differential heat of adsorption is appreciably lowered in the bimetallic catalysts. This is substantial because reducing the CO binding strength can avoid the poisoning of the active metal sites. As a result, we demonstrate that the rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts.
1. Introduction
Due to rising fuel prices, efforts to improve catalysts for production of alternative fuels have increased in the last few years. Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells. However, hydrogen as a fuel will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only when the source of hydrogen is environmentally benign such as water or biomass. But since water electrolysis is an energy-intensive process it requires a cheap and renewal source of electricity for it to be efficient. Currently photovoltaic cells, however, are not a viable energy source for water electrolysis. The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible. After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol

[3]
, further studies
[4]
suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols.
From our previous studies
[5]
and the literature
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst. It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability
[9]
. The NiPt system in particular has been extensively studied because of its synergetic catalytic effect
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
. Reducibility and kinetic studies for various reactions on NiPt system supported on silica and alumina have also been reported

conducted CO chemisorption on mono- and bimetallic catalysts of Ni and Pt supported on γ-Al2O3 to study preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in hydrogen rich stream. Their study showed that under the same pre-treatment condition NiPt bimetallic catalysts had higher number of active sites. Moreover, the activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst per unit site of the catalyst was also found to be higher for the PROX reaction. However, the reason for this was not clear beyond the enhanced reducibility of bimetallic catalysts. One of the reasons could be that the catalyst was more resistant to oxidation under the reaction condition
[25]
. It may also be possible that CO adsorption is altered on bimetallic catalysts due to surface heterogeneity creating favourable reaction conditions. Several probe molecules and surface reactions have been conducted to study adsorption behaviour of bimetallic catalysts
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
. However, the effect of noble metals on the CO chemisorption properties of the bimetallic supported catalysts has been less understood. In this study we aim to correlate the effect of the noble metal promoters such as Pt and Pd on Ni, using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), oxidation (TPO) and CO desorption (TPD). Heat-flow microcalorimetry was employed to determine the strength of CO interaction on these catalysts. CO interaction with the catalyst is of high importance because a strong interaction can lead to catalyst poisoning
[21]
. It has been suggested that weaker interaction can decrease the heat of adsorption of CO and hydrogen chemisorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for the reforming reaction
[22]
. Reducing the amount of precious noble metal content also reduces the cost of the catalysts.
2. Experiments and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts used in this study were prepared using the wet impregnation technique. Hydrogen hexacholoroplatinate(IV) (8% solution in water, Aldrich) was used as a precursor for the platinum catalyst, while nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)26H2O, Univar) as a source of nickel and palladium(II) nitrate solution (10 wt% Pd(NO3)2 solution in 10 wt% nitric acid, Aldrich) for palladium catalysts. The impregnated Pt, Pd and Ni catalysts were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of solution of precursor to the support with constant stirring at 60C for 6 h. The catalysts were then dried overnight at 90C followed by calcination at 500C. Pt, Pd and Ni were supported on high surface area alumina nano-fibre (Alnf). For alumina nano-fibre preparation, glycerol was mixed with an appropriate amount of acid solution of AlCl36H2O and then a basic solution of NaAlO2 was added drop-wise. The final pH of the solution was maintained at 6. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was then washed several times to remove Na+ and Cl ions. The washed cake was then mixed with PEO surfactant Tergitol 15TS-7. After prolonged stirring and ageing at 100C the resultant supernatant liquid was thrown and the white cake was dried in air and calcined at 500C for 20 h.
2.2. Characterisation of catalyst
Alumina nano-fibre surface area was measured using the BET technique employing nitrogen physisorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen in a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument. The percentage of metal loading was measured by Inductively-Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICPAES).
2.2.1. TPR/TPO/TPD
Temperature programmed characterisation, such as reduction (TPR), oxidation (TPO) and desorption (TPD), was carried out using a setup illustrated in
Fig. 1
. Probe gases, attached to Brooks 5850E mass flow controllers of suitable flow range, were passed through a quartz glass reactor in a tube furnace. The gases were continuously sampled downstream through a 25 μm capillary connected to a Varian leak valve. The leak valve introduced gases in a vacuum chamber attached to SRS RGA300 quadrupole mass spectrometer. Varian MiniTask, with a maximum pumping speed of 40 L/s (for nitrogen) and base pressure of
, was used to evacuate the vacuum chamber. The partial pressures of the gases evolved from the sample were recorded with respect to time, which was then converted to temperature according to the ramp rate of the furnace. Partial pressures were then converted to μmol/min using the calibration from standard gas mixtures at a measured flow rate in ml/min. TPR was conducted with 5% H2/N2 mixed gas at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. TPO was conducted with 2% O2/He mixed gas at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. In both cases the temperature was raised from room temperature to 700C at the rate of 10C/min. For COTPD catalysts were pre-reduced in situ at 500C for Ni catalysts and 300C for Pt and Pd catalysts using ultrapure H2 at a flow rate of 80 ml/min for 5 h. The catalysts were then purged with He at 100 ml/min flow rate, at the reduction temperature for 1 h. The catalysts were cooled to room temperature and dosed with CO at 100 ml/min for 15 min. The whole system, including the catalyst, was then flushed with He at 100 ml/min for at least 1 h to remove any trace of CO. For TPD measurements the temperature was raised from room temperature to 700C at the rate of 10C/min.

2.2.2. Microcalorimetry
Microcalorimetry measurements were performed at 30C using a Setaram BT2.15 heat-flux calorimeter. The calorimeter was connected to a high vacuum gas-handling and volumetric system employing Baratron capacitance manometers for precision pressure measurement of
. The maximum apparent leak rate of the volumetric system, including the calorimetric cells, was in the range of 106 Torr/min. The ultimate dynamic vacuum of the system was 107 Torr. The calorimetric procedures used in this study have been described in detail elsewhere
[23]
. Briefly, each catalyst sample was reduced ex situ in ultrapure flowing H2, followed by purging in ultrahigh purity He and sealing the sample in a Pyrex capsule at ca. 350 Torr. The Pyrex capsule containing the sample was then broken in a special set of calorimetric cells
[24]
after the sample had attained thermal equilibrium with the calorimeter. After the capsule had been broken the He pressure in the cell was reduced to ca. 1 Torr. The microcalorimetry data were collected by sequentially introducing small doses of CO (15 μmol) onto the catalyst (0.20.3 g) until it became saturated. The resulting heat response for each dose was recorded as a function of time and integrated to determine the energy released (mJ). The amount of gas adsorbed (μmol) was determined volumetrically from the dose and equilibrium pressures and the system volumes and temperatures. The differential heat (kJ/mol), defined as the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of gas adsorbed, was then calculated as a function of the adsorbate coverage.
The CO-chemisorption experiments were conducted in the same vacuum gas-handling and volumetric system described above. The catalysts were reduced in situ in a Pyrex cell in flowing ultrahigh purity H2 followed by purging with ultrahigh purity He and evacuation for 60 min at reduction temperature. Adsorption isotherm data was collected by sequentially introducing small doses of CO onto the catalyst until it became saturated. The cell was then evacuated for at least 1 h before second isotherm data was collected by introducing similar doses.
2.2.3. TEM and STEM/EDS Study
The calcined catalysts were suspended on a 3 mm holey carbon support film on a copper grid and were analysed in a Philips Tecnai 20 and a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The analytical resolution of Tecnai 20 is a result of the high brightness field emission gun (FEG), which acts as the electron source in this microscope. EDAX thin-window energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used on the Techai 20 in scanning tunnelling electron microscope (STEM) mode.
2.3. Reaction kinetic study
The liquid phase reforming reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor (
Fig. 2
) at 200C and 20 bar pressure. Prior to starting the reforming reaction the catalysts were reduced in situ with high purity H2 for at least 5 h at an appropriate reduction temperature followed by 15 min purging with Ar. The temperature of the reactor and furnace were controlled by individual PID controllers, which were placed in series such that the temperature over-limit inside the reactor would limit the current supply to the furnace controller. Both furnace and reactor temperatures were measured by OneTemp K-type thermocouples. A Swagelok back pressure regulator attached to a Swagelok pressure gauge was used to pressurise the system and a Brooks 5850E mass flow controller was employed for precise flow of Ar. 10% (w/w) concentration of sorbitol in water was fed in to the fixed bed reactor at a weight hourly space velocity of 6.2 h1 (defined as feed mass flow rate in gmh1/mass of catalyst bed in gm).

Gas samples were analysed at 1 h intervals in a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatographer employing 80/100 mesh carbosphere 1/8" I.D., 6 ft long packed column. Thermal conductivity and flame ionisation detectors were used to analyse H2 and carbon compounds respectively. Sorbitol solutions were analysed in an HPLC using an external source to calculate the concentration of spent liquor. Shimadzu GCMS-QP5050A was used to qualitatively analyse the spent liquor for other organic compounds. The solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique was used to extract the organic compounds by heating the spent liquor to 95C in a glass vial with Teflon septa cap. 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Supleco SPME fibre was used to adsorb the vapours of the organic compounds.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. CO-chemisorption
Table 1
shows the results of metal loading, support BET surface area and CO-chemisorption analysis. For CO-chemisorption analysis two isotherms were generated, first corresponding to the combined strong and weak adsorption and the second corresponding to only weak adsorption. Both the isotherms were Langmuir Type 1, characteristic of monolayer chemisorption, with the former corresponding mostly to fast strong adsorption on metal sites and the latter corresponding to slow weak adsorption on the metal oxide support. The CO-uptake (μmol/gm) in
Table 1
is the total CO uptake i.e. weak and strong adsorption combined. However, the metal surface area and dispersion is calculated on the basis of monolayer adsorption of CO on the metal sites only. Therefore, only strong CO adsorption is considered for these calculations. The metal surface area and dispersion was calculated according to the following equations

The BET surface area is given for the calcined alumina nano-fibre support. It is expected that after impregnation the surface area of the catalysts will reduce slightly.
The chemisorption results suggest that the addition of both Pt and Pd to Ni catalyst increases the number of active metal sites (measured as the total CO-uptake). We also observed an increase in specific metal surface area and dispersion for NiPt bimetallic catalysts. This can be simply explained by the high formula weight and therefore high number of atoms per mol of Pt and Pd. In addition, the NiO particles are catalysed by Pt and Pd during the reduction process and therefore the number of Ni particles available for adsorption is greatly enhanced
[10]
.
3.2. Temperature programmed reduction results
The results of CO-chemisorption can be supported by the TPR result shown in
Fig. 3
a. Ni/Alnf was tested for reducibility up to 820C and it exhibited two peaks at 700 and 800C. These high temperature peaks can be associated with the reduction peak of NiO which is in strong interaction with alumina support. It is known from literature
[26]
that calcination has a strong impact on the reducibility of Ni catalysts. In this study all the catalysts were calcined at 500C and the reduction peaks of Ni/Alnf is in close agreement with the results published by Rynkoswski et al.
[26]
at similar calcination temperature. The addition of Pt and Pd decreases the reduction peak of NiPt/Alnf and NiPd/Alnf to 450 and 550C respectively. Two shoulder peaks can be found either side of the maximum peak for both the bimetallic catalysts. The shoulder peak at higher temperature corresponds to the second Ni reduction peak observed for monometallic Ni/Alnf but, in this case, it is closer to the first reduction peak. The shoulder peak for NiPt/Alnf at 265C is likely to be the NiPt alloy reduction peak because it is at a higher temperature than the Pt/Alnf reduction peak (215C), suggesting that Pt particles are in close vicinity to the Ni particles. Therefore, due to the non-uniform nature of the catalyst surface, Pt can catalyse the NiO reduction by surface migration of a chemisorbed hydrogen atom
[27]
. This is also in agreement for NiPd/Alnf, whereby the NiPd alloy reduction peak appears at 345C, which is higher than that for Pd/Alnf (110C).

The total H2 consumption for Ni/Alnf was equivalent to only ca. 80% of the theoretical requirement for complete reduction after TPR at 820C. However it was in excess of 90% for both NiPt/Alnf and NiPd/Alnf even though the TPR in this case was carried out to only 700C. In another result (
Fig. 3
b), TPO of NiPt/Anf reduced at 500C for 5 h with pure H2 proved that it goes through complete reduction (according to the total oxygen consumption), whereas, TPO of Ni/Alnf after the same reduction process showed that only ca. 60% reduction was achieved. It has been reported that Ni catalyst is not completely reduced on an alumina support due to nickel aluminate (NiAl2O4) formation during the calcination step of catalyst preparation
[26]
,
[28]
,
[29]
. It may be possible that the presence of Pt in the catalyst inhibits the formation of NiAl2O4 during calcination. Moreover, the oxidation peak of NiPt/Alnf shifted towards higher temperature by 50C compared to Ni/Alnf, suggesting that the addition of Pt may provide increased resistance to oxidation during the reaction conditions
[30]
. A negative peak was also noticed for O2 uptake in case of Pt/Alnf, which can be explained by the deoxygenation of PtO2 at temperatures in excess of 550C
[10]
. We note here that H2 consumption during TPR of Pt/Alnf and Pd/Alnf was also lower than the theoretical requirement (Pt/Alnf = 54%, Pd/Alnf = 28%), but this is because the catalysts go through partial reduction at room temperature, while the reactor cell is purged with H2/N2 mixed gas.
3.3. Temperature programmed desorption results
COTPD was carried out over all the catalysts listed in
Table 1
(illustrated in
Fig. 4
). The mechanism of desorption is complex and not always well understood
[27]
. However, it is clear that rate of desorption is largely a function of coverage. The rate is given by following the equation
[27]
(3)
where, K is the rate constant,
is the activation energy of desorption, and
is the fraction of site available for desorption at coverage θ.
is related to the heat q and activation energy E of adsorption.
(4)
where, E is the activation energy for adsorption.

Therefore it is evident that
will vary with θ because q is a function of θ. Likewise, K may vary because the frequency of surface bond vibration varies with θ and also because of the heterogeneity of the surface.
It is known from literature
[27]
(also shown in Section
3.5
) that q falls as θ increases. Therefore there will be a significant change in
and hence the rate of desorption will be very rapid at the low activation energy sites. Keeping this in mind we discuss the results of the rate of CO desorption illustrated in
Fig. 4
a. Moreover,
Fig. 4
a must be studied together with
Fig. 4
b because, in regards to CO desorption over alumina nano-fibre, part of CO is converted to CO2 which can be a result of the combination of two reactions, namely the water gas shift (WGS) and Boudouard reaction, largely dominated by the former reaction. Jackson et al.
[31]
suggested that the WGS reaction during CO desorption occurs probably because of the dehydroxilation of alumina (Eq.
(5)
), while, Noronha et al.
[32]
suggested that in the absence of sufficient OH groups CO goes through the Boudouard reaction (Eq.
(6)
). These reactions occur because of the high temperatures required for desorption, which cause the adsorbed layer to become largely mobile. As a result, the equilibrium distribution of the adsorbate may interact with each other (Eq.
(5)
) and with OH groups present on the metal oxide support surface (Eq.
(6)
). The reactions are as follows
(5)
(6)
From
Figs. 4a and 4b
it is evident that the peaks can be categorised in three broad regions in the rate of CO desorption (
) and also in the corresponding rate of CO2 emission (
,
,
) for all the catalysts.
Figs. 5a and 5b
shows the deconvolution of the overlapping peaks for Ni/Alnf and NiPt/Alnf (others not shown). The fitted curve, which is summation of the Gaussian function peaks, closely represents the raw data. The peaks at low temperature represents desorption of low activation energy (
) sites. Accordingly these sites have low heat of adsorption (q) or high coverage θ. It can be noted here that the distribution of strength of CO binding sites is most likely to be a continuous probability density function. It is, however, safe to assume in this argument that the Gaussian peaks represent an interval of individual activation energy (
) values
[33]
. It is believed that the peaks in α region are most likely desorption from a single site chemisorption and the latter two from two site chemisorption
[27]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. Hayward et al.
[27]
suggested that the two site chemisorption is believed to take place at low coverage. At higher coverage the single site chemisorption is dominant. They also reported from literature
[36]
that mixed one and two site chemisorption was observed on Ni, whereas single site chemisorption dominated on both Pt and Pd. We can also note from the literature
[36]
that the nature of support plays an active role in determining the two types of adsorption. Pt supported on alumina was reported to exhibit more two site chemisorption compared to silica support. The mechanism of the single and two site chemisorption can be due to heterogeneity
[27]
,
[36]
and adsorption on different lattice spacing
[37]
. In conclusion we can say that the desorption peaks in
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
have different heats of chemisorption in the order
because of the inverse order of their surface coverage.

The most interesting observation from
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
is the increase in peak heights in the α and
regions (and simultaneous decrease in the peak heights in the
region) for bimetallic catalysts when compared to monometallic catalysts. A corresponding change in CO2 emission can also be noted from
Fig. 4
,

. Both NiPt/Alnf and NiPd/Alnf show the highest rate of CO-desorption in the α region i.e. low
, suggesting an increase in low heat of adsorption sitesEq.
(4)
shows that
is lowered with decreasing q. The addition of Pt and Pd to the Ni may form surface alloys and create heterogeneity or different lattice spacing leading to decrease in two site chemisorption.
Additionally, the integral of CO and CO2 desorption peaks i.e. the total CO released (desorbed + converted to CO2) was found to be in close agreement with the CO chemisorption results in
Table 1
. For example, the total CO released for Pt/Alnf was 97.40 μmol/gm, for Ni/Alnf it was 92.67 μmol/gm and for NiPt/Alnf it was 102.93 μmol/gm.
3.4. Temperature programmed oxidation results
To illustrate that conversion of CO to CO2 during COTPD was dominated by the WGS reaction, we carried out TPO of the catalysts immediately after the COTPD experiment. If the Boudouard reaction took place during the desorption experiment we would expect to see combustion of the carbon deposited on the catalyst as CO2 emission peak. This CO2 emission peak could then be integrated to calculate the amount of carbon deposit. In
Fig. 6
we only illustrate the TPO analysis carried out over Ni/Alnf, Pt/Alnf and NiPt/Alnf for better clarity of the chart. The solid curves indicate the CO2 emission from the carbon combustion and the bullet curves represent O2 uptake during the process. We note here that the O2 uptake peak does not coincide with the CO2 emission peak. This is because the O2 uptake is dominated by the oxidation of the catalysts as evident from the scale of the peak which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the CO2 emission peak. We also notice the negative peak for O2 uptake in case of Pt/Alnf at temperatures in excess of 550C which is similar to the result in
Fig. 3
b. The CO2 emission from Pt/Alnf and NiPt/Alnf peaks at 410 and 425C respectively, indicating that it was likely to be formed on metal or metalsupport interface sites, similar to the results published by Marcot et al.
[38]
. The CO2 peak for Ni/Alnf, however, is at 200C indicating that it was formed on the metal site
[38]
. The integral of CO2 emission peaks suggests that the amount of CO2 released by the Boudouard reaction during the COTPD accounted for only 2.8% for Pt/Alnf and 9.1% for NiPt/Alnf on a molar basis. However, the amount of CO2 released in TPO of Ni/Alnf was 17.8% of CO2 released during COTPD, suggesting that the Boudouard reaction is more dominant on the Ni catalyst compared to both the Pt and NiPt bimetallic catalysts.

The O2 uptake for Pt/Alnf (), Ni/Alnf (+) and NiPt/Alnf (×) is shown on the right Y-axis. After the COTPD run the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature under flowing ultrahigh purity He before starting the TPO run with 2% O2/He mixed gas.
It should be noted here that an organic surfactant was used in synthesising alumina nano-fibre and although it was calcined at 500C for 20 h after drying the gel, and for a further 5 h at 500C after metal impregnation, any remaining carbon could conceivably be combusted in the TPO runs. Therefore, to test that there was no carbon remaining on the support, TPO was conducted on the alumina nano-fibre support and we could not detect any CO2 released during the process. Therefore, the remainder of the CO2 emission is considered to be entirely due to the WGS reaction. WGS reaction is an important step for higher H2 selectivity production from oxygenated hydrocarbons
[3]
. Addition of noble metals such as Pt and Pd to the Ni catalyst may suppress the Boudouard reaction, promoting the WGS reaction in the process leading to higher H2 yield.
3.5. Microcalorimetry results
It was necessary to compare the results obtained from the COTPD experiments with direct measurement of heat of adsorption to confirm the findings. Therefore, microcalorimetry experiments were carried out in the heat flux calorimeter using CO as the probe molecule. The differential heat of adsorption (in kJ/mol) was plotted as a function of the adsorbate coverage (in μmol/gm), as shown in
Fig. 7
. The differential heat profiles are characterised by a plateau of nearly constant heat of adsorption at low coverage (1520 μmol/gm) followed by an abrupt decrease as the surface saturation limit is reached. In the low coverage plateau region the adsorption of CO can be considered to be strongly bonded and at high coverage the differential heat of CO adsorption represents an average heat from the various adsorption sites on the surface of a given catalyst particle. Therefore, we compare only the initial heat of adsorption when the CO chemisorption may be considered to be equilibrated. The initial heat of CO adsorption on Pd/Alnf was found to be highest (130.09 kJ/mol) followed by Pt/Alnf (122.73 kJ/mol) and Ni/ALnf (116.79 kJ/mol). The initial heat of CO adsorption on NiPt/Alnf was recorded as 111.28 kJ/mol, which is lower than both Pt/Alnf and Ni/Alnf. Similarly, the initial differential heat of NiPd/Alnf (109.60 kJ/mol) was lower than both the corresponding monometallic catalysts. This indicates that the addition of noble metals, even in small fractions, to the Ni catalyst has a significant but weaker promoting effect on the adsorption of CO.

It was suggested earlier that the Pt and Pd forms near surface alloys with Ni and causes changes in the lattice spacing
[39]
. According to the theoretical calculation of Greeley et al.

some of the near surface alloys including Ni/Pt may cause lowering of CO-binding energy leading to a decrease in heat of adsorption. This is an ideal property in a reforming catalyst because it can avoid strong preferential adsorption of CO on the metal, while freeing up that extra fraction of the active sites available for reforming reactions. It has been known for a long time
[27]
that an ideal catalyst should not have either too strong or too weak adsorption for the reactant. Therefore, by lowering the binding energy of CO over the alloy catalysts it can be expected that the WGS reaction will be favoured during the reforming reaction leading to greater selectivity of H2 formation.
3.6. TEM, STEM/EDX results
TEM micrographs and EDX analysis of the bimetallic and monometallic catalysts were carried out to visually confirm the alloying effect of Pt on Ni.
Fig. 8
illustrates the TEM micrographs of Ni/Alnf (a), NiPt/Alnf (b) and the STEM dark field micrograph of NiPt/Alnf (c) and the corresponding EDX spectra (d) of the two points shown on the STEM micrograph. Point 1 was chosen to be on a bulk particle and Point 2 was a single crystal particle. This was chosen because we wanted to observe the distribution of Ni and Pt on the catalyst. The size of the EDX beam was ca. 5 nm.

Initial observation from the TEM micrographs suggests that both the Ni/Alnf and NiPt/Alnf catalysts contain rod shaped particles and are ca. 3 nm across and 1020 nm in length. However, the Ni/Alnf catalyst largely contains agglomerated particles which are not necessarily rod shaped. All the TEM micrographs taken were of unreduced catalysts, and therefore a decrease in agglomeration can be expected after the catalysts are reduced.
The results from EDX strongly suggest that Ni and Pt emission lines are present in both the bulk and the single crystal particles. The Pt emission lines in a bulk area scan may suggest only the presence of Pt on the support. However, the presence of Pt and Ni emission lines in single-particle EDX spectrum suggests alloy formation. According to the EDX quantification, the atomic concentration of Pt:Ni in the bulk area was 1:33.67 which is in close agreement with the ICP results. The corresponding atomic concentration on the single crystal particle was 1:24. It is believed that Pt and Ni exist as solid solution in mixed oxide form because the catalyst was not reduced before EDX. The X-ray count from the single crystal particle was expectedly lower than the bulk particle. Therefore, when represented on the same scale with the bulk particle spectrum, the Pt peaks tend to be difficult to read. However, Pt was indeed detected along with Ni in all the particles we analysed in EDX. Therefore it is most likely that Pt is present in close vicinity of Ni particle, confirming the experimental findings from TPR, TPD and microcalorimetry that Pt and Ni forms an alloy catalyst which results in a decrease in heat of CO adsorption.
3.7. Reaction study of liquid phase reforming of sorbitol
Studies carried out in the fixed bed reactor on mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina nano-fibre suggests that the addition of Pt and Pd as promoters to Ni, increases its activity to more than three to five times that of Ni/Alnf (
Fig. 9
a). The rate of H2 formation increased from 1.5 μmol/ming Cat for Ni/Alnf to nearly 9 μmol/ming Cat for NiPt/Alnf. The gas phase selectivity of the H2 production shown in
Fig. 9
a is defined according to the following equation
(7)
where RR is the reforming ratio for 100% conversion of sorbitol to H2 and CO2 according to the following equation
[3]
(8)
The gas phase selectivity of H2 production was found to be highest for Pt/Alnf at 79.4% followed by NiPt/Alnf (75.6%) and NiPd/Alnf (66.7%). The selectivity of both Ni/Alnf and Pd/Alnf was less than 50%. The conversion of sorbitol, measured as the change in concentration of sorbitol in water, increased from 35% for Ni/Alnf to 62.5% for NiPt/Alnf (
Fig. 9
b). We note that the conversion of sorbitol does not equate to the theoretical limit of hydrogen yield (not shown here) because we believe that a considerable fraction of sorbitol does not get converted to a gas phase product. The GCMS results showed presence of propanol, methanol, pentanol and glycolic acid. However, it is evident from
Fig. 9
b that higher conversion does tend to increase the turn over frequency of H2 production (TOF in min1 is based of the total CO uptake). These results are in good agreement with the previous studies conducted by Huber et al.
[22]
where they observed a similar increase in activity of bimetallic catalysts of Pt and Pd for ethylene glycol reforming. We observed a direct correlation between the characterisation studies and the reaction performance of the catalysts.

4. Conclusion
Temperature programmed reduction was carried out on mono- and bimetallic catalysts of Ni, Pt and Pd. The results, when considered in correlation with chemisorption studies, suggested that the addition of Pt and Pd to Ni catalyst increases the reducibility of Ni catalysts and therefore the number of active sites. Results from temperature programmed desorption suggested that in the case of bimetallic catalysts there was a reduction in the number of strong CO-adsorption sites. It is understood that the alloying effect of these systems leads to the lowering of the CO heat of adsorption. This was confirmed by direct measurement of differential heat of CO chemisorption in the microcalorimetry experiment. We observed that the differential heat of adsorption for NiPt/Alnf reduced to 111.28 kJ/mol, which was 11.45 and 5.51 kJ/mol lower than Pt/Alnf and Ni/Alnf respectively. A similar result was obtained for the NiPd bimetallic catalyst. This was interesting because the atomic ratio of Pt:Ni and Pd:Ni was only 1:33 and 1:18. It was suggested earlier in the literature
[39]
,
[41]
that only a minute amount of surface concentration of solute in the alloy catalysts is sufficient to significantly alter the properties of constituent monometallic catalysts. The TEM and STEM/EDX study was carried out to confirm the presence of Pt in close vicinity of Ni particles in the NiPt/Alnf catalyst. The results provided us the evidence that both Pt and Ni are present in nano-sized rod shaped particles. The reaction study conducted on the fixed bed reactor provided the evidence that the bimetallic catalysts exhibit substantially greater activity than the corresponding pure metal catalysts. The rate of H2 formation from NiPt/Alnf was more than five times greater than Ni/Alnf and the sorbitol conversion also increased substantially.
