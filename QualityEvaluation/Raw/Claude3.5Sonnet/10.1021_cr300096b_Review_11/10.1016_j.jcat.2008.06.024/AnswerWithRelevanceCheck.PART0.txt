          [1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol, further studies suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."

[3] "The liquid phase reforming reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 200C and 20 bar pressure."

[4] "The rate of H2 formation increased from 1.5 μmol/ming Cat for Ni/Alnf to nearly 9 μmol/ming Cat for NiPt/Alnf."

[5] "The gas phase selectivity of H2 production was found to be highest for Pt/Alnf at 79.4% followed by NiPt/Alnf (75.6%) and NiPd/Alnf (66.7%)."

[6] "Currently photovoltaic cells, however, are not a viable energy source for water electrolysis. The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."

[7] "From our previous studies and the literature we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst. It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability"

[8] "As a result, we demonstrate that the rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts."

          Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from biomass, which is a renewable and abundant feedstock. This provides an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process can directly convert sugars and sugar alcohols derived from biomass into hydrogen, offering a more efficient route compared to traditional biomass conversion methods.

3. It operates under relatively mild conditions (e.g., 200°C, 20 bar) compared to other thermochemical processes, potentially reducing energy requirements.

4. Using bimetallic catalysts (like NiPt or NiPd) significantly improves hydrogen production rates and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. The rate of H2 formation can be 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts.

5. The aqueous-phase nature of the process allows for using wet biomass directly, avoiding energy-intensive drying steps required in some other biomass conversion routes like gasification or steam reforming.

6. High selectivity toward hydrogen (up to ~80% for some catalysts) minimizes unwanted byproducts, improving atom economy and reducing waste.

7. The addition of noble metals to Ni catalysts may reduce coke deposition, enhancing catalyst stability and longevity.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several advantages:
- It can utilize wet biomass, which is unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming.
- It operates at milder conditions, potentially reducing energy requirements.
- It achieves higher hydrogen production rates and selectivity with bimetallic catalysts.
- It provides a more direct and efficient route from biomass to hydrogen.

These factors contribute to improved sustainability, higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and more practical implementation compared to some traditional hydrogen production methods.

          选择性含氧化合物重整技术通过以下几个关键方面对可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它能够从生物质中生产氢气，而生物质是一种可再生且丰富的原料。这为基于化石燃料的氢气生产提供了一种更环保的替代方案。

2. 该过程可以直接将从生物质中提取的糖和糖醇转化为氢气，与传统的生物质转化方法相比，提供了一条更高效的路径。

3. 与其他热化学过程相比，它在相对温和的条件下运行（例如200°C，20巴），可能会降低能源需求。

4. 使用双金属催化剂（如NiPt或NiPd）与单金属催化剂相比，显著提高了氢气产率和选择性。双金属催化剂的氢气形成速率可以比单金属催化剂高3至5倍。

5. 该过程的液相特性允许直接使用湿生物质，避免了某些其他生物质转化路线（如气化或蒸汽重整）所需的能源密集型干燥步骤。

6. 对氢气的高选择性（某些催化剂高达约80%）最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品，提高了原子经济性并减少了废物。

7. 向Ni催化剂中添加贵金属可能会减少积碳，提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

与传统方法相比，选择性含氧化合物重整技术具有以下优势：
- 它可以利用湿生物质，而湿生物质不适合气化或蒸汽重整。
- 它在较温和的条件下运行，可能减少能源需求。
- 使用双金属催化剂可以实现更高的氢气产率和选择性。
- 它提供了一种从生物质到氢气更直接、更高效的路径。

这些因素有助于提高可持续性，提高产品产率，减少环境影响，并与一些传统氢气生产方法相比，实现更实际的应用。
