          Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly liquid phase methanol reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Simplified and compact process: It allows for more compact and simple reaction equipment compared to traditional steam reforming, making the process more practical to implement.

2. Energy efficiency: It eliminates the need for evaporation energy of the methanol aqueous solution, improving overall energy efficiency.

3. Pure hydrogen production: The process aims to develop a simple and compact system for producing pure hydrogen, which is crucial for fuel cell applications and establishing hydrogen as a future fuel.

4. High selectivity and activity: Using appropriate catalysts like PtRu/TiO2 can yield high selectivity (90.9%) and activity for hydrogen and CO2 production.

5. Feedstock advantages: Methanol is easy to convert, store, and handle, with relatively low prices, making it a promising feedstock for hydrogen production.

6. Milder reaction conditions: The process can operate at lower temperatures compared to conventional steam reforming, potentially reducing energy requirements.

Key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation include:

- Higher product yield: PtRu/TiO2 catalysts show high activity and selectivity for hydrogen and CO2 production.
- Improved environmental impact: High selectivity for CO2 means less CO formation, which is a pollutant. The energy efficiency of the process also suggests potential environmental benefits.
- Practical implementation: The compact, simple equipment design makes it easier to scale and deploy, potentially leading to reduced costs and easier scaling compared to traditional methods.

However, the provided information doesn't offer direct quantitative comparisons to traditional methods in terms of specific yield numbers or environmental impact data.

          选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是液相甲醇重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 简化和紧凑的过程：与传统蒸汽重整相比，它允许使用更紧凑、更简单的反应设备，使过程更易于实施。

2. 能源效率：它消除了甲醇水溶液蒸发能的需求，提高了整体能源效率。

3. 纯氢生产：该过程旨在开发一个简单紧凑的系统来生产纯氢，这对燃料电池应用和将氢气确立为未来燃料至关重要。

4. 高选择性和活性：使用适当的催化剂（如PtRu/TiO2）可以获得高选择性（90.9%）和活性，用于氢气和CO2的生产。

5. 原料优势：甲醇易于转化、储存和处理，价格相对较低，使其成为有前景的氢气生产原料。

6. 较温和的反应条件：与传统蒸汽重整相比，该过程可以在较低温度下运行，可能减少能源需求。

在产品产率、环境影响和实际实施方面的主要优势包括：

- 更高的产品产率：PtRu/TiO2催化剂显示出对氢气和CO2生产的高活性和选择性。
- 改善环境影响：对CO2的高选择性意味着更少的CO形成，CO是一种污染物。该过程的能源效率也表明可能带来环境效益。
- 实际实施：紧凑、简单的设备设计使其更易于扩大规模和部署，可能导致成本降低和比传统方法更容易扩大规模。

然而，所提供的信息并未提供与传统方法在具体产率数据或定量环境影响方面的直接比较。
