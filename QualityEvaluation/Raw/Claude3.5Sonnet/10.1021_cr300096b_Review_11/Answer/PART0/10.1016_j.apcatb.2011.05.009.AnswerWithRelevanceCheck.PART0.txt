          [1] "Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply."

[2] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[3] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

[4] "Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product."

[5] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology."

[6] "As the activity results indicate, glycerol is transformed into OHCs, especially 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, under APR conditions."

          Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides an alternative to fossil fuels, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.

2. It utilizes glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a raw material to produce value-added products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. This helps address the problem of glycerol surplus from increased biodiesel production.

3. Compared to traditional steam reforming, aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers key advantages:
   - Lower energy requirements as it doesn't need to vaporize the feed
   - Produces gas rich in hydrogen and poor in CO
   - Minimizes decomposition reactions that occur at high temperatures

4. It enables the production of useful oxygenated hydrocarbons like 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol, and methanol through glycerol hydrogenolysis.

5. It can produce hydrogen, which has many industrial applications including use in fuel cell technology, supporting clean energy initiatives.

Key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation include:

- Improved energy efficiency due to lower temperature and pressure requirements
- Better product selectivity towards hydrogen and useful oxygenates
- Utilization of renewable feedstocks, making the process more environmentally friendly
- Potential for simpler reactor designs and reduced operating costs compared to traditional high-temperature reforming processes
- Production of both fuel (hydrogen) and chemical intermediates in a single process

However, the studies show that under the tested conditions, liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons were the main products rather than hydrogen gas. This indicates that further optimization and catalyst development may be needed to maximize hydrogen yield if that is the desired outcome for practical implementation at industrial scale.

          选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它为化石燃料提供了替代方案，有助于减少温室气体排放，提高能源安全性。

2. 它利用生物柴油生产的副产品甘油作为原料来生产增值产品，如氢气和含氧烃。这有助于解决生物柴油产量增加带来的甘油过剩问题。

3. 与传统蒸汽重整相比，水相重整(APR)具有以下关键优势：
   - 能量需求更低，因为不需要将进料汽化
   - 产生的气体富含氢气且一氧化碳含量低
   - 最大限度地减少在高温下发生的分解反应

4. 它通过甘油加氢分解反应生产有用的含氧烃类，如1,2-丙二醇、乙二醇、乙醇和甲醇。

5. 它可以生产氢气，氢气有许多工业应用，包括用于燃料电池技术，支持清洁能源倡议。

在产品产率、环境影响和实际应用方面的主要优势包括：

- 由于温度和压力要求较低，能源效率得到提高
- 对氢气和有用含氧化合物的产品选择性更好
- 利用可再生原料，使过程更加环保
- 与传统高温重整工艺相比，反应器设计可能更简单，运营成本更低
- 在单一过程中同时生产燃料（氢气）和化学中间体

然而，研究表明，在测试条件下，液态含氧烃是主要产品，而不是氢气。这表明如果目标是在工业规模上实现最大化氢气产量，可能需要进一步优化和开发催化剂。
