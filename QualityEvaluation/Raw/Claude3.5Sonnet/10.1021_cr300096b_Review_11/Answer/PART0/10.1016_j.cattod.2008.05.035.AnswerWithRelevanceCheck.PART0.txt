          [1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly"

[2] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[3] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[4] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

          Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides a pathway for producing hydrogen, which is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when used as a fuel.

2. It has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production compared to alternatives like partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming.

3. It requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons, making it more energy-efficient.

4. It produces mostly CO2 rather than more harmful emissions.

5. It utilizes ethanol, a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle, and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to alternatives like methanol.

Key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation:

- Higher product yield: Steam reforming offers the highest efficiency for hydrogen production.
- Improved environmental impact: It uses renewable resources and produces mostly CO2 instead of more harmful emissions.
- Practical implementation benefits: Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and less toxic than alternatives like methanol.

However, the highly endothermic nature of the process is noted as an inconvenience, which may present challenges in terms of energy input for practical implementation.

          选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它提供了一种生产氢气的途径，预计当氢气用作燃料时可以减少空气污染和温室气体排放。

2. 与部分氧化或自热重整等替代方案相比，它具有最高的氢气生产效率。

3. 与饱和烃类重整相比，每摩尔氢气产量所需的能量投入更少，使其更加节能。

4. 它主要产生二氧化碳，而不是更有害的排放物。

5. 它利用乙醇，这是一种可再生资源，与甲醇等其他替代品相比，更容易储存、更安全处理和运输，因为它的毒性和挥发性较低。

在产品产率、环境影响和实际应用方面的主要优势：

- 更高的产品产率：蒸汽重整在各种替代方案中具有最高的氢气生产效率。
- 改善环境影响：它使用可再生资源，主要产生CO2而不是更有害的排放物。
- 实际应用优势：乙醇比甲醇等替代品更易于储存、更安全处理，毒性更低。

然而，该过程的高度吸热性被指出是一个不便之处，这可能在实际应用中在能量输入方面带来挑战。
