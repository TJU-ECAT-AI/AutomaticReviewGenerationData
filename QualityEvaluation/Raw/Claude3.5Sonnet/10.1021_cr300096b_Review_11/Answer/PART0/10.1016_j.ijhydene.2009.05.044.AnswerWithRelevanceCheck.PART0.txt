          [1] "Ethanol steam reforming over supported ruthenium and rutheniumplatinum catalysts: Comparison of organometallic clusters and inorganic salts as catalyst precursors"

[2] "The hydrogen economy is seen as a possible solution to the various economical, environmental and security woes associated with the current fossil fuel-based economy"

[3] "Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel. In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral"

[4] "Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic."

[5] "C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2"

[6] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be more active and selective than a commercial catalyst as well as their salt-derived counterparts."

[7] "The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]."

[8] "Besides the conventional steam reforming of natural gas, various H2 production methods are currently being explored, including the partial oxidation of methane [6], gasification of coal [7], electrolysis or thermochemical decomposition of water [8], microbial H2 metabolism [9,10], and the reforming of ethanol [4,1118]."

[9] "The advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam."

          Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Renewable feedstock: Bio-ethanol can be obtained from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, making it a renewable fuel source.

2. Potential carbon neutrality: The entire process from crop growing to hydrogen production has the potential to be carbon neutral, though this depends on various factors.

3. High hydrogen yield: Ethanol steam reforming can produce 6 moles of hydrogen per mole of ethanol (C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2), which is a high hydrogen/carbon ratio.

4. Practical advantages: Ethanol is easily transported and relatively non-toxic compared to other potential hydrogen sources.

5. Environmental benefits: It offers a potential solution to economic, environmental, and security issues associated with fossil fuel dependence.

6. On-board hydrogen generation: It's an attractive method for hydrogen production in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

7. Low-temperature operation: The process is compatible with PEMFCs, which operate at relatively low temperatures.

8. Alternative to conventional methods: It presents an option beyond traditional hydrogen production methods like natural gas reforming or coal gasification.

Key advantages include:

1. Product yield: More hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, as hydrogen is extracted from both ethanol and steam.

2. Environmental impact: The potential for carbon neutrality and the use of renewable feedstock contribute to reduced environmental impact compared to fossil fuel-based methods.

3. Practical implementation: Ethanol's ease of transport, relatively low toxicity, and compatibility with existing infrastructure make it suitable for practical, large-scale implementation.

4. Improved catalysts: Research into organometallic cluster-derived catalysts has shown higher activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts, potentially improving the efficiency of the process.

These advantages make ethanol steam reforming a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen production methods, contributing to more sustainable energy and chemical production systems. However, challenges such as catalyst efficiency and durability still need to be addressed for widespread commercial implementation.

          选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 可再生原料：生物乙醇可以通过富含碳水化合物的植物发酵获得，使其成为可再生燃料来源。

2. 潜在的碳中和：从作物种植到氢气生产的整个过程有可能实现碳中和，尽管这取决于各种因素。

3. 高氢气产率：乙醇蒸汽重整每摩尔乙醇可产生6摩尔氢气（C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2），这是一个很高的氢/碳比率。

4. 实际优势：与其他潜在的氢源相比，乙醇易于运输且相对无毒。

5. 环境效益：它为解决与化石燃料依赖相关的经济、环境和安全问题提供了潜在的解决方案。

6. 车载制氢：它是质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）驱动车辆的一种有吸引力的制氢方法。

7. 低温操作：该过程与在相对较低温度下运行的PEMFCs兼容。

8. 传统方法的替代：它提供了除天然气重整或煤气化等传统制氢方法之外的选择。

主要优势包括：

1. 产品产率：每摩尔重整的乙醇可以产生更多的氢气，因为氢气可以从乙醇和蒸汽中提取。

2. 环境影响：碳中和的潜力和可再生原料的使用有助于减少环境影响，相比于基于化石燃料的方法。

3. 实际实施：乙醇易于运输、相对低毒性以及与现有基础设施的兼容性使其适合实际的大规模实施。

4. 改进的催化剂：有机金属簇衍生催化剂的研究表明，与传统催化剂相比，它们具有更高的活性和选择性，可能提高了该过程的效率。

这些优势使乙醇蒸汽重整成为传统基于化石燃料的制氢方法的一个有前途的替代方案，为更可持续的能源和化学品生产系统做出贡献。然而，要实现广泛的商业应用，仍需解决催化剂效率和耐久性等挑战。
