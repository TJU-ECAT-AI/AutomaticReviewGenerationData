[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."

[3] "Aqueous phase reforming [16–24] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200–250°C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

"Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells. If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."

"Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[1] "The production of hydrogen from oxygenated compounds has been a topic of increasing interest as a way to alleviate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption."

          [2] "Ethanol has attracted particular interest because it can be produced from biomass, and the distillation of ethanol from fermentation of corn is already practiced industrially."

          [3] "Along with ethanol, ethylene glycol has been studied as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production and as a model compound for larger polyols that can be derived from biomass such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc."

[1] "Conversion of biomass to fuels has been a subject of research for many years because of its environmental benefits and renewability."

          [2] "Aqueous phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons, like alcohols and polyols, to produce hydrogen, has been especially of great interest [16]."

          [3] "Hydrogen was produced by Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) of 10% (w/w) sorbitol using mono- and bi-metallic catalysts of Ni and Pt supported on alumina nano-fibre (Alnf), mesoporous ZrO2 and mixed oxides of ceriazirconiasilica (CZxS) with varying concentration of silica (where x is silica concentration)."

[1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."

[2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."

[3] "Through aqueous phase reforming, the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."

[4] "Glycerol has attracted recent attention as a feed molecule for these processes and is particularly interesting because as a by-product of the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats its availability could potentially increase with the expected increase in biodiesel production."

[1] "H2 production technologies have been investigated intensively in recent decades with the aim of utilizing H2-rich gases as fuel for fuel cell (FC) systems. FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions [1]."

[2] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]."

[3] "Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[4] "ATR is also advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions [2]."

[5] "Autothermal reforming of ethanol on zirconia-supported Rh and Pt mono- and bimetallic catalysts (0.5 wt-% total metal loading) was studied as a source of H2-rich gas for fuel cells."

[6] "The Rh-containing catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity for H2 production and were stable in 24 h experiments. The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."

[7] "Synthesis gas can be used in the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels by e.g. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [5,6] or as fuel for FCs."

[1] "For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2."

          [2] "The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel"

          [3] "The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production"

          [4] "H2-rich mixtures are industrially produced by steam reforming (SR, Eq. (1)) of natural gas on Ni catalysts"

          [5] "With higher hydrocarbons, moreover, the SR becomes very endothermic, thus the combination of SR and partial oxidation (POX, Eq. (5)), known as autothermal reforming (ATR), is preferred. The hydrocarbons react with H2O and O2 in a process where high energy efficiencies are achieved as the exothermic POX reaction provides the heat needed for the endothermic SR reaction. The process is simple in design and requires low monetary investments"

[1] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."

[2] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol, further studies suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."

[3] "The liquid phase reforming reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 200C and 20 bar pressure."

[4] "The rate of H2 formation increased from 1.5 μmol/ming Cat for Ni/Alnf to nearly 9 μmol/ming Cat for NiPt/Alnf."

[5] "The gas phase selectivity of H2 production was found to be highest for Pt/Alnf at 79.4% followed by NiPt/Alnf (75.6%) and NiPd/Alnf (66.7%)."

[6] "Currently photovoltaic cells, however, are not a viable energy source for water electrolysis. The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."

[7] "From our previous studies and the literature we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst. It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability"

[8] "As a result, we demonstrate that the rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts."

[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."

[2] "Production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."

[3] "Here, we show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."

[4] "The carbon conversion significantly increased from 14.7 to 72.7% at 400 C with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A, and reached 96.5% at 500 C and 3.8 A. The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C"

[5] "In summary, we present a new and effective method for production of hydrogenvia the electrochemical catalytic reforming of bio-oil over 18%NiO/Al2O3 reforming catalyst, giving good reforming performance including high hydrogen yield (>90%) and high carbon conversion (>90%) even at low temperature."

[6] "The energy efficiency in ECR was higher than that in the CSR process"

[1] "Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply."

[2] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[3] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

[4] "Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product."

[5] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology."

[6] "As the activity results indicate, glycerol is transformed into OHCs, especially 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, under APR conditions."

"Oxygenates such as methanol and ethylene glycol can be reformed to produce CO and H2 on various transition metal surfaces. Facile reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates to H2 and CO provides for a renewable route to a hydrogen economy."

          "Bimetallic catalysts offer a means of reducing precious metal loadings both by replacing bulk atoms with a less expensive substitute and by increasing the activity and selectivity for desired products."

          "Additionally, oxygenates such as ethylene glycol are considered as model probe molecules for reforming of larger polyols and sugars, including glycerol, sorbitol, and glucose"

[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

[3] "The reforming of oxygenates, a hydrogen-production reaction, to further explore the correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of MBS structures."

[4] "The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, operation of direct methanol fuel cells, and methanol reforming to produce hydrogen."

[5] "In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces"

[2] "The hydrogen economy is seen as a possible solution to the various economical, environmental and security woes associated with the current fossil fuel-based economy"

[3] "Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel. In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral"

[4] "Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic."

[5] "C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2"

[6] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be more active and selective than a commercial catalyst as well as their salt-derived counterparts."

[7] "The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]."

[8] "Besides the conventional steam reforming of natural gas, various H2 production methods are currently being explored, including the partial oxidation of methane [6], gasification of coal [7], electrolysis or thermochemical decomposition of water [8], microbial H2 metabolism [9,10], and the reforming of ethanol [4,1118]."

[9] "The advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam."

[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly"

[2] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[3] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[4] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."

[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[1] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."

[2] "Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions. This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as FischerTropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis"

[3] "This integrated catalytic system displayed 100% carbon conversion of concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) into CO2 and CO, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80% of the amount that would ideally be obtained from the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to H2 and CO followed by equilibrated water-gas shift with the water present in the feed."

[4] "To integrate the glycerol gasification and water-gas shift processes in a single reactor system, the gasification process must operate at conditions that are thermodynamically favorable for WGS (e.g., lowest temperature possible)."

[5] "Lastly we demonstrate that concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) can be processed at low temperatures (e.g., at 573 K) in a two bed-single reactor system (PtRe/C and Pt/CeZrOx) to obtain 100% conversion of the carbon in glycerol to gas phase products, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80%."

[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer one approach to altering the physical and chemical properties of metals, in some cases producing unique catalytic properties not seen for either of the parent metals."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

[4] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."

[5] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity. The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."

[6] "Similar to ethylene glycol, ethanol reacts primarily through dehydrogenation and the desired CC bond scission. CO bond scission is minimal and probably can be attributed to defect sites on the surfaces"

[1] "We have recently reported a low temperature process for the conversion of glycerol to synthesis gas over a carbon-supported PtRe catalyst"

[2] "Furthermore, we demonstrated that this glycerol conversion process can be combined with FischerTropsch synthesis in a single reactor process such that the heat generated by the exothermic FischerTropsch reaction can be supplied to the endothermic glycerol reforming reaction"

[3] "This combined process allows for the direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation applications from glycerol"

[4] "Biomass represents an attractive option for liquid fuels to supplement those derived from petroleum, provided that efficient and economical conversion technologies can be developed."

[1] "We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol)"

          [2] "No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth."

          [3] "The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production"

          [4] "The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process."

[1] "The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future."

[2] "As compared with the usual steam reforming reaction, the advantages of liquid phase reforming are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution."

[3] "The main purpose of our study is the development of more simple and compact system for production of pure hydrogen"

[4] "PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity (6.4 × 104 s1) and selectivity (90.9%) than the other catalysts."

[5] "Basic oxide supports improved the selectivity to CO2, whereas acidic supports suppressed the catalytic activity and selectivity."

[6] "The PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited highest activity and selectivity for CO2, which were improved by higher temperature reduction."

[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."

[3] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate."

[4] "Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield and this is most likely related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo oxidation/reduction cycles without deactivation."

[5] "Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K. There are two main observations in the figure. (i) The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production. This observation has been repeated several times and is independent of reaction flow rate. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason. (ii) Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane and has been seen on other studies."

[6] "Maximum variations of the reaction yield of 10–15% were observed. These variations are attributed to analytical and experimental errors rather than to an intrinsic change within the catalyst from one run to the other."

[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells.

[3] "Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel. In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral"

[4] "Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic."

[5] "C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2"

[6] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be more active and selective than a commercial catalyst as well as their salt-derived counterparts."

[7] "The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]."

[8] "Besides the conventional steam reforming of natural gas, various H2 production methods are currently being explored, including the partial oxidation of methane [6], gasification of coal [7], electrolysis or thermochemical decomposition of water [8], microbial H2 metabolism [9,10], and the reforming of ethanol [4,1118]."

[9] "The advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam."

[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly"

[2] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[3] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[4] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."

[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[1] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."

[2] "Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions. This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as FischerTropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis"

[3] "This integrated catalytic system displayed 100% carbon conversion of concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) into CO2 and CO, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80% of the amount that would ideally be obtained from the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to H2 and CO followed by equilibrated water-gas shift with the water present in the feed."

[4] "To integrate the glycerol gasification and water-gas shift processes in a single reactor system, the gasification process must operate at conditions that are thermodynamically favorable for WGS (e.g., lowest temperature possible)."

[5] "Lastly we demonstrate that concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) can be processed at low temperatures (e.g., at 573 K) in a two bed-single reactor system (PtRe/C and Pt/CeZrOx) to obtain 100% conversion of the carbon in glycerol to gas phase products, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80%."

[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer one approach to altering the physical and chemical properties of metals, in some cases producing unique catalytic properties not seen for either of the parent metals."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

[4] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."

[5] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity. The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."

[6] "Similar to ethylene glycol, ethanol reacts primarily through dehydrogenation and the desired CC bond scission. CO bond scission is minimal and probably can be attributed to defect sites on the surfaces"

[1] "We have recently reported a low temperature process for the conversion of glycerol to synthesis gas over a carbon-supported PtRe catalyst"

[2] "Furthermore, we demonstrated that this glycerol conversion process can be combined with FischerTropsch synthesis in a single reactor process such that the heat generated by the exothermic FischerTropsch reaction can be supplied to the endothermic glycerol reforming reaction"

[3] "This combined process allows for the direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation applications from glycerol"

[4] "Biomass represents an attractive option for liquid fuels to supplement those derived from petroleum, provided that efficient and economical conversion technologies can be developed."

[1] "We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol)"

          [2] "No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth."

          [3] "The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production"

          [4] "The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process."

[1] "The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future."

[2] "As compared with the usual steam reforming reaction, the advantages of liquid phase reforming are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution."

[3] "The main purpose of our study is the development of more simple and compact system for production of pure hydrogen"

[4] "PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity (6.4 × 104 s1) and selectivity (90.9%) than the other catalysts."

[5] "Basic oxide supports improved the selectivity to CO2, whereas acidic supports suppressed the catalytic activity and selectivity."

[6] "The PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited highest activity and selectivity for CO2, which were improved by higher temperature reduction."

[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."

[3] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate."

[4] "Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield and this is most likely related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo oxidation/reduction cycles without deactivation."

[5] "Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K. There are two main observations in the figure. (i) The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production. This observation has been repeated several times and is independent of reaction flow rate. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason. (ii) Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane and has been seen on other studies."

[6] "Maximum variations of the reaction yield of 10–15% were observed. These variations are attributed to analytical and experimental errors rather than to an intrinsic change within the catalyst from one run to the other."
