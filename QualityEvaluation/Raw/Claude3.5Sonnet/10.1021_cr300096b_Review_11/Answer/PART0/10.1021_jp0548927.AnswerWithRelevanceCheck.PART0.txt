          [1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer one approach to altering the physical and chemical properties of metals, in some cases producing unique catalytic properties not seen for either of the parent metals."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

[4] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."

[5] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity. The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."

[6] "Similar to ethylene glycol, ethanol reacts primarily through dehydrogenation and the desired CC bond scission. CO bond scission is minimal and probably can be attributed to defect sites on the surfaces"

          Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is a clean energy carrier.
2. The oxygenates used can be derived from renewable biomass, making the process more sustainable.
3. These oxygenates have advantages such as low toxicity and low reactivity, improving safety and ease of handling.
4. The process is compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure, facilitating practical implementation.
5. Using bimetallic catalysts can enhance the efficiency of the reforming process by altering the physical and chemical properties of the metals, potentially producing unique catalytic properties.
6. The ability to predict catalyst performance using the d-band center correlation allows for rational design of more effective catalysts.
7. The process primarily involves dehydrogenation and C-C bond scission, with minimal undesirable C-O bond scission, leading to good product selectivity.
8. Specific bimetallic catalysts like NiPtPt(111) have shown significantly higher reforming activity compared to traditional catalysts like Pt(111).

While the provided information doesn't offer direct comparisons to traditional methods in terms of product yield and environmental impact, the advantages mentioned suggest that selective oxygenate reforming could offer improvements in sustainability, safety, and efficiency compared to conventional hydrogen production methods. The use of renewable feedstocks and the production of clean hydrogen fuel indicate potential environmental benefits over fossil fuel-based processes.
