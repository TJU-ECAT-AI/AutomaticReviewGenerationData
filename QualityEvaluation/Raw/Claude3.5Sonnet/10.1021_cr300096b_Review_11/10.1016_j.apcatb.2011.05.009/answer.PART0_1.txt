[1] "Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product."

[2] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology."

[3] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[4] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It utilizes glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a raw material to produce value-added products like hydrogen. This helps address the problem of glycerol surplus from increased biodiesel production.

2. It can produce hydrogen, which has many industrial applications including use in fuel cell technology, supporting clean energy initiatives.

3. Compared to traditional steam reforming, aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers key advantages:
   - Lower energy requirements as it doesn't need to vaporize the feed
   - Produces gas rich in hydrogen and poor in CO
   - Minimizes decomposition reactions that occur at high temperatures

4. It enables the production of useful oxygenated hydrocarbons like 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol through glycerol hydrogenolysis.

In terms of practical implementation, APR can be conducted at lower temperatures than steam reforming. The main products are valuable chemicals rather than just hydrogen gas. Environmentally, it makes use of a renewable feedstock (glycerol) and requires less energy input than traditional reforming. However, the yields of hydrogen appear to be lower than conventional reforming based on the information provided.

选择性含氧化合物重整在几个方面为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它利用生物柴油生产的副产品甘油作为原料来生产增值产品如氢气。这有助于解决生物柴油产量增加带来的甘油过剩问题。

2. 它可以生产氢气，氢气有许多工业应用，包括用于燃料电池技术，支持清洁能源倡议。

3. 与传统蒸汽重整相比，水相重整(APR)具有以下关键优势：
   - 能量需求更低，因为不需要将进料汽化
   - 产生的气体富含氢气且一氧化碳含量低
   - 最大限度地减少在高温下发生的分解反应

4. 它通过甘油加氢分解反应生产有用的含氧烃类，如1,2-丙二醇和乙二醇。

在实际应用方面，APR可以在比蒸汽重整更低的温度下进行。主要产品是有价值的化学品，而不仅仅是氢气。从环境角度来看，它利用可再生原料(甘油)，并且比传统重整需要更少的能量输入。然而，根据所提供的信息，氢气产率似乎低于常规重整。
