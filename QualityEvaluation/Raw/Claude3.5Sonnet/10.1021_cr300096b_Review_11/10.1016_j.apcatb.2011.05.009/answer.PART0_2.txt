[1] "Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply."

[2] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[3] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides an alternative to fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.

2. It has lower energy requirements compared to traditional steam reforming, as it does not require vaporization of the feedstock.

3. It produces a hydrogen-rich gas stream with low CO content, which is advantageous for fuel cell applications.

4. It allows for the conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates like glycerol into valuable chemical products such as 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol.

5. It operates at milder conditions, minimizing unwanted decomposition reactions.

The key advantages in terms of product yield include the ability to selectively produce desired oxygenated hydrocarbons through hydrogenolysis reactions. Environmentally, it offers a more sustainable approach by utilizing renewable feedstocks and operating under less energy-intensive conditions. For practical implementation, the lower temperature and pressure requirements may allow for simpler reactor designs and reduced operating costs compared to traditional high-temperature reforming processes.
