[1] "Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply."

[2] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[3] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides an alternative to fossil fuels, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on external energy sources.

2. It has lower energy requirements compared to traditional steam reforming, as it does not require vaporizing the feed.

3. It produces hydrogen-rich gas with low CO content, favoring the water-gas shift reaction.

4. It minimizes high-temperature decomposition reactions.

5. It enables the conversion of glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct, into valuable oxygenated hydrocarbons like 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol.

The key advantages include improved energy efficiency, better product selectivity towards hydrogen and useful oxygenates, and the ability to utilize renewable feedstocks. This makes the process more environmentally friendly and economically viable compared to traditional methods. However, the study shows that under the tested conditions, liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons were the main products rather than hydrogen gas, indicating that further optimization may be needed to maximize hydrogen yield if that is the desired outcome.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它为化石燃料提供了替代方案,有助于减少温室气体排放和对外部能源的依赖。

2. 与传统蒸汽重整相比,它的能量需求更低,因为不需要将原料气化。

3. 它产生富含氢气且CO含量低的气体,有利于水气变换反应的进行。

4. 它最大限度地减少了高温分解反应。

5. 它能够将生物柴油副产品甘油转化为有价值的含氧烃类,如1,2-丙二醇和乙二醇。

主要优势包括提高能源效率、改善产品选择性(偏向氢气和有用的含氧化合物),以及利用可再生原料的能力。与传统方法相比,这使得该工艺更加环保和经济可行。然而,研究表明,在测试条件下,液态含氧烃是主要产品,而不是氢气,这表明如果目标是最大化氢气产量,可能需要进一步优化。
