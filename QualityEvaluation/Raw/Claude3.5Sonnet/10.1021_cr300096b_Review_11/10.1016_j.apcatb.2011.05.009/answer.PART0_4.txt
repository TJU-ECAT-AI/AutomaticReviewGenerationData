[1] "Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product."

[2] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2."

[3] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[4] "As the activity results indicate, glycerol is transformed into OHCs, especially 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, under APR conditions."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It allows the utilization of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a raw material to produce value-added products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. This helps address the problem of glycerol surplus from increased biodiesel production.

2. The process has lower energy requirements compared to traditional steam reforming, as it does not require vaporization of the feed. This improves energy efficiency.

3. It produces a gas stream rich in hydrogen and poor in carbon monoxide, which is advantageous for fuel cell applications. The water-gas shift reaction is favored under APR conditions.

4. Decomposition reactions that occur at high temperatures are minimized in APR, leading to better selectivity.

5. It allows the production of useful oxygenated hydrocarbons like 1,2-propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethanol and methanol from glycerol under milder conditions.

Key advantages include improved energy efficiency, better product selectivity, utilization of a renewable feedstock (glycerol), and production of both fuel (hydrogen) and chemical intermediates in a single process. The milder conditions also allow for better process control and potentially lower capital costs compared to high-temperature reforming. However, the literature indicates that further catalyst development is needed to improve hydrogen yields and long-term stability for practical implementation at industrial scale.

选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献的几种方式:

1. 它允许利用生物柴油生产的副产品甘油作为原料来生产增值产品,如氢气和含氧烃。这有助于解决生物柴油产量增加导致的甘油过剩问题。

2. 与传统蒸汽重整相比,该过程的能量需求更低,因为不需要将进料汽化。这提高了能源效率。

3. 它产生富含氢气和贫碳一氧化碳的气体流,这对燃料电池应用有利。在APR条件下,水气变换反应是有利的。

4. APR最大限度地减少了在高温下发生的分解反应,从而提高了选择性。

5. 它允许在较温和的条件下从甘油生产有用的含氧烃,如1,2-丙二醇、乙二醇、乙醇和甲醇。

主要优势包括提高能源效率、更好的产品选择性、利用可再生原料(甘油),以及在单一过程中同时生产燃料(氢气)和化学中间体。较温和的条件还允许更好的过程控制,与高温重整相比可能降低资本成本。然而,文献表明,还需要进一步开发催化剂,以提高氢气产率和长期稳定性,从而在工业规模上实现实际应用。
