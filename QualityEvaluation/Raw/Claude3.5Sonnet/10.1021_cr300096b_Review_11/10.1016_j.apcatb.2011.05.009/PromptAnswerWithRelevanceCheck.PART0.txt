[1] "Renewable energy sources are a clear alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuel utilization and to decrease the European Union's dependency on external energy sources, improving the safety and sustainability of the energy supply."

[2] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

[3] "The activity results showed that glycerol conversion was especially due to the formation of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons, mainly 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which are formed from glycerol hydrogenolysis"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides an alternative to fossil fuels, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.

2. It has lower energy requirements compared to traditional steam reforming, as it doesn't require vaporizing the feed.

3. It produces hydrogen-rich gas with low CO content, which is advantageous for fuel cell applications.

4. It minimizes unwanted high-temperature decomposition reactions.

5. It enables the conversion of biorenewable feedstocks like glycerol into valuable chemical products such as 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol.

The key advantages include:

- Higher product yields of useful oxygenated hydrocarbons compared to complete gasification
- Milder reaction conditions, reducing energy use and equipment costs
- Ability to use wet biomass feedstocks without drying
- Production of both fuel (hydrogen) and chemical products from renewable sources

While the literature doesn't provide quantitative comparisons to traditional methods, the qualitative benefits in terms of energy efficiency, product selectivity, and use of renewable feedstocks suggest selective oxygenate reforming could have significant environmental and practical advantages for sustainable chemical and fuel production.

[1] "Among biofuels, biodiesel demand and production has seen exponential growth in the past few years. During the production of biodiesel by transesterification, glycerol is generated as a by-product."

[2] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology."

[3] "Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It utilizes glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a raw material to produce value-added products like hydrogen. This helps address the problem of glycerol surplus from increased biodiesel production.

2. It can produce hydrogen, which has many industrial applications including use in fuel cell technology, supporting clean energy initiatives.

3. Compared to traditional steam reforming, aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers key advantages:
   - Lower energy requirements as it doesn't need to vaporize the feed
   - Produces gas rich in hydrogen and poor in CO
   - Minimizes decomposition reactions that occur at high temperatures

4. It enables the production of useful oxygenated hydrocarbons like 1,2-propylene glycol and ethylene glycol through glycerol hydrogenolysis.

In terms of practical implementation, APR can be conducted at lower temperatures than steam reforming. The main products are valuable chemicals rather than just hydrogen gas. Environmentally, it makes use of a renewable feedstock (glycerol) and requires less energy input than traditional reforming. However, the yields of hydrogen appear to be lower than conventional reforming based on the information provided.

Key advantages include improved energy efficiency, better product selectivity, utilization of a renewable feedstock (glycerol), and production of both fuel (hydrogen) and chemical intermediates in a single process. The milder conditions also allow for better process control and potentially lower capital costs compared to high-temperature reforming. However, the literature indicates that further catalyst development is needed to improve hydrogen yields and long-term stability for practical implementation at industrial scale.
