[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."

[3] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, resulting in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels.

2. It can utilize a variety of oxygenate molecules generated from biomass as feedstocks.

3. Multiple process options are available, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and aqueous phase reforming.

The aqueous phase reforming process offers some particular advantages:

1. It operates in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize water and reactants.

2. It can use non-volatile oxygenates as feedstocks.

3. It operates at much lower temperatures (200-250°C) compared to steam or autothermal reforming.

4. It produces hydrogen with low CO concentrations in a single reactor.

5. It mainly generates CO2 and H2 as products.

These characteristics make selective oxygenate reforming, especially aqueous phase reforming, an attractive option for sustainable hydrogen production with potentially lower energy requirements, broader feedstock flexibility, and simplified processing compared to traditional reforming methods. However, the literature does not provide quantitative comparisons of product yields or detailed environmental impact assessments versus other approaches.

选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学品生产做出了几个关键贡献：

1. 它可以从可再生生物质衍生的原料中生产氢气，与化石燃料相比可以降低净二氧化碳排放。

2. 它可以利用由生物质生成的各种含氧分子作为原料。

3. 有多种工艺选择，包括蒸汽重整、自热重整和水相重整。

水相重整工艺具有一些特殊优势：

1. 它在液相中进行，无需汽化水和反应物。

2. 它可以使用非挥发性含氧化合物作为原料。

3. 与蒸汽重整或自热重整相比，它的操作温度要低得多（200-250°C）。

4. 它在单一反应器中生产低CO浓度的氢气。

5. 它主要生成CO2和H2作为产品。

这些特性使选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是水相重整，成为一种具有吸引力的可持续氢气生产选择，与传统重整方法相比，它可能具有更低的能源需求、更广泛的原料灵活性和简化的加工过程。然而，文献中没有提供与其他方法相比的定量产品产率比较或详细的环境影响评估。
