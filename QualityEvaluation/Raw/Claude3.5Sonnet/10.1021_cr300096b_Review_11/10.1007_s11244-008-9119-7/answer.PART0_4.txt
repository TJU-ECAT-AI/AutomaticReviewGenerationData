[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, resulting in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels.

2. The process can operate at lower temperatures (200-250°C) compared to traditional steam reforming or autothermal reforming methods.

3. It produces hydrogen with low CO concentrations in a single reactor, simplifying the process.

4. Aqueous phase reforming eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, allowing the use of non-volatile oxygenates as feedstock.

5. It can generate hydrogen for use in fuel cells, supporting clean energy applications.

Key advantages include improved environmental impact through lower CO2 emissions, practical implementation through lower operating temperatures and simpler reactor design, and potentially higher product yields due to the ability to use a wider range of biomass-derived feedstocks.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献包括以下几个方面:

1. 它能够从可再生生物质衍生的原料中生产氢气,与化石燃料相比可以降低净CO2排放。

2. 该过程可以在较低的温度下运行(200-250°C),相比传统蒸汽重整或自热重整方法更为温和。

3. 它在单一反应器中生产低CO浓度的氢气,简化了整个工艺流程。

4. 水相重整消除了水和反应物蒸发的需求,允许使用不易挥发的含氧化合物作为原料。

5. 它可以生产用于燃料电池的氢气,支持清洁能源应用。

主要优势包括通过降低CO2排放改善环境影响,通过较低的操作温度和更简单的反应器设计实现实际应用,以及由于能够使用更广泛的生物质衍生原料而可能获得更高的产品收率。
