[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

2. It results in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuel utilization.

3. Aqueous phase reforming in particular offers key advantages:
   - Operates at lower temperatures (200-250°C) than traditional methods
   - Produces H2 with low CO concentrations in a single reactor
   - Eliminates need to vaporize water and reactants
   - Allows use of non-volatile oxygenates as feedstock

4. It can utilize a variety of oxygenate molecules derived from biomass.

5. The process is applicable for hydrogen production for fuel cells, supporting clean energy technologies.

While the document does not provide direct comparisons of product yields to traditional methods, the ability to operate at lower temperatures with renewable feedstocks suggests improved efficiency and environmental benefits compared to conventional reforming processes.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面:

1. 它能够利用可再生生物质衍生的原料生产氢气，减少对化石燃料的依赖。

2. 与使用化石燃料相比，它产生的净CO2排放量更低。

3. 特别是水相重整提供了以下关键优势:
   - 操作温度较低(200-250°C)，低于传统方法
   - 在单个反应器中生产低CO浓度的H2
   - 无需蒸发水和反应物
   - 可使用不易挥发的含氧化合物作为原料

4. 它可以利用从生物质衍生的多种含氧分子。

5. 该过程适用于生产燃料电池用氢气，支持清洁能源技术。

虽然文献没有直接比较产品产率与传统方法的差异，但能够在较低温度下使用可再生原料运行表明，与传统重整工艺相比，该过程具有更高的效率和环境效益。
