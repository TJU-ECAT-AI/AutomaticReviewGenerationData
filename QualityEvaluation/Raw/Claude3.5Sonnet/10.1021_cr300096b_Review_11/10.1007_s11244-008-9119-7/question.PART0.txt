Abstract
We present results for H2 production by reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol were employed as probe molecules. The formation of bimetallic surfaces with a 3d metal monolayer on Pt(111), designated 3d-Pt-Pt(111), led to increased H2 production as compared to the parent metal surfaces. The combined experimental and DFT results suggest that the reforming activity tracks the energy of the surface d-band center of various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.

Introduction
The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization. Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming. Steam reforming [110] is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500900 C. Typical catalysts used in steam reforming include Ni, Rh, Ru, and Pt. The high operating temperature favors CO production, and a second water-gas shift reactor operating at lower temperature is needed to reduce the CO concentration in the exit stream [1]. Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters [2, 11]. Autothermal reforming [10, 1215] combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming. It has been demonstrated to work with both volatile and non-volatile feeds, utilizing short contact time reactors with Pt, Rh, RhCe, and RhLa catalysts at temperatures between 7001100 C.
Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor. Typical pressures vary between 1550 bar, and H2 and CO2 can be separated from the exit stream using current pressure swing adsorption or Pd membrane technologies. Literature studies [18] show that Pt and Ni catalysts exhibit high reforming activity, while reforming selectivity is highest on Pt and Pd, with decreased selectivity on Ni due to methane production. Addition of Sn to Ni leads to a decrease in the production of methane [2527].
The focus of the current paper is on the reforming of oxygenates at low temperatures, most applicable to the aqueous phase reforming process for which Pt-based catalysts have shown promise [16, 18]. We are specifically interested in investigating bimetallic catalysts that might show increased activity and selectivity for oxygenate reforming. The 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems have been studied extensively due to their novel catalytic properties [2834]. In this notation, 3d represents the periodic row of transition metals from Ti to Ni. The deposition temperature of the Pt(111) substrate can be used to control the formation of specific bimetallic surface configurations. As described in previous studies [2834], deposition at elevated temperatures leads to the 3d metal diffusing into the subsurface region, producing a sandwich structure designated Pt-3d-Pt(111), with the top layer enriched with Pt atoms. The deposition temperature needed to drive the 3d metal into the subsurface region of Pt is generally 600 K for Ni, Co, and Fe. Alternatively, the inherent activation barrier for segregation prevents the diffusion of the 3d metal at room temperature, and deposition at these conditions produces a surface overlayer structure, designated 3d-Pt-Pt(111), with the top layer enriched with 3d atoms. For both subsurface and surface structures, it is important to control the amount of 3d metal as the novel catalytic properties are observed most prominently near monolayer coverage for both Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt-Pt(111). Longer deposition times produce surfaces of increasing thickness of 3d metal, and after several layers these surfaces begin to approximate the structure and reactivity of the parent 3d(111) surfaces. These surfaces are designated as 3d(111) films throughout the paper.
We are interested in monolayer bimetallic surfaces that ideally contain only either Pt or 3d atoms in the first layer. The subsurface and surface monolayer structures represent the extreme cases in the formation of bimetallic surfaces, exhibiting different properties from each other and from their parent metals due to the combination of ligand and strain effects. Structures that contain both types of atoms in the surface layer as either a random or an ordered alloy would fall in between these two cases, as shown by previous studies using calculated hydrogen binding energies [35]. However, ensemble effect could also be important where adsorbates do not interact with one type of the surface atoms and require a certain geometric configuration. One example would be the adsorption of molecules on Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces [36, 37] where most adsorbates do not bind on sites that incorporate Sn atoms.
The Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt-Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display unique chemical properties that are very different from each other, and in general are not simply a mixture of the properties of the parent Pt(111) and 3d(111) surfaces. Using both experiments [2830, 32, 33] and DFT modeling [29, 35, 38], decreased interaction with various adsorbates have been observed for the Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces. The adsorbates that were studied included atomic species such as H [29, 30] and O [39], unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene [28], 1-butene [40], 1-hexene [40] and cyclohexene [28, 30, 31, 40], oxygenates, such as methanol [41], ethanol [42], ethylene glycol [42] and glycerol [43], and more complex species such as acrolein [44] and thiophene [33]. The availability of more weakly bonded adsorbates such as hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons can lead to increased low temperature hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces are characterized by increased interactions with adsorbates [29, 4143]. This can lead to an increase in activity for bond scission reactions, advantageous for the reforming of oxygenates.
In the current paper we provide an overview of our recent work on the general trends in the reactivity of oxygenates on various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. TPD results for methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces are presented first to compare the yields of gas phase products from monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. This is followed by HREELS studies of ethylene glycol on Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces to illustrate the bond scission sequence for the OH, CH and CC bonds. We present results using DFT calculations for various oxygenate adsorbates on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, and correlations of the experimentally determined reforming yields on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with the surface d-band center. The last section explores the stability of the desirable 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface bimetallic structures using both experiments and theoretical calculations.
Experimental and Modeling Methods
Experimental Techniques
Two ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers were used for this work. The UHV chamber used for the Ni/Pt(111) TPD experiments has been described previously [42]. It consists of a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure 1 × 1010 Torr), equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and TPD. TPD experiments used a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTI 100 C), which could monitor up to 12 masses simultaneously. During TPD the samples were heated at a linear rate of 3 K/s. The UHV chamber used for the HREELS experiments, as described previously [45], is a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure 3 × 1010 Torr) equipped with AES and TPD in the top two levels and a LK3000 HREELS unit in the bottom level. The HREELS spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6 eV. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60 with respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically between 2 × 104 and 5 × 104counts per second, and the spectral resolution was between 30 and 50 cm1 full width at half maximum. Each HREEL spectrum was normalized to unity using the elastic peak, and then scaled by a multiplication factor as shown in the figures.
The Pt(111) single crystal (Princeton Scientific, 99.99%) was 1-mm-thick, with a 10 mm diameter, and was oriented to within 0.5. The crystal was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electric contacts for resisting heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. The temperature of the crystal could be varied between 100 and 1100 K, and was measured by spot-welding a chromel-alumel thermocouple to the top edge of the Pt(111) single crystal. The surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering at 600 K and annealing at 1100 K. Following the last cleaning cycle, 1 L of O2 at 890 K was used to remove carbon left on the surface, followed by annealing at 1100 K for 5 min. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES.
Methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99+%), ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5+%), ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) and glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5+%) were transferred into glass sample cylinders and purified using repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles. All other gases were of research purity and were used without further purification. The purity of all reagents was verified in situ by a mass spectrometer prior to use. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity. Gas exposures were carried out at a crystal temperature of 120 K for methanol and 200 K for the other oxygenates through a  in. stainless steel directional tube. Glycerol experiments were carried out with the entire dosing line heated to 400 K due to the low vapor pressure of this molecule.
The 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by thermal evaporation of the 3d metal onto Pt(111), as described earlier [29, 46]. The Pt(111) single crystal was held at either 600 K or 300 K during deposition, depending on whether a sandwich structure or an overlayer was being prepared. The metal doser consisted of a tungsten filament with a high purity 3d metal wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.99+%) wrapped around it, mounted within a tantalum enclosure. The Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES ratios were used to determine Ni coverages, with a ratio of 1.0 taken as the monolayer coverage for Pt-Ni-Pt(111) based on previous calibration [29]. For Co/Pt(111) surfaces, the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES ratios were used to determine Co coverages, with a ratio of 2.0 taken as the monolayer coverage for Pt-Co-Pt(111) [46]. For Ni/(111) film surface, deposition was carried out at 600 K until more than 6 ML of Ni atoms were deposited onto Pt(111).
DFT Calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed with the VASP package, which uses a planewave basis set with pseudopotentials to represent core electrons. The PW91 functional was used for self-consistent electronic structure calculations. The surfaces were approximated by a 3 × 3 unit cell with four layers of metal separated by six equivalent layers of vacuum, repeated periodically. The top two layers along with the adsorbates were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration. A planewave cutoff of 396 eV was used for all calculations. The d-band density of states was determined by projection of the planewaves onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The d-band center values were previously calculated [39] as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms relative to the Fermi level. The binding energies of adsorbates were determined as the difference between the energy of the slab with the adsorbate minus the energies of the slab alone and the adsorbate alone. The Ni(111) film surface was approximated by Ni(111) in all DFT calculations.
Results and Discussion
TPD Results
TPD studies were carried out to monitor the reaction pathways of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. The oxygenate molecules studied included methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, and TPD experiments were performed following saturation exposures of 0.08 L, 0.3 L and 0.2 L, respectively. The gas phase species that were observed included H2, CO and unreacted oxygenates. No other gas phase species were observed with the exception of methane, which was produced after adsorption of ethanol. The H2 TPD spectra following oxygenate adsorption on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been reported previously [41, 42] and are compared in Fig. 1. On Pt(111) methanol adsorbed reversibly on the surface without undergoing decomposition, consistent with previous studies [4750]. In contrast, ethanol and ethylene glycol reacted to produce H2, which desorbed at 351 and 327 K from these two sources, respectively. On Pt-Ni-Pt(111) very little H2 was produced following methanol and ethanol adsorption, while a small peak was present at 300 K following ethylene glycol exposure. In contrast, significant H2 desorption was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) for all three oxygenates. The desorption peaks were centered at 372 K for methanol and 367 K for ethanol. Two overlapping peaks were observed for ethylene glycol at 360 and 385 K. The Ni(111) film was also active for oxygenate reforming. For methanol and ethanol, H2 desorbed from a single peak at 360 K, while after ethylene glycol exposures, H2 desorption occurred from two peaks centered at 327 and 360 K. Comparing the H2 peak areas on all the surfaces, Ni-Pt-Pt(111) displayed the highest peak areas followed by the Ni(111) film, then Pt(111). Pt-Ni-Pt(111) displayed the lowest H2 peak areas. The general trend in the H2 desorption temperature was also consistent with previous DFT calculations of atomic hydrogen binding energies on the four surfaces [29].

Along with H2, CO was also produced as the gas phase product for oxygenate reforming. The CO TPD spectra of methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces are shown in Fig. 2 [41, 42]. On Pt(111), CO desorbed from a single peak at 461 K for all three oxygenates. The CO desorption peak on Pt(111) following methanol exposure was similar to that obtained without dosing methanol, and thus was attributed to adsorption of CO from the UHV background. On the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, the CO desorption temperature decreased to 402 K and the CO peak areas decreased compared to Pt(111). In contrast, CO peak areas increased significantly on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface. The main desorption peak for CO produced from all three oxygenates was at 460 K. CO desorbed from two peaks at 463 and 517 K following methanol adsorption. For ethanol, CO desorption was observed at 459 K, while for ethylene glycol three overlapping CO peaks at 402, 426, and 459 K were present. On the Ni(111) film surface, CO desorbed at slightly lower temperatures and the CO peak areas decreased slightly compared to Ni-Pt-Pt(111). For methanol and ethanol, CO desorption occurred at 426 K, while two overlapping peaks at 404 and 426 K were present for ethylene glycol. Comparing the H2 and CO TPD results, similar trends were obtained, with the peak areas increasing in the order Pt-Ni-Pt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) film < Ni-Pt-Pt(111). The desorption temperatures of the H2 and CO products were also similar to those obtained after exposing H2 and CO molecules on the same surfaces (data not shown), indicating that both H2 and CO are desorption-limited for methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces [29]. TPD experiments were also carried out using glycerol. Results indicated that glycerol displayed a similar reactivity trend on the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces [43].

The TPD results for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol were quantified using a procedure described previously [4143, 51]. The TPD peak areas were converted to units of monolayers (ML) by calibration of saturation coverages of H2 and CO against literature values for Pt(111) [52, 53] (0.45 ML H2 and 0.68 ML CO). Blank experiments were also carried out to determine the contributions from H2 and CO adsorbed from the UHV background and the final product yields were obtained by subtracting the contributions attributed to the background. The general reaction pathways for an oxygenate can be summarized by the equations below. The first reaction is the desired reforming reaction producing CO and H2. The second reaction represents total decomposition producing Cad and Oad along with H2. Depending on the stoichiometry of the reactant, Cad can also be formed in the first reaction, as in the case of ethanol, and needs to be removed from the catalyst surface through steam reforming to prevent deactivation. Along with these general reactions, oxygenates can react to produce other products specific to each reactant, such as the reaction of ethanol to form methane.
$$ a{\text{C}}_{x} {\text{O}}_{y} {\text{H}}_{2x + 2} \to ax{\text{CO}} + a(x + 1){\text{H}}_{2} + a(x - y){\text{C}}_{\text{ad}} $$
$$ b{\text{C}}_{x} {\text{O}}_{y} {\text{H}}_{2x + 2} \to bx{\text{C}}_{\text{ad}} + by{\text{O}}_{ad} + b(x + 1){\text{H}}_{2} $$
The ideal oxygenates, such as methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, have 1:1 C:O stoichiometry, and Cad is not formed by the reforming reaction. The reactions above simplify to the following.
$$ a{\text{C}}_{x} {\text{O}}_{x} {\text{H}}_{2x + 2} \to ax{\text{CO}} + a(x + 1){\text{H}}_{2} $$
$$ b{\text{C}}_{x} {\text{O}}_{x} {\text{H}}_{2x + 2} \to bx{\text{C}}_{\text{ad}} + bx{\text{O}}_{\text{ad}} + b(x + 1){\text{H}}_{2} $$
The reforming yield, a, can then be defined as the number of oxygenate molecules reacting via the reforming pathway. Similarly, the total decomposition yield, b, can be calculated using the equations below, allowing one to then determine the selectivity toward the desired reaction. The reforming yields of methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces will be presented later in Sect. 3.4.
$$ a = \frac{{{\text{CO}}\,{\text{yield}}}}{x}\quad b = \frac{{{\text{H}}_{2} \,{\text{yield}}}}{x + 1} - a $$
HREELS Results
In order to better understand the reactions occurring on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, HREELS studies were carried out to determine the surface species involved in the reforming reactions. We have performed HREELS experiments using methanol [41], ethanol [54] and ethylene glycol [54] on Pt(111), Pt-Ni-Pt(111), Ni-Pt-Pt(111) and Ni(111) film surfaces. However, as a representative example we consider only HREELS results for ethylene glycol on Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces. For the HREELS experiments, ethylene glycol was adsorbed at 200 K. Following the initial scan the surface was flashed to the indicated temperatures at 3 K/s followed by cooling before taking the next HREEL spectrum.
Figure 3 displays the HREEL spectra corresponding to the thermal decomposition of 1 L ethylene glycol on Pt(111). The HREEL spectrum at 200 K exhibited the following vibrational modes: 530, δ(CCO); 700 cm1, τ(OH); 865 cm1, ν(CC); 1080 cm1, νs(CO); 1250 cm1, ρt(CH2); 1360 cm1, ρw(CH2); 1450 cm1, ν(CH2); 2850 cm1, νs(CH); 2920 cm1, νas(CH); 3270 cm1, ν(OH). The vibrational assignments are summarized in Table 1 and are in agreement with previous results on other surfaces [55, 56] and with the liquid phase spectrum of this molecule [57]. The similarity of the spectrum on Pt(111) compared to that of the liquid phase along with the presence of the strong ν(OH) and τ(OH) modes at 3270 and 700 cm1, respectively, indicated that ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly on Pt(111) at 200 K with the OH bonds intact. Heating the surface to 250 K produced several changes in the vibrational spectrum. The intensity of the modes associated with ethylene glycol decreased at 250 K. The ν(OH) and τ(OH) modes were no longer present, indicating ethylene glycol reacted through initial OH bond cleavage. The peak at 865 cm1 attributed to the ν(CC) mode decreased in intensity significantly, indicating that ethylene glycol began to react by CC bond scission. However, the presence of a residual small peak suggested that at least some of the adsorbed species retained the CC bond at this temperature. With heating to 250 K, new vibrational ν(CO) modes appeared at 2080 cm1 and 1830 cm1, along with the corresponding ν(MC) modes at 470 and 410 cm1. These vibrations were attributed to linear and bridge bonded CO adsorbed on the surface. After heating the surface to 300 K the modes associated with ethylene glycol disappeared, indicating the adsorbed species decomposed to form CO on the surface.

As a comparison to Pt(111), Fig. 4 displays the HREEL spectra corresponding to the thermal decomposition of 1 L ethylene glycol on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), the surface that displayed the highest H2 and CO peak areas from TPD. At 200 K ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly with the OH bonds intact, as shown by the presence of ν(OH) at 3270 cm1 and τ(OH) at 700 cm1 and by the general similarity of the spectrum compared to that of the liquid phase. Heating the surface to 250 K produced several changes in the spectra. The ν(OH) and τ(OH) vibrational modes disappeared, indicating that ethylene glycol dehydrogenated through initial OH bond cleavage, similar to its behavior on Pt(111). No evidence for initial CH bond cleavage was observed on either surface. Along with these changes noted, new vibrational ν(CO) and ν(MC) modes appeared at 1820 and 430 cm1, respectively, indicating the production of adsorbed CO. The intensity of the ν(CC) mode at 860 cm1 was similar at 250 K compared to 200 K, suggesting that on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) the CC bond cleavage did not occur by 250 K. This was in contrast to Pt(111) on which evidence of CC bond cleavage was apparent by 250 K. No changes were observed with the other vibrational modes attributed to ethylene glycol, suggesting that other than the OH bond cleavage the rest of the adsorbate was unperturbed compared to molecular ethylene glycol. The spectrum at 250 K also contained a weak peak at 3460 cm1, which is attributed to surface OH groups produced by the decomposition of water from the UHV background. Heating the surface to 300 K produced a spectrum that was similar to that at 250 K. The intensity of the ν(CC) mode at 860 cm1 did not change, indicating that the CC bond did not break at this temperature. The increased stability at 300 K of the partially dehydrogenated ethylene glycol species on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) was in contrast to results on Pt(111), where at 300 K this species had already decomposed to form CO. On Ni-Pt-Pt(111) this species remained stable at 300 K and the decomposition occurred only after heating the surface to 400 K (data not shown).

DFT Results
Density functional theory calculations were carried out to study the trend in the binding energies of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. Figure 5 shows the binding energies of several species, methanol, methoxy, ethanol and ethoxy, on Pt(111), Ni(111), Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces [41, 54]. All species were adsorbed on an atop site through the oxygen atom. The results show that for each surface species a linear correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center was observed, consistent with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nrksov [58]. The binding energies increased as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level. The binding energies were highest on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, which exhibited the highest reforming yields based on TPD. Calculations on other 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces displayed a similar trend with the surface d-band center, with further increases in the oxygenate binding energy as the 3d metal moved left in the periodic table for the surface monolayer [54]. The binding energy of the molecular oxygenate species was low on all surfaces, between 3 and 12 kcal/mol. After removing the first hydrogen, the methoxy and ethoxy species adsorbed more strongly to the surface, with binding energies ranging from 30 to 55 kcal/mol. Overall, the size of the species had a relatively small effect on the binding energy, as the values for different molecular oxygenates and alkoxide species were similar. These results are in agreement with previous DFT studies of methanol and methoxy on Pt(111) [59, 60, 61] and Ni(111) [62, 63], and ethanol and ethoxy on Pt(111) [64].

Reforming Trends on 3d/Pt(111) Bimetallic Surfaces
The oxygenate reforming yield obtained experimentally was correlated with the surface d-band center as shown in Fig. 6 [42, 43, 54]. The reforming yields were based on the TPD results presented earlier in Sect. 3.1, along with similar TPD experiments using glycerol [43] on Ni/Pt(111), as well as ethanol and ethylene glycol [54] on Fe/Pt(111) and Ti/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces (data not shown). In general, the oxygenate reforming yield displayed a somewhat linear correlation, and increased as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level. The observed trend was the opposite of that observed for hydrogenation reactions on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, which displayed increased activity on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) surfaces [28, 3032, 40, 44, 46, 65]. Comparing the reforming yield on each of the surfaces, the trend was glycerol > ethylene glycol > ethanol. Comparing trends for a given 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic combination, the surface monolayer 3d-Pt-Pt(111) generated a higher reforming yield compared to the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111), using Ni, Fe [54], and Ti [54] as the 3d metal. For the surfaces studied experimentally, the highest reforming yield using ethylene glycol was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), while with ethanol it was on Fe-Pt-Pt(111). The trends observed on single crystal model surfaces have also been reported on supported catalysts as well, with Al2O3 supported NiPt, CoPt and FePt catalysts displaying increasing turnover frequencies compared to Pt/Al2O3 for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol [21].

The reforming selectivity of ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is compared in Fig. 7 [42, 54]. For ethanol and ethylene glycol the reforming selectivity remained high on all the surfaces (>80%), with a slight decreasing trend as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level. Glycerol displayed slightly lower reforming selectivities, and this is attributed to difficulty in preparing clean bimetallic surfaces when working with glycerol. Examining the selectivity on other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces (data not shown), ethylene glycol displayed high reforming selectivity on all the surfaces. However, differences were observed when using ethanol as the probe molecule. As the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Ti-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces, the reforming selectivity began to decrease significantly, and on the Ti-Pt-Pt(111) the reforming and total decomposition reactions occurred in equal amounts. This was most likely because on Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Ti-Pt-Pt(111) the oxygenates bonded very strongly, increasing the possibility of reacting through CO bond cleavage. This would suggest an optimal oxygenate binding energy is needed, consistent with Sabatiers principle, where lower binding energies lead to decreased reforming activity while higher binding energies lead to decreased reforming selectivity. More detailed discussion about Fe/Pt(111) and Ti/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces will be presented in an upcoming paper [54].

Stability of 3d-Pt-Pt(111) Surfaces
As shown by the activity/selectivity discussions of the preceding sections, the structural configurations of the bimetallic surfaces have a significant effect on their chemical properties. For reforming reactions, the surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration showed increased activity while the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure showed reduced activity in comparison to pure Pt(111). Hence, the stability of the 3d adlayers on the Pt surface is of importance in order to maintain the enhanced chemical properties for the reforming reactions of oxygenates. In the following section, the thermodynamic potential as well as the activation barrier for the segregation of the subsurface 3d admetal are discussed for the 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems. Crucial to this consideration is the fact that that the thermodynamically preferred bimetallic configuration is related to the binding strength of adsorbates present on the surface.
Beginning with an adsorbate-free surface, the surface compositions of many bimetallic systems have been studied in vacuum both experimentally and using density functional theory [34]. As shown by Ruban et al [66], there is a general trend for the thermodynamic potential for the interchange from the surface to subsurface configuration in vacuum. For example, for the 3d/Pt(111) systems, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are thermodynamically preferred over the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structure in vacuum. This trend has been verified experimentally for several 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems [29, 39, 46]. Although the subsurface configuration is thermodynamically preferred in vacuum, the surface configuration can be formed as a metastable state as discussed previously. This configuration is stable at room temperature due to the kinetic barrier of diffusion to form the subsurface structure.
Using density functional theory, the subsurface configuration is predicted to be preferred for 3d/Pt(111) systems with weak binding adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen [67]. For adsorbates such as atomic oxygen, which binds more strongly than hydrogen on many surfaces, the surface configuration can become thermodynamically preferred, as confirmed experimentally in Fig. 8. This figure displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface. The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen.

Similar predictions for other 3d/Pt(111) surfaces were obtained based on DFT calculations. These show that oxygen can overcome the potential in vacuum favoring the subsurface configuration. Figure 9 displays the thermodynamic potential for segregation with a coverage of 0.5 ML atomic O. For all the 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface is the preferred configuration under these conditions. Furthermore, the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. Along with the thermodynamic potential, the activation barrier for the segregation of 3d metal to the surface has been shown follow a similar trend with the surface d-band center. Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]. The remainder of the 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems are expected to follow this trend, and based on the shift in the d-band center the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

In summary, since the surface configuration has been shown to have increased activity for the reforming of oxygenate molecules, the retention of the 3d metal on the surface is crucial to maintain the increased activity. This can in principle be achieved by the presence of strongly adsorbed species, such as atomic oxygen or other oxygen-containing intermediates. More detailed DFT and experimental studies are needed to determine whether the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structures are preferred under reforming conditions.
Conclusions
Based on the results presented in this paper, the following conclusions about the reforming of oxygenates on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces can be drawn:
1)
The surface monolayer 3d-Pt-Pt(111) displays higher reforming activity than Pt(111), subsurface monolayer Pt-3d-Pt(111), and 3d(111) film surfaces.
2)
HREELS studies show that ethylene glycol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) through initial OH bond scission. After the initial dehydrogenation, on Pt(111) the adsorbate reacts through CC bond cleavage at 250 K, while on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) the CC bond is stable to over 300 K.
3)
The binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol and ethoxy display a linear trend with the surface d-band center, increasing as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The alkoxide binding energies are much greater than those of the molecular species, while the size of the species (methanol versus ethanol, and methoxy versus ethoxy) does not significantly affect the binding energies.
4)
The reforming yield obtained from TPD for ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol display an increasing trend as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The reforming selectivity remains high on all the surfaces when using ethylene glycol, however, for ethanol the selectivity decreases, especially on Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Ti-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces.
5)
The stability of the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface has been studied experimentally and computationally. Pt-Ni-Pt(111) is the thermodynamically stable configuration in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen. However, in the presence of strongly bonded adsorbates, such as atomic O, subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface, forming the desired Ni-Pt-Pt(111) structure with an activation barrier of 15 kcal/mol.
