          [1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."

[3] "Aqueous phase reforming [16–24] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200–250°C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

          Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, resulting in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels.

2. It can utilize a variety of oxygenate molecules generated from biomass as feedstocks, providing flexibility in raw material sourcing.

3. Multiple process options are available, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and aqueous phase reforming.

4. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, supporting clean energy applications.

The aqueous phase reforming process offers some particular advantages:

1. It operates in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize water and reactants.

2. It can use non-volatile oxygenates as feedstocks, expanding the range of potential biomass sources.

3. It operates at much lower temperatures (200-250°C) compared to steam or autothermal reforming, improving energy efficiency.

4. It produces hydrogen with low CO concentrations in a single reactor, simplifying the process.

5. It mainly generates CO2 and H2 as products, providing good product selectivity.

Key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include:

1. Improved environmental impact through lower CO2 emissions and use of renewable feedstocks.
2. More practical implementation through lower operating temperatures and simplified reactor designs.
3. Potential for distributed hydrogen production from locally available biomass resources.
4. Broader feedstock flexibility and potentially higher product yields due to the ability to use a wider range of biomass-derived feedstocks.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming offers a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, addressing both environmental concerns and practical implementation challenges associated with traditional reforming methods. However, the literature does not provide quantitative comparisons of product yields or detailed environmental impact assessments versus other approaches.

          选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学品生产做出了几个方面的贡献：

1. 它能够从可再生生物质衍生的原料中生产氢气，与使用化石燃料相比可以降低净CO2排放。

2. 它可以利用由生物质生成的各种含氧分子作为原料，提高了原材料采购的灵活性。

3. 有多种工艺选择，包括蒸汽重整、自热重整和水相重整。

4. 它可以为燃料电池生产氢气，支持清洁能源应用。

水相重整工艺具有一些特殊优势：

1. 它在液相中进行，无需汽化水和反应物。

2. 它可以使用非挥发性含氧化合物作为原料，扩大了潜在生物质来源的范围。

3. 与蒸汽重整或自热重整相比，它的操作温度要低得多（200-250°C），提高了能源效率。

4. 它在单一反应器中生产低CO浓度的氢气，简化了工艺流程。

5. 它主要生成CO2和H2作为产品，具有良好的产物选择性。

选择性含氧化合物重整的主要优势包括：

1. 通过降低CO2排放和使用可再生原料，改善了环境影响。
2. 通过降低操作温度和简化反应器设计，实现了更实用的实施。
3. 有潜力利用当地可获得的生物质资源进行分布式氢气生产。
4. 由于能够使用更广泛的生物质衍生原料，具有更广泛的原料灵活性和可能更高的产品收率。

总的来说，选择性含氧化合物重整为可持续氢气生产提供了一条有前途的路径，解决了与传统重整方法相关的环境问题和实际实施挑战。然而，文献中没有提供与其他方法相比的定量产品产率比较或详细的环境影响评估。
