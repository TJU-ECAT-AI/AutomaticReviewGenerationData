[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."
