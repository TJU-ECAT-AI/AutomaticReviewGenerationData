[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."

[3] "Aqueous phase reforming [16–24] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200–250°C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, resulting in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels.

2. It allows for the use of a variety of oxygenates as feedstocks, providing flexibility in raw material sourcing.

3. Processes like aqueous phase reforming operate at lower temperatures (200-250°C) compared to traditional methods, improving energy efficiency.

4. It produces hydrogen with low CO concentrations in a single reactor, simplifying the process.

5. For aqueous phase reforming, the ability to operate in the liquid phase eliminates the need to vaporize water and reactants, saving energy.

6. It enables the use of non-volatile oxygenates as feedstocks, expanding the range of potential biomass sources.

The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include:

1. Improved product yield and selectivity, especially on certain bimetallic catalysts.
2. Lower environmental impact due to the use of renewable feedstocks and reduced CO2 emissions.
3. More practical implementation through lower operating temperatures and simplified reactor designs.
4. Potential for distributed hydrogen production from locally available biomass resources.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming offers a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, addressing both environmental concerns and practical implementation challenges associated with traditional reforming methods.
