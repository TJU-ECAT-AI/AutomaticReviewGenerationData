[1] "The reforming of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces has attracted recent attention because of possible applications for hydrogen production for use in fuel cells. A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."

[2] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed. The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations [20] in a single reactor."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables hydrogen production from renewable biomass-derived feedstocks, resulting in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels.

2. It can produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, supporting clean energy applications.

3. The aqueous phase reforming process operates at much lower temperatures (200-250°C) than traditional methods, improving energy efficiency.

4. It produces hydrogen with low CO concentrations in a single reactor, simplifying the process.

5. It can use non-volatile oxygenates as feed and eliminates the need to vaporize water, increasing flexibility and efficiency.

6. The process generates mainly CO2 and H2, providing good product selectivity.

While the literature does not provide direct comparisons of product yields to traditional methods, the lower operating temperatures, simplified process, and ability to use renewable feedstocks suggest significant practical and environmental advantages over conventional reforming techniques.
