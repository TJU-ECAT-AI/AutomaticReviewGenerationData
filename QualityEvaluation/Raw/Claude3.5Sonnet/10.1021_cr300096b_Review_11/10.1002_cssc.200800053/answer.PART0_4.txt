[1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."

[2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."

[3] "Through aqueous phase reforming, the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."

[4] "Glycerol has attracted recent attention as a feed molecule for these processes and is particularly interesting because as a by-product of the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats its availability could potentially increase with the expected increase in biodiesel production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, helping to increase energy supply while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

2. It utilizes biomass, which is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, allowing for energy production without increasing CO2 emissions.

3. The process can yield H2 for use in fuel cells, offering a clean energy source.

4. It can produce H2/CO mixtures that can be used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to create liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure.

5. It can utilize by-products like glycerol from biodiesel production, creating value from waste streams.

Key advantages of this process include:

1. Product yield: It can produce valuable products like H2 and CO from biomass-derived oxygenates.

2. Environmental impact: Being carbon-neutral and utilizing renewable resources, it has a lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuel-based processes.

3. Practical implementation: The products can be used in existing infrastructure (for liquid alkanes) or in developing technologies (for H2 in fuel cells), making implementation more feasible.

4. Sustainability: It provides a renewable source of energy and chemicals, contributing to long-term sustainability goals.
