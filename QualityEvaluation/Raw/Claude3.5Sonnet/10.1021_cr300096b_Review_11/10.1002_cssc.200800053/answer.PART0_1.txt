[1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."

[2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."

[3] "Through aqueous phase reforming, the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."

[4] "Glycerol has attracted recent attention as a feed molecule for these processes and is particularly interesting because as a by-product of the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats its availability could potentially increase with the expected increase in biodiesel production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, helping to increase energy supply while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

2. It utilizes biomass, which is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, making important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions.

3. The process can produce H2 for use in fuel cells or H2/CO mixtures for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to create liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure.

4. It can use glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a feedstock, potentially increasing its utilization as biodiesel production grows.

Key advantages of this process include:

1. Product yield: The process can be tuned to produce desired H2/CO ratios for various applications.

2. Environmental impact: It utilizes renewable biomass and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel use.

3. Practical implementation: The products (H2, CO, or liquid alkanes) are compatible with existing fuel cell technology or petroleum infrastructure, facilitating adoption.
