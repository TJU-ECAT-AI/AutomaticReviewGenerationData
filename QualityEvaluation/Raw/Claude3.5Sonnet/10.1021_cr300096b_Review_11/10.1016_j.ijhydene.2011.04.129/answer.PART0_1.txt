[1] "ATR is also advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions [2]."

[2] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]."

[3] "Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owingto theneed toreduce greenhousegas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[4] "Synthesis gas can be used in the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels by e.g. FischereTropsch synthesis [5,6] or as fuel for FCs."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier that can be used in fuel cells for efficient electricity generation.

2. It uses ethanol as a feedstock, which has several advantages: it is renewable (especially bio-ethanol), biodegradable, has low toxicity, low production costs, and high hydrogen content.

3. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable ethanol.

4. The process produces synthesis gas, which can be used to make high-quality, ultra-clean chemicals and fuels through processes like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

5. ATR inhibits the formation of carbonaceous deposits due to the presence of oxidation reactions, which improves the longevity and efficiency of the catalysts.

Compared to traditional methods, ATR of ethanol offers advantages in terms of product yield (high hydrogen production), environmental impact (use of renewable feedstock, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions), and practical implementation (ethanol is easy to handle, transport, and store, and is free from catalyst poisons like sulfur).

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇的自热重整（ATR），通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它生产氢气，这是一种清洁的能源载体，可用于燃料电池中进行高效发电。

2. 它使用乙醇作为原料，具有多项优势：可再生（尤其是生物乙醇），可生物降解，低毒性，生产成本低，氢含量高。

3. 通过用可再生乙醇替代化石燃料，有助于减少温室气体排放。

4. 该过程产生合成气，可通过费托合成等工艺用于生产高质量、超清洁的化学品和燃料。

5. 由于存在氧化反应，ATR抑制碳质沉积物的形成，从而提高催化剂的寿命和效率。

与传统方法相比，乙醇ATR在产品产率（高氢气产量）、环境影响（使用可再生原料，减少温室气体排放）和实际应用（乙醇易于处理、运输和储存，且不含硫等催化剂毒物）方面具有优势。
