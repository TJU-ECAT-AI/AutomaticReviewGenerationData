[1] "H2 production technologies have been investigated intensively in recent decades with the aim of utilizing H2-rich gases as fuel for fuel cell (FC) systems. FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions [1]."

[2] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]. Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[3] "ATR is also advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions [2]."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen-rich gases that can be used as fuel for fuel cell systems, potentially doubling the efficiency of electric power generation compared to conventional engines while reducing CO2 emissions.

2. Using ethanol as a feedstock has numerous advantages: it has low toxicity, low production costs, high hydrogen content, is biodegradable, relatively clean, readily available, easy to handle, and free from catalyst poisons like sulfur.

3. Bio-ethanol in particular helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replaces fossil fuels with a renewable alternative.

4. The ATR process inhibits the formation of carbonaceous deposits due to the presence of oxidation reactions, which is an advantage over other reforming methods.

These factors make selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ATR of ethanol, an attractive option for sustainable energy and chemical production. It offers improved efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and practical benefits in terms of feedstock handling and catalyst longevity compared to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇的自热重整(ATR)，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它产生富氢气体，可用作燃料电池系统的燃料，与传统发动机相比，有可能将发电效率提高一倍，同时减少二氧化碳排放。

2. 使用乙醇作为原料有许多优势：毒性低、生产成本低、氢含量高、可生物降解、相对清洁、易于获得、易于处理，且不含硫等催化剂毒物。

3. 特别是生物乙醇有助于减少温室气体排放，并用可再生替代品取代化石燃料。

4. 由于存在氧化反应，ATR过程抑制了碳质沉积物的形成，这是相对于其他重整方法的一个优势。

这些因素使选择性含氧化合物重整，尤其是乙醇的ATR，成为可持续能源和化学品生产的一个有吸引力的选择。与传统方法相比，它在效率、环境影响和原料处理及催化剂寿命等实际方面提供了改进。
