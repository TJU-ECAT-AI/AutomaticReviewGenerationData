[1] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]."

[2] "Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[3] "Autothermal reforming of ethanol on zirconia-supported Rh and Pt mono- and bimetallic catalysts (0.5 wt-% total metal loading) was studied as a source of H2-rich gas for fuel cells."

[4] "The Rh-containing catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity for H2 production and were stable in 24 h experiments. The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen-rich gas for fuel cells, which can generate electricity more efficiently than conventional engines while reducing CO2 emissions.

2. It utilizes bio-ethanol, a renewable fuel source that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.

3. Ethanol as a feedstock has several advantages: low toxicity, low production costs, high hydrogen content, biodegradability, and ease of handling and storage.

4. The process is free from catalyst poisons like sulfur, which can be present in other feedstocks.

Key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation include:

1. Higher selectivity for hydrogen production, especially with Rh-containing catalysts.

2. Improved stability, with Rh-containing catalysts showing stable performance in 24-hour experiments.

3. Lower formation of carbonaceous deposits compared to traditional Ni-based catalysts, which improves catalyst longevity and reduces waste.

4. The ability to use low metal loadings (0.5 wt-%) of noble metals like Rh and Pt, which can help offset their higher cost compared to traditional catalysts.

5. The potential for thermally sustained operation and optimized hydrogen production through the combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation in ATR.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient route to hydrogen production compared to traditional methods, with improved catalyst performance and the use of renewable feedstocks.
