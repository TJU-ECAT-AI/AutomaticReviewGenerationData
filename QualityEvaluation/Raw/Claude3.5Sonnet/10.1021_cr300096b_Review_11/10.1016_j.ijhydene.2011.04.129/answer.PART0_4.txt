[1] "H2 production technologies have been investigated intensively in recent decades with the aim of utilizing H2-rich gases as fuel for fuel cell (FC) systems. FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions [1]."

[2] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]. Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[3] "ATR is also advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions [2]."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen-rich gases that can be used as fuel for fuel cell systems, potentially doubling the efficiency of electric power generation compared to conventional engines while reducing CO2 emissions.

2. Ethanol is an attractive feedstock for hydrogen production due to its low toxicity, low production costs, high hydrogen content, biodegradability, and ease of handling and storage. Bio-ethanol in particular helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable alternatives.

3. The ATR process has the advantage of inhibiting carbonaceous deposits through oxidation reactions, which improves catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

Key advantages of this process include:

1. Higher product yield: The process can produce hydrogen-rich gases efficiently.
2. Reduced environmental impact: It enables the use of renewable bio-ethanol and reduces CO2 emissions.
3. Practical implementation: Ethanol is readily available, easy to handle, and free from catalyst poisons like sulfur, making the process more practical to implement compared to some traditional methods.
