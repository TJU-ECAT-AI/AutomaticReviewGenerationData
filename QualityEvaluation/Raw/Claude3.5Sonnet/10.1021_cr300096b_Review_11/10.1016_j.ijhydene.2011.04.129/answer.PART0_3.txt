[1] "H2 production technologies have been investigated intensively in recent decades with the aim of utilizing H2-rich gases as fuel for fuel cell (FC) systems. FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions [1]."

[2] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content. It is biodegradable, a relatively clean fuel in terms of composition, readily available, and easy to handle, transport, and store. It is also free from catalyst poisons such as sulfur [3,4]. Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."

[3] "ATR is also advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions [2]."

[4] "The Rh-containing catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity for H2 production and were stable in 24 h experiments. The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen-rich gases that can be used as fuel for fuel cell systems, potentially doubling the efficiency of electric power generation compared to conventional engines while reducing CO2 emissions.

2. Using ethanol as a feedstock is advantageous due to its low toxicity, low production costs, high hydrogen content, biodegradability, and ease of handling. Bio-ethanol in particular helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewables.

3. The ATR process inhibits the formation of carbonaceous deposits due to the presence of oxidation reactions, improving catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

4. Noble metal catalysts, especially those containing rhodium, show high selectivity for hydrogen production, good stability, and lower carbonaceous deposit formation compared to traditional nickel-based catalysts.

These advantages in terms of product yield (high hydrogen selectivity), environmental impact (reduced CO2 emissions, use of renewable feedstocks), and practical implementation (improved catalyst stability, reduced coking) make selective oxygenate reforming a promising technology for sustainable energy and chemical production compared to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇的自热重整（ATR），通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它生产富含氢气的气体，可用作燃料电池系统的燃料，与传统发动机相比，有潜力将发电效率提高一倍，同时减少二氧化碳排放。

2. 使用乙醇作为原料具有诸多优势，如低毒性、低生产成本、高含氢量、可生物降解性以及易于处理。特别是生物乙醇有助于减少温室气体排放，并用可再生能源替代化石燃料。

3. ATR过程由于存在氧化反应，抑制了碳质沉积物的形成，提高了催化剂寿命和过程效率。

4. 贵金属催化剂，尤其是含铑的催化剂，表现出高的氢气选择性、良好的稳定性，以及与传统镍基催化剂相比更低的碳质沉积物形成。

这些在产品产率（高氢气选择性）、环境影响（减少二氧化碳排放，使用可再生原料）和实际应用（改善催化剂稳定性，减少结焦）方面的优势，使选择性含氧化合物重整成为与传统方法相比更有前景的可持续能源和化学品生产技术。
