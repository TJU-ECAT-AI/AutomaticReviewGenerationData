The kinetics and mechanism of the decomposition of methanol (CH3OD) on oxygen-covered 
Pt(lll) were studied using static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and temperature 
programmed desorption (TPD). The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer 
coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively. The maximum amounts decomposed in 
TPD on O/Pt(lll) and clean Pt(lll) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. At low methanol 
coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(lll) the only reaction products were CO2, H20 and D20, 
whereas at saturation CO, H20, D20 and H 2 were observed. The decomposed amount did not 
saturate at or before the onset of molecular methanol desorption, but increased monotonically 
until saturation of the first layer. No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and 
preadsorbed 180. A decomposition mechanism involving methoxy and a hydroxyl type species is 
proposed. Methanol coverages as low as 0.002 ML could be detected with SIMS. The CH- ion 
was the most intense ion in the positive SIMS spectrum of both methanol and methoxy. Larger ion 
clusters such as (CH3OD) + (n = 2, 3) developed successively at specific multilayer coverages. At 
low coverages on O/Pt(lll), methoxy formation occurs above 125 K and its decomposition 
becomes detectable above 150 K during temperature programming. In the isothermal mode, the 
SIMS CH- ion was used to follow the kinetics. Over the temperature range 120-145 K, the 
second order Arrhenius rate parameters for methoxy formation are E = 5.5 +-0.7 kcal/mol and 
A = 1.5 X 10- 7  0.6 cm2/s" molecule for an initial methanol coverage of 0.05 ML. Methoxy decom- 
position was studied in the temperature range 150-165 K and at an initial coverage of 0.015 ML. 
The first order kinetic parameters, E=11.4+0.5 kcal/mol and A=5.3X10131 s -1 were 
derived. Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed. 
I. Introduction 
Methanol decomposition has been studied on a number of metallic surfaces 
[1-13,29] including clean and oxygenated Pt(111) [14-16]. The motivation of 
many of these studies was to explore the stability and reactivity of the methoxy 
intermediate and its relevance to catalysis of methanol synthesis and conver- 
sion. A common observation in many of these studies was that the formation 
and decomposition of methoxy occurred at low temperatures (usually below

300 K) such that no reaction limited product desorbed during either process. 
Hence, using TPD techniques, it was not possible either to locate the tempera- 
ture regimes of formation and decomposition or to study their respective 
kinetics. Exceptions include methoxy decomposition on oxygenated Cu(ll0) 
[2] and Ag(ll0) [1] where decomposition is accompanied by desorption of 
reaction limited products. For these cases, kinetic parameters have been 
evaluated from TPD experiments. Use of spectroscopic techniques like 
HREELS [10,14,30] and XPS/UPS [3,4] have helped in identifying the reac- 
tion intermediate, the reaction mechanism and the temperature regions in 
which formation and decomposition occur. The limited time resolution of these 
techniques has precluded detailed kinetic studies. 
SIMS provides information about changes in the adsorbed layer whereas, by 
comparison, TPD detects only desorption into the gas phase. The methods are 
complementary and, used together, provide a more complete picture [19,20]. 
Static SIMS has the capabilities of very high detection sensitivity and data can 
be collected rapidly [17,18]. These capabilities make it a good tool for kinetic 
measurements; particularly in cases such as methanol decomposition at low 
temperatures, where the products remain adsorbed during decomposition. Its 
applicability to kinetic studies has been previously demonstrated for several 
reactions on Pt(111): O(a) + H 2 [19], OH(a) + H 2 [24], HzO(a 
) + O(a) [21,22], 
ethylidyne and propylidyne formation and decomposition [23] and H-D 
exchange in alkylidyne overlayers [25]. 
There were two primary objectives of this work: first, to obtain rate 
parameters for the formation and decomposition of a catalytically important 
intermediate and, second, to further assess the applicability of SIMS as a tool 
for kinetic studies. As a prerequisite for the second objective, we chose a 
system for which rate parameters were not available through other techniques. 
Methanol decomposition on O/Pt(lll) is a good candidate [14] which has 
been studied by HREELS [14] and TPD [15,16]. These studies show that a 
saturation coverage of methoxy is stable below 170 K and decomposes to 
CO + H above that temperature. CO and H 2 then appear as desorption limited 
products above 300 K. However, no rate parameters have been measured. 
In this study, positive SIMS has been used both in temperature programmed 
(TPSIMS) and isothermal modes. The isothermal mode has been used to 
gather rate data from which initial reaction rates and Arrhenius rate parame- 
ters have been derived. 
2. Experimental 
The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber pumped 
by a 450 l/s turbomolecular pump. A base pressure of (2 4) x 10 10 Tort was 
routinely obtained. The chamber was equipped with a double pass CMA for 
S. Akhter, J.M. White / Methoxy on O/Pt(lll) 
103 
AES and a secondary ion quadrupole mass spectrometer for SIMS, TPD and 
RGA measurements. 
The Pt(lll) sample could be cooled to 100 K with liquid N 2 and heated 
resistively to 1400 K. Two chromel-alumel thermocouples were spotwelded at 
different positions on the back of the crystal and their readings agreed to 
within 0.01 mV. Methanol exposures were done at 100-120 K through a glass 
multichannel doser and were calibrated against dosing by backfilling. All 
exposures have been corrected for ion gauge sensitivity factors. 
All TPD experiments were done at heating rates of either 1.1 or 5.5 K/s as 
indicated in the figures. All temperature programmed SIMS experiments were 
done at a heating rate of 1.1 K/s. 
SIMS and TPD spectra were taken with the sample surface in line-of-sight 
with the quadrupole. The ion intensities are reported as recorded and have not 
been corrected for quadrupole transmission efficiency. The Ar + ion beam (600 
eV, < 3.0 nA) was rastered across the sample. Under these conditions the loss 
of adsorbates due to sputtering during SIMS measurements was very slow but 
was taken into account (see below). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. TPD study 
CH3OD decomposition on O/Pt(lll) was studied over a coverage range of 
0.015 ML to multilayers. Initially, a (2 × 2)O/Pt(111) surface was prepared by 
adsorbing about 10 L 02 at 110-120 K followed by a brief flash to 250 K to 
remove molecular oxygen. This procedure results in a surface atomic O 
coverage of 0.25 ML [26]. One ML is taken to be the Pt(lll) surface atomic 
density (15.2 × 1014/cm2). With this definition, the first layer of methanol is 
complete at 0.36 ML (see below). 
The product distribution for an initial methanol (CH3OD) coverage of 0.044 
ML is shown in fig. 1. The only desorbing products observed were CO 
2 
(320-330 K), H20, HDO (not shown), D20 (195 K) and 02 (650-800 K). No 
CO, H2, HD or D 2 were detected. In order to confirm the origin of the CO 
2 
peak as being due to oxidation of CO after its formation on the surface, a 
small amount of preadsorbed CO was oxidized in excess 02. The resulting CO 
2 
peak temperature (320-330 K) was coincident with that from CH3OD decom- 
position. No molecular methanol desorbed below an initial coverage of 0.05 
ML. 
At higher coverages, molecular methanol (195 K), CO (460 K) and H 2 (350 
K) were observed in desorption. Increased CO formation was accompanied by 
decreased CO 
2. This trend continued until at first layer saturation, no CO 2 
desorbed. The product distribution for a coverage slightly above saturation of

the first layer of CH3OD is shown in fig. 2. Note the presence of a small 
multilayer CHOD peak (this peak appeared for all exposures above 1.40 L). 
The presence of H20 has mechanistic implications because it signifies that not 
all O is initially titrated by the D(a), even though excess molecular methanol is 
available. The initial titration step can be represented by the equation: 
CH3OD + O = CH30 + OD. 
(1) 
This provides a mechanism by which substantial amounts of oxygen may be 
left untitrated by CH3OD because the subsequent recombination of deuteroxyl 
groups recycles atomic oxygen: 
OD + OD = 
D20 + O. 
This released oxygen is then available for reaction with H, generated from 
CH30 dissociation, to produce H20. The TPSIMS data, discussed later, are 
also consistent with this reaction. 
The two insets in fig. 2 show the TPD profiles for CH1OD and C=sO for a 
monolayer of CH3OD on 0.25 ML sO/Pt(lll). It is evident that negligible 
exchange occurs with molecular CH3OD. A small amount of ClSO ( - 5 10% 
of CO) appears in the product CO. In part, this is probably due to exchange at

tainty, we conclude that little oxygen exchange takes place between methanol 
(or methoxy) and preadsorbed lSO. 
Before proceeding further, the methods of calculating the coverages of 
various reactant and product molecules is described. The O(a) coverages were 
easily obtained from the O 2 TPD areas knowing the area corresponding to 0.25 
ML of O(a). The water TPD areas were calibrated by normalizing to the area 
corresponding to 0.25 ML of water prepared by titrating a layer of 0.25 ML 
O(a) with 2 × 10 - Torr of H 2 at 135 K [19]. The same calibration was used 
for D20 (i.e., small differences in mass spectrometer sensitivity and pumping 
speed are neglected). The H 2, CO and CO 2 TPD areas were calibrated against 
water TPD in the following manner. At low coverages (below 0.05 ML) all 
methanol decomposed to CO 
2 and water (fig. 1): 
2 CH3OD + 80 ---, 2 CO 
2 + 3 H20 + D20. 
The CO 2 and water TPD areas from the above reaction will correspond to a 
stoichiometry of 1:2. Since the water area can be calibrated as above, this 
reaction provides a means of calibrating the CO 
2 areas. The calibration of the

CO area was obtained by oxidizing a known peak area (amount) of CO to 
CO 2. The H 2 areas were calibrated against CO through the reaction: 
CHOH  CO + 2 H 2, 
which takes place on clean Pt(111). The CO area was calibrated against CO:, 
which in turn has been calibrated against water. 
Calibrating the CHBOD peak areas was more difficult since the methanol 
area could not be related to the area for any of the above molecules. 
Fortunately, the sticking coefficient, S, of methanol was unity (discussed 
below) for all exposures. The amount of methanol adsorbed was, thus, esti- 
mated from the exposure (using S = 1.0). The amount of methanol decom- 
posed was determined from the amount of water (or CO,, CO) desorbed. The 
amount of molecular methanol desorbed was obtained from the difference 
between the amount adsorbed and the amount decomposed. No direct use was 
made of the CH3OD peak areas. 
Using the above calibration method, all peak areas were converted into 
coverages expressed in monolayers (ME) and concentrations (molecules/cm:). 
The estimated error in these calculations is _+ 10%. The various coverages are 
plotted in figs. 3 and 4 as functions of CH)OD exposure. At coverages below 
0.05 ML all adsorbed methanol decomposes and the sticking coefficient is 
unity (fig. 4). At lower coverages, CO, is the principal carbon-containing 
product, but when the first layer saturates, CO is the only reaction product 
containing carbon. The CO: is produced by oxidation of CO after the latter

forms. The decomposed amount (fig. 4) increases monotonically even for 
coverages above the onset of molecular methanol desorption. 
CH3OD was also studied on clean Pt(lll) in order to compare the maxi- 
mum amount decomposed relative to that on O/Pt(lll). Fig. 5 shows the H 2 
and CO peaks resulting from saturation coverages on both surfaces. From the 
CO peak areas it is estimated that the amount decomposed on O/Pt(lll) 
is 
four times that on clean Pt(lll). First layer saturation on both surfaces 
required an identical exposure of = 1.43 L. 
The amount of methanol decomposed at saturation of the first layer on 
O/Pt(lll) 
is 0.19 ML based on the amount of D20 product (figs. 3 and 4). 
The maximum amount decomposed on the clean surface is 0.047 ML. The 
greater extent of decomposition on O/Pt(111) reflects the importance of O(a) 
in activating O-H bond cleavage in methanol. The total amount of methanol 
adsorbed on the oxygenated surface at first layer saturation was estimated 
using two methods: (1) Assuming the sticking coefficient is unity up to 
saturation (1.43 L), 0.36 ML is adsorbed. (2) Identical exposures (1.43 L) were 
required to reach monolayer saturation on both clean and oxygenated surfaces. 
Assuming that the first layer coverage is identical on both surfaces (without 
any assumption about sticking coefficient), then 
cA + 0.047 = cA 2 -I- 0.19 
or 
c= 0.143/AA, 
where A = methanol peak area from clean Pt(lll), A 2 = methanol peak area 
from O/Pt(lll), 
c = proportionality constant and AA = A 1 -A 2. The total

amount of methanol adsorbed in a monolayer on O/Pt(111) is then equal to 
(0.19+0.143Az/zA) ML. Using experimental values of AA and A 2, the 
saturation first layer coverage is 0.36 ML. Thus, both methods give the same 
result. From the above discussion, we conclude that the sticking coefficient of 
methanol is unity throughout the coverage range and the saturation first layer 
coverage is 0.36 ML on both the clean and oxygenated surfaces. Saturation 
first layer coverages of = 0.45 ML on clean Pd(100) [33,34] and Rh(111) [29] 
and about 0.16 ME on Ni(100) [35] have been reported. 
For any initial methanol coverage greater than saturation of the first layer, 
0.25 ME of O(a) is consumed by 0.19 ML of methanol (figs. 3 and 4), i.e., 
about 1.30 atoms are titrated by each reacted methanol molecule. This result 
agrees with that reported by Sexton et al. [15].

below the detectability limits of AES. In frame c, the initial methanol layer (of 
frame b) was briefly annealed to 170 K to convert it to methoxy (and recooled 
to 120 K for SIMS). The choice of temperature required to make methoxy was 
based on the temperature programmed SIMS results discussed later (fig. 10), 
and is in agreement with a HREELS study, by Sexton [14]. By comparing the 
SIMS spectrum of methanol (frame b) and methoxy (frame c), it is apparent 
1 t0 
S. Akhter, J.M. White / Methoxy on O/Pt(lll) 
that conversion to methoxy leads to no new ions. The CH3OHD  and 
CHOD 
+ ions are of the same type as H(H20), 
+ that are observed in the 
SIMS spectrum of hydrogen bonded ice [27]. The presence of the (CH3OD)D + 
ion suggests hydrogen bonding between methanol molecules. The absolute 
intensity of the CH3 
O+ ion decreases upon methoxy formation but its relative 
intensity increases sharply. The CH3OD 
 (m/e = 35) and. CH3OHD + (m/e 
= 34) ions disappear completely on methoxy formation (compare frames b and 
c), which is consistent with their origin being attributed to H-bonded methanol 
molecules. At low temperatures, H-bonding is a general observation [3,11,14]. 
The assignment of ion formulas was confirmed by experiments using 
CD3OH, in which corresponding deuterated ions were observed. 
3.2.2. Changes in ion yields as a function of CH+OD exposure at 120 K 
Changes in the SIMS ion yields as a function of methanol coverage were 
investigated on both clean Pt(111) and O/Pt(lll). The nature of the ions and 
the changes in ion yield are similar on both surfaces except for differences in

assignment was possible. Fig. 8 shows the variation in yield of different ions as 
function of CH3OD exposure. The onset of higher clusters coincides with the 
onset of particular multilayers. For example, the C- clusters begin appearing 
with the onset of the second layer and dominate until the completion of the 
third layer. The C clusters pick up in intensity with the onset of the fourth

assumption that the coverage in each layer is identical to that in the first layer 
(0.36 ML) and that each layer is completed before the beginning of the next. It 
is difficult to decide whether the presence of higher clusters represents cluster- 
ing or is simply a consequence of mu!tilayer formation without clustering. The 
presence of larger clusters in the NH3/Ni(100 ) system has been correlated with 
the clustering of NH 3 molecules in the submonolayer regime [28]. Whatever

the case for methanol, the intensity of larger clusters does correlate with 
multilayer formation. Just as on O/Pt(lll), larger ion clusters were observed 
on clean Pt(lll) after completion of the first layer of methanol. 
The behavior of the C- ions is interesting in that they go through a 
maximum as the methanol exposure is increased. The decline in C- yield 
above 3 L exposure is coupled with sharp increases first in C and then in C 
yields (compare figs. 8a, 8b and 8c). We have noted similar behavior for water 
on Pt(lll). In an IR reflection study of methanol on clean Pt(lll), Ehlers et al. 
[31] have provided evidence for an amorphous layer of methanol on top of the

chemisorbed layer, followed by the a-form of multilayer ice at 125 K. It is 
quite likely that the decline in the C yield above 2-3 layers is linked to the 
amorphous  a ice transition at the onset of the third layer. 
The Si +, Ca + and Mg + impurity ions declined monotonically in intensity as 
the methanol coverage increased (fig. 9). In contrast, the A1 + and K + ion 
intensities passed through a maximum and closely followed the behavior of the 
C ions (fig. 8a). This suggests that the A1 and K impurities are intimately 
associated with the methanol adlayer, possibly in the form of corresponding 
methoxides. It is important to note that these impurity concentrations were 
below AES detection limits and did not significantly influence the intrinsic 
behavior of Pt. 
3.3. Temperature 
programmed SIMS (TPS1MS) studies 
Various SIMS ions were followed as the temperature was ramped at a rate 
of 1.1 K/s. Fig. 10 shows the profiles for the CH, H3 
O+ and D3 
O+ ions 
when 0.044 ML CH3OD at 100 K was temperature programmed. The H3 
O+ 
(D3 
O+) signal is from either H20 (D2 
O) or OH (OD) [19-22]. The CHf signal 
shows two distinct regions. It starts declining above 125 K and is accompanied 
by a rise in the D3 
O+ signal. In this temperature range methoxy forms: 
CH3OD + O --* CH30 + OD. 
The CHf signal will decline with the formation of methoxy because the CH 
yield from methoxy is smaller than that from methanol (section 3.2.1, fig. 6). 
Around 155 K, the H3 
O+ signal begins to rise, marking the onset of methoxy 
decomposition: 
CH30CO+3H, 
H+OOH 
or 
2H+OH20. 
The subsequent decline of the H3 
O+ and D3 
O+ signals is caused by the 
desorption of water, as observed in TPD. The H30 + signal from H20 is very 
intense, whereas that ,"r,m 
OH species is about ten times weaker [19-22]. This 
suggests that the weak H3 
O+ and D3 
O+ signals observed during methoxy 
formation and decomposition are due to hydroxyl. Formation, decomposition 
and desorption of these species are consistent with the TPD behavior as 
discussed in section 3.1. 
The reason for the peak in the CH profile at  180 K is not clear, 
particularly since the methoxy is decomposing in this temperature range (as 
evidenced by the H30 + signal). One possibility is that the CH_ yield changes 
when water desorbs (= 180 K). Another possibility may be the formation of 
metastable species like CH20 and CHO, which locally increase the CHf yield. 
The local maximum was not present for methanol coverages below 0.015 ML 
(fig. 11). 
Other ions including CH3 
O+, CH3OD +, CH2 
O+ and CHO + were also 
followed in TPSIMS and all behaved like the CHf ion. 
S. Akhter, J.M. White / Methoxy on O/Pt(lll) 
117 
Based on the TPD and TPSIMS results, the following decomposition 
mechanism on O/Pt(lll) is postulated: 
CH3OD(a ) + O(a)  cn30(a ) + OD(a), 
above 125 K; 
(1) 
CH30(a ) 
- CO(a) + 3 H(a), 
above 150 K; 
(2) 
OD(a) + OD(a) 
--, O(a) + D20(g ), 
above 170 K; 
(3)

Tp = 460 K; 
(5) 
2 H(a) 
 H2(g), 
Tp = 350 K; 
(6) 
CO(a) + O(a) 
 CO2(g), 
rp = 320-330 K. 
(7) 
An alternative for step (1) was proposed by Sexton [14] for methanol decom- 
position on O/Pt(lll): 
2 CH3OH(a 
) + O(a)  2 CHsO(a ) + H20(a ), 
(8) 
although losses for neither H20(a ) nor OH(a) were observed in the HREELS 
spectrum. This alternative step has also been suggested for methanol decom- 
position on Cu(ll0) [2], Ag(ll0) [1] and Pd(lll) Ill] surfaces. The evidence for 
H20(a 
) formation on Cu(ll0) [2] and Cu(100) [30] was obtained by TPD and 
is convincing though no spectroscopic data are available. On Ag(ll0) [1] the 
TPD results are more complicated. On Pd(lll) [11] and Pt(lll) [14], attempts 
to observe H20(a 
) and OH(a) by HREELS were unsuccessful and attributed to 
interference and resolution problems. For water formation and decomposition 
on oxygen-covered Pt(lll), Mitchell et al. [24] and Creighton and White 
[21,22] have presented arguments that simple hydroxyl species may not be 
formed, but rather an intermediate of stoichiometry, 
2 H20 + O --* I. 
(9) 
The absence of OH vibrations in HREELS for CH3OH reactions may be the 
result of a similar process. 
From the above discussion it is clear than an apparent difference exists 
between Cu(ll0) and Pt(lll) for the initial reaction step leading to HzO(a 
) or 
I formation. This difference is readily explained by the above water decom- 
position reaction (9). This reaction is rapid in the temperature range of 
methoxy formation (> 125 K) and is characterized by kinetic parameters, 
A = 6.9 x 10 -1 +14 cm2/s" molecule and E = 10.2 _+ 0.8 kcal/mol [22]. Thus, 
the initial interaction on Cu(100) and Cu(110) is given by reaction (8), leading 
to the formation of H20(a). But on Pt(111), any H20(a 
) immediately re- 
arranges to a hydroxyl-like intermediate I (reaction (9)), such that the overall 
reaction would be 
2 CH3OD(a ) + O(a) ---, 2 CH30(a ) + I'(a). 
The kinetics and stoichiometry of the water decomposition reaction (9) on 
Cu(ll0) are not known. A slow kinetics or the immediate desorption of H20(a

would explain the absence of this reaction on Cu(110). On Pd(100) [36,37] 
there is evidence that the H20 q- O reaction takes place rapidly below 170 K. 
Thus, methanol decomposition on O/Pd(100) would be expected to be similar 
to that on O/Pt(lll), as observed on Pd(lll) [11].

of 0.05 ML. Below this coverage the CH- yields vary linearly with methanol 
(fig. 8a) and methoxy (fig. 14) coverages. Furthermore, no methanol is left 
undecomposed when methoxy is formed (fig. 3).

decay of the CH signal was continuously monitored as shown in fig. 12. (The 
thermocouple output is included for the 141.5 K run and shows that the 
approach to the preset temperature is rapid enough for most runs except for 
T> 135 K.) For temperatures greater than 135 K, the maximum amount of 
methanol that reacts before the temperature stabilizes is about 0.012 ML 
(nearly 30% of the initially adsorbed amount). The error introduced into the 
temperature dependence was not appreciable (fig. 13).

gives an activation energy of 5.5 + 0.7 kcal/mol for methoxy formation. To 
determine the preexponential, a second order rate expression of the type 
R = k(CH3OD)(O ) was assumed on the basis that the order of a closely related 
reaction, that of water with oxygen, is best described as second order [22]. The 
calculated value of the pre-exponential was A=1.5×10 -76 cmZ/s - 
molecule. If the reaction is assumed to be pseudo first order, the pre-exponen- 
tial value becomes A = 107 s -. Similar data for methoxy formation on 
oxygenated surfaces is not available for comparison. However, recently Hall et 
al. [32] have studied laser induced decomposition of CH3OD on clean Ni(100) 
and have evaluated first order parameters for methoxy formation as E = 8.4 
kcal/mol and A = 4 × 108 s - at an initial methanol coverage of 0.14 ML. 
The low value of the preexponential (= 10 3 expected for ideal second order 
reaction, but several orders of magnitude variation have been observed experi- 
mentally [13]) in our study may arise for several reasons. The effective reaction 
order may be less than two because of the immobility of oxygen at low 
temperatures and any non-uniform distribution (islanding) of reactants. Also, 
following the arguments of Hall et al. [32], the reaction proceeds from an initial 
mobile reactant (CH3OD) state to an immobile (methoxy-like) transition state. 
The resulting loss of translational degrees of freedom will constitute a large 
entropy barrier, resulting in low values of the pree×ponential. 
We attempted to fit the whole reaction rate curve (fig. 12) using the initial 
calculated values of A and E and a simple expression for the rate constant, 
k=A e -e/T. 
The agreement between the calculated profile and the experimental curve was 
good only for short reaction times. At longer reaction times, the experimental 
rate was slower than that predicted by the above expression. Hall et al. [32] 
observed similar behavior on Ni(100) and were able to fit the rate data using a 
coverage dependent activation barrier. 
k = A e -(E+OEp)/RT, 
where Ep is a constant. 
3.4.2. Kinetics of methoxy decomposition: CHO = CO + 3H 
The kinetics of methoxy decomposition on O/Pt(lll) were studied at a 
methoxy coverage of 0.015 ML. It was possible to conduct kinetic experiments 
at such low coverage because, under the present experimental conditions, 
SIMS was capable of detecting coverages down to 0.002 ML. The methoxy 
adlayer was prepared by annealing a layer (0.015 ML) of methanol on 
O/Pt(lll) 
at 147 K for 300 s. This procedure resulted in the complete 
conversion of methanol to methoxy, as judged by the saturation of the D3 
O+ 
signal which accompanies methoxy formation. The completeness of the conver- 
sion was checked by using higher initial methanol coverages, in which case the

D30 + and H30 + signals were more intense and could be easily followed. The 
loss of methoxy due to its decomposition during the above preparation 
procedure is very small (the rate of methoxy decomposition at 147 K is 
7 × 10 -6 ML/s, fig. 16). 
The linearity of the CH signal (from methoxy) with methoxy coverage (at 
and below 0.015 ML) was established (fig. 14) by measuring (1) the CH yield 
from a methoxy layer (prepared as above) and (2) the total CO 
2 desorbed upon 
decomposition. Under the present experimental conditions, the noise level in 
fig. 14 was about 50 counts/s- nA which gives a SIMS detectability limit of 
0.002 ML of methoxy. The methoxy coverages in this region are determined to 
within +0.001 ML. This is achieved because of the excellent mass analyzer 
sensitivity for CH and for CO 
2 in TPD (note the relative scales in fig. 1). 
Fig. 15 shows the isothermal CH3 
 decay profiles for methoxy decomposi- 
tion. The sample temperature was rapidly ramped to preset temperatures 
between 151 to 165 K and the CH signal was continuously recorded. The 
approach to preset temperatures was quite rapid compared to reaction, except 
at the highest temperatures employed. 
At the Ar + beam current (2.7 nA) used in these experiments, the maximum 
rate of adsorbate loss due to sputtering was 3 X 10 6 ML/s and was taken 
into account in calculating rates.

higher activation energy on Cu(ll0) is consistent with the high stability of 
methoxy on that surface (decomposition peak T = 365 K compared to 170-190 
K on Pt(lll)). 
In concluding this section, a few comments on the use of SIMS are 
appropriate. The kinetics were studied in the low coverage regime where the 
SIMS yields was proportional to adsorbate coverage and insensitive to matrix 
composition variations. The sensitivity of the ion yield to matrix composition 
[17,18] is a major obstacle to the use of SIMS as a kinetic tool. This is 
illustrated by our inability to conduct decomposition kinetics above a methoxy 
coverage of 0.015 ML because of complex SIMS spectra (fig. 11). The

advantages of SIMS include rapid data acquisition and high sensitivity, which 
permits kinetic studies at low coverages. 
4. Conclusions 
The main conclusions of this work are: 
(1) The initial sticking coefficient of CH3OD on O/Pt(lll) is unity. 
(2) The maximum amounts of CH3OD decomposed on the oxygenated and 
clean Pt(111) surfaces are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. Saturation first 
layer coverage is 0.36 ML on both surfaces. 
(3) Methoxy formation takes place above 125 K and its decomposition rate 
becomes appreciable above 150 K during temperature programming. A decom- 
position mechanism involving methoxy and a hydroxyl type species is pro- 
posed. 
(4) Hydrogen bonding between methanol molecules at 100 K is indicated by 
the presence of the (CH3OD)D  ion in SIMS. 
(5) Appearance of larger cluster ions in SIMS is correlated with the formation 
of multilayers. 
(6) Assuming a second order reaction between adsorbed methanol (initial 
coverage = 0.05) and chemisorbed oxygen atoms, the activation energy and 
pre-exponential factors for methoxy formation are 5.5 + 0.7 kcal/mol and 
1.5 X 10 -7 -+ 0.6 cm2/s " molecule. 
(7) Methoxy decomposition (initial coverage = 0.015 ML), assuming first order 
kinetics, is characterized by an activation energy of 11.4 _+ 0.5 kcal/mol and a 
pre-exponential factor of 5.3 x 1013 
+ 1 s-1
