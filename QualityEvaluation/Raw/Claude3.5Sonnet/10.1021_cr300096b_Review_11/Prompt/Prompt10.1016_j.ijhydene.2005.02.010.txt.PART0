Abstract
Fuel cell requires hydrogen as its fuel source for generating power. Hydrogen for use in auxiliary power units is produced in
a fuel processor by the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons. Diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, as well as natural gas, are potential fuels
that all have existing infrastructure of manufacture and distribution, for hydrogen production for fuel cell applications. It is well
known that essentially all hydrocarbon feeds contain sulfur at different concentrations. In addition to coking, sulfur poisoning
is the main force for deactivation of pre-reforming and reforming catalysts. The objective of this paper is to develop, test
and characterize efficient catalysts for hydrogen generation from diesel autothermal reforming. Bimetallic catalysts exhibited
superior performance compared to the commercial catalyst and the monometallic counterparts. BET, TPD, TPR, and XPS were
utilized for surface analysis of these formulations, which showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong metalmetal
and metalsupport interaction in the catalyst.

1. Introduction
Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells show
considerable promise for fuel-efficient vehicular applica-
tions and therefore a substantial amount of effort has re-
cently been directed at their production and optimization
[1]. The PEM fuel cell requires hydrogen as its fuel source.
In order to avoid storing high-pressure hydrogen, the fuel
can be generated in an onboard fuel processor [2 and 3]. For
transportation applications, the primary focus is on reform-
ing gasoline, because a production and distribution infra-

structure already exists [4,5]. For auxiliary power units, the
focus is on reforming both gasoline (for automotive appli-
cations [6]) and diesel (for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles
[7]). For portable power generation, the focus has been on
reforming natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.
The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried
out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam
reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), and autothermal re-
forming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam,
and fuel to produce H2 and CO2. In essence, this process
can be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and has
recently attracted considerable attention due to its higher
energy efficiency than the above processes and also low in-
vestment process using a simple system design [8].
The design of ATR catalysts can be challenging, particu-
larly for gasoline/diesel reforming due to the complex and
ill-defined nature of the fuel. ATR catalysts have to be active
for both steam reforming and partial oxidation, be resistant
to high temperatures and tolerant against sulfur poison and

coke formation, especially in the catalytic zone with inade-
quate oxygen concentration.
Catalyst formulations for ATR fuel processors depend on
the fuel choice and operating temperature. For methanol, Cu-
based formulations can be used [9]. For higher hydrocarbons
the catalyst typically comprises of metals such as Pt, Rh, Ru
and Ni deposited or incorporated into carefully engineered
oxide supports such as ceria-containing oxides [10].
Current interest in bimetallic catalysts is increasing, in
particular, because they show superior selectivity and resis-
tance to poisoning as well as improved activity and stability.
The main objective of the present work was to determine
whether the autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be im-
proved when a second metal is added to the substrate.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Ceria-based catalysts
The CeO2 support material has a purity of 99.9%. The
metal originates from a nitrate-based precursor material.
Each catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness method
using distilled water as the solvent for the precursor materi-
als. The catalysts were then dried in air at 110 C overnight.
Each catalyst was also calcined in air at 300500 C for 4 h.
Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by depositing a metal
first, drying, calcining and then depositing the second metal
with subsequent drying and recalcination.
2.1.2. Alumina-based catalysts
The support material is Al2O3 (acidic, gamma). The ac-
tive metal sites were obtained from nitrate precursors. The
preparation technique adopted was incipient wetness method
using distilled water as the solvent for the precursor mate-
rials. The catalyst was then dried in air at 110 C overnight
followed by calcination in air at 400 C for 3 h. The cata-
lyst was then reduced in a mixture of 5% H2 and N2 for 1 h
at 350 C. Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by deposit-
ing one metal first, drying (110 C) and calcining (400 C)
and then depositing the other metal, with subsequent drying
and calcination (400 C). The catalyst was then reduced in
a mixture of 5% H2 and N2 for 1 h at 350 C.
2.2. Reactor system
All the experiments were performed in a 3
8
 adiabatic
fixed-bed tubular (quartz) reactor. Liquid feed consisting of
water and diesel was vaporized and mixed along with air
in a pre-heater containing silicon carbide bed to enhance
mixing. Calibrated HPLC pumps and unit mass flow con-
trollers were used to control the flow rates. The gaseous
mixture from the pre-heater was maintained at a tempera-
ture of 400 C. The reactor with the catalyst bed was well
insulated to achieve the adiabatic reaction conditions. The
hot product gas leaving the reactor was cooled down in
a heat exchanger/condenser system to separate water and
liquid hydrocarbons from the product gas. Pressures above
2 psig were not encountered. The dry product gas from the
condenser was analyzed using a SRI gas chromatograph to
monitor H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and O2 concentrations. In each
test, 2 g of fresh non-diluted commercial catalyst sample
(pellets with an average size of 2 mm) was supported on a
layer of quartz wool.
The experiments reported in this document were per-
formed under the following conditions: steam/C ratio = 3,
oxygen/C
ratio
= 0.5,
Pre-heater/Reactor
temperature
= 400 C, space velocity = 17000 hr1. These conditions
were chosen according to the experimental work done on
synthetic diesel and JP8 fuel [11]. Oxygen was never ob-
served in the effluent during any of the experiments at any
of the temperatures tested. Condensate from the reactor
was considered as unconverted/reformulated hydrocarbon.
Hydrogen yield defined in the experiments is the ratio of
molar hydrogen concentration in the product to the molar
concentration of hydrogen in the reactants (diesel + water).
2.3. BET (surface area) and CO chemisorption
(dispersion) measurements
BET surface area of the catalysts was analyzed by
nitrogen adsorptiondesorption technique. CO chemisorp-
tion at 80 C was utilized to measure the dispersion of
these catalysts using the pulse technique, this method is
know to avoid to some extent the spillover phenomenon
which affects accuracy of the data [12].
2.4. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
experiments
Temperature-programmed reduction was performed in a
U-tube quartz reactor using a CHEMBET 3000 apparatus
manufactured by Quantachrome, provided with thermal con-
ductivity detector (TCD). Pellets (0.4 gm) or fine pow-
der (0.25 gm) was used. To remove any water and CO2
adsorbed on the surface, the catalysts were pre-heated to
250 C for 2 h followed by purging and cooling in helium.
Then a reducing gas mixture consisting of 5% H2 in helium
was passed through the catalyst and the temperature was
ramped from 25 to 800 C at a heating rate of 20 C/min.
2.5. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
experiments
TPD of catalysts was carried out in the CHEMBET ap-
paratus described above. In all the TPD experiments, the
catalysts were preheated to 300 C in helium for 1 h to re-
move residual H2O and CO2. After cooling down to room
temperature in helium, the TPD data were acquired with a
heating rate of 20 C/min to 600 C. The flow rate of the
gas was typically 70 cm3/ min.

2.6. XPS studies
XPS data were obtained using a Kratos Axis 165 with an
Al anode as the X-ray source.
3. Results and discussion
The role of defect chemistry and the surface oxygen va-
cancies in determining the catalytic behavior of metal sup-
ported mixed oxide systems is well known. The focus of this
study was on the autothermal reforming activity of some cat-
alysts, as well as, the effect and role of both the metal and the
dopant on the catalytic properties. The experimental work
involved developing, testing and characterizing: (a) single
metal catalysts supported on reducible or nonreducible sup-
port and (b) bimetallic catalysts dispersed on various sup-
ports. Reactor studies involved the reforming of synthetic
diesel fuel. Metal loadings generally range from 12% in the
case of noble metals and from 5 to 10% in nonnoble metals.
3.1. Alumina supported bimetallic catalysts
Three model catalysts were prepared to study the ATR
activity of synthetic diesel fuel: Pt, Pd and PtPd catalysts
supported on alumina. Also, two different bimetallic cata-
lysts were prepared by changing the order of impregnation:
Pt (I)-Pd (II); Pd (I)-Pt (II). Metal content and BET sur-
face area of these catalysts are presented in Table 1. Surface
area values evaluated from nitrogen adsorptiondesorption
isotherms clearly indicate a decrease in the sorption capac-
ity of the alumina support after Pt and/or Pd incorporation.
As expected the BET surface areas of the calcined catalysts
were lower than that of the support and decreased further
for the bimetallic catalysts.
The autothermal reforming activity of these catalysts is
shown in Fig. 1. Before carrying out the activity tests, all the
catalysts were reduced at 350 C in a 5% H2/N2 mixture.
Catalysts loaded with Pt or Pd yielded about 50% hydro-
gen compared to 45% from bare alumina. The most inter-
esting results are obtained from the mixed metal bimetallic
PtPd catalysts. Each bimetallic catalyst showed high activ-
ity yielding 60% hydrogen compared to 50% from their
monometallic counterparts. The order of impregnation had

no impact on the performance of these catalysts. The ATR
activity on the Pt, Pd and PtPd catalysts confirms a positive
effect of Pt and Pd in the bimetallic catalyst, because the
level of activity of this system was higher than on either of
the monometallic components in spite of fixed dispersion of
total active component.
Gaseous product distribution obtained after ATR of syn-
thetic diesel fuel over alumina-supported Pd and/or Pt cata-
lysts showed a decrease in the lower hydrocarbon (C2C6)
concentration by impregnating Pt or Pd on bare alumina.
More dramatic results were obtained over the bimetallic cat-
alysts yielding more hydrogen due to significant decrease in
the lower hydrocarbon concentration coupled with improved
CO oxidation activity resulting in lower concentration of
undesired CO.
This higher intrinsic activity is probably due to the PtPd
interaction in the system. Temperature programmed reduc-
tion studies and XPS analysis were carried out to understand
this phenomenon.
TPR profiles of monometallic Pd (PdA) and Pt (PtA)
and the bimetallic (PtPdA) catalysts are shown in Fig. 2.
TPR pattern of alumina carrier is not shown because of its
nonreducible nature.

The TPR profile (Fig. 2) of the Pd catalyst shows a nega-
tive peak at 75 C followed by a positive peak at 110 C. The
former can be assigned to desorption of hydrogen from the
decomposition of a bulk palladium hydride formed through
H-diffusion in the Pd-crystallites [13], while the latter is at-
tributed to the Pd oxide species. In contrast, the TPR profile
of the Pt catalyst shows a broad reduction profile extending
from 50450 C. All platinum is reduced to Pt metal below
450 C. Two reduction peaks one at 100 C and the other at
250 C were observed for Pt/Al2O3. The broadening sug-
gests the presence of several Pt species with different oxida-
tion states. These reduction peaks are slightly lower than the
reported reduction temperature [14] probably due to differ-
ences in Pt content, calcination temperature, alumina type,
and temperature ramp rate during the TPR analysis.
The TPR profile of the bimetallic PtPd catalyst is not
simply the sum of the monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts. The
bimetallic reduction profile exhibits peaks typical of PtO re-
duction (100 C) and PdO (110 C) in addition to the Pd hy-
dride decomposition peak at 75 C, although both are much
more intense than in the monometallic catalysts. Since the
metal content is about the same in these catalysts, the in-
crease in H2 consumption associated with the metal oxide
species seems to depend on the presence of second metal.
In addition, the broader second peak centered at 400 C, de-
tected in the PtPd catalyst indicates the reduction of Pd
species together with the coimpregnated Pt, probably due to
some kind of interaction between the metals. Similar inter-
actions in PtPd systems were reported in TPR studies per-
formed by Noronha et al. [14]. These interactions between
the metals leading to the formation of an active phase seem
to be a probable reason behind the activity enhancement.
Significant differences were observed in the XPS spec-
tra of the Pt and/or Pd catalysts supported on alumina. The
high-resolution XPS spectra of the Pt 4d and the Pd 3d bind-
ing energy regions obtained from the Pt/Al2O3, Pd/ Al2O3
and PtPd/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Note a slight
shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak (0.5 eV to higher binding en-
ergy) of the PtPd/Al2O3 catalyst with respect to that of the
Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The observed difference between the re-
sults on the alumina supported Pd and PtPd surfaces may
be due to the oxidation of Pd on the surface [15]. This pos-
itive shift may arise from changes in the electronic relax-
ation energy of Pd levels (220) in the presence of platinum,
as suggested by Dufaux et al. [16].
3.2. Ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts
As a part of fundamental study to identify the role of
metals and metal oxides in autothermal reforming reactions,
activity of bimetallic catalysts supported on a reducible ceria
substrate was studied.
Three different metals viz. Pt, Pd, Ni were chosen for
their ATR activity. These metals were chosen since, it is
generally accepted that Pt/Pd and Ni are the most preferred
catalysts for oxidation and steam reforming, respectively.
Hence, the presence of these active metals on the same sup-
port can facilitate heat transfer between exothermic oxida-
tion and endothermic steam reforming at the micro scale,
which allows advanced heat management and thermally ef-
ficient hydrogen production. The ceria supported catalysts
include monometallic components and their combinations
with Pt (PtNi and PtPd).
Two different bimetallic catalysts were also prepared by
changing the order of impregnation on ceria substrate. It
can be noted from Figs. 4 and 5 that all of these met-
als improved the ATR activity of ceria support. Similar to
the results observed over the alumina-supported catalysts

discussed in the above section, the selectivity to produce
hydrogen from diesel fuel was highest for the bimetallic
catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts.
In the case of bimetallic PtPd catalysts, the order of
impregnation had no effect on the ATR activity. However,
the impregnation order clearly had an effect on the activ-
ity in case of the PtNi bimetallic catalysts as observed in
Fig. 5.
The higher level of activities observed over the bimetal-
lic catalysts was further studied by introducing sulfur-
containing feeds in the ATR feed stream. This was achieved
by testing the activity of these catalysts for reforming JP8
fuel. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, significant loss of activity
was observed over the ceria-supported platinum catalyst
after testing the catalyst for ATR of JP8 fuel for more than
50 h. Similar experiments were carried out on the bimetallic
catalysts and the results of these experiments are presented
in Figs. 6 and 7. It is clear from these plots that both the
catalysts (PtNi and PtPd) exhibit resistance to sulfur

poisoning in contrast to the activity decay observed over
the monometallic platinum catalyst. Stable activity was ob-
served over these catalysts even after testing them for more
than 50 h in presence of significant amount of sulfur poison
in the feed stream.
Higher intrinsic activity and sulfur tolerance of the
bimetallic catalysts was further studied by conducting
surface characterization studies in order to explain the phe-
nomenon involved in the improved performance and the
results are presented below.
3.3. Characterization of Pt and/or Ni catalysts
The TPR data sets obtained from the ceria supported Pt
and/or Ni catalysts are portrayed in Fig. 8. The formation of
two peaks centered at 250 C and 450 C in the Ni catalyst is
due to the reduction of different oxidation states of supported
nickel species in bulk like phase [17].

The reduction peaks associated with the Pt catalyst are
well documented in the previous section. The TPR spectrum
obtained from the bimetallic PtNi catalyst consists of three
major features, one centered at 130 C, one at 260 C and
the other at 500 C. This profile is clearly a mixture of
the two spectra above excluding the new feature at 260 C.
The asymmetrical nature of the higher-temperature feature
suggests the existence of two reduction peaks, probably due
to simultaneous reduction of Ni species and ceria support.
The peak at 260 C due to the reduction of nickel ox-
ide species seems to have enhanced in presence of Pt, sug-
gesting that the structure and/or location of the NiO phase
changes in the presence of Pt. One cannot definitively as-
sign this state to the improved hydrogen yield over this cat-
alyst relative to the other two, but does suggest that this is a
strong possibility. The data suggest a possible scenario that
may cause the resulting enhancement noted in the activity
with the presence of both the Pt and Ni. A probable mecha-
nism is that the Pt causes a further reduction in neighboring
Ni sites which adsorb the O2 and lends this reactant to the
CO/CHx adsorption site, most likely associated with the Pt.
From temperature-programmed reduction data, the for-
mation of PtNi alloy is excluded since after Pt incorpora-
tion onto Ni catalysts no lowering in the NiO reduction tem-
perature occurred. This can be anticipated considering that
platinum has a larger atomic radius and lower surface ten-
sion than Ni. Also, the concentration of Ni is in excess (5%)
compared to Pt (1%). As a result, Pt tends to be excluded
out of the Ni matrix leading to a strong Pt isolation [18].
TPR spectra of the bimetallic Pt and Ni catalysts with
different order of deposition on ceria support are shown in
Fig. 9. H2 uptake over the NiPt catalyst followed the same
pattern as that of PtNi catalyst (discussed above) except for
the peak at 260 C. This peak at 260 C due to the reduction
of oxide species is not as enhanced as that observed in the
other catalyst, clearly demonstrating the fact that the order

of deposition affects the oxidation states of metals. This
difference in the reduction mechanism is also reflected in
the ATR activity of these catalysts as noted in Fig. 5.
XPS characterization of the Pt and/or Ni catalysts was
performed and Table 2 presents the results of the peak BE
so analyzed. Assigned Pt peaks suggest +2 and +4 states of
Pt. The BE of Pt 4f of PtNi catalyst seems to be higher
than that of Pt catalyst, while those of Ni 2p are similar
between the bimetallic and the Ni catalyst (855.4855.3 eV),
as shown in Fig. 10.
In comparison with the ceria supported Ni catalyst, the
peak indicative of Ni 3s (Ni) species in the bimetallic PtNi
catalyst is shifted toward a lower binding energy, indicating
a higher electron density in the Ni species in the bimetallic
catalyst. Although the Ni 2p BE values are comparable as
described above, the Pt 4f BE value of the bimetallic catalyst
is higher than that of the monometallic catalyst. This may
contribute to the enhancement of activity and stability of the
bimetallic catalysts. It can also be noted that, with platinum
incorporation, the reducibility of the Ni species increased as
observed in the TPR experiments.
The ceria-supported PtNi catalysts are even more active
and stronger against deactivation in autothermal reforming
of diesel fuel than the corresponding monometallic Ni and
Pt catalysts. The activity of these catalysts seems to depend
on the order of loading of the metals and the formation of
different oxidation states during the synthesis of the cata-
lysts. The XPS and TPR experiments confirm no synergy

between the loaded metals and indicate that the amounts of
exposed Ni and Pt sites are different among the catalysts,
corresponding with the differences in the catalytic activity
and stability.
3.4. Characterization of Pt and/or Pd catalysts
The H2-TPR profile of the unreduced bimetallic PdPt
catalyst showed marked differences compared to those of
the monometallic catalysts. A sharp peak at about 100 C is
observed, which is more intense than that in the monometal-
lic Pd catalyst, perhaps pointing to the formation of better
defined PdO species, so leading to a small reduction in tem-
perature and a much greater quantity of this species. These
species alone cannot be attributed to the improved activity
and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts, since the influ-
ence of bimetallic dispersion is not well understood during
the TPR experiments and further analysis was carried out
by XPS characterization and H2 chemisorption.
Fig. 11 presents the TPD profile of H2 from the ceria-
supported Pt and/or Pd catalysts obtained following H2 ad-
sorption at 25 C. Four major peaks at 120, 190, 310 and
680 C can be distinguished on the Pt/Ceria catalyst after
H2 chemisorption at 25 C. For the bimetallic PtPd/Ceria
catalyst, significant differences can be observed in the des-
orption profile. While the first three peaks at 160, 200, and
360 C may correspond to the respective three peaks on the
Pt/Ceria, the peak at 680 C has shifted to a lower temper-
ature (560 C).

In addition to the shift in the high-temperature peak the
amount of hydrogen desorption decreased substantially over
the bimetallic catalyst. This may correspond to the strongly
bound H species in case of the monometallic catalyst, prob-
ably the hydride species or the hydrogen species in the sub-
surface layers of the metal catalyst [19]. While the major
hydrogen species desorb at temperatures below 360 C from
the bimetallic catalyst, they remain on Pt/Ceria surface at
temperatures higher than 400 C.
The Hmetal bond on the Pt/Ceria catalyst appears to
be stronger than that on the PtPd/Ceria, suggesting that

an interaction between Pt and Pd leads to weakening of
Hmetal bond and hence better ATR activity compared to
its monometallic counterparts.
The Pd-3d core level spectra for Ptceria, Pdceria and
Pt/Pdceria catalysts studied are shown in Fig. 12. For

bimetallic PtPd catalyst, a decrease in the Pd 3d 5
2 signal
together with a positive binding energy shift to 336.5 eV
was found.
The positive shift possibly arises from changes in the elec-
tronic relaxation energy of Pd levels (220) in the presence
of a second metal, since an electron transfer from the Pd
to the Pt electron population due to an alloy formation is
not evidenced during the XPS characterization. This close
PtPd contact may account for the observed decrease in the
surface exposure of Pd due to the dilution effect of Pt on
the bimetallic interaction.
However, the decrease in the surface coverage of Pd is
more than the value estimated, indicating some Pt surface
isolation in the bimetallic particles, which could lead to
secluded Pt clusters on the Pd surface. Surface segrega-
tion of one component (Pd) in bimetallic silicaalumina
supported PtPd particles as the Pt content (Pt > 75%) in-
creased was also found by Rades et al. [21]. These results
clearly indicate that the catalytic behavior of PtPd/ceria
for the ATR of diesel fuel in the presence of sulfur is
closely related to the presence of these electron-deficient
Pt species (secluded Pt clusters on the Pd surface), in
addition to the weak metalhydrogen bond strengths
in the bimetallic catalysts as observed in the H2-TPD
studies.
This kind of electro-deficient metallic species is claimed
by a number of researchers to be responsible for the high
sulfur tolerance of supported bimetallic catalysts, knowing
the electron acceptor character of the sulfur atom [22,23].
Consequently, the positive interaction of the bimetallic
PtPd catalysts may be attributed to the presence of a
bimetallic interaction, which reduces the tendency of Pt/Pd
to chemisorb sulfur or form bulk sulfide and subsequent
spill over on to the support ceria.
4. Conclusions
Autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel fuel was inves-
tigated for potential applications in auxiliary power units.
Experimental results revealed that the impregnation of Ni or
Pd (in addition to Pt) on alumina or ceria-supported catalysts
not only improves the activity but also modifies the catalyst
to resist poisoning from sulfur present in the feed. Surface
analysis of these formulations showed that the enhanced sta-
bility is due to a strong metalmetal and metalsupport in-
teraction in the catalyst. The improved performance of the
bimetallic catalysts is due to structural and electronic effects
rather than the degree of metal dispersion.
