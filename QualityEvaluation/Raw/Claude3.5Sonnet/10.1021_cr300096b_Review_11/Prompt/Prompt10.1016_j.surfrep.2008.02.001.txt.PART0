Monolayer bimetallic surfaces: Experimental and theoretical studies of trends in electronic and chemical properties
Abstract
The current review focuses on the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS). The MBS is defined in this review as a monolayer of admetal deposited on a single crystal metal substrate. Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces. The review will summarize recent experimental and theoretical studies of the surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and inter-mixed bimetallic structures to demonstrate their unique electronic and chemical properties. In the current review we will use one the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, surface and subsurface Ni monolayer on Pt(111), as a model system to introduce the synthesis, characterization, and DFT modeling of MBS structures. We will then utilize the adsorption of atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, and CO to demonstrate the correlation between the surface d-band center and the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates for various bimetallic surfaces. We will also address the issue of stability of the subsurface and surface MBS structures in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. We will then use the hydrogenation of alkenes on subsurface MBS structures, and the reforming of oxygenates on surface MBS structures, to illustrate the trend between binding energies of adsorbates and chemical activities.
1. Introduction
1.1. Unique catalytic properties of bimetallic alloys
One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts 
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst. The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on the possible applications of different bimetallic catalysts. Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis 
[4]
and electrocatalysis 
[5]
,
[6]
applications.
For this reason, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews 
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. It is now well known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. However, it is difficult to know a priori how the electronic and chemical properties of a particular bimetallic surface will be modified relative to the parent metals. For this reason, the study of bimetallic surfaces in the field of catalysis has gained considerable interest. There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of the hetero-atom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g. the average metal-metal bond lengths change. This gives rise to the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap.
1.2. Unique properties of MBS
Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes. Many studies have attempted to correlate chemical reactivities with the electronic properties of MBS. For example, Goodman and coworkers found a strong dependence of the CO desorption temperature and the core electron energy shift in a wide range of bimetallic surfaces 
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
. Hammer and Nrskov have also extensively studied the interactions between adsorbates and metal surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) 
[14]
. They have shown that the center of the surface d-band in transition metals also correlates with the binding energies of CO and that the core-level shift is related to the d-band shift. Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy 
[15]
,
[16]
. Therefore, the formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy.
The modification of the structural and electronic properties of MBS can also lead to new reaction pathways of catalytically important reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization. For example, Koel and coworkers have attempted to correlate a change in electronic or physical structures with novel chemistry of bimetallic surfaces, such as Sn/Pt(111) and Pd/Mo(100) 
[17]
,
[18]
. These studies revealed that surfaces with metal adlayer coverages in the monolayer range often demonstrated chemical properties unlike the pure metal surfaces. Another example of correlating the structural, electronic and chemical properties is the novel chemistry on faceting surfaces of many bimetallic systems by Madey and coworkers. For example, the faceting surface of Pd, obtained by depositing one monolayer Pd on W(211), showed a substantial enhancement in the activity towards the cyclotrimerization pathway than that on either Pd(110) or W(211) surfaces 
[19]
.
In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures. Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirmed the different chemical properties of MBS with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures. In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties.
1.3. Scope of the current review
In the current review we will discuss the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of MBS from both experimental and DFT studies. We will primarily focus on the results published after the review of bimetallic surface chemistry by Rodriguez in 1996
[8]
. One of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, surface and subsurface Ni monolayer on Pt(111), will be used as a model MBS to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques. This will be followed by an introduction of the application of the density functional theory (DFT) method to determine the electronic properties, such as the surface d-band center, of bimetallic surfaces. A semi-empirical equation will also be introduced to allow the estimation of the d-band center of MBS without quantum calculations. The general trends in the chemical properties of MBS will be demonstrated using several classes of probe atoms and molecules. The dissociative adsorption and desorption of hydrogen will be used to reveal the correlation between the hydrogen binding energy and the surface d-band center for various bimetallic surfaces. This will be followed by the demonstration of the general trend in the binding energy of oxygen, as well as the thermodynamic stability and segregation kinetics of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The general trend in the adsorption and reaction of hydrocarbon molecules with unsaturated carboncarbon bonds will be discussed, in particular the novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways on the subsurface bimetallic structures that are resulting from weakly-bonded hydrogen and alkenes. This will be followed by the discussion of the adsorption and reaction of oxygen-containing molecules, in particular the trend in the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO on the surface bimetallic structures. The review will conclude by pointing out some of the challenges and opportunities in the understanding and potential applications of MBS.
2. Synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces
A fundamental correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic alloys requires the synthesis of well-characterized bimetallic surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Bimetallic surfaces can be prepared by cutting single crystal bulk alloys in a particular crystalline orientation. However, the chemical compositions of these surfaces are limited to those bimetallic systems that produce bulk alloys. A more common way to prepare bimetallic surfaces is by depositing one metal onto the well-ordered single crystal surface of another metal. Comparing to bulk alloy crystals, the deposition method offers the flexibility to compare surface properties of the metal substrate without metal overlayer, and with metal overlayers at different coverages. Another advantage is that, depending on the substrate temperature during deposition, the monolayer admetal can either stay on the surface to produce the surface monolayer or diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the subsurface monolayer. In this section we will provide procedures for the synthesis of MBS with surface and subsurface structures, followed by a description of common UHV techniques for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces.
2.1. Preparation of MBS structures
Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament.
Fig. 1
shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems. The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition. Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO.

).
Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K. This phenomenon is quite common for other 3d metals on Pt(111), although the diffusion temperature of the admetal layer varies for different 3d metals. More about the preparation of surface and subsurface MBS structures will be discussed in Section 
2.3
.
2.2. Common techniques for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces
2.2.1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces.
One of the most important aspects in studying the bimetallic surfaces is to understand the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer. For studying MBS structures, it is important to differentiate whether the metal atoms grow in a layer-by-layer mode, often referred to as the Frank van der Merwe growth mechanism as shown in
Fig. 2
(a), or grow to form 3D islands in the VolmerWeber (VW) mechanism as shown in
Fig. 2
(b). In the latter mechanism, a uniform monolayer is not formed because the cohesive energy between metal overlayer atoms (MM) is generally higher than that for the adsorption energy between the metal overlayer and the substrate surface (MS). At least two other growth mechanisms have been described for the formation of metal overlayers: the StranskiKrastanov mechanism that describes the growth of 3D islands after the completion of the first monolayer, and the multiple layer growth mechanism where the second and third layers may start to grow before the first monolayer is completed. Because the current review focuses mainly on the monolayer bimetallic structures, only the first two growth mechanisms will be discussed here, with the purpose being to use AES and XPS to differentiate between a uniform monolayer and 3D islands.

).
The layer-by-layer and the 3D island growth mechanisms can be in most cases differentiated from the AES or XPS intensities as a function of deposition time.
Fig. 3
illustrates the typical intensity curves for the two mechanisms. The -axis in
Fig. 3
is the deposition time at a constant deposition current or voltage, and the y-axis is the intensity for the metal overlayer (M) and the substrate (S). The rate of decrease of the substrate peak and the increase of the metal overlayer peak can be used to qualitatively identify different growth modes. In the layer-by-layer mechanism,
Fig. 3
(a), the peak intensity of both the metal overlayer and the substrate show distinct breaks, with the first break being an indication of the completion of the first monolayer. In contrast,
Fig. 3
(b) illustrates that such breaks are absent for the 3D island growth mechanism. The AES or XPS calibration curves, provide critical information about whether the admetal forms a monolayer on the substrate, should be performed for the characterization of bimetallic surfaces whenever possible. In addition, calibration curves such as those in
Fig. 3
(a) also provide information about the deposition time to achieve the monolayer coverage.

[27]
).
Because the calibration curves in
Fig. 3
require the measurements of many data points, the average thickness of the metal overlayer in the bimetallic surfaces is
(2.1)
sometimes estimated based on the reduction in the AES or XPS intensities of the metal substrate. In Eq.
(2.1)
, and are the intensity before and after the deposition of a metal overlayer, is the thickness of the film, and is the mean free path of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons, which is based on its kinetic energy using the Universal curve 
[20]
. Using this method, the monolayer coverage is referred to as a film thickness that equals the diameter of the admetal.
The utilization of both the calibration curves in
Fig. 3
and Eq.
(2.1)
requires that the AES or XPS measurements of the substrate surface, with and without the metal overlayer, are performed with the sample at the identical location with respect to the AES or XPS spectrometer. This is because a change in the relative distance and angle between the sample surface and the AES or XPS spectrometer can often lead to variation in the intensity. It is often difficult to keep the constant distance and angle because the deposition often requires the rotation of the sample surface, and in most cases the movement of the sample in the , or directions. An alternative method to estimate the coverage of the overlayer is from a single AES or XPS spectrum from the intensity ratios of the overlayer and substrate. As described below, the calculation takes into consideration the following two effects: (1) the screening of the substrate AES or XPS intensity by the metal overlayer and (2) the contribution of the substrate AES or XPS signal from multiple layers in the bulk. For ease of explanation, the following calculations are described for a monolayer Pt on a W(110) substrate using the XPS peak intensities. The following parameters are defined in the calculation:
: intensity of Pt(71.2 eV) feature for 1 ML Pt
: intensity of W(31.5 eV) feature for 1 ML W
: XPS intensity of Pt(71.2 eV) for Pt/W
: XPS intensity of W(31.5 eV) for Pt/W.
The XPS intensities of Pt(71.2 eV) for 1 ML Pt and W(31.5 eV) for 1 ML W are related by the XPS sensitivity factors as follows:
(2.2)
where and are the sensitivity factors, which are 5.572 and 3.523, respectively, at an analyser angle of 54.7 from the standard XPS Handbook. The experimentally measured XPS intensity of the Pt(4f) feature at 71.2 eV, , can be expressed as
(2.3)
where is the fraction of monolayer of Pt residing on top of the polycrystalline W surface. The experimentally measured XPS intensity of the W(31.5 eV) feature is contributed from many layers of W. The intensity from the first layer of W can be expressed as
(2.4)
The first term represents the region without surface Pt, and the second term is from the surface region where W atoms are screened by the surface Pt layer with a thickness of . The term is the mean free path of the W(31.5 eV) electrons, which can be estimated to be 18 Å from the Universal curve 
[20]
. Similarly the W XPS signal from the subsequent layers of W can be described by the following general equation:
(2.5)
(2.6)
Finally, the experimentally measured XPS ratio of the Pt(4f)/W(4f) features can be related to the surface Pt coverage, x, using the relationship as given in
Box I
: The terms of and can be replaced with XPS sensitivity factors by rearranging Eq.
(2.2)
:
(2.7)
In the current example the diameter of a Pt atom (
Å
, 
[21]
) is used for the thickness of the Pt monolayer. The thickness of each W layer is estimated to be based on the geometric arrangement of the body centerd cubic (BCC) structure, with being the diameter of a W atom of 2.74 Å 
[21]
. The calculation also reveals that contributions to the W XPS signal from W atoms 20 layers or deeper are negligible. For this reason the sum of the XPS W(31.5 eV) signal, , is calculated from the first 20 W layers. Using the above equations, a monolayer Pt on W(110) is characterized by an XPS Pt(71.2 eV) /W(31.5 eV) ratio of 0.17. Similar equations can also be utilized for AES measurements, after utilizing the relevant AES sensitivity factors for the peak-to-peak intensities and the corresponding mean free paths for the Auger electrons.
Box I
2.2.2. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy
Comparing to the AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy 
[22]
is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces. In LEIS experiments the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne or Ar, of a relatively low energy (1005000 eV). The incident ion is scattered back with an energy that is directly related to the mass of the surface atom with which it collides. The energy of these ions can be correlated to the mass of the atom from which it is scattered by Eq.
(2.8)
. In this relationship, is the energy of the incident ion, and are the masses of the incident ion and the surface atom, respectively, is the measured energy of the scattered ion, and is the scattering angle of the ions. By selecting the appropriate experimental parameters, , and , the value of can be determined by measuring the value of E in the LEIS experiment.
(2.8)
Fig. 4
shows an example of the LEIS results following Ni deposition on Pt(111) at 300 K, using He+ ions with an energy of 1 keV as the ion source. The spectrum clearly shows that scattering from Ni and Pt atoms on the surface is easily distinguishable. Since the ions have different sensitivities towards atoms of different atomic numbers, the intensity of the scattering peaks needs to be normalized to the intensity of a pure surface of each element. In this case the sensitivity factor for the Pt signal is determined by measuring the intensity of a clean Pt(111) surface and the sensitivity factor of Ni is determined by measuring the Ni signal in a thick Ni film.

Fig. 4. Schematic diagram of a low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) experiment. The right panel is a typical LEIS spectrum of a Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surface (from 
[27]
).
There are several other scattering phenomena that occur in the LEIS experiment which make it specific to only the first surface layer. The ions used for scattering in these experiments have a high neutralization probability and are likely to be neutralized if they penetrate the first atomic layer. As a result, these ions cannot be detected in the analyser. In addition to neutralization effects, the process of elastic shadowing occurs, in which the deeper atomic layers lie within a shadow cone that is projected by the scattering of ions by an atom in the top layer. Within this shadow cone, atoms cannot be detected. These scattering phenomena both contribute to the surface sensitivity of LEIS. As will be demonstrated in Section 
2.3
, the surface sensitivity of the LEIS technique makes it one of the most sensitive techniques in the differentiation of surface and subsurface MBS structures,
2.2.3. LEED
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces. LEED utilizes a beam of low-energy electrons directed at the surface and collects a diffraction pattern of the electrons that scatter from the surface using a phosphor screen 
[23]
,
[24]
. LEED is very useful in identifying the periodicity of the metal overlayer with respect to the single crystal substrate. For example, LEED studies have helped to reveal that alloy surfaces, such as Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibit a pure Pt outermost layer with a Pt-depleted layer underneath 
[25]
. LEED measurements are also important to confirm the epitaxial growth of metal overlayers in bimetallic surfaces.
2.2.4. STM
Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. In STM experiments a tip is scanned over a sample surface in a regular array, adjusting the height of the tip to keep either the tunnelling current or voltage constant between the STM tip and the surface. STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces.
2.3. Case Study: Synthesis and characterization of Ni /Pt(111) surfaces
The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling 
[26]
. When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure. Below we will use the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces as model systems to illustrate the information that can be derived from AES, XPS, LEIS and STM characterization.
For example,
Fig. 5
shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments (
Fig. 5
(a)), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was approximately 1 ML. The LEIS analyser was fixed at an energy corresponding to He+ scattering from either Ni or Pt, while the sample was heated continuously at a linear rate of approximately 9 K /s. The Pt and Ni intensities were measured in separate experiments, and the LEIS ratio of Ni /Pt intensities was the same at the beginning of each experiment. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to the desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments (
Fig. 5
(b)), which were performed at three different initial coverages. In these experiments, the Ni /Pt AES ratio gradually decreased until around 700 K, in good agreement with the LEIS results. The Ni /Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements

).
Fig. 6
shows the normal and grazing emission XPS of the NiPt(111) surface prepared at 300 K and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure prepared at 600 K. In the normal emission experiment, the sample surface was normal to the analyzer and the X-ray beam was incident on the surface at an angle approximately 6070 from the surface normal. In the grazing emission experiment, the analyser axis was at an angle of 60 with respect to the surface normal, and the x-ray beam was nearly incident with the surface normal (about 10 off). Therefore, the grazing emission experiments should be more sensitive to the near surface region than the normal emission experiments. At 300 K, the Ni intensity in the grazing emission spectrum was about 1.35 (based on areas indicated in
Fig. 6
) times larger than the Ni intensity in the normal emission spectrum (
Fig. 6
(a)). This indicated that Ni atoms were preferentially located near the surface. At 600 K (
Fig. 6
(b)), the grazing to normal intensity ratio was 0.74, suggesting a more isotropic composition of the near-surface region, consistent with the inward diffusion of surface Ni atoms at 600 K. The ratios between Ni2p and Pt4f XPS intensities showed a similar trend. For the 300 K deposition, the normal emission Ni2p /Pt4f ratio was 0.82, while for grazing emission it was 1.95, indicating again there was more Ni in the near surface region for deposition at 300 K. At 600 K, the normal emission ratio was 0.71, while the grazing emission ratio was 0.77. Thus, for deposition at 600 K, the surface was not as rich in Ni as the surface prepared by deposition at 300 K, or alternatively, the 600 K surface was enriched in Pt compared to the 300 K surface

).
Finally, STM was also utilized to further characterize the morphology of the 300 K and 600 K surfaces. As shown in
Fig. 7
(a), after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Since the islands did not uniformly cover the step edges, the Ni adatoms were most likely mobile on both the surface and at the step edge until another Ni adatom at the step edge was encountered, at which point nucleation or sticking occurred. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in
Fig. 7
(b). The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, light, worm-like features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni in Pt(111) 
[26]
. Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later.

3. DFT modeling of bimetallic surfaces
The use of ab initio calculations to predict chemical behavior of various catalytic systems has gained increasing momentum over the past decade due to the ever increasing speed of computer processors, as well as to the improvement in the methodology and data interpretation. Results from DFT modeling have provided important insights into the structural stability, electronic density of states, and chemical reactivity of many MBS systems. The review of DFT and its applications to catalysis and surface science can be found in many papers 
[14]
,

. The main objective of the current section is to provide a brief overview of the basic concepts and assumptions of the DFT methods, in particular the surface d-band center that appears to be a very useful parameter in correlating and predicting properties of bimetallic surfaces. A semi-empirical equation will also be introduced as an alternative method to estimate the change in the surface d-band center of MBS.
3.1. Brief overview of DFT modeling
The advent of DFT began with the discovery by de Broglie that matter can be associated with wavelike properties 
[42]
. Using this notion that even matter could be described using waves, Schrdinger proposed the now famous time-independent wave equation
(3.1)
 [43]
by modifying the classical mechanics wave equation and substituting in de Broglies relationship. This is the equation that all later quantum mechanical calculations are based on.
(3.1)
H
Ψ
=

.
However, for most systems of interest it is computationally very expensive to solve this equation. The term that causes this dilemma is the term accounting for the electronelectron interactions of multiple electron systems. If we were to attempt to solve the exact Schrdinger equation using current computing power, this would limit reasonable calculations to those containing fewer than 100 electrons. Since transition metals contain many electrons, this restricts simulations to calculations on one to three atoms, which would be insufficient to represent metal surfaces. Therefore, instead of solving the exact Schrdinger equation, alternative numerical methods have been derived based on Eq.
(3.1)
with various assumptions.
The first assumption is the BornOppenheimer approximation, which states that the electrons depend only on the position of the nucleus rather than on position and momentum of the nucleus 
[44]
. The resulting simplified Hamiltonian to be solved assuming no magnetic moment is presented in the following equation:

where the first term is the kinetic energy of the electron, the second term is due to the electronnucleus interaction and the third term is due to the electronelectron interaction. It is the third term that gives rise to the computational difficulties. The main difference between the various computational methods (HartreeFock, DFT, etc.) is from different approaches for expanding the electronelectron interaction term. The HartreeFock (HF) method effectively deals with this issue by replacing the third term with a Coulomb operator and an Exchange operator. The DFT approach, on the other hand, removes this difficulty in effect by moving away from the many electron approach.
The DFT method focuses on solving for the electron density rather than solving for the individual electrons. The HohenbergKohn theorem states that given an electron density, there is only one unique external potential which can be mapped to it 
[45]
. Therefore, the many interacting electron systems can be correlated exactly to a system of noninteracting electrons in an effective potential. This idea led to the KohnSham (KS) single electron equations

where the first term in Eq.
(3.3)
is the standard kinetic term and the second term expresses the KS approach by using an effective external potential,
v

. The effective external potential is expanded in Eq.
(3.4)
, where the first term is the potential due to the nucleuselectron interaction, the second term is the electronelectron Coulomb interaction, and the rest of the potential is contained within the exchanged correlation potential,
v
x
c
. If the exact exchange correlation potential were known, these equations would provide the exact electron density. In the DFT approach, various functionals are used as approximations for the exchange correlation potential.
There are two main exchange correlation functionals used to implement the use of DFT, the local density approximation (LDA) 
[47]
and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). LDA approximates the exchange correlation by using the assumption that the density behaves locally like a uniform electron cloud. This approximation provides a good starting point for DFT, however, it tends to make semiconductor systems too metallic 
[48]
and it overpredicts bonding in molecular and solid systems 
[49]
. To correct for this discrepancy, GGA builds on LDA by including the first derivative of the density and hence includes the first order approximation of the gradients of electron density. Most programs implement GGA exchange correlation functionals such as PBE 
[50]
, RPBE 
[51]
, PW91 
[52]
, etc. Currently one of the main difficulties with improving DFT is that no systematic approach has been discovered for developing new exchange correlation functionals that would compare to the systematic approach developed for the HF methods. However, the current GGA functionals have been successfully used in a wide variety of systems and have provided a foundation to solidify DFT as a powerful predictive tool.
Once an exchange correlation is selected, the total energy can be solved for iteratively using the following steps. First, the electron density is given by making an initial guess for the KS orbitals and using the following relationship:
(3.5)
ρ
(
r
)
=
i

n
φ

.
This initial guess for the density is then used in Eq.
(3.4)
to obtain the corresponding effective potential, which is used to solve the KS orbitals using Eq.
(3.3)
. Finally, the KS orbitals are used to solve for the new electron density using Eq.
(3.5)
. These steps are repeated until a certain tolerance is approached and therefore the solutions are self-consistent. The ground state energy is then given by the following equation:

encompasses all the interactions not accounted for by the first three terms. This would contain the difference between the kinetic energy for the noninteracting system and the exact kinetic energy, the electron exchange repulsions, and correlation effects for both exchange and Coulomb interactions. Using the RayleighRitz variational principle, an upper bound for the ground state can be calculated for a given basis set.
There are a number of software packages available to implement the iterative approach. Two major packages are often used in the references listed in
Table 1
, the open software Dacapo package 
[53]
from the Center for Atomic-scale Materials Design (CAMD) at Denmark Technical University, and the Vienna ab-initio software package (VASP) 
[54]
,
[55]
,
[56]
from the Theoretical Physics Department at the University of Vienna. Both programs are total energy molecular dynamic simulations that use pseudo-potentials to express the core electrons and planewaves for periodic boundary conditions.
The main concepts for understanding the implementation of DFT for slab calculations are the use of pseudopotentials and the method of applying the periodic boundary condition, which can significantly reduce the computation time. The computational capability is scaled as a function of the number of electrons. Therefore, if the number of electrons to be solved is reduced, the size of the system that can be modelled can be increased. One method for decreasing the total number of electrons involved is to remove the core electrons, which often do not participate in bonding interactions and only act as a shield (through orthogonality) to the nucleus charge. This is done through using a pseudopotential, which provides an effective potential in place of the core electrons. Pseudopotentials are not unique functions and they are generated using various methods. The Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials 
[57]
are a common set used by many simulation packages. For the periodic boundary condition, this is implemented using the Blochs theorem, which shows that a wave function for an electron can be written as the product of a planewave and a periodic function

In order to use the planewaves as a basis, the periodic function,

where G is the wave vectors of the reciprocal lattice vectors. In order to achieve a perfect expansion when using a planewave basis, an infinite number of planewaves is required. However, since the wave function is of finite energy, the coefficients for the higher energy planewaves must go to zero. Therefore, the planewave basis set is truncated by setting a cutoff energy. The cutoff energy required for a given precision is element dependent and has to be determined for each element of interest.
Finally, it is important to point out that while DFT has proved to be successful in predicting many trends that have been verified experimentally, there are some limitations that may result in misleading predictions 
[58]
. In brief, the current DFT method is inadequate to accurately describe dispersion forces, charge transfer, extended
π
conjugation and, in some cases, bond cleavage. Thus, DFT calculations would have difficulty in predicting long-range dispersive intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or physisorption. Charge transfer refers to such problems as Rydberg excitations due to the asymptotic potential error. The current exchange correlations underestimate molecular HOMO-LUMO band gaps, which leads to poor prediction of electron delocalization as found in
π
-bond conjugation. These deficiencies with the long-range representation of potential energy also often lead to poor prediction for bond dissociation as the bonds lengthen past the ground state value. Therefore, care must be taken when using DFT to predict chemical behavior if any of these conditions exist in the system of interest.
3.2. Density of states and d-band center
Ab initio calculations offer the ability to identify parameters that correlate electronic and chemical properties, which in turn provide opportunities to predict how the properties of a metal surface are modified by alloying with other metals or promoters. For transition metal surfaces, the effect of substituting one metal for another can largely be attributed to the modification in the d-orbitals, which participate largely in the bonding interaction with adsorbates. It has been further shown that the d-orbitals on the surface of the catalyst of interest can be distinguished largely by characterizing the transition metal density of states (DOS) for the d-orbitals 
[59]
,
[60]
. Specifically, it is the location of the d-band center of the DOS in relation to the Fermi level that has been correlated for many bonding interactions. There are many reviews that introduce and develop the notion of density of states and the various moments and it is highly recommended to consult these for further details 
[59]
,
[60]
.
The density of states is calculated using the solutions found to the set of single electron KS equations shown in Eq.
(3.3)
. These solutions are the KS orbitals, which have no known direct physical meaning. However, since DFT solves for the electron density of a system, the sum of the squared KS orbitals is equal to the exact electron density if the exact exchange correlation functional is known. Since these KS orbitials square form the exact electron density, it has been proposed that these orbitals may have a more physical meaning 
[14]
. Based on this assumption, the DOS is calculated by using the following numerical approximation summed over the reduced first Brillouin zone:
(3.9)
ρ
(
ε
)
=
k
ω
k
i
β
(
ε
ε
i
k
)
where
ρ
is the density of states as a function of energy,
ε
is the absolute energy,
ω
k
is the weight given to a given
k
-point,
β
is a broadening function that is used to interpolate the energy present between the finite number of
k
-points, and
ε
i
k
is the KS eigenvalue solution for a given
k
-point and specific orbital. This numerical approximate is used because the energy of the system is comparable at
k
-points that are located closely together. This fact allows an interpolation method to be used and only a finite number of
k
-points need to be calculated. Therefore, to put it simply, the above equation serves the same purpose as the trapezoid rule serves in simpler numerical problems. Eq.
(3.9)
enables one to calculate the density of states, and subsequently the various moments, as a function of energy.
In this review, we will focus on the relationship between chemical properties and the center of d-band, which is related to the first order moment of DOS. The various moments of the DOS for any specific orbital or total sum are calculated using the following equation:
(3.10)
μ
n
=


ε
n
ρ
(
ε
ε

)
d

ρ
(

)
d
ε
where
n
is the order of the moment,
ρ
is the density of states,
ε
is the energy, and
ε
o
is the reference energy which is commonly set to the Fermi energy. The zeroth order moment (
n
=
0
) corresponds to the total normalized number of states. The first order moment (
n
=
1
) corresponds to the average energy of the DOS, which is also referred to as the DOS band center short for center of mass. Other common moments are the mean squared width (
n
=
2
), skewness (
n
=
3
), and kurtosis (
n
=
4
) of the DOS.
There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic properties, such as the d-band center, of an admetal on the surface of another metal. First, the geometry of the structure, for example, the average metal-metal bond length, is typically different from that of the bulk metal. This gives rise to strain effects that are known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap 
[61]
. According to these arguments, when the surface atoms are subjected to a tensile strain, the d-orbital overlap is decreased, resulting in a sharpening of the d-band and a shift in its average energy (the d-band center) closer to the Fermi level. On the other hand, when surface atoms are under a compressive strain, the d-orbital overlaps are increased, resulting in a broadening of the d-band and a lowering of its average energy. The second factor that contributes to the modification of surface properties in bimetallic systems is the electronic interaction between the two metals. This effect, also commonly referred to as the ligand effect 
[62]
,
[63]
, arises because the presence of other metals around a metal atom changes its electronic environment, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure and consequently, its chemical properties. The relative dominance of the strain or the ligand effects is obviously different for different bimetallic surfaces. More discussion about the two effects can be found elsewhere 
[38]
,
[61]
,
[64]
. There are also other important phenomena that can affect the properties of bimetallic surfaces, such as ensemble effects and bifunctional catalysis, in which the two metals function independently. These two effects are generally not considered in most DFT modeling of electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces.
The structure of the surface d-electron bands has been shown to be a critical factor in the adsorption properties of many simple adsorbates 
[14]
. In correlating adsorption properties with the d-band structure, it is convenient to use a single, characteristic value that is representative of the d-band. One line of reasoning is that the electrons at the Fermi level are the most energetically available electrons for reactions, suggesting the density of states at the Fermi level,
ρ
F
,
as a possible parameter to represent electronic properties. This, however, is only a single point in the distribution of states, and may reflect little of the d-band structure. Furthermore, there has been only limited success in understanding trends in catalysis using
ρ
F
,
and in many systems there is a lack of general correlation between
ρ
F
and chemical properties of a surface 
[65]
. Another choice of parameter for correlation has been the number of d-holes, or unoccupied d-states. Hammer and Nrskov have shown that the interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces involve the entire d-band 
[14]
. Therefore, a more logical choice of parameters is one that depends in a functional way on the entire d-band including both the occupied and unoccupied states, such as its average energy. The first moment of the d-band with respect to the Fermi level is the average energy of the band, also called the d-band center. An alternative choice would be the mean squared band width, or the second moment, again with respect to the Fermi level. As will be shown later, these two moments are highly correlated in bimetallic systems.
For example,
Fig. 8
shows the DFT results of the surface DOS and d-band center for Pt(111) and for several Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures 
[64]
. As shown in
Fig. 8
(a), in each Pt-3d-Pt(111) case, the Pt d-band center is lower in energy, i.e. further away from the Fermi level, than the pure Pt slab. The magnitude of the shift in the d-band center relative to pure Pt generally increases as the subsurface metal moves to the left side in the Periodic Table, from Ni to Ti. The results indicate that the value of the surface d-band center, which is related to the surface chemical properties, can be controlled using different bimetallic combinations. Such modification effects will be illustrated throughout the remainder of this review.

Fig. 8. (a) Variations in the surface d-band center of Pt slabs containing subsurface 3d metals. (b) Calculated surface d-band DOS for subsurface 3d metal containing Pt slabs. The number of d-electrons/surface atom is shown for each band (from 
[64]
).
As shown in the values of
N
d
in
Fig. 8
(b), which is the number of d-electrons per surface Pt atom and is calculated by integrating the projected d-band DOS up to the Fermi level, remain approximately 9.3 d-electrons/Pt atom for all surfaces. Thus, the d-band filling does not appear to change substantially by the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures. Correspondingly, the number of unoccupied d-states does not change either, thus correlations between the number of d-holes and chemical properties of these systems are not expected. This does not exclude the possibility that charge is polarized away from the surface, as has been suggested for Ni and Pd on Ta(110), for example,
[66]
,
[67]
.
It is important to keep in mind that, when comparing DFT results reported in the literature, it is absolutely critical to pay attention to calculation details that are used in the modeling. For example, the results in
Fig. 8
were calculated using the following calculation procedures: The Pt(111) surfaces were modelled using a 2×2 unit cell with four layers of metal atoms periodically repeated, and with 46 equivalent layers of vacuum (>10 Å ) separating the slabs to represent the Pt(111) surface. The four atoms in the second layer of the slab were substituted with one of the 3d transition metals from Ti to Ni. The first and second layers were allowed to relax to their lowest energy configuration, while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk PtPt distance, 2.84 Å, as determined by DFT for the RPBE exchange correlation functional used in the modeling. The electronic structure was calculated with the Dacapo-2.7 code, which uses planewaves as the basis set, and ultra-soft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials to represent the core electrons 
[53]
. A 4×4×1 MonkhorstPack
k
-point set was used, the planewave cutoff energy was 350 eV, the maximum symmetry constraints were applied, and spin polarization was not included. A dipole correction scheme was used to ensure the slabs were decoupled. The d-band was determined by projection of the planewaves onto spherical harmonic orbitals, with the cutoff radius at infinity. The d-band center was calculated as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level. Overall, any change in the above procedures or parameters can lead to variations in the DFT modeling results. Therefore, a comparison between values from different papers or different research groups is only valid when identical calculation procedures are used in different studies.
3.3. Case study: DFT modeling of thermodynamic stability of 3d/Pt(111) surfaces
One of the most critical questions in MBS is the relative stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures. As shown earlier in Section 
2.2
, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e. without adsorbates on either surface. Several other investigations of Pt-3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies were covered by a Pt skin 
[68]
,
[69]
,
[70]
. It has been reported experimentally that the presence of adsorbed oxygen can induce Ni segregation in Ni /Pt alloys 
[71]
.
Ruban et al. 
[29]
have demonstrated the ability of using DFT to calculate the segregation energy (
E
seg
) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving force to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. The ability to predict the segregation energy of transition metal alloys stems from two important features revealed previously by Alden et al. 
[72]
: (1) the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components and (2) the surface segregation energy depends strongly on the crystal structure of the alloy components. Ruban et al. 
[29]
have performed DFT calculations of the values of
E
seg
for admetal atoms on many host substrates, utilizing the linear-muffintin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. The calculations also included spin-polarized solutions where magnetic hosts or impurities were involved. If
E
seg
is sufficiently negative, the admetal will segregate to the surface to produce the surface monolayer structure. If
E
seg
is sufficiently positive, the surface layer will be the host metal, leading to the formation of the subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. 
[73]
have also utilized DFT to discuss surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis 
[31]
added to the segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures. Specifically, they investigated whether a strongly bound hydrogen atom could pull the admetal out of a subsurface position. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of
E
seg
, and the difference of the hydrogen binding energy on the surface and subsurface structures. For hydrogen, which bonds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces resulted in hydrogen induced segregation. It is predicted, however, that for adsorbates that have a significantly higher thermodynamic driving force, such as oxygen, CO, and sulphur, adsorbate induced segregation will play a vital role in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures.
In this section the DFT results of the 3d/Pt(111) systems will be utilized to demonstrate the thermodynamic stability of the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and the surface 3d-Pt(111) structures.
Fig. 9
shows the total energy difference
Δ
E
seg
, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures in vacuum, as a function of the surface d-band center of Pt in the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structure. The values of
Δ
E
seg
are positive for all systems, predicting that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the surface 3d-Pt(111) structures in vacuum. There is also a nearly linear trend with respect to the d-band center, with PtTiPt(111) having the largest thermodynamic driving force and PtNiPt(111) having the smallest
Δ
E
seg
. This trend was verified experimentally by comparing the onset temperature for the diffusion of surface Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) and Co atoms in PtCoPt(111) 
[74]
. The PtCoPt(111) system was found to have a lower onset temperature for diffusion than PtNiPt(111). Using BrnstedEvansPolanyi principle, the lower onset temperature supports the larger thermodynamic driving force for Co than Ni, which is consistent with the predicted trend in

Fig. 9. DFT calculations of segregation energies for Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures in vacuum. Based on the definition described in the text, a positive value means that the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structure is thermodynamically stable (from 
[75]
).
The effect on the relative stability of the 3d/Pt(111) surfaces was also calculated when a half monolayer of O or H is present on the surfaces, as shown in
Fig. 10
. The values of
Δ
E
seg
are calculated from the difference in the total energy using the reaction coordinate shown at the top of
Fig. 10
. Similar to the concepts described by Greeley and Mavrikakis 
[31]
, the value of
Δ
E
seg
is related to two terms, the value of
Δ
E
seg
in vacuum and the difference in the hydrogen or oxygen binding energy between the surface and subsurface structures. Based on the definition of
Δ
E
s
, a positive value means that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt structure is more stable, while a negative value indicates that the surface 3d-Pt(111) is more thermodynamically favorable. The DFT results predict that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure is favored in the presence of adsorbed H. In contrast, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of half monolayer O, revealing the thermodynamic driving force for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. The segregation of subsurface Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) has been verified experimentally in the presence of adsorbed O 
[74]
, which will be described in more detail in Section 
5

Based on the definition described in the text, a positive value means that the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structure is stable, while a negative value indicates the 3d-Pt surface structure is thermodynamically favored (from 
[75]
).
In addition, the results in
Fig. 10
also reveal the general similarities and differences between MBS structures on the Pt(111) and Pt(100) substrates. Although the values of the d-band center and
Δ
E
s
are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures remain the same 
[75]
.
3.4. Semi-empirical equation for estimating surface d-band center
Kitchin et al. have developed a semi-empirical correlation to predict the shift of surface d-band centers of MBS without performing DFT calculations 
[40]
. The equation considers the two dominant effects that can lead to the shift in the d-band center in monolayer bimetallic systems, the strain and ligand effects. In the strain effect, the average bond lengths between the metal atoms in the MBS are typically different from those in the parent metals, resulting in changes the orbital overlap and correspondingly electronic properties. In the ligand effect, hetero-metallic bonding interactions between the electronic orbitals of surface atoms and the substrate can result in modification of the surface electronic structures. By taking into account both considerations, an empirical equation is derived that correlates the change in the electronic structures with the characteristic length of bond distance (strain effect) and of d-orbitals (ligand effect) in monolayer bimetallic systems 
[40]

where
V
is the interatomic matrix element that is proportional to the change in the electronic structures,
r
d
is the characteristic length for the overlayer or substrate metal that is related to the spatial extent of the d-orbitals that can be obtained from the Solid State Table in Ref. 
[67]
, and
d
is the internuclear distance between the overlayer and substrate metals. According to the tight binding theory, the d-band width should be proportional to the matrix element, which is confirmed by a linear relationship between the value of
V
and the root mean squared (rms) d-band width with numerous bimetallic surfaces 
[67]
.
In order to correlate the d-band width with the d-band center, Kitchin et al. examined whether the formation of the bimetallic surfaces alters the filling of the surface d-band, as shown earlier in
Fig. 8
. The change in d-band filling is found to be less than 2% in magnitude upon formation of many bimetallic surfaces. Using a rectangular band model, we can argue that if the d-band filling remains constant but the d-band width changes, then the average energy of the d-band (the d-band center) must change to conserve both the d-band filling and the total number of d-states.
Fig. 11
shows the linear correlation between the rms d-band width and the d-band center for both unrelaxed and relaxed slabs of many monometallic and bimetallic systems. The slope of the correlation is nearly 1, as predicted by the rectangular band model. Thus, the d-band becomes wider as it moves down in energy, i.e. the d-band center moves further from the Fermi level. Similarly, the d-band narrows as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level. The linear correlation between the d-band width and d-band center is an important observation because some DFT studies discuss changes in the d-band width (second-order moment of DOS) instead of the d-band center (first-order moment of DOS).

[30]
).
The establishment of the linear relationship in
Fig. 11
allows the estimation of the modification of surface d-band center using Eq.
(3.11)
.

shows a comparison of the shift in the d-band center calculated from the semi-empirical equation and from DFT modeling. The comparison shows a remarkable agreement between the two types of calculations for a wide range of monolayer bimetallic systems 
[40]
. The excellent agreement offers the possibility to quickly estimate the shift in the d-band center, which is related to the modification in chemical activities of bimetallic systems, without performing the more expensive first-principle DFT calculations.

4. Correlating binding energy of adsorbates with surface d-band center
The adsorption properties of many atoms and small molecules on transition metals have been shown by Hammer and Nrskov to depend primarily on the electronic structure of the surface 
[14]
, which is determined by its geometrical structure and chemical composition. It has been shown that the interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces can be considered via a two state orbital mixing picture. The adsorbate orbitals are first broadened by interactions with the broad s-electron band, and then split by strong interactions with the sharper d-band. The authors further demonstrate that changes in the electronic structure of the surface, such as the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, are clearly correlated with changes in the chemical properties of the surface 
[14]
.
In this section we will use several simple atomic and molecular adsorbates, atomic H, atomic O and CO, to demonstrate that the adsorption energy is related to the surface d-band center of the MBS structures. Some of the experimental and theoretical studies are summarized in
Table 2
. We will use these examples to show that there is a nearly linear relationship between the adsorption energy and the surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, with the adsorption energy becoming stronger when the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. The results will illustrate that the formation of MBS modifies the value of the d-band center from that of the parent metal surfaces, with the direction and magnitude of the shift depending on the structure and chemical composition of the bimetallic surfaces. Such correlation provides the opportunity for the rational design of surfaces with desirable chemical properties by synthesizing MBS of specific structures and compositions.

4.1. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and trends in hydrogen binding energy
4.1.1. Surface and subsurface Ni /Pt structures
Through a combination of theory and experiments, the Ni /Pt MBS structures are among the most well-characterized bimetallic systems 
[26]

. As discussed earlier in Section 
2.3
, depending on the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate during or after the deposition of one monolayer Ni, the resulting surfaces can be described as either the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer. A related surface, PtNi(111), can be produced by depositing one monolayer of Pt on a Ni(111) substrate at 600 K 
[78]
. In this section we will use the adsorption energies of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces to demonstrate the unique properties of the surface and subsurface MBS structures.
Fig. 13
shows a comparison of the Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) spectra of H2 from clean Pt(111), surface monolayer NiPtPt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and a thick Ni(111) film epitaxially grown on Pt(111). It is apparent that the desorption temperature of H2 is significantly different upon the formation of bimetallic surfaces. H2 desorbs from the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure at a lower temperature than that from Pt(111) and Ni(111), while the desorption from the NiPt(111) surface structure occurs at a higher temperature than that of either parent metal surfaces.

[87]
).
Since the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(111) and Pt(111) is not an activated process 
[81]
, the desorption temperature of H2 from these surfaces should, in principle, be related to the respective metalH bond strengths. If one assumes that H2 dissociation on the bimetallic surfaces is also not activated, then desorption temperatures in
Fig. 13
indicate a weaker metalH bond on subsurface PtNiPt(111) and a stronger metalH bond on surface NiPtPt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).
Parallel DFT modeling is performed to understand the origin of the different hydrogen binding energy (HBE) from the four surfaces in
Fig. 14
, using the Dacapo-2.6 code and with 2×2 super cells of 3-layer slabs at a 0.25 ML coverage of hydrogen atoms 
[26]
.
Fig. 14
(a) shows the density of states, which is decomposed into contributions from different atomic orbitals by projection of the planewaves onto an atomic orbital basis set as implemented by the Dacapo software, of the four surfaces. A comparison of the DOS clearly reveals significant differences in the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. Comparing to Pt(111), the presence of subsurface Ni in PtNiPt(111) tends to increase the intensity of low energy states at the expense of higher energy states in the surface Pt atoms, thus shifting the average energy of the surface Pt d-band away from the Fermi level. In contrast, the NiPt(111) d-band was narrower than Pt(111) and Ni(111), moving the d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

(b) Calculated hydrogen binding energies vs. the d-band center of the surface metal atoms for relaxed slabs and unrelaxed slabs. In each case, the slab is frozen in the HBE calculation, as described in the text. The unrelaxed slabs are included to demonstrate the effect of relaxation on the HBE (from 
[26]
).
Fig. 14
(b) shows the calculated HBE values as a function of the surface d-band center of various Ni /Pt surfaces. In addition to the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures, DFT modeling is also performed on intermixed NiPt surface structures by incorporation of Ni into the Pt surface layer (e.g. Ni1Pt3, Ni3Pt1). The DFT results in
Fig. 14
(b) show an approximately linear correlation between the HBE values and surface d-band center for both relaxed and unrelaxed surfaces. It is important to point out that the relaxation of the surface layers has a negligible effect on the calculated HBE values for the pure metal slabs (Pt and Ni). However, the HBE values on the bimetallic surfaces show a significant sensitivity to relaxation, as does the center of the d-band. In each case, relaxation reduces the magnitude of the HBE, with a corresponding change in the d-band center. The results in
Fig. 14
(b), as well as DFT modeling for many other MBS systems, indicate that allowing the surface layer or layers to relax is a critical requirement when performing DFT modeling on MBS.
The trend in
Fig. 14
(b) also reveals that the incorporation of Ni into the Pt surface layer increases the HBE on that surface, with all such surfaces (e.g. Ni1Pt3, Ni3Pt1) showing a higher HBE than pure Pt. A corresponding shift of the d-band center closer to the Fermi is observed for each surface. The full Ni-monolayer shows a HBE value that is slightly stronger than Ni(111), which is consistent with the TPD measurements. Most importantly, the comparison of the DFT modeling (
Fig. 14
(b)) and TPD (
Fig. 13
) results provides verification of the existence of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. The presence of subsurface Ni in Pt(111) is consistent with other studies of NiPt alloys 
[82]
,
[83]
,
[84]
,
[85]
. For example, for a Pt0.5Ni0.5 alloy, it has been reported that the surface is 88% Pt, the second layer is 91% Ni, and the third layer is 65% Pt 
[82]
. The stability of Pt-terminated surfaces is also consistent with the DFT modeling of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface stability in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, as described earlier in Section 
3.3
.
In order to verify the correlation between the DFT modeling and TPD results, Kitchin et al. 
[26]
calculated the heats of dissociative adsorption from the values of HBE on Pt(111), Ni(111), PtNiPt(111) and NiPt(111) surfaces. The barrier for desorption in this case is identical to the heat of dissociative adsorption of H2, and is equal to the gas phase dissociation energy minus twice the metalH bond strength. These values are compared to the heat of adsorption from the TPD measurements using the Redhead equation for second-order desorption 
[86]
. Identical trend is observed for the four surfaces between DFT modeling and TPD experiments.
To further confirm the unique properties of the Pt-terminated PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, TPD studies were performed for the desorption of H2 from the PtNi(111) surface prepared by depositing Pt on Ni(111) 
[78]
. As shown in
Fig. 15
, the desorption temperature of H2 is at 234 K from ML PtNi(111), which is lower than either Ni(111) or Pt(111) and is consistent with the lower desorption temperature from the PtNiPt(111) MBS structure. More about the general similarity and minor difference between the PtNi(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces will be discussed in Section 
5.1
in the reactions of alkene molecules on these two types of surfaces.

4.1.2. Trends in HBE on 3d-Pt(111) and Pt-3d-Pt(111) MBS structures
Similar to the Ni /Pt bimetallic surfaces, the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are thermodynamically stable in vacuum and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen, as shown earlier in the DFT results in Section 
3.3
. The values of HBE on these subsurface structures have been calculated using DFT 
[28]
, which reveals that, as the 3d metal moves toward the left of the Periodic Table from Ni to Ti, the surface d-band center of Pt-3d-Pt(111) gradually shifts away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker HBE as compared to that on Pt(111). In order to further understand the general trend in HBE on different 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, DFT modeling and TPD experiments have been performed on selected MBS structures of Ti, Fe, Co and Cu surfaces on Pt(111) 
[87]
.
Fig. 16
compares the HBE on the surface and subsurface monolayers of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu surfaces, using the VASP code with a 3x3 unit cell of 4 layer slab, with the top two layers allowed for relaxation. For each bimetallic system, the d-band center of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is further away from the Fermi level than the parent metals, resulting in a weaker HBE. On the other hand, the d-band center of the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS is closer to the Fermi level than the parent metals, leading to a stronger HBE. The exception is the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces, where the values of d-band center and HBE of PtCuPt(111) and CuPt(111) show relatively minor differences. This could be attributed to difficulties in describing Cu as a transition metal due to the high degree of d-band filling, as will be illustrated later for other bimetallic systems involving Cu, Ag or Au.

The corresponding H2 TPD results are shown in
Fig. 17
for the subsurface and surface MBS structures of Co/Pt(111) and Fe/Pt(111). Consistent with the DFT prediction, the desorption temperatures from the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) subsurface structures are lower than the parent metals, and those from the CoPt(111) and FePt(111) surface structures are higher than the parent metals. Combining these results with those shown earlier for the Ni /Pt(111) surfaces (
Fig. 13
), it is clear that the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on Pt(111) can be either decreased or increased by the formation of the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface or 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures.

4.1.3. Monolayer Ni on Pt(111), Ru(0001) and W(110)  strain and ligand effects
As discussed earlier, the modification on the d-band center from the formation of bimetallic surfaces can be related to the combination of strain and ligand effects. The surface monolayers of NiPt(111), NiRu(0001), and NiW(110) are bimetallic surfaces where the strain and ligand effects work in opposite directions. The comparison of these surfaces with Ni(111) provides a good example on how the two effects lead to the overall modification on the surface d-band center and HBE. As illustrated in
Fig. 18
, a Ni monolayer on W(110) is under substantial tensile strain (>10%) as compared to Ni(111), resulting in a narrowing in the d-band. At the same time, there is a significant broadening of the d-band due to the bonding interaction with the W substrate, as calculated from the interatomic matrix element using the semi-empirical equation
(3.11)
by Kitchin et al. 
[40]
. The net effect is dominated by the ligand effect, leading to a broadening of the d-band and correspondingly a shifting of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, from 1.22 eV on Ni(111) to 1.64 eV on NiW(110). For a Ni monolayer on Ru(0001), the tensile strain is similar to that on W(110), but the ligand effect is weaker 
[40]
. Consequently, the band-narrowing due to the strain effect and the band-broadening effect due to the ligand effect cancels out, resulting a value of d-band center (1.18 eV) that is very similar to Ni(111). In contrast, for a Ni monolayer on Pt(111), the tensile strain is similar to the other two substrates, but the ligand effect is the weakest 
[40]
. The net effect is dominated by the strain effect, leading to a narrowing of the d-band and a shifting of the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, from 1.22 eV on Ni(111) to 0.80 eV on NiPt(111). As summarized in
Fig. 18
, the combination of the ligand and strain effects leads to the following trend of the Ni surface d-band center, NiW(110) < NiRu(0001)  Ni(111) < NiPt(111).

Fig. 19
shows the corresponding H2 TPD measurements from the NiW(110) and NiRu(0001) surfaces 
[77]
. As shown earlier in
Fig. 13
, the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiPt(111) surface is 355 K, slightly higher than that from the Ni(111) film at 311 K. As shown in
Fig. 19
, the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiW(110) is centered at 265 K, and that from the monolayer NiRu(0001) is centerd at 332 K. Therefore, the TPD experiments show the following trend in the desorption temperature, NiW(110) < NiRu(0001)  Ni(111) < NiPt(111), qualitatively confirming the predicted trend from the DFT prediction.

4.1.4. Other bimetallic surfaces
In addition to the examples shown in previous sections, the DFT correlation between surface d-band center and HBE has been established on a wide range of other MBS structures. Pallassana et al. 
[16]
,
[34]
,
[41]
,
[88]
,
[89]
,
[90]
have performed extensive DFT calculations of HBE on PdRe bimetallic systems, including monolayer PdRe(0001), RePd(111), and intermixed RexPd1x layers on both Re(0001) and Pd(111).
Fig. 20
shows the nearly linear relationship between the HBE and the weighted d-band center of these bimetallic surfaces 
[41]
. These authors also investigated the effect between hydrogen bonding to a single type of metal atoms and to both Re and Pd metals. The results in
Fig. 20
illustrate that the correlation of the HBE with d-band center holds for both types of bonding configurations.

shows the correlation of HBE with surface d-band center for several classes of bimetallic surfaces, including the subsurface configurations of a wide range of admetals on the closed-packed substrate of Pt(111), Pd(111), and Rh(111), and Re(0001)-based MBS structures. A nearly linear trend is observed for all the bimetallic systems. The three individual lines were drawn by the authors to highlight the different slopes for bimetallic systems on the three different substrates, Pt, Pd and Rh, which are expected due to difference in the coupling matrix elements of the three substrates 
[32]
. More about the different slopes will be discussed later for the binding energies of alkenes on various bimetallic surfaces in Section 
5.1
, where the effect of differing coupling matrix elements becomes more significant.

Ogura et al. 
[91]
reported that hydrogen adsorption on surface monolayer AgPt(111) and AuPt(111) act similarly to that on Ag(111) and Au(111) single crystal surfaces. This phenomenon is explained by DFT modeling, which shows that the d-band center of AgPt(111) and AuPt(111) change only slightly as compared to Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces, respectively. These results are consistent with HBE values shown earlier (
Fig. 16
) for CuPt(111) and PtCuPt(111), which are similar to Cu(111). Altogether these results confirm that the bimetallic surfaces containing Cu, Ag and Au behave differently from those containing Group IV-VIII transition metals.
Fig. 22
shows an extension of the DFT trend from MBS systems to transition metal carbides 
[39]
. This is an attempt to explain the observations that transition metal carbides, such as Mo2C, often show similar chemical properties as those of Pt-group metals 
[92]
,
[93]
. The correlation of HBE with the surface d-band center appears to extend to the carbide surfaces, which suggests the possibility of using the values of surface d-band to predict chemical properties of different carbide surfaces. The combination of bimetallic and carbide surfaces expands the d-band center values from near the Fermi level to approximately 3 eV below, which offers a wide range of selections for choosing materials with desirable values of electronic and chemical properties.

Finally, the DFT results in
Fig. 21
,
Fig. 22
both identified Pt/W as the surface with one of the lowest HBE values. This has been confirmed experimentally by Zellner et al. with H2 TPD on the PtW(110) surface monolayer 
[94]
. The desorption of H2 occurs at 142 K, representing the lowest desorption temperature among all the MBS structures that have been studied experimentally.
From the results discussed in Section 
4.1
, it is apparent that bimetallic surfaces with the subsurface monolayer structures bond to hydrogen more weakly than the parent metals. Typically a weaker HBE would suggest a higher activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 based on correlations from simple dissociation reactions 
[37]
,
[95]
,
[96]
. However, as demonstrated by Greeley and Mavrikakis in
Fig. 23
 [32]
, the subsurface monolayer structures have relatively low activation barriers for H2 dissociation. Even though the HBE on these surfaces could be as low as those on the relative inert metals such as Cu and Au, the activation barriers for H2 dissociation are much lower on the subsurface monolayer structures. As pointed out by the authors, the subsurface structures offer the unique combination of facile H2 dissociation and weakly bonded hydrogen, which should have significant effect in reactions involving H transfer, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes, as will be demonstrated in Section 
5.1
.

4.2. Dissociative adsorption of oxygen and oxygen-induced segregation
4.2.1. Trends in oxygen binding energy on 3d/Pt surfaces
In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron

[105]
have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement 
[100]
,
[101]
,
[104]
. These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level 
[95]
,
[106]
. The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) 
[107]
. All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.
Menning et al. have performed DFT calculations to compare the general trend in the OBE on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and surface 3d-Pt(111) structures 
[74]
.
Fig. 24
shows the comparison of OBE as a function of surface d-band center on various Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt(111) MBS configurations. There is a nearly linear trend in the OBE on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt structure. The OBE values of all subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are weaker than that on pure Pt(111), with the weakest binding energy on PtTiPt and the strongest on PtNiPt. For the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer configuration, there is again a nearly linear trend in the OBE values with respect to the surface d-band center. However, this trend is opposite to that of the subsurface configuration, with the TiPt(111) surface having the strongest binding energy while the NiPt(111) surface the weakest. Overall, the OBE values on all the 3d-Pt(111) surface structures are stronger than that on pure Pt(111), suggesting that these bimetallic surface structures should have lower activity toward the ORR than Pt(111) due to poisoning by the strongly bonded oxygen atoms.

The DFT results in
Fig. 24
also reveal two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures the surface atom is Pt (5d metal), while 3d is the surface metal in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures. The different slopes for the two types of structures are due to the Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, resulting in an increase in the kinetic energy that is proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element
V
a
d
2
. This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, which generally leads to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d and 5d metals. The differences become even more obvious for larger adsorbes, such as hydrocarbons as will be illustrated in Section 
5.1
.
In order to provide insights into the unique properties of the Pt-skin electrocatalysts, Xu et al. have performed detailed DFT modeling of adsorption and dissociation of O and O2 on various surface structures of Pt3Co(111) and Pt3Fe(111) alloys 
[95]
,
[106]
. In this work the Pt-skin was modelled by one monolayer of Pt on either the Pt3Co(111) or Pt3Fe(111) substrate. The authors also compared the properties of 2% stressed Pt(111) to determine the effect of strain due to lattice mismatch between the surface Pt atoms with the bulk alloy substrate.
Fig. 25
shows a correlation between the OBE and the surface d-band center of various surfaces. The DFT results show that the d-band center of the intermixed Pt3Co(111) surface is much closer to the Fermi level than that of the Pt-skin structure, leading to a stronger bonding of O atoms on the former surface. These authors also confirmed the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship between the OBE and activation barrier for the dissociation of O2 on the various surface structures, suggesting the possibility to correlate ORR activity with the value of OBE 
[95]
,
[106]
. Results from DFT calculations by Norskov et al. further confirmed that the ORR activity of the cathode electrocatalysts can be related to the binding energy of atomic oxygen on bimetallic surfaces

4.2.2. Oxygen-induced segregation in Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structures
While there is a general agreement that the ORR activity can be significantly improved by modifying Pt electrodes with a layer of subsurface 3d metal, the stability of these bimetallic systems remains unclear. Results from LEED studies revealed that alloy surfaces, such as Pt78Ni22(111), Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibited a pure Pt outermost layer with a 3d-rich layer underneath 
[25]
. In the presence of oxygen, however, Bardi et al. observed the formation of bulk-like Co oxides on the surface of both the (100) and (111) faces of Pt80Co20, suggesting the segregation of the subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen 
[108]
,
[109]
.
Menning et al. have performed DFT calculations and experimental measurements to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the segregation of 3d metals in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures 
[74]
. As shown earlier in
Fig. 10
, the 3d-Pt(111) surface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the corresponding Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures in the presence of 0.5 ML of adsorbed O atoms. The stability of the Pt-3d bimetallic systems can be determined by comparing the difference in total energy,
Δ
E
, between the subsurface and surface configurations when exposed to a half monolayer of oxygen. The total energy difference should be proportional to the heat of reaction and should allow the prediction of which configuration is thermodynamically favored in the presence of adsorbed oxygen atoms. As shown in
Fig. 10
, in each case the 3d-Pt(111) surface configuration is lower in energy than that of the corresponding subsurface configuration, indicating a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of the subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures to produce the 3d-Pt(111) surfaces.
Using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), Menning et al. used the onset of the

(CoO) mode to verify the segregation of subsurface Ni or Co from PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) 
[74]
. AES measurements were also performed in the presence of oxygen on PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) to estimate the activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms.
Fig. 26
(a) shows the AES measurements of oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni from PtNiPt(111), which were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni /Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures in order to estimate the activation barrier (
E
a
) for transforming the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure to the surface NiPt(111) in the presence of oxygen. The AES Ni /Pt ratio in
Fig. 26
(a) is renormalized in such a way that a value of 0 represents only Pt in the first layer and 1 represents only Ni in the first layer. The rate of Ni segregation was estimated based on the time required to reach a Ni /Pt ratio of 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature. The

for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms. The difference between the

values for Ni and Co suggests that the magnitude of the activation barrier is related to the difference in the total energy between, O/3d-PtPt and O/Pt-3d-Pt, with a smaller thermodynamic driving force in Ni /Pt(111) leading to a larger
E
a
for the segregation of subsurface Ni. As shown earlier in
Fig. 10
, the thermodynamic driving force becomes larger as the 3d metals move from Ni to the left side of the Periodic Table, which in turn suggests that the activation barrier for the segregation of other subsurface 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than that for Co or Ni 
[74]
.
4.2.3. Other bimetallic surfaces
The examples in the previous section show that the 3d monolayer in Pt-3d-Pt(111) segregate from the subsurface to the surface region in the presence of oxygen. In contrast, the AgCu(110) monolayer surface provides an opposite example, where the presence of oxygen induces the inward diffusion of the surface Ag atoms into the subsurface region. Hirsimaki and Chorkendorff reported that, upon the deposition of Ag on Cu(100) in vacuum, Ag replaces Cu within the top layer to produce a surface alloy 
[110]
. The O2 dissociation over Ag/Cu(100) is significantly lower than that of clean Cu(100) 
[110]
, mainly due to steric blocking of the surface defects on the Cu(100) face by Ag atoms. The exposure of O2 to AgCu(100) at surface temperatures between 320473 K resulted in an induced segregation/diffusion of the surface constituents 
[111]
. Utilizing AES along with Ar+ sputtering, it was determined that Cu segregated to the surface to produce Cu2O after exposure to O2 while driving Ag into the subsurface region and remaining in the metallic Ag state. The oxygen-induced diffusion of Ag was attributed to the significant thermodynamic difference in the heat of formation between Cu2O (169 kJ /mol) and that of the most stable Ag oxide Ag2O (31.1 kJ/mol). It is most likely that similar inward diffusion should occur for those bimetallic systems where the difference in the heats of oxide formation is larger than the segregation energy of the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.
In addition to being an important parameter for identifying the ORR activity, the value of OBE can also be a useful indicator in identifying catalytic materials for other reactions that involve the adsorption of oxygen, such as CO oxidation and NO reduction reactions 
[65]
. Greeley and Norskov 
[112]
have provided a comprehensive database of the OBE values and shifts in the surface d-band center for many MBS systems. Using these databases they developed a relatively simple model to estimate the values of OBE on bimetallic surface alloys on different metal substrates. In this model the change in the OBE is scaled to the shift in the surface d-band center of the corresponding MBS structures. This model allows the quick estimation of the binding energy of oxygen on the 3-fold site made of AAB surface mixtures on substrate A (designated as AABA) or substrate B (designated as AABB), where A and B represent different transition metals.
Fig. 27
shows a comparison of the OBE values obtained from this simple model and from full DFT calculations 
[112]
, which shows a remarkable agreement with hundreds of bimetallic alloy surfaces. The systems that show deviation of more than 0.5 eV are labeled in
Fig. 27
, which are alloy systems that involve the Cu, Ag, and Au elements. This is a reoccurring observation and further confirms that the d-band center might be inadequate to describe these three metals due to their d-band filling.

4.3. Adsorption of CO and trend in binding energy of molecular adsorbates
4.3.1. Correlation of desorption temperature of CO with surface d-band center
The adsorption and desorption of carbon monoxide have a long history of being used to probe the physical and chemical properties of surfaces, due to the fact that the bonding configurations of adsorbed CO are sensitive to the electronic structures of metal surfaces. The TPD measurements of the desorption temperature of CO are a simple and useful way to determine the bonding of CO on surfaces. Unlike the complications from the second-order recombinatory desorption of H2, the desorption of CO is first-order on most surfaces, with the shift in the peak desorption temperature corresponding directly to changes in the activation energy for desorption if the pre-exponential factor is a constant 
[86]
. Assuming that the adsorption of CO is not activated, which is valid on most transition metal surfaces, the activation energy of desorption is equal to the adsorption energy. Therefore, a shift in the CO desorption temperature is related to a change in the adsorption energy, which offers a direct and simple way to determine the effect of bimetallic formation.
Many research groups, especially Goodman and coworkers, have performed systematic TPD studies of CO desorption from a wide range of MBS structures

,
[116]
,
[117]
,
[118]
,
[119]
,
[120]
. The experimental results from these studies clearly indicated that the desorption temperature of CO from the bimetallic surfaces is different from that of parent metals, and that the change in the desorption temperature is related to the modification of the electronic structures due to bimetallic formation. These results have been discussed and debated in depth in many papers and reviews

and will not be covered in the current review. The purpose of the current section is to use the adsorption/desorption of CO as an example to demonstrate the correlation between the molecular adsorption energy and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
Hammer at al. 
[15]
have performed DFT calculations to correlate the change in the CO desorption temperature with surface core level shift for several MBS structures, as shown in
Fig. 28
. The shift in the CO desorption temperature is from the experimental data of Pd, Ni and Cu monolayers on many substrates by Rodriguez and Goodman 
[116]
. The nearly linear correlation clearly demonstrates that the desorption temperature of CO is a useful probe to determine the changes in the electronic structures of MBS. These authors also proposed that the adsorption energy of CO is related to the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces 
[15]
. Hennig et al. have also shown that the variations in the surface core level shifts of bimetallic monolayer systems are correlated with the differences in the core level binding energy of the monolayer surface and an unperturbed surface, termed the adlayer core-level shift (ACLS) 
[122]
. The ACLS is the experimental equivalent of the d-band shift, which is determined as the difference between the d-band center of the metal surface with and without the admetal monolayer.

and estimated the shift in peak desorption temperature with respect to desorption from the pure overlayer metal. DFT calculations were performed for each bimetallic surface to determine the change in the surface d-band center as compared to the pure metal. The results are summarized in
Fig. 29
, where the shift in CO desorption peak temperature is correlated with the shift in the surface d-band center using either relaxed or unrelaxed slab calculations. The trend in
Fig. 29
confirms that the binding energy of CO, as experimentally determined from the desorption temperature of CO, is related to the surface d-band center for a wide range of bimetallic surfaces. These results also suggest that the TPD measurement of molecularly adsorbed CO offers a simple experimental method if one needs to estimate the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift in MBS structures.

4.3.2. Adsorption of CO on Pt-based and Ru-based bimetallic surfaces
The facile oxidation of CO to C O2 is a critical reaction in improving the CO-tolerance of anode electrocatalysts in PEM fuel cells. Currently PtRu bimetallic alloys are the leading CO-tolerant electrocatalysts 
[123]
, resulting in many surface science and DFT studies of the interactions of CO with the PtRu bimetallic surfaces, as well as with Pt-based and Ru-based bimetallic surfaces. In this section we will provide a brief summary of literature in this area and conclude with some unanswered questions.
Koschel et al. used angle resolved UV spectroscopy to show that monolayer Cu modified Ru(0001) resulted in an increased interaction of CO with the substrate as compared to Cu(111) 
[124]
, although the interaction is still weaker than CO on pure Ru(0001). The increase in the CO binding energy on the CuRu(0001) bimetallic surface was attributed to Cu 3d states coupling strongly to the Ru(0001) surface states. Hager et al. 
[125]
noticed a similar strong coupling for the Cu/Ru(0001) surface while examining PdCu surface alloys on Ru(0001). Engelhardt et al. 
[126]
,
[127]
examined the effects of monolayer Cr modification of Ru(0001). They found that for Cr deposited and annealed between 7001000 K, Cr and Ru formed a surface alloy that enhanced the activity of CO dissociation as compared to Ru(0001).
Among the Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, Colen et al. 
[128]
examined the reaction rate of CO oxidation on submonolayer Cu modified Pt(111). It was found that the Cu modification of Pt(111) enhanced the CO oxidation rate to C O2. The enhancement was attributed to decreases in the apparent adsorption, desorption, and surface reaction activation energies. This conclusion was consistent with the DFT calculations by Mavrikakais et al. 
[61]
and Hammer et al. 
[15]
, who reported that the CO binding energy was weaker on Cu/Pt(111) than on pure Pt(111).
The most relevant bimetallic surface in PEM fuel cells, PtRu, has been synthesized using various methods, including the reduction of H2PtCl6 on Ru(0001) 
[129]
,
[130]
, the evaporation of Pt on Ru(0001) 
[131]
, and the deposition of Ru on Pt(111) and Pt(100) 
[132]
,
[133]
,
[134]
. Behm and coworkers have performed detailed studies of the adsorption and desorption of CO on Pt/Ru(0001) bimetallic surfaces utilizing TPD and STM 
[131]
. Their results indicated that, in the absence of water or hydroxyls, the CO binding energy on Pt/Ru(0001) was significantly reduced as compared to Ru(0001) or Pt(111). Additionally, Schlapka et al. 
[135]
examined the CO adsorption on Pt/Ru(0001) using IRAS and found a significant decrease in CO adsorption on well annealed Pt/Ru(001) surfaces as compared to surfaces that were not annealed, as shown in
Fig. 30
. They attributed the decrease in CO adsorption to increase in size of the Pt islands and an increase in their density when annealed, therefore causing the CO to adsorb at straight PtRu steps that were not present when the Pt was more dispersed in less dense smaller clusters. In both papers, the significant decrease in CO and CO2 desorption temperatures was cited as a likely explanation to the significantly enhanced CO oxidation activity of Pt/Ru fuel cell electrocatalysts.

Desai and Neurock 
[136]
utilized DFT to model CO oxidation on Pt and Ru/Pt bimetallic surfaces. These authors have identified two competing mechanisms that could attribute to the enhancement of CO oxidation on the Ru/Pt bimetallic surface: (1) Similar to the correlation of CO binding energy with surface d-band center (shown earlier in
Fig. 29
), some Ru/Pt bimetallic structures weaken the interaction of CO with the surface and therefore reduce the activation energy for CO oxidation. (2) The addition of Ru acts as a promoter for the oxidation of water, which enhances a bifunctional mechanism that promotes the oxidation of CO through a COOH* intermediate. However, as pointed out by Desai and Neurock 
[136]
, there is still debate over the dominant mechanism for the increased activity of CO oxidation. In this particular case, the comparison between the DFT modeling, performed in the presence of water and hydroxyl groups, and the UHV experiments is not straightforward. Furthermore, the stability of the various Pt/Ru structures, such as the surface and subsurface monolayer configurations, is not well understood in the presence of adsorbed CO, surface hydroxyl, and in the liquid environment with applied electrochemical potentials. More experimental studies and DFT calculations under realistic fuel cell operating conditions are needed to further understand the mechanism responsible for the enhanced CO-tolerance of the Pt/Ru bimetallic surfaces.
5. Correlating chemical activities with surface d-band center
The examples used in Section 
4
provide a clear correlation of the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates with the d-band center of MBS structures. In this section we will extend the correlation of surface d-band center to the chemical activities of the bimetallic surfaces using two types of surface reactions. The first one is the hydrogenation of molecules containing the C=C bond, which should require the surface to interact weakly with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples given in Section 
4
, the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures should be preferred over either Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which should in principle require the surface to bond relatively strongly to both oxygenates and to the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this case the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures should be favored as compared to the corresponding parent metals and to the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.
Similar to the format in Section 
4
, the examples in this section will attempt to compare results from UHV experiments and DFT modeling, with a focus on correlating hydrogenation and reforming activities with the surface d-band center. For this reason many of the elegant examples of reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as the pyramidal monolayer surfaces by Madey and coworkers 
[9]
, and the Sn/Pt surfaces by Koel and coworkers 
[17]
, just to name a few, will not be covered in this review. We have summarized in
Table 3
reactions of many molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, including those that will not be reviewed here. Interested readers are encouraged to read the relevant papers in
Table 3
for the novel chemical activities of bimetallic surfaces.

5.1. Adsorption and hydrogenation of hydrocarbons containing C=C bond
5.1.1. Linear alkenes
5.1.1.1. Ethylene
The reaction of ethylene was used as a probe molecule to investigate the chemical properties of Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces by Fruhberger et al. 
[137]
.
Fig. 31
shows a comparison of the TPD spectra of the H2 product from the decomposition of ethylene on Pt(111), a Ni(111) thin film epitaxially grown on Pt(111), and a PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer. As expected, the Pt(111) and Ni(111) surfaces are active toward the decomposition of ethylene, as indicated by the production of relative intense H2 peaks. In contrast, the H2 peak area from PtNiPt(111) is nearly negligible, indicating that the subsurface structure is nearly inert toward the decomposition of ethylene. The results in
Fig. 31
represent one of the first examples that convincingly demonstrate the unique chemical activities of MBS structures, which are distinctively different from those of either parent metals.

In order to confirm the unusual TPD results, Fruhberger et al. 
[137]
performed vibrational studies of ethylene on the three surfaces.
Fig. 32
shows the HREELS results following the adsorption of ethylene on PtNiPt(111) at 80 K and after heating to higher temperatures. The peak positions and the relative intensities of the vibrational features at 80 and 200 K are indicative of weakly
π
-bonded ethylene, which undergoes reversible molecular desorption by 300 K. HREELS measurements were also performed in the same study following the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene on Pt(111) and the Ni(111) film 
[137]
. The results on Pt(111) confirm the literature data that ethylene undergoes decomposition to produce the ethylidyne intermediate, which further decomposes to produce H2 and atomic carbon at higher temperatures. On the Ni(111) film ethylene decomposes to produce acetylene, which also undergoes further decomposition to produce H2 and atomic carbon. These observations are consistent with the TPD results, clearly indicating that the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure interacts very weakly with ethylene.

In order to verify that the unique property of PtNiPt(111) is due to the interaction of Pt atoms with the subsurface Ni, Khan et al. have performed TPD and HREELS studies of the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene on Ni(111) with one monolayer surface Pt atoms 
[80]
. The degree of ethylene decomposition on monolayer PtNi(111) is determined to be significantly less than on either Ni(111) or Pt(111), consistent with the results of PtNiPt(111). These studies indicate that in both cases the weaker interaction of between ethylene and the surface Pt atoms is related to the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. Similarly, Egawa et al. 
[138]
showed that monolayer Pt epitaxially grown on Ni(100) results in a narrowing of the surface d-band states. This in turn weakens the ethylene binding energy on the monolayer PtNi(100) surface.
The weaker interaction of ethylene on PtNiPt(111), as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), was confirmed by DFT calculations of ethylene binding energy on these surfaces 
[139]
. As shown in
Fig. 33
the binding energy of ethylene on PtNiPt(111) is weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The results also illustrate different slopes for the 3d, 4d and 5d surface metals in the correlation of binding energy with the surface d-band center. As explained earlier in Section 
4.2
, the coupling matrix element in the DFT modeling varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d, and 5d orbitals 
[139]
. This variation is relatively minor for small adsrobates such as atomic H, leading to a nearly linear trend in the HBE with the d-band center of 3d, 4d, and 5d metals. However, such variation becomes more significant for the interaction with larger adsorbates. Therefore, for correlation of molecular binding energy with surface d-band center, it is necessary to draw separate slopes for MBS structures with 3d, 4d, and 5d surface metals, as in the case in
Fig. 33
. In addition to calculating the ethylene binding energies, Goda et al. have also calculated the binding energies of other C2 species, including acetylene, vinyl (C2H2) and ethyl (C2H4), on all the surfaces in
Fig. 33
 [139]
. The trends in binding energy vs. d-band center of these C2 species are very similar to those for ethylene.

[94]
).
DFT calculations also predict that several other MBS structures, such as monolayer PdMo(110) and PtW(110) surfaces, should also bond to ethylene very weakly 
[94]
. Zellner et al. performed TPD and HREELS studies to confirm the DFT predictions 
[94]
.
Fig. 34
shows the desorption of the H2 product following the decomposition of ethylene on Mo(110), thick Pd(111) film, and surface monolayer PdMo(110). Based on the desorption peak areas of H2, the degree of ethylene decomposition on monolayer PdMo(110) is significantly less than either Mo(110) or Pd(111) 
[94]
, confirming the DFT predictions. TPD experiments monitoring the decomposition of ethylene on the monolayer PtW(110) bimetallic surface show the identical trend, with a significant decrease in the decomposition of ethylene on monolayer PtW(110) as compared to either W(110) or Pt(111) 
[94]
. Further investigations of the monolayer PtW(110) system with HREELS reveal that ethylene adsorbs in the more strongly di-
σ
bonded configuration on both W(110) and Pt(111), but in the more weakly
π
-bonded configuration on monolayer PtW(110) 
[94]
. The results from these combined experimental and DFT studies confirm that the d-band center can be used to predict the binding energies of ethylene on MBS structures.

Similar trends have been observed in the DFT modeling of the adsorption and reactions of ethylene on monolayer Pd on Re(0001), Ru(0001), and Au(111) surfaces by Pallassana and Neurock 
[34]
.
Fig. 35
shows that on surfaces that exhibit a shift in the center of d-band away from the Fermi level, Pd/Re(0001) and Pd/Ru(0001) as compared to that of Pd(111), both ethylene and hydrogen bond more weakly than on Pd(111). The hydrogenation of ethylene to ethyl is examined through the addition of an adsorbed hydrogen atom into the CH bond as well as by the
β
-hydride elimination reaction of the ethyl intermediate. It is found that surfaces with weaker molecule/surface interactions with both ethylene and hydrogen demonstrate an increased activity and lower activation barrier for the hydrogenation reaction. Similarly, the surface that exhibits shift in the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, Pd/Au(111), the binding energies of both ethylene and hydrogen both increase as compared to Pd(111). The higher binding energies lead to an increase in the activity and a decrease in the activation barrier for the dehydrogenation of ethylene to vinyl. One of the important conclusions from this study is that surfaces with the d-band shifting toward the Fermi level are more reactive toward the dehydrogenation reaction, while those with the d-band center moving away from the Fermi level are more active toward the hydrogenation reactions. Such correlation of the hydrogenation activity with the d-band center will become more obvious in the examples shown below.

5.1.1.2. 1-butene and 1-hexene
DFT calculations of the binding energy of 1-butene are shown in
Fig. 36
for several subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) and surface 3d-Pt(111) structures 
[140]
. Two separate trends can be observed between the binding energy and d-band center, one for the Pt-3d-Pt(111) and Pt(111) where the surface atoms are Pt, and another one for 3d-Pt(111) where the surface layer is 3d metals. Except for the Cu/Pt(111) systems, one common observation in
Fig. 36
is that the binding energy of the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure is weaker than both Pt(111) and the corresponding surface 3d-Pt(111) structure. This is consistent with the trends discussed earlier for the binding energies of atomic H, atomic O, and ethylene on the corresponding surface and subsurface structures. DFT calculations of the binding energies have also been performed for 1-hexene on these MBS structures, which reveal similar trends as for 1-butene

The observation of weakly bonded alkenes and atomic H suggests that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures should be more active toward the hydrogenation of alkenes. Murillo et al. 
[141]
performed TPD studies following the reaction of 1-butene and 1-hexene with preadsorbed H on the PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. The results reveal that only the subsurface PtNiPt(111) is active for the hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene under UHV conditions 
[141]
.
Fig. 37
shows the production of the dehydrogenation products, butane and hexane, from PtNiPt(111) with and without preadsorbed hydrogen. In the absence of preadsorbed hydrogen, the reaction is termed self-hydrogenation (disproportionation reaction), where a fraction of adsorbed alkenes dehydrogenates to produce hydrogen for the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. The comparison in
Fig. 37
shows that self-hydrogenation occurs for 1-hexene but not for 1-butene, and that the hydrogenation yield is significantly enhanced with preadsorbed hydrogen atoms 
[141]

).
Another objective for that study is to determine the effect of increasing chain length of alkenes on the hydrogenation activity 
[141]
. For weakly
π
-bonded alkenes, such as ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, the effect of increasing the hydrocarbon chain length is to increase the desorption temperature of alkene molecules from the surface. For each additional CH2 unit in the hydrocarbon chain length, approximately an extra 30 kJ of energy is needed for thermal desorption 
[142]
. This phenomenon was found to play an important role in the hydrogenation and self-hydrogenation reactions of alkenes on PtNiPt(111). For ethylene, neither self-hydrogenation nor hydrogenation is detected 
[141]
. For 1-butene, the self-hydrogenation is not detected but hydrogenation is observed, as illustrated in
Fig. 37
. For 1-hexene, both self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation occur on PtNiPt(111). For the self-hydrogenation reaction, which first requires the availability of atomic hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of co-adsorbed alkenes, chain length plays a significant role. The absence of the self-hydrogenation reaction for ethylene and 1-butene is attributed to the weak binding energies, causing molecular desorption to occur prior to the dehydrogenation reaction that is necessary to produce atomic hydrogen. Because longer chain length molecules desorb at relatively higher temperatures due to their increased molecular weight, 1-hexene remains on the surface to higher temperatures than 1-butene, allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to proceed before molecular desorption and therefore allowing the self-hydrogenation reaction pathway. Similar argument can also be made for the hydrogenation of the three alkene molecules, where the hydrogenation with preadsorbed hydrogen would occur only if the alkene molecules do not desorb from the surface before the desorption of atomic hydrogen. This can explain why the hydrogenation does not occur for ethylene but for the longer chain 1-butene and 1-hexene 
[141]

5.1.2. Cyclic hydrocarbons
5.1.2.1. Cyclohexene
The low-temperature self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni /Pt(111) are among the earliest examples that demonstrate the novel reaction pathways that are not present on parent metals 
[137]
. In this section we will use the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to correlate the hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
Fig. 38
(a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene 
[143]
. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher.

Fig. 38. Comparison of TPD spectra of self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene on various Ni /Pt(111) and Pt/Ni(111) surfaces (from 
[80]
).
In order to confirm that the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway is due to the interaction of surface Pt atoms with subsurface Ni atoms, similar TPD measurements were performed on Pt-modified Ni(111) at various Pt coverages, as shown in
Fig. 38
(b) 
[78]
. Similar to PtNiPt(111), a low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is detected at 237 K. As quantified by Khan et al. 
[80]
, the product yield, in the unit of molecules per surface metal atom, is 0.031 C6H6 and 0.003 c- C6H12 on the ML PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure. Similarly, the self-hydrogenation yield on the ML PtNi(111) is calculated to be 0.027 C6H6 and 0.004 c- C6H12. The nearly identical yields demonstrate that both monolayer surfaces have similar activities toward dehydrogenation and self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Interestingly, as shown in
Fig. 38
, the two types of surfaces show significant differences at a metal overlayer coverage of 3 ML. The 3 ML NiPt(111) surface starts to show activity similar to Ni(111), as indicated by the absence of the self-hydrogenation pathway. In contrast, the 3 ML PtNi(111) retains the self-hydrogenation activity, which is different from Pt(111). The latter is likely due to the inability of the larger Pt atoms to grow epitaxially on the Ni(111) substrate 
[80]
. More importantly, the comparison in
Fig. 38
reveals that the novel hydrogenation pathway can be achieved by either depositing one monolayer of Pt on bulk Ni or by one monolayer of Ni on bulk Pt. The former procedure should definitely be preferred in catalytic applications because of the higher cost of Pt.
The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS 
[143]
, as shown in
Fig. 39
. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment 
[143]
, the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly
π
-bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di-
σ
bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111). These assignments were further confirmed from the polarization-dependence Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) measurements 
[143]
. Results from both HREELS and NEXAFS measurements indicate that the interaction of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is much weaker than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111), responsible for the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure.

The weaker binding energy of cyclohexene on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is confirmed by DFT calculations 
[140]
, as shown in
Fig. 40
. The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures. The trends are similar to those shown earlier for atomic H (
Fig. 16
), atomic O (
Fig. 24
), ethylene, 1-butene (
Fig. 36
), and 1-hexene, further confirming that the surface d-band center is a reliable parameter in predicting the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces.

).
The DFT calculations indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111), predicting that the subsurface structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in
Fig. 41
, which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison 
[87]
. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). Interestingly, the PtNiPt(111) surface is also more active toward the production of gas-phase benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (78 amu). As discussed earlier in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of ethylene in Section 
5.1.1.1
, the surface with d-band center closer to the Fermi level should be more active for the dehydrogenation of ethylene 
[34]
. Assuming the same trend applied for cyclohexene, it would mean that the NiPt(111) surface monolayer should have higher hydrogenation activity than the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, which is not consistent with the observation in
Fig. 41
. More in-depth DFT calculations of the activation barriers for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways of cyclohexene will be needed to clarify this.

[87]
).
The general trend in the DFT calculations in
Fig. 40
shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Even though the weaker binding energy of cyclohexene might favor the hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to occur. We would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e. when the adsorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in
Fig. 42
by Humbert et al. 
[87]
. The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces. Another point of comparison is the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the monolayer PtW(110) surface, which has the d-band center even further away from the Fermi level than PtFePt(111) (
Fig. 33
). The hydrogenation of cyclohexene does not occur on the PtW(110) 
[94]
, which further confirms the volcano relationship in the hydrogenation activity with respect to the surface d-band center.

The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center. As discussed earlier for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on these surfaces in Section 
4.1.3
(
Fig. 18
,
Fig. 19
), the d-band center of these monolayer surfaces are modified from Ni(111) due to a combination of strain and ligand effects. The distance between the d-band center and the Fermi level follows the trend of NiPt(111) < Ni(111)  NiRu(0001) < NiW(110). The results shown earlier in
Fig. 38
(b) already reveal that the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene does not occur on Ni(111), due mainly to the strong bonding of cyclohexene. Based on the similar d-band center value between Ni(111) and monolayer NiRu(0001), one would expect that the self-hydrogenation doe not occur on the NiRu(0001) surface. This is confirmed in
Fig. 43
(a), where the presence of monolayer Ni on Ru(0001) does not increase the self-hydrogenation pathway on Ru(0001). In comparison, based on the trend in the d-band center, the self-hydrogenation might occur on NiW(110) due to the weaker adsorption of cyclohexene. This is confirmed experimentally in
Fig. 43
(b), where the presence of monolayer Ni on W(110) leads to the onset of the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene 
[80]
. The presence of weakly
π
-bonded cyclohexene on NiW(110) is also confirmed using HREELS measurements 
[144]
. The results in
Fig. 43
further confirm the correlation of the self-hydrogenation activity with the value of the surface d-band center of MBS structures.

5.1.2.2. Benzene
The binding energy of benzene has been calculated on several Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt(111) surfaces 
[140]
. Similar to the trends observed for linear and cyclic alkenes described earlier, benzene adsorb more weakly on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures than on Pt(111) or the corresponding 3d-Pt(111) surface structures. Based on the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of linear and cyclic alkenes on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures, it is natural to explore whether the hydrogenation of benzene also occurs on these surfaces. Murillo et al. 
[141]
have performed TPD studies of the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of benzene on PtNiPt(111). Unlike linear and cyclic alkenes, the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur under UHV conditions 
[141]
. This was not unexpected, however, due to the nature of benzene being an aromatic molecule and therefore thermodynamically more stable as compared to the alkenes.
The adsorption and reaction of benzene have been studied on several other bimetallic surfaces. Domnick et al. 
[145]
investigated the adsorption of benzene on Ni/Cu(111) using XPS. At temperatures lower than 300 K, Ni grows layer-by-layer on top of Cu(111) and at temperatures between 300600 K Cu segregates to the top layer and Ni diffuses into the subsurface region. However, when benzene is adsorbed onto the 300 K NiCu(111) surface and the surface is subsequently annealed to 600 K, Cu does not segregate, leaving atomic carbon from the decomposed benzene bonded to Ni in the on-top sites. The change in the Cu segregation kinetics is attributed to a possible reduction of the surface energy of carbon-covered Ni-adlayer, or to the possibility of benzene kinetically hindering the Cu segregation through the Ni layer.
Koschel et al. 
[124]
have compared the binding energy of benzene on CuNi(111) and CuRu(0001) to that on the Ni(111) and Ru(0001) surfaces. On the CuNi(111) surface the HRXPS results show that benzene behaves similarly to that on the Cu(111) surface. However, on the CuRu(0001) surface, benzene is found to interact much more strongly than on Cu(111). DFT calculations of the two surfaces reveal a weak coupling of the Cu 3d states to the Ni substrate states, while the Cu states interact very strongly with the Ru substrate states, accounting for the strongly modified chemical properties of the CuRu(0001) monolayer surface 
[124]
.
5.1.3. Unsaturated aldehydes
The hydrogenation of the C=C and/or C=O bonds in unsaturated aldehydes offers the possibility of improving both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity through the formation of MBSs. The selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond to produce unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors 
[146]
,
[147]
. Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C=O bond of some
α
,
β
-unsaturated aldehydes. Koel et al. have studied the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (methyl substituted acrolein at the
β
carbon) on Sn/Pt(111) 
[148]
. They found that the hydrogenation activity was enhanced on the bimetallic Sn/Pt(111) surfaces in comparison with Pt(111) by using a batch reactor at relative low pressures. Beccat et al. observed an enhancement on the selectivity of crotonaldehyde and methylcrotonaldehyde (CH3)2C=CHCH=O) toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohols on Pt80Fe20(111) bimetallic surfaces 
[149]
. The enhancement in the selectivity to C=O hydrogenation was attributed to alloy formation in the case of crotonaldehyde.
Recently Murillo et al. have performed combined DFT and experimental studies of the hydrogenation of acrolein, CH2=CHCH=O, on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPt(111) structures 
[150]
.
Fig. 44
shows the DFT results of acrolein binding energies of different adsorption configurations with co-adsorbed H on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), and Pt(111) surfaces. The bonding configurations include di-
σ
CC, di-
σ
CO and
η
4
(C, C, C, O) 
[150]
. Similar to the trends observed for alkenes, the binding energies of acrolein are in the order of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < NiPt(111). In addition, on all three surfaces the di-
σ
bonding through the CC bond of acrolein is stronger than through the CO bond. In fact, on the H/Pt(111) and H/NiPt(111) surfaces, the binding through the di-
σ
CO configuration is so weak that it converts to the flat
η
4
(C, C, C, O) configuration during the course of DFT calculations. Based on the previous discussion for the hydrogenation of alkenes, the presence of weakly bonded acrolein and atomic hydrogen on PtNiPt(111) should enhance the hydrogenation activity of acrolein as compared to either NiPt(111) or Pt(111). Furthermore, as pointed by Delbecq and Sautet in their DFT study of the hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt(111) 
[151]
, the hydrogenation selectivity is most likely related to whether acrolein is bonded to the surface via the C=C or C=O bond, which favors the hydrogenation of C=C and C=O, respectively. Because the binding energies of the di-
σ
CC and CO configurations are comparable on the H/PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure, one would expect that the hydrogenation of both the C=C and C=O bonds of acrolein should occur on this surface. In contrast, the adsorption of acrolein on H/Pt(111) and H/NiPt(111) surfaces does not occur through the di-
σ
CO configuration, hence making it difficult to hydrogenate the C=O bond.

These DFT predictions are confirmed experimentally using TPD and HREELS measurements.

[143]
. In agreement with the DFT predictions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is active toward the hydrogenation of both the C=O and C=C bonds, while the C=O hydrogenation does not occur on either Pt(111) or NiPt(111). Also as predicted, the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure is significantly more active in the overall hydrogenation activity based on the comparison of the TPD peak areas in

 [143]
. Overall, the combined DFT and experimental results in

suggest that the d-band center can be used to potentially predict bimetallic surfaces with not only enhanced hydrogenation activity, but also improved selectivity for hydrocarbons containing multiple unsaturated functional groups.

5.2. Adsorption and reforming reaction of oxygenates
5.2.1. Methanol
In Section 
5.1
we used the examples of hydrogenation, a hydrogen-consuming reaction, to illustrate the relationship between the d-band center, binding energy, and chemical activities. In the current section we will use the reforming of oxygenates, a hydrogen-production reaction, to further explore the correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of MBS structures. The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, operation of direct methanol fuel cells, and methanol reforming to produce hydrogen. In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces 
[152]
.
Skoplyak et al. performed DFT calculations of the binding energies of methanol and methoxy on the subsurface and surface Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) bimetallic systems 
[153]
. As shown in
Fig. 46
, the binding energies of methanol and methoxy follow the same trends as the atomic and molecular adsorbates discussed earlier, with the binding energy becoming weaker as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. Similar type of linear correlations with the surface d-band center have also been reported for the binding energies of methoxy species on the monometallic surfaces of group VIII metals

Based on the DFT results, the surface monolayer 3d-Pt(111) structures should be more active toward the decomposition of methanol than Pt(111) and subsurface monolayer Pt-3d-Pt(111). Such trend is confirmed experimentally by Skoplyak et al. using TPD and HREELS to follow the reforming reaction of methanol on the various Ni /Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) surfaces 
[153]
.

shows the TPD results of H2 and CO from the reforming of methanol on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. Based on the TPD peak areas of the H2 and CO, the surface monolayer NiPt(111) structure has the highest reforming activity, with the reforming yield being 0.108 and 0.018 methanol per surface metal atoms on the NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) surfaces, respectively

The corresponding HREELS measurements further confirm the difference in the reforming activity on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPt(111) structures 
[153]
. As compared in the HREELS results in
Fig. 48
, upon heating to 300 K most of the adsorbed methanol desorb reversibly from PtNiPt(111), leaving a surface with little hydrocarbon fragments except adsorbed CO (2060 cm1) that is from the residual UHV system. In contrast, upon heating to 300 K methanol undergoes significant decomposition on the NiPt(111) surface, producing a formaldehyde-like surface intermediate that further decomposes at higher temperatures. Overall, the DFT and experimental results in
Fig. 46
,
Fig. 47
,
Fig. 48
indicate that, for the Ni /Pt bimetallic system, the surface NiPt(111) structure is preferred for the reforming of methanol due to its stronger bonding to methanol and to the reforming intermediates and products. The combined theory and experiments also suggest the possibility of using the surface d-band center as a possible parameter to identify active bimetallic surfaces for the reforming reactions.

Similar to the volcano type of relationship mentioned for the hydrogenation activity as a function of d-band center, one should also expect similar type of volcano behavior for the reforming yield. This is because as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, the surface can bond to methanol and/or the CO product too strongly, leading to the complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and oxygen. This behavior is confirmed in the comparison of the reforming yield of methanol on the monolayer surfaces of NiPt(111) and CoPt(111) 
[153]
. The CoPt(111) surface is much more active than NiPt(111) for the decomposition of methanol, with the activity being 0.369 and 0.108 methanol per surface metal atoms on the two surfaces, respectively. The higher activity of CoPt(111) than NiPt(111) is consistent with the DFT calculations of the binding energies on the two surfaces. However, among the methanol molecules that undergo decomposition, the selectivity to reforming is much lower on CoPt(111) (13%) than on NiPt(111) (100%) 
[153]
, confirming that the CoPt(111) surface is too active for the selective reforming of methanol to produce H2 and CO. More systematic DFT and surface science studies are needed to establish the volcano relationship for the reforming yield as a function of surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces.
5.2.2. Ethanol and ethylene glycol
The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/
γ
- Al2O3 at similar conditions 
[155]
. Skoplyak et al. 
[156]
have compared the reforming activity and selectivity of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Pt(111) and Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.
Fig. 49
shows the production of H2 and CO from the reforming of ethanol on PtNiPt(111), NiPt(111), Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film. Based on the TPD peak areas of the H2 and CO, the surface monolayer NiPt(111) structure has the highest reforming activity. Similar trend is also observed for the reforming of ethylene glycol on the corresponding surfaces

shows the correlation of experimentally measured reforming activity with the surface d-center of the Ni /Pt(111) surfaces 
[156]
. The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. These results again suggest the possibility of identification promising MBS structures based on the d-band center. More systematic studies on other bimetallic surfaces are needed to identify the general trend in reforming activity, and to determine the volcano relationship in the reforming selectivity of these two molecules.

Overall, the results discussed in Section 
5.2
show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production.
6. Conclusions, challenges and research opportunities
6.1. Conclusions
The examples in the current review demonstrate that the formation of MBS structures modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals. One useful parameter to represent the electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. In most cases the surface d-band center of MBS is significantly different from that of either parent metal. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt MBS systems, the formation of the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface MBS structures shifts the d-band center further away from the Fermi level as compared to either parent metal, while the formation of the 3d-Pt surface MBS structure shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level.
The shifts in the surface d-band center affect the binding energy of both atomic and molecular adsorbates on MBS. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal. In addition, for each adsorbate, there is a nearly linear correlation between the binding energies and the values of the surface d-band center, although for molecular adsorbates different slopes are observed for MBS structures terminated by 3d, 4d and 5d metals.
The modification on the d-band center, and correspondingly on the binding energies of adsorbates, provides the possibility to control the activity of MBS structures. The general correlation of the modification of the d-band center and the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces are qualitatively illustrated in
Fig. 51
. For example, for the hydrogenation of alkenes, the preferred surfaces are those that bond weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes, which are MBS structures with the surface d-band center further away from the Fermi level. In contrast, the reforming reaction requires MBS structures with stronger adsorption energies, i.e. with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level as compared to the parent metals. The different trends in the two types of reactions can be rationalized based on the adsorption energies of the reactants and products. In the hydrogenation reaction, it is preferred to keep the carboncarbon and carbonhydrogen bonds intact, with the desirable bimetallic surfaces being more weakly bonded to reactants than the parent metals. On the other hand, the reforming reaction requires the cleavage of carboncarbon, carbonhydrogen, and oxygenhydrogen bonds to produce H2 and CO. Therefore, the desirable bimetallic surfaces should bond more strongly to the oxygenate reactants, as well as to the reaction products of H and CO, than the parent metals. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene and the reforming selectivity of methanol, a volcano-type relationship often exists between the activity/selectivity and the binding energies of the adsorbates and/or products.

Fig. 51. Qualitative summary of the modification of the d-band center by the formation of subsurface Pt-3d-Pt and surface 3d-Pt structures. The effect on the binding energies (BDE) of adsorbates and several types of reactions are also qualitatively illustrated.
Similar approaches can be used for the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for other types of reactions. After identifying whether the particular reaction requires weakly or strongly bonded adsorbates, we should be able to quickly identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures (surface vs. subsurface monolayer) that are potentially better than the parent metals, based on the extensive database of values of HBE, OBE, and the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift of the MBS structures with respect to those of the parent metals. After the identification of the directions of d-band center shifts, more systematic experimental studies should follow to identify the possible volcano relationship between activities and the magnitude of the d-band center shift.
6.2. Challenges and research opportunities
We will conclude this review by pointing out several challenges and research opportunities to further understand and utilize the novel properties of MBS structures:
(1)
Most of the current DFT correlations are based on the changes in the surface d-band center, which is clearly an oversimplification of the electronic properties. Although this parameter seems to provide a general correlation of binding energies of many adsorbates on various MBS structures, a molecular level understanding of the reaction mechanism would clearly require more detailed description of the electronic properties, such as the position and DOS of individual d-orbitals.
(2)
DFT calculations of activation barriers are required to predict the activity and selectivity of reactions on various MBS structures. However, such calculations are computationally expensive, especially for bimetallic surfaces that often require a 3x3 unit cell of four-layer slab, with the top two layers relaxed and with spin polarization. A compromise will be to develop a more quantitative correlation between the binding energies of the adsorbates and products, which are much easier to calculate, with the activation barriers for different types of surface reactions.
(3)
At present most of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures are produced on the single crystal substrates. In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed.
(4)
The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions.
