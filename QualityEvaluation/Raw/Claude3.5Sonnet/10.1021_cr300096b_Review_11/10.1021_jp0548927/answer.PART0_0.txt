[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Reforming of other oxygenates, such as ethanol, has been studied on bimetallic catalysts such as RhPt, AuRh, and NiRh."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is a clean energy source.

2. The oxygenates used can be derived from renewable biomass, making the process more sustainable.

3. It offers advantages like low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

4. The use of bimetallic catalysts allows for improved selectivity and efficiency in the reforming process.

5. Correlations between catalyst properties and activity enable rational design of more effective catalysts.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming likely offers better product yields and reduced environmental impact due to the use of renewable feedstocks and more efficient catalysts. The compatibility with existing infrastructure also makes practical implementation easier. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, so the full extent of these advantages cannot be definitively stated.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献有以下几个方面：

1. 它生产用于燃料电池的氢气，这是一种清洁能源。

2. 所使用的含氧化合物可以从可再生生物质中获得，使得这个过程更加可持续。

3. 它具有低毒性、低反应性，以及与现有运输和储存基础设施兼容的优点。

4. 双金属催化剂的使用可以提高重整过程的选择性和效率。

5. 催化剂性质与活性之间的相关性使得可以合理设计更有效的催化剂。

与传统方法相比，选择性含氧化合物重整可能因为使用可再生原料和更高效的催化剂而提供更好的产品收率和降低环境影响。与现有基础设施的兼容性也使得实际实施更加容易。然而，文献中并未提供与传统方法的直接比较，因此无法确定地说明这些优势的全部程度。
