[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer one approach to altering the physical and chemical properties of metals, in some cases producing unique catalytic properties not seen for either of the parent metals."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is a clean energy source.

2. The oxygenates used can be derived from renewable biomass, making the process more sustainable.

3. These oxygenates have advantages such as low toxicity and low reactivity, which improves safety and ease of handling.

4. The process is compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure, facilitating practical implementation.

5. Using bimetallic catalysts can enhance the efficiency of the reforming process by altering the physical and chemical properties of the metals.

6. The ability to predict catalyst performance using the d-band center correlation allows for rational design of more effective catalysts.

While the text doesn't provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, the advantages mentioned suggest that selective oxygenate reforming could offer improvements in terms of sustainability, safety, and efficiency compared to conventional hydrogen production methods.
