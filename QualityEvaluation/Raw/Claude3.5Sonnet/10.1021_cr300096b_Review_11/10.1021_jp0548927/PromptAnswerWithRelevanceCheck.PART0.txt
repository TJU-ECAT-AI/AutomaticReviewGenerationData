<quotes>

[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Reforming of other oxygenates, such as ethanol, has been studied on bimetallic catalysts such as RhPt, AuRh, and NiRh."

[3] "Extrapolation of the correlation between activity and the surface d-band center of bimetallic systems may provide useful predictions for the selection and rational design of bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is a clean energy source.

2. The oxygenates used can be derived from renewable biomass, making the process more sustainable.

3. It offers advantages like low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

4. The use of bimetallic catalysts allows for improved selectivity and efficiency in the reforming process.

5. Correlations between catalyst properties and activity enable rational design of more effective catalysts.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming likely offers better product yields and reduced environmental impact due to the use of renewable feedstocks and more efficient catalysts. The compatibility with existing infrastructure also makes practical implementation easier. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, so the full extent of these advantages cannot be definitively stated.

[2] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."

[3] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity. The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."

[4] "Similar to ethylene glycol, ethanol reacts primarily through dehydrogenation and the desired CC bond scission. CO bond scission is minimal and probably can be attributed to defect sites on the surfaces"
