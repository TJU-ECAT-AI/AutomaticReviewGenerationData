[1] "Production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells can be achieved by selective reforming of oxygenates. The oxygenates may be derived from renewable biomass and offer advantages such as low toxicity, low reactivity, and compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

[2] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."

[3] "The NiPtPt(111) surface displays the highest reforming activity and total activity. The reforming activity of the thick Ni/Pt(111) is also significantly higher compared to Pt(111)."

[4] "Similar to ethylene glycol, ethanol reacts primarily through dehydrogenation and the desired CC bond scission. CO bond scission is minimal and probably can be attributed to defect sites on the surfaces"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, which is a clean energy carrier.

2. The oxygenates used can be derived from renewable biomass, making the process more sustainable.

3. These oxygenates have advantages like low toxicity and low reactivity, improving safety.

4. They are compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure, facilitating practical implementation.

5. The process primarily involves dehydrogenation and C-C bond scission, with minimal undesirable C-O bond scission, leading to good product selectivity.

6. Using bimetallic catalysts like NiPtPt(111) can significantly increase reforming activity compared to traditional catalysts like Pt(111).

7. The reactivity can be tuned and potentially optimized by modifying the surface d-band center of catalysts.

While the document doesn't provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, these advantages suggest selective oxygenate reforming could offer improvements in terms of sustainability, safety, and catalytic efficiency over conventional hydrogen production methods.
