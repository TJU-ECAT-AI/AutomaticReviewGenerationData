Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically liquid phase methanol reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering a promising method for hydrogen production. Its key advantages include:

1. Compact and simple reaction equipment: The process allows for more compact and simplified reaction systems compared to traditional steam reforming methods.

2. Energy efficiency: It eliminates the need for evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution, making the process more energy-efficient.

3. High product yield: PtRu/TiO2 catalysts demonstrated high activity and selectivity (90.9%) in the liquid phase methanol reforming reaction, indicating good product yield.

4. Potential for pure hydrogen production: The process aims to develop a simpler and more compact system for producing pure hydrogen, which is crucial for sustainable energy applications.

5. Milder reaction conditions: Liquid phase reforming can be performed at lower temperatures compared to conventional steam reforming, potentially reducing energy requirements and environmental impact.

While the literature doesn't provide extensive information on environmental impact, the energy efficiency and compact nature of the process suggest potential environmental benefits through reduced energy consumption and smaller plant footprints. The practical implementation advantages stem from the simplification of reaction equipment and the ability to operate at milder conditions, which could lead to easier scaling and reduced operational costs compared to traditional methods.
