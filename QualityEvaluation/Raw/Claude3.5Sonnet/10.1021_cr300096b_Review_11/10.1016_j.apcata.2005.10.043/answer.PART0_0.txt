Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly liquid phase methanol reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It allows for more compact and simple reaction equipment compared to traditional steam reforming, making the process more practical to implement.

2. It eliminates the need for evaporation energy of the methanol aqueous solution, improving energy efficiency.

3. The process can produce pure hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier.

4. Using appropriate catalysts and supports (like PtRu/TiO2) can yield high selectivity for CO2, reducing unwanted byproducts.

5. The reaction conditions are relatively mild (around 350-357 K), which is favorable for energy efficiency.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yield: PtRu/TiO2 catalysts show high activity and selectivity for hydrogen and CO2 production.
- Improved environmental impact: High selectivity for CO2 means less CO formation, which is a pollutant.
- Practical implementation: The compact, simple equipment design makes it easier to scale and deploy.

However, the document does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods in terms of specific yield numbers or quantitative environmental impact data.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是液相甲醇重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 与传统蒸汽重整相比，它允许使用更紧凑、更简单的反应设备，使过程更易于实施。

2. 它消除了甲醇水溶液蒸发能的需求，提高了能源效率。

3. 该过程可以生产纯氢气，这是一种清洁能源载体。

4. 使用适当的催化剂和载体（如PtRu/TiO2）可以获得高选择性的CO2，减少不需要的副产品。

5. 反应条件相对温和（约350-357 K），有利于能源效率。

主要优势包括：

- 更高的产品产率：PtRu/TiO2催化剂显示出对氢气和CO2生产的高活性和选择性。
- 改善环境影响：对CO2的高选择性意味着更少的CO形成，CO是一种污染物。
- 实际实施：紧凑、简单的设备设计使其更易于扩大规模和部署。

然而，该文档并未提供与传统方法在具体产率数据或定量环境影响方面的直接比较。
