[1] "The main purpose of our study is the development of more simple and compact system for production of pure hydrogen"

[2] "As compared with the usual steam reforming reaction, the advantages of liquid phase reforming are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution."

[3] "Basic oxide supports improved the selectivity to CO2, whereas acidic supports suppressed the catalytic activity and selectivity."

[4] "The PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited highest activity and selectivity for CO2, which were improved by higher temperature reduction."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly liquid phase methanol reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It allows for more compact and simple reaction equipment compared to traditional steam reforming, making the process more practical to implement.

2. It eliminates the need for evaporation energy of the methanol aqueous solution, improving energy efficiency.

3. The process can produce pure hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier.

4. Using appropriate catalysts and supports (like PtRu/TiO2) can yield high selectivity for CO2, reducing unwanted byproducts.

5. The reaction conditions are relatively mild (around 350-357 K), which is favorable for energy efficiency.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yield: PtRu/TiO2 catalysts show high activity and selectivity for hydrogen and CO2 production.
- Improved environmental impact: High selectivity for CO2 means less CO formation, which is a pollutant.
- Practical implementation: The compact, simple equipment design makes it easier to scale and deploy.

However, the document does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods in terms of specific yield numbers or quantitative environmental impact data.
