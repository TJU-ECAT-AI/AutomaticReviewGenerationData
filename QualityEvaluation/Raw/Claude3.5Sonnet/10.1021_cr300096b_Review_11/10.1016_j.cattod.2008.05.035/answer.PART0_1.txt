[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly"

[2] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

[3] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[4] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It uses renewable feedstocks like ethanol, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and associated environmental problems.

2. It produces hydrogen, a clean fuel that can significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when used in applications like fuel cells.

3. It has higher efficiency for hydrogen production compared to alternatives like partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming.

4. It requires less energy input per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons.

5. It primarily produces CO2 rather than more harmful emissions.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yield: Steam reforming has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among alternatives.
- Reduced environmental impact: Uses renewable feedstocks and produces cleaner emissions.
- Practical implementation benefits: Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and less toxic than alternatives like methanol.

While highly efficient, the main drawback is the endothermic nature of the process, requiring heat input. Overall, selective oxygenate reforming offers a more sustainable pathway for hydrogen and chemical production compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，以多种方式促进可持续能源和化学品生产：

1. 它使用乙醇等可再生原料，减少对化石燃料的依赖及相关环境问题。

2. 它生产氢气，这是一种清洁燃料，在燃料电池等应用中可显著减少空气污染和温室气体排放。

3. 与部分氧化或自热重整等替代方案相比，它具有更高的氢气生产效率。

4. 与饱和烃类重整相比，每摩尔氢气产量所需的能量投入更少。

5. 它主要产生二氧化碳，而不是更有害的排放物。

主要优势包括：

- 更高的产品产率：蒸汽重整在各种替代方案中具有最高的氢气生产效率。
- 降低环境影响：使用可再生原料并产生更清洁的排放。
- 实际应用优势：乙醇比甲醇等替代品更易于储存、更安全处理，毒性更低。

虽然效率很高，但主要缺点是过程的吸热性质，需要热量输入。总的来说，与传统的基于化石燃料的方法相比，选择性含氧化合物重整为氢气和化学品生产提供了一条更可持续的途径。
