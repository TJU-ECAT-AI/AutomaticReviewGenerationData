[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources. Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly"

[2] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

[3] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It provides a pathway for producing hydrogen, which is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when used as a fuel.

2. It utilizes ethanol, a renewable resource that is easier to store and safer to handle compared to other alternatives like methanol.

3. Steam reforming has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other reforming methods.

4. The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons like ethanol requires less energy per mole of H2 produced compared to saturated hydrocarbons.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yield: Steam reforming offers the highest efficiency for hydrogen production.
- Improved environmental impact: It uses renewable resources and produces mostly CO2 instead of more harmful emissions.
- Practical implementation: Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility.

However, the highly endothermic nature of the process is noted as an inconvenience, which may present challenges in terms of energy input for practical implementation.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它提供了一种生产氢气的途径，预计当氢气用作燃料时可以减少空气污染和温室气体排放。

2. 它利用乙醇，这是一种可再生资源，与甲醇等其他替代品相比，更容易储存和更安全处理。

3. 蒸汽重整在各种重整方法中具有最高的氢气生产效率。

4. 与饱和烃相比，含氧烃（如乙醇）的重整每摩尔H2生产所需能量更少。

主要优势包括：

- 更高的产品产率：蒸汽重整提供了最高的氢气生产效率。
- 改善环境影响：它使用可再生资源，主要产生CO2而不是更有害的排放物。
- 实际应用：由于乙醇毒性较低和挥发性较低，更容易储存、更安全处理和运输。

然而，该过程的高度吸热性被指出是一个不便之处，这可能在实际应用中在能量输入方面带来挑战。
