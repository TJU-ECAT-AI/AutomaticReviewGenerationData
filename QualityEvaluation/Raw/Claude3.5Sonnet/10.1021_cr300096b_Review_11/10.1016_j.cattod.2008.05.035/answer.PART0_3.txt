[1] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[2] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[3] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Higher efficiency: Steam reforming has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production compared to other methods like partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming.

2. Lower energy requirements: Reforming oxygenated hydrocarbons like ethanol requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons.

3. Cleaner production: It produces mostly CO2 rather than more harmful emissions.

4. Renewable feedstock: Ethanol is a renewable resource, making the process more sustainable.

5. Safer handling: Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to alternatives like methanol.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production, offering improved product yield, reduced environmental impact, and more practical implementation compared to traditional methods using fossil fuels.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，以多种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 更高效率：蒸汽重整在氢气生产方面的效率高于部分氧化或自热重整等其他方法。

2. 更低能耗：与饱和烃重整相比，含氧烃（如乙醇）重整每摩尔氢气产量所需能量更少。

3. 更清洁生产：主要产生CO2，而不是更有害的排放物。

4. 可再生原料：乙醇是可再生资源，使得该过程更加可持续。

5. 更安全处理：与甲醇等替代品相比，乙醇更易储存、更安全处理和运输，因为它的毒性和挥发性更低。

这些优势使选择性含氧化合物重整成为可持续氢气生产的一种有前景的方法，与使用化石燃料的传统方法相比，它提供了更高的产品产率、更低的环境影响和更实用的实施方案。
