[1] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[2] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[3] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly steam reforming of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It offers high efficiency for hydrogen production compared to other methods like partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming.

2. It requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons, making it more energy-efficient.

3. It produces mostly CO2 rather than more harmful emissions.

4. It utilizes ethanol, which is a renewable resource, making the process more sustainable.

5. Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to other feedstocks like methanol.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming, especially ethanol steam reforming, a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the highly endothermic nature of the process is a challenge that needs to be addressed for practical implementation.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 与其他方法（如部分氧化或自热重整）相比，它为氢气生产提供了更高的效率。

2. 与饱和烃类重整相比，每摩尔氢气生产所需的能量更少，使其更加节能。

3. 它主要产生CO2，而不是更有害的排放物。

4. 它利用乙醇这种可再生资源，使过程更加可持续。

5. 由于乙醇毒性较低、挥发性较小，与其他原料（如甲醇）相比，更易于储存、处理和运输。

这些优势使选择性含氧化合物重整，尤其是乙醇蒸汽重整，成为可持续氢气生产的一种有前途的方法。然而，该过程的高度吸热性质是一个需要在实际应用中解决的挑战。
