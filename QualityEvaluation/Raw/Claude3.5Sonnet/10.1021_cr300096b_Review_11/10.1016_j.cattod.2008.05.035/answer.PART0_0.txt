[1] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature"

[2] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2"

[3] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly steam reforming of ethanol, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Higher efficiency: Steam reforming has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production compared to other methods like partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming.

2. Lower energy requirements: Reforming oxygenated hydrocarbons like ethanol requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons.

3. Cleaner production: It produces mostly CO2 rather than more harmful emissions.

4. Renewable feedstock: Ethanol is a renewable resource, making the process more sustainable.

5. Safer handling: Ethanol is easier to store, safer to handle, and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to alternatives like methanol.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming, especially ethanol steam reforming, a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the highly endothermic nature of the process remains a challenge for practical implementation.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 更高效率：与部分氧化或自热重整等其他方法相比，蒸汽重整具有最高的氢气生产效率。

2. 较低的能量需求：与饱和烃类重整相比，含氧烃类（如乙醇）的重整每摩尔氢气生产所需能量更少。

3. 更清洁的生产：它主要产生CO2，而不是更有害的排放物。

4. 可再生原料：乙醇是一种可再生资源，使得这个过程更具可持续性。

5. 更安全的处理：与甲醇等替代品相比，乙醇更容易储存、更安全处理和运输，因为它的毒性和挥发性较低。

这些优势使选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是乙醇蒸汽重整，成为可持续氢气生产的一种有前景的方法。然而，该过程的高度吸热性质仍然是实际应用中的一个挑战。
