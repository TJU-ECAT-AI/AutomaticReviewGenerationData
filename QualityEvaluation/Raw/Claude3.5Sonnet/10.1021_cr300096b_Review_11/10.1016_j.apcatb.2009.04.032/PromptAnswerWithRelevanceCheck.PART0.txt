[1] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."

[2] "Hydrogen-rich gas mixtures can be obtained from biomass feedstocks by a two-step process. In the first step, the oxygenated organic compound generates a mixture of CO and H2 (denoted as bio-syn-gas) according to the following Eq. (1)"

[3] "Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions. This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as FischerTropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis"

[4] "This integrated catalytic system displayed 100% carbon conversion of concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) into CO2 and CO, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80% of the amount that would ideally be obtained from the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to H2 and CO followed by equilibrated water-gas shift with the water present in the feed."
