[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."

[3] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group."

[4] "Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield and this is most likely related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo oxidation/reduction cycles without deactivation."

Selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It utilizes a renewable feedstock (ethanol) that can be produced from crops via fermentation, resulting in negligible net CO2 emissions.

2. It enables on-board hydrogen generation for fuel cells, making hydrogen fuel more practical for transportation applications.

3. It can produce hydrogen with high yield when optimized catalysts are used that efficiently break C-C bonds and promote the water-gas shift reaction.

4. It avoids some drawbacks of traditional hydrogen production methods by using a liquid fuel that is easy to transport and store.

The key advantages include:
- Higher product yields of hydrogen when using optimized bimetallic catalysts 
- Reduced environmental impact due to using a bio-derived feedstock
- Practical implementation for mobile and distributed hydrogen production
- Ability to utilize existing ethanol production and distribution infrastructure

However, challenges remain in optimizing catalysts to suppress unwanted byproducts like methane at lower temperatures. Overall, ethanol reforming shows promise as a more sustainable route to hydrogen production compared to fossil fuel-based methods, especially for transportation applications.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献有以下几个方面：

1. 它利用可再生原料（乙醇），可通过作物发酵生产，因此对整体CO2排放的贡献可以忽略不计。

2. 它可以实现车载制氢用于燃料电池，使氢燃料在交通应用中更加实用。

3. 当使用经过优化的催化剂时，它可以高效地断裂C-C键并促进水煤气变换反应，从而高产氢气。

4. 它避免了传统制氢方法的一些缺点，因为乙醇作为液体燃料易于运输和储存。

主要优势包括：
- 使用优化的双金属催化剂时，氢气产率更高
- 使用生物衍生原料，环境影响较小
- 可实现移动式和分布式制氢的实际应用
- 能够利用现有的乙醇生产和配送基础设施

然而，在优化催化剂以抑制低温下不需要的副产品（如甲烷）方面仍存在挑战。总的来说，与基于化石燃料的方法相比，乙醇重整显示出更可持续的制氢路径，特别是在交通应用方面。
