          [1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."

[3] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate."

[4] "Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield and this is most likely related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo oxidation/reduction cycles without deactivation."

[5] "Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K. There are two main observations in the figure. (i) The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production. This observation has been repeated several times and is independent of reaction flow rate. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason. (ii) Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane and has been seen on other studies."

[6] "Maximum variations of the reaction yield of 10–15% were observed. These variations are attributed to analytical and experimental errors rather than to an intrinsic change within the catalyst from one run to the other."

          Selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Renewable feedstock: Ethanol can be produced from crops through fermentation, making it a renewable resource with negligible net CO2 emissions.

2. Hydrogen production: The process enables efficient production of hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier for fuel cells and other applications.

3. On-board hydrogen generation: Ethanol's easy transportability allows for on-board hydrogen generation, making it practical for mobile applications.

4. Temperature-dependent product control: By controlling the reaction temperature, the product distribution can be tuned. At 550-650K, CO and CO2 production is favored due to the water-gas shift reaction. Above 700K, hydrogen production increases at the expense of methane.

5. Efficient catalytic process: Using optimized catalysts (e.g., containing rhodium) allows for efficient breaking of C-C bonds in ethanol, which is crucial for producing hydrogen.

Key advantages include:

1. Higher product yields: The catalytic process can achieve high hydrogen yields, especially at temperatures above 650K.

2. Lower environmental impact: As a renewable feedstock, ethanol reforming has a smaller carbon footprint compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods.

3. Practical implementation: The process shows good stability over multiple runs, with only minor variations in yield attributed to experimental errors rather than catalyst degradation.

4. Versatility: The reaction conditions can be tuned to favor different products based on temperature and catalyst composition.

5. Utilization of existing infrastructure: The process can leverage existing ethanol production and distribution systems.

However, challenges remain in optimizing catalysts to suppress unwanted byproducts like methane at lower temperatures and in quantifying the specific advantages over traditional methods in terms of overall yield and environmental impact.

          选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面：

1. 可再生原料：乙醇可以通过作物发酵生产，使其成为一种净二氧化碳排放量可忽略不计的可再生资源。

2. 氢气生产：该过程可以高效生产氢气，氢气是燃料电池和其他应用的清洁能源载体。

3. 车载制氢：乙醇易于运输，允许车载制氢，使其在移动应用中更具实用性。

4. 温度依赖的产物控制：通过控制反应温度，可以调节产物分布。在550-650K时，由于水气变换反应，有利于CO和CO2的生成。在700K以上，氢气产量增加，甲烷产量减少。

5. 高效催化过程：使用优化的催化剂（如含铑的催化剂）可以有效断裂乙醇中的C-C键，这对生产氢气至关重要。

主要优势包括：

1. 更高的产品产率：催化过程可以实现高氢气产率，尤其是在650K以上的温度下。

2. 较低的环境影响：作为可再生原料，乙醇重整与传统的基于化石燃料的方法相比，碳足迹更小。

3. 实际应用性：该过程在多次运行中表现出良好的稳定性，产率的微小变化主要归因于实验误差，而非催化剂性能退化。

4. 多功能性：可以通过调节反应条件（如温度和催化剂组成）来优化不同产品的产率。

5. 利用现有基础设施：该过程可以利用现有的乙醇生产和配送系统。

然而，在优化催化剂以抑制低温下不需要的副产品（如甲烷）方面仍然存在挑战，并且在量化其相对于传统方法在总体产率和环境影响方面的具体优势时还需要进一步研究。
