[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate."

[3] "Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K. There are two main observations in the figure. (i) The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production. This observation has been repeated several times and is independent of reaction flow rate. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason. (ii) Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane and has been seen on other studies."

Selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Renewable feedstock: Ethanol can be produced from crops through fermentation, making it a renewable resource with low net CO2 emissions.

2. Hydrogen production: The process can efficiently produce hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier for fuel cells and other applications. 

3. Temperature-dependent product control: By controlling the reaction temperature, the product distribution can be tuned. At 550-650K, CO and CO2 production is favored due to the water-gas shift reaction. Above 700K, hydrogen production increases at the expense of methane.

4. Carbon-carbon bond breaking: The catalysts used, particularly those containing rhodium, are effective at breaking the C-C bond in ethanol, which is crucial for producing smaller molecules like hydrogen.

5. Reduced environmental impact: Compared to traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen production, this process has lower overall CO2 emissions due to the renewable nature of the feedstock.

The key advantages include:
- Higher product yields of desired products like hydrogen
- Lower environmental impact due to renewable feedstock
- Ability to tune product distribution by adjusting reaction conditions
- Potential for practical implementation due to the use of common catalysts and moderate reaction conditions

However, challenges remain, such as suppressing unwanted methane formation at lower temperatures. Further catalyst development is needed to optimize the process for low-temperature hydrogen production.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面：

1. 可再生原料：乙醇可以通过作物发酵生产，使其成为一种净二氧化碳排放量低的可再生资源。

2. 氢气生产：该过程可以高效生产氢气，氢气是燃料电池和其他应用的清洁能源载体。

3. 温度依赖的产物控制：通过控制反应温度，可以调节产物分布。在550-650K时，由于水气变换反应，有利于CO和CO2的生成。在700K以上，氢气产量增加，甲烷产量减少。

4. 碳-碳键断裂：所使用的催化剂，特别是含铑的催化剂，能有效断裂乙醇中的C-C键，这对生产氢气等小分子至关重要。

5. 降低环境影响：与传统的基于化石燃料的氢气生产相比，由于原料的可再生性，该过程的整体CO2排放量更低。

主要优势包括：
- 所需产品（如氢气）的产率更高
- 由于使用可再生原料，环境影响较小
- 通过调整反应条件可以调节产物分布
- 由于使用常见催化剂和适中的反应条件，具有实际应用潜力

然而，仍然存在一些挑战，如在较低温度下抑制不需要的甲烷生成。需要进一步开发催化剂以优化低温氢气生产过程。
