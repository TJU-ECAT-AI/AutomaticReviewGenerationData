Hydrogen production from ethanol over bimetallic Rh-M/CeO2 (M = Pd or Pt)
Abstract
The reaction of ethanol for the production of hydrogen has been studied over a series of metal supported CeO2 catalysts. The study is conducted by TPD, steady state reaction, XPS, TEM, and infrared spectroscopy. TPD gave evidence for the role of Rh in dissociating the carboncarbon bond needed for efficient production of hydrogen molecules. IR of CO adsorption at 90 K revealed that Rh particles are most likely in very small clusters as evidenced by a single OCRh IR band at 2020 cm1. TEM did not show conclusive evidence for the presence of the metal on-top of the CeO2 support, yet the Rh-Pd/CeO2 used catalyst has features that might be attributed to epitaxial growth of the noble metal along the (1 1 1) surface of the CeO2 support. Considerable reconstruction of the CeO2 support is seen for the used catalysts, in addition. Reforming of ethanol to hydrogen using (3 moles of water per mole of ethanol) was very efficient particularly above 650 K where hydrogen selectivity reaches 60 vol.%. At these temperatures hydrogen production from reforming of methane takes place.
1. Introduction
Ethanol has been receiving considerable attention recently because of its high potential for producing molecular hydrogen to power fuel cells. At present the primary global energy demand is around 15 TW and bioenergy has the potential to contribute by up to 3 TW annually. Bioenergy in general suffers from its low energy density, about 1 W/m2 (to compare to fossil fuel where the energy density is 103104 W/m2)
[1]
. Finding new processes or improving the present ones is thus highly desirable. Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production. Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells. Catalytic reactions of ethanol both, as an end product, and as a reactant have been studied for long years with publications dating back to the early seventies

[6]
. Ethanol synthesis is particularly challenging since making one molecule of ethanol from two molecules of CO requires the dissociation of one molecule of CO. This reaction has been achieved over several noble metals supported catalysts including Rh
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. Other non-CO bond dissociating noble metals such as Pd could also be active with the addition of promoters such as alkali earth
[10]
,
[11]
. Within the principle of micro-reversibility it is thus not surprising that catalysts found appropriate for ethanol decomposition to hydrogen and carbon oxides are very similar to those found active for making it. For example, it has been observed almost 80 years ago that Cu/ZnO catalysts are equally good for making methanol from CO and H2 as well as for decomposing the former to the latter compounds
[12]
. One main criterion in fully decomposing ethanol to H2 and ideally to CO2, is that the reaction intermediate should not include ethylene, the latter is formed by dehydration. Ethylene may further react to higher hydrocarbons and this does not only consume further hydrogen it may also lead to considerable deactivation of the catalyst due to un-desorbed high molecular weight compounds. In this case it has been seen that the support plays a crucial role. Acidic oxides such as Al2O3 are found to make considerable amounts of ethylene when used to support Rh. On the other hand basic oxides such as CeO2 do not orient to the dehydration reaction
[13]
,
[14]
. CeO2 has additional advantages that make it attractive: high oxygen storage capacity and being easily made of homogenous size particles of very small size; typically less than 20 nm in diameter.
To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled
[15]
. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate. Rh and Co metals have been shown to stabilize this intermediate
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield
[19]
and this is most likely related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo oxidation/reduction cycles without deactivation. Third, the metal needs to be active for the H:H recombination reaction.
In this work we present a study of bimetallic Rh-containing CeO2 catalyst and of its activity for ethanol reforming to hydrogen. The work is compared to other monometallic CeO2 catalysts previously studied

[24]

[27]
. We have opted for Pd as a second metal because of its high hydrogenation activity and for Rh because of its activity for the CC bond dissociation of ethanol molecule over CeO2

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
CeO2 was prepared by precipitating white crystalline cerous nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) (100 g), dissolved in de-ionized water (0.40 L). Ammonia (0.91 mol L1) was added drop wise (ca. 30 mL) until a pH of 8 was attained. The resulting white slurry precipitate was than collected by filtration, washed and left to dry in an oven at 373 K for 12 h. The pale purple dried powder was calcined in a furnace at 773 K for 4 h with flowing air. Stock solutions of Pd and Rh metals, in 1 M of HCl were used. The monometallic and bimetallic catalysts MM/CeO2 were prepared by conventional impregnating technique, where the CeO2 support and the appropriate amount of stock solutions were mixed in a beaker at ambient temperature with continuous stirring. Temperature was than raised to around 373 K and retained. When most of the liquid vaporized, it forms paste like material, which was than dried for 12 h at 373 K then calcined for 4 h at 673 K under flowing air.
2.2. Characterization
Catalysts characterization was conducted by BET (QUANTASORB JR.), XRD (Philips 1130 generator and a Philips 1050 goniometer; Cu Kα: λ = 1.5148 Å), TEM (JOEL FX-2000II with a Link Isis EDX system), EDX and XPS (KRATOS XSAM-800, Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV); all peak energies were referenced to the C 1s binding energy of residual carbon at 284.7 eV) techniques.
Table 1
presents some of the characterization results. In brief the main characteristics of the catalysts were as follow.
1.
The BET surface area of CeO2 alone or that after metal impregnation deviated mildly. This was mainly due to reproducibility of the precipitation method rather than to an intrinsic effect of the metal ions (because of the very low concentration of the metal). The BET values ranged from 50 to 80 m2/g.
2.
CeO2 alone did not contain Ce3+ ions but all other as prepared catalysts did contain non-negligible amounts of Ce3+ (
Fig. 1
).

The Ce3+ lines are not observed on a similarly treated CeO2 without the noble metal (Metals used were Rh, Pd or Pt with the atomic percentage indicated in
Table 1
). (b) XPS 3d levels for the Pd and Rh contributions of the 0.46 at.% Rh0.40 at.% Pd/CeO2. While the presence of the metal is clear a non-negligible contribution of the metal oxide is also seen. RhCl3 is clearly not present while small Pd 3d lines that can be attributed to PdCl2 cannot be excluded. Binding Energies of Rh and Pd lines are from Ref.
[53]
.
3.
The atomic percentage of the elements on the surface differed from the expected bulk composition, most likely due to surface segregation (
Fig. 1
).
4.
The fluorite bulk structure was maintained for all catalysts.
5.
TEM did not conclusively identify the presence of the metals on the surface of CeO2, which had an average diameter close to 20 nm. Yet both XPS and EDX did detect their photoelectron (XPS) and X-ray (EDX) emission.
6.
Irreversible (titration at 300 K) and electrostatic (90 K) adsorption of CO gave evidence of considerable differences in the CO mode of adsorption between CeO2 and M/CeO2.

Also shown the expected percentage based on bulk composition. The binding energy of the metal indicates that they are mainly in an oxidized state, as indicted, although signal contribution from metallic states cannot be ruled out. The CO uptake at 300 K is conducted, over hydrogen-reduced samples at 523 K for 12 h, 1 atm, by the pulse method (0.25 ml injection volume of CO). No detectable CO uptake was found for CeO2 alone at the indicated conditions. The O 1s/Ce 3d ratios are an indication of the extent of reduction of the support by the metal at the calcination conditions (673 K).

2.3. Catalytic reactions
2.3.1. Temperature programmed desorption
Ethanol reactions were performed in a conventional U-shape quartz fixed bed micro-reactor. Samples (50 mg) were loaded onto the sinter of the reactor. Prior to any reactions, sample catalysts were oxidized at 573 K under oxygen stream for 3 h. The reactor was than allowed to cool to ambient temperature under oxygen, then pumped down to base pressure (102 Torr). Dosing of ethanol was done by allowing its vapor pressure (about 8 Torr at room temperature) to saturate the catalyst bed for a period of 3 min, sufficient for complete monolayer coverage. After dosing, the reaction line was then subject to further pumping to remove any loosely adhered reactant on the catalyst surface and in the line. The reactor was than heated using a high temperature-heating furnace connected to a programmed temperature controller. The reaction line was connected to the vacuum chamber containing a Spectra Vision quadrupole mass spectrometer, with a base pressure of 107 Torr. Before data collection, the signal at m/z = 31 (dominant fragment of ethanol) was monitored. The TPD (from 300 to 773 K with ramping rate of 20 K min1) started when no further change was observed. The desorption profile was monitored inside the high vacuum chamber using the quadrupole mass spectrometer, connected to an online computer and running a mass spectrometer software (RGA for Windows), which allows the monitoring of up to 200 masses simultaneously at a cycle rate of 1 min or up to 12 masses at a faster cycle rate (typical 5 s/cycle). Relative yields were calculated for individual desorption products by quantitatively analyzing the desorption spectra for the respective mass fragments. In order to identify a gas from mass spectra, the fragmentation pattern of a particular species must be known. Two factors were employed when determining the cracking contribution; firstly, major fragmentation product was distinguished from the background signal, and secondly, assigning possible products to the fewer possible species. In the case of a mass fragment resulting from multiple species other mass fragments were checked for consistency. The method used for TPD analysis is the same as that reported in other works

[23]
.
2.4. Infrared spectroscopy
Infrared spectra were monitored using a Digilab FTS-60 Fourier transform spectrometer, with a 256 scan data acquisition at a resolution of 4 cm1. The adsorption of ethanol on sample catalysts were performed in a stainless steel IR cell equipped with removable CaF2 windows (32 mm diameter, 4 mm thick) sealed with Viton O-rings. The calcium fluoride optics is used to monitor the region from 4500 to 1000 cm1 regime and is capable of operating at temperatures between 77 and 773 K. A type K (chromel/alumel) thermocouple, welded into the center of the cell in close proximity to the catalyst disc, was used to monitor the temperature. The sample catalysts was pressed into a self-supporting disc (ca. 15 mm in diameter), and mounted into a gold-plated brass sample holder inside the cell. The cell is connected to a vacuum line, with a base pressure of ca. 105 Torr. O2 and CO gases used to treat the catalyst were contained in separate glass bulbs, which were attached to the vacuum line by vacuum-sealed clamps. Catalysts were annealed under 20 Torr of O2 at 673 K followed by evacuation for 1-h. The cell was then cooled to the desired temperature prior to adsorption.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1
a presents a typical XPS Ce3d of an as prepared Rh-Pd/CeO2 catalyst. The XP spectra of ceria are rather complicated due to the hybridization between the Ce 4f levels and the O 2p state. The series of peaks denoted by v and u are from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of Ce, respectively. Both Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2 levels are composed of five components, three structures in the case of CeO2 and two structures only for Ce2O3. They are identified as (v0, v, v, v and v) and (u0, u, u, u and u), if the spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. Assignment of the different structure shown is with referring to the work from Burroughs et al.

,
[32]
,

,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
, where structures of v, v and v are attributed to CeO2. The hybridization between the Ce 4f screening level and the O 2p level results in the v and v lines, which are due to a mixture of Ce(5d 6s)0 4f2 O2p4 and Ce(5d 6s)0 4f1 O2p5 configurations, respectively.106 The v line is a pure Ce(5d 6s)0 4f0 O2p6 final state. On the other hand, v0 and v are due to mixture of Ce(5d 6s)0 4f2 O2p5 and Ce(5d 6s)0 4f1 O2p6 final states in Ce2O3. The u structures of Ce 3d3/2 level can be explained in a similar way. Owing to the complexity of the spectra, no quantitative analysis was attempted as to the partitioning of the Ce4+ and Ce3+ species. It is however clear that Ce3+ ions are present because of the lines assigned to v and u. The nine transitions observed in this work (the 10th transition, uo, is generally not observed in a CeO2/Ce2O3 mixture because it is masked by the v peak) are shown in the inset of
Fig. 1
a.
Fig. 1
b presents the XPS 3d lines corresponding to Rh and Pd. The atomic percent for both metal is relatively low and explains the high signal to noise. It is however clear that a combination of metal and metal oxides is present for both metals. The Pd region was more difficult to analyze. The raw data could not be fitted with two peaks at each line (3d5/2 and 3d3/2). Because some chlorine atoms are left on the surface upon calcination, it is possible to attribute the third peak in each region not to another oxidation state of Pd but to ligands-effect (chlorine has a higher electronegativity value than oxygen and as a results the core electron of Pd2+ in PdCl2 appears with a higher binding energy when compared to Pd2+ in PdO).
The extent of reduction has been related to the amount and nature of the noble metal that triggers the reduction of a fraction of Ce4+ ions on the surface
[15]
. The inset in
Fig. 1
a is a schematic representation of the (1 1 1) CeO2 phase (the most stable surface in a fluorite structure) in presence of a metal. The reduction of Ce4+ ions is most likely occurring at the interface with the metal and is presented in the inset by a missing O atom.
Table 1
gives the atomic percent of surface atoms (as analyzed by XPS) together with the expected atomic percentage of the metals if they were equally distributed in the bulk and at the surface. All metal/CeO2 catalysts contained an O to Ce ratios less than 2, indicating some reduction of the surface of ceria. Also shown is the CO uptake at 300 K over the catalysts. CO adsorption was not observed on CeO2 alone in this work suggesting that irreversible adsorption at 300 K on the support is negligible compared to that on the metal. No attempt was made to calculate the metal particle size because of inevitable variations in the modes of adsorption of CO on the different metals.
Infrared spectra of sequential irreversible CO adsorption on CeO2 and Rh/CeO2 at 90 K and after evacuation under dynamic vacuum (104 Torr) are presented in
Fig. 2
A and B. Both catalysts were not reduced prior to CO adsorption. The objective is to see for a possible differences in the weak (electrostatic) mode of adsorbed CO on Ce and on Rh cations. The introduction of small amounts of CO (0.4 Torr),
Fig. 2
A, leads to the appearance of a band in the CO stretching region at 2186 cm1. A gradual increasing of the CO pressure results in an intensity increase of the 2186 cm1 band and an emergence of a lower wavenumber shoulder at about 2165 cm1. Further increase of the CO pressure enhanced the intensity of both bands. The shoulder at 2165 cm1 eventually shared similar absorbance intensity as the band at 2186 cm1 at high coverage. At saturation coverage, the absorption bands at 2186 and 2165 cm1 experienced negligible shifts to 2182 and 2163 cm1, respectively. In general a large shift with increasing coverage is associated with a large distribution of non-homogenous-type surfaces
[37]
,
[38]
. The assignment of these two bands is, however, not totally clear at present. Two CO stretching bands of 2170 and 2150 cm1
[39]
or 2168 and 2157 cm1 are observed by others
[40]
when adsorbing CO on CeO2 at low temperature followed by evacuation. These two bands were assigned to CO adsorbed on Ce4+ cations and defects associated with Ce3+, respectively. This interpretation is tempting; yet, the absence of Ce3+ by XPS in our CeO2 alone may not favor such an argument. Although a small amounts of Ce3+ may escape the instrument resolution of about 0.5 eV, it is difficult to accept that stoichiometric CeO2 has equal amounts of Ce4+ and Ce3+ at its surface. There are however other interpretations, one of them is based on different binding modes on differently oriented surfaces. An ab initio DFT study has attempted to compute the frequency of CO on CeO2 as a function of surface structure
[41]
; CeO2(1 1 1) and CeO2(1 1 0). The authors
[42]
found that CO adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface was blue shifted (from the CO gas phase) by +6 cm1 while that on the (1 1 0) was shifted by +15 cm1. The blue shift is consistent with experimental observations of this work and those of others
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
. Although the absolute numbers do not match the experimental ones (in general due to deviation of the computation work from un-harmonicity), their result nevertheless points to another interpretation not related to different oxidation states of Ce ions. In their work they also found that the binding energy of CO is higher on the (1 1 0) when compared to that on (1 1 1) surface
[41]
. This is in line with the results of
Fig. 2
A since the high frequency band populates first. Heating to 180 K resulted in the removal of all CO from the surface (not shown). The presence of Rh ions (
Fig. 2
B) is clearly marked by the appearance of a band at about 2120 cm1. This band is attributed to a linear mode of adsorption (red shifted with respect to gas phase CO) on isolated (very small) clusters of Rh ions on point defect of CeO2 for the reasons outlined next. IR bands of CO adsorbed on Rh have been well studied in the past. In particular and relevant to this work is the IR of CO at low temperature on Rh supported on oxide supports
[42]
,
[43]
. This IR and STM study of CO adsorption at 90 K (the same temperature as in this work) over clusters of Rh atoms (about 9 atoms) deposited over thin film of Al2O3 have shown that these small clusters give IR bands at 2117 cm1 and at 2125 cm1 attributed to linear CORh ions
[42]
,
[43]
as well as to (CO)2Rh+ species (gem dicarbonyl). Based on STM data they have attributed this mode to Rh clusters formed on point defects (Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref.
[32]
). When the cluster size increases this band disappears in favor of a more commonly observed band around 2080 cm1. The authors explain the absence of the asymmetric band of the gem dicarbonyl (expected at about 2050 cm1) as possibly due to selection rule because of the thin film in their case
[39]
,
[40]
. This explanation is difficult to apply in our case because CeO2 is polycrystalline. Thus the absence of a band at 2050 cm1 in
Fig. 2
may not be in favor of a dicarbonyl species and most of CO adsorbed on these isolated Rh ions is in the form of CORhx+. In addition, in our case (
Fig. 2
) the band is large and is most likely composed of more than one type of linearly adsorbed CORhx+. It is worth indicating that a computation work a decade ago has predicted that segregation of metal ions such as Pd2+, and Rh3+ are stabilized with O point defects on the surface of CeO2
[44]
. In all cases the IR data favors the formation of Rh particles in small clusters. Following the initial population of these sites the two IR bands corresponding to adsorbed CO over Ce cations are seen as in the case of CeO2 alone. Removal of OC-Rh bands occurs by heating the surface to 240 K (not shown).

Fig. 3
shows a TEM/EDX study of a fresh and used Rh-Pd/CeO2 catalyst. Other M/CeO2 catalysts were also studied and the results were in general similar. As in other works CeO2 is composed of very small particles. High magnification reveals that the unused CeO2 has lattice fringes mostly along the [1 1 1] orientation as expected from the most stable cut of the fluorite structure. Nothing else was observed on the fresh catalyst despite numerous attempts. In other words while EDX (inset of
Fig. 3
), XPS (
Table 1
), irreversible CO adsorption (
Table 1
) at room temperature and electrostatic CO-adsorption (
Fig. 2
B) show evidences of the presence of the metal the TEM pictures did not conclusively show that. The used catalyst (for the reforming of ethanol with a total number of working hours of about 60) had other features, however. Two distinct regions in some particles (denoted as 1 and 2) are seen in
Fig. 4
. First, light patches of hexagonal shape are present (region 1). The line spacing is close to 3.7  0.2 Å, within the instrument resolution, which is very close to that of the spacing along the (1 1 1) plan of CeO2 (3.8 Å). The spacing of Pd (1 1 1) or Rh (1 1 1) is far smaller 2.8 Å. In other words if these lines belong to Pd or Rh (or a mixture of both) they would have grown epitaxially on top of a CeO2 lattice. Second, light feature with lozenge shapes are also seen (region 2). One can also see steps along the edges. Reconstructions giving rise to steps, is not uncommon. The first fluorite-type surface to give rise to steps is the (3 1 0). This surface has been postulated as the most active low index surface for CO oxidation
[45]
it does also have he highest surface energy of low index surfaces of CeO2
[46]
. It is not intended to explain the reconstruction of CeO2 as solely due to the formation of the 310 reconstructed-phase alone, though. The inset in
Fig. 4
shows a schematic representation of such a stepped surface (as an example).

From

,

Fig. 4
one can conclude that (i) part of CeO2 is reduced by the presence of the noble metal ions (Pd, Rh, or Pt), (ii) the presence of these noble metal ions is also seen following CO adsorption at 90 K by IR. (iii) these metals (as well as metal ions) are not unambiguously seen by TEM; this at least indicates that their particle dimension is smaller than 5 nm, (iv) reconstruction of part of CeO2 surface occurs for the used Rh-Pd/CeO2 catalyst.
Ethanol TPD was conducted on several monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, containing Rh, Pt and Pd on CeO2 and details of some are given in Refs.
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[28]
. Although Ethanol-TPD is conducted in conditions not necessarily close to those of reforming or oxidation reactions it brings essential information needed for the study of ethanol reaction. Here we focus on three TPD studies over the bimetallic catalysts: Rh-Pd/CeO2, Rh-Pt/CeO2 and Pd-Pt/CeO2.
Table 2
shows details of the desorption products quantified as indicated in Section
2
. The reaction product distribution on the bimetallic catalysts is very simple, in contrast to that observed over the monometallic catalysts
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. This is indicative of the high activity of the bimetallic catalysts for ethanol decomposition. This high activity is of course due to the higher loading of the support (see
Table 1
) but is essentially due to a combined (synergetic) effect of the Rh with Pd or Pt as explained next. Other products that were observed on the monometallic catalysts but are not observed here are acetone and benzene. Water in all cases was not quantified and ethylene in all cases was absent. There is one main observation from
Table 2
: catalysts containing Rh give a large amount of methane when they are hydrogen reduced prior to TPD. Hydrogen reduction will reduce metal ions to zero valent metal. The behavior is best explained in
Fig. 5
. While the three unreduced catalysts behave similarly for ethanol decomposition and give considerable amounts of acetaldehyde the reduced catalysts containing Rh switch the reaction from acetaldehyde to methane. On the contrary the reduced Pd-Pt/CeO2 does not show much difference. In other words the carboncarbon bond splitting of ethanol is not further improved by reduction of Pd or Pt ions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol yields acetaldehyde and this is naturally more favored over unreduced catalysts. Reduction may still favor dehydrogenation if beta hydrogen elimination of the ethoxide species (formed upon dissociative adsorption of ethanol as seen by IR on these catalysts

[22]

[28]
occurs. However, Rh metal favors the removal of terminal hydrogen of the CH3 group and this results in an oxametallacycle intermediate:
CH3CH2O(a)  CH3CHO(g) + H(a) favored over Pd and Pt metals
CH3CH2O(a)  (a)-CH2-CH2O(a) favored over Rh metal

Periodic Pane wave DFT study of Rh/CeO2 (1 1 1) surface indicated that the decomposition of ethanol has a low energy path via an oxametallacycle intermediate at the interface between Rh and Ce ions: RhCH2CH2OCe
[47]
. This route is in line with the above experimental observation.
Fig. 6
presents the reforming of ethanol with water (1 ethanol/3 water molecules) over Rh-Pd/CeO2 as a function of temperature. The catalyst was not reduced prior to reaction. At each temperature the catalyst was kept for a period of 2 h or more. No catalytic deactivation is seen during this period. The numbers indicated are the average over about a 2-h period. At low temperature <500 K trace amounts of acetaldehyde and acetone are seen. These products were absent at higher temperatures. Ethylene was not observed at all temperatures studied consistent with TPD results. Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K. There are two main observations in the figure. (i) The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production. This observation has been repeated several times and is independent of reaction flow rate. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason. (ii) Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane and has been seen on other studies

. However, the amount of CO increases again at high temperature. It is worth indicating that WGSR is exothermic while reforming is endothermic [more details on the temperature effects on these two reactions can be found in Ref.
[51]
]. The steam reforming reaction (SRR) together with WGSR have been studied over a wide range of catalysts in order to find the best catalytic formulation for hydrogen and CO2 production
[52]
. It was found that while Rh is very good for SRR the presence of a good WGSR such as CeO2 has resulted in a decrease of the CO2 formation at high temperature. The authors therefore have concluded that a non-active support for the WGSR should be used. The authors presumably indicate that CO2 can be directly formed by CO oxidation in a different route. This interesting idea may need complementary work for further understanding.

The complete reaction was repeated four times (the duration of each run was about 15 h). The trend was reproducible indicating that the catalyst was not deactivated. Maximum variations of the reaction yield of 1015% were observed. These variations are attributed to analytical and experimental errors rather than to an intrinsic change within the catalyst from one run to the other.
4. Conclusions
The reaction of ethanol has been studied over bimetallic CeO2 catalysts (Rh and Pd or Pt) for the production of hydrogen. The reaction seems to occur at the interface between Ce and metal ions. While CO adsorption (IR and titration), XPS and TPD techniques revealed characteristics related to the presence of the metal, TEM does not give conclusive presence. It is highly likely that these metals are dispersed in ultra small clusters on the surface of the support. The presence of Rh atoms is crucial for the reforming of ethanol since they initiate the terminal carbonhydrogen bond dissociation and thus favoring the formation of the possible oxametallacycle intermediate needed for further interaction with the surface and dissociation of the carboncarbon bond. The increasing hydrogen production at elevated temperatures (above 650 K) is most likely due to reforming of methane. The formation of methane is undesired and the next generation of catalysts will need to suppress methane formation if a low temperature (below 650 K) hydrogen production catalyst by reforming of ethanol is desired.
