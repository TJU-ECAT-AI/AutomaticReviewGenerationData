[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."

[3] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled"

[4] "Maximum variations of the reaction yield of 10–15% were observed. These variations are attributed to analytical and experimental errors rather than to an intrinsic change within the catalyst from one run to the other."

Selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It utilizes a renewable feedstock (ethanol) that can be produced from crops, resulting in negligible net CO2 emissions.

2. It enables on-board hydrogen generation for fuel cells, allowing easier transport and storage of the energy carrier (ethanol) compared to hydrogen gas.

3. It can produce hydrogen with relatively high yields (up to 60% selectivity reported) at temperatures above 650 K.

4. The process shows good stability, with minimal catalyst deactivation observed over multiple runs.

Key advantages include the renewable nature of the feedstock, potential for distributed hydrogen production, and the ability to utilize existing liquid fuel infrastructure. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison to traditional methods in terms of overall yield, environmental impact, or practical implementation challenges. More research would be needed to fully assess these aspects compared to conventional hydrogen production methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它利用可再生原料（乙醇），该原料可以从农作物中生产，因此对净CO2排放的贡献可以忽略不计。

2. 它实现了燃料电池的车载制氢，与氢气相比，能源载体（乙醇）的运输和储存更加方便。

3. 在650 K以上的温度下，它可以生产相对高产率的氢气（报告的选择性高达60%）。

4. 该过程显示出良好的稳定性，在多次运行中观察到的催化剂失活程度很小。

主要优势包括原料的可再生性、分布式制氢的潜力，以及利用现有液体燃料基础设施的能力。然而，文献并未直接比较该方法与传统方法在总体产率、环境影响或实际实施挑战方面的差异。需要进行更多研究才能全面评估这些方面与传统制氢方法的比较。
