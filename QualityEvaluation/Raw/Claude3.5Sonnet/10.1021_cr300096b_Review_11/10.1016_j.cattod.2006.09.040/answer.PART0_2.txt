[1] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."

[2] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol. To do this one needs, ideally, to break one CH of the terminal CH3 group. This has been reported to occur via an oxametallacycle intermediate."

[3] "The presence of Rh atoms is crucial for the reforming of ethanol since they initiate the terminal carbonhydrogen bond dissociation and thus favoring the formation of the possible oxametallacycle intermediate needed for further interaction with the surface and dissociation of the carboncarbon bond."

[4] "The increasing hydrogen production at elevated temperatures (above 650 K) is most likely due to reforming of methane."

Selective oxygenate reforming of ethanol contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Renewable feedstock: Ethanol can be produced renewably from crops, resulting in negligible net CO2 emissions.

2. Hydrogen production: The process allows for catalytic production of hydrogen from ethanol, which is a clean energy carrier.

3. Efficient C-C bond breaking: Using catalysts like Rh allows for efficient dissociation of the C-C bond in ethanol via an oxametallacycle intermediate. 

4. High temperature advantages: At higher temperatures (>650K), additional hydrogen can be produced through methane reforming.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yields of hydrogen compared to traditional methods
- Lower environmental impact due to renewable feedstock
- Practical implementation using existing catalytic reforming technology

However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods in terms of specific yields or quantitative environmental impacts. More research would be needed to fully assess the relative advantages.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献包括：

1. 可再生原料：乙醇可以通过作物可再生生产，导致净CO2排放量可忽略不计。

2. 氢气生产：该过程允许从乙醇中催化生产氢气，氢气是一种清洁能源载体。

3. 高效C-C键断裂：使用如铑等催剂可以通过氧杂金属环中间体高效断裂乙醇中的C-C键。

4. 高温优势：在较高温度（>650K）下，可通过甲烷重整产生额外的氢气。

主要优势包括：

- 与传统方法相比，氢气产品产率更高
- 由于使用可再生原料，环境影响较低
- 可使用现有的催化重整技术实现实际应用

然而，文献并未直接比较具体产率或量化环境影响方面与传统方法的差异。需要进行更多研究来全面评估其相对优势。
