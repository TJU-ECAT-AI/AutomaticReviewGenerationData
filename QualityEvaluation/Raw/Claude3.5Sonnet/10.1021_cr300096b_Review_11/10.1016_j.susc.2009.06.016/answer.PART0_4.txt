[1] "Oxygenates such as methanol and ethylene glycol can be reformed to produce CO and H2 on various transition metal surfaces. Facile reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates to H2 and CO provides for a renewable route to a hydrogen economy."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer a means of reducing precious metal loadings both by replacing bulk atoms with a less expensive substitute and by increasing the activity and selectivity for desired products."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a renewable route to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide from biomass-derived feedstocks. Its key advantages include:

1. Renewable feedstock: Using biomass-derived oxygenates like methanol and ethylene glycol as starting materials.

2. Valuable products: Producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are important building blocks for chemical synthesis and energy applications.

3. Improved catalysts: Bimetallic catalysts can increase activity and selectivity while reducing the use of precious metals, enhancing cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

4. Potential for a hydrogen economy: Facilitating the production of hydrogen from renewable sources, supporting the transition to cleaner energy systems.

5. Resource efficiency: Utilizing oxygenates derived from biomass helps to close the carbon cycle and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

While the text does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods, the emphasis on renewable feedstocks and improved catalysts suggests potential advantages in environmental impact and practical implementation over conventional fossil fuel-based processes.
