[1] "Oxygenates such as methanol and ethylene glycol can be reformed to produce CO and H2 on various transition metal surfaces. Facile reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates to H2 and CO provides for a renewable route to a hydrogen economy."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts offer a means of reducing precious metal loadings both by replacing bulk atoms with a less expensive substitute and by increasing the activity and selectivity for desired products."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a renewable route to hydrogen production from biomass-derived feedstocks. Key advantages include:

1. Product yield: It produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are valuable chemical feedstocks and energy carriers.

2. Environmental impact: The process uses renewable biomass-derived oxygenates as starting materials, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

3. Practical implementation: Bimetallic catalysts can increase activity and selectivity while reducing precious metal usage, potentially lowering costs.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers a more sustainable approach by utilizing renewable resources and potentially improving efficiency through advanced catalyst design. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods in terms of specific yields or quantitative environmental impacts.
