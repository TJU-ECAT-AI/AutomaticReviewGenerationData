          [1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

[3] "The reforming of oxygenates, a hydrogen-production reaction, to further explore the correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of MBS structures."

[4] "The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, operation of direct methanol fuel cells, and methanol reforming to produce hydrogen."

[5] "In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces"

          Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. Hydrogen and biofuel production: It enables the conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates like ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and glucose into hydrogen or biofuels, providing a renewable pathway for producing these important energy carriers.

2. Improved catalytic performance: Bimetallic catalysts such as NiPt, CoPt, and FePt show increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming compared to traditional catalysts like Pt/γ-Al2O3, potentially leading to higher yields of desired products.

3. Environmental benefits: By utilizing biomass-derived feedstocks, this process reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps decrease overall carbon emissions, aligning with sustainability goals.

4. Versatility: The process can be applied to various oxygenates, from smaller molecules like methanol to larger ones like glycerol and glucose, offering flexibility in feedstock selection and product output.

5. Fundamental understanding: Studies on smaller oxygenates provide insights into the chemistry of larger, more complex biomass-derived molecules, facilitating the development of more effective catalysts and processes.

Key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation include:

1. Higher product yields: Bimetallic catalysts show improved efficiency, potentially leading to increased yields of hydrogen and other desired products.

2. Reduced environmental impact: The use of renewable feedstocks and the potential for lower operating temperatures in aqueous phase reforming can result in a smaller carbon footprint compared to traditional methods.

3. Practical implementation: The ability to tune catalyst properties through bimetallic formulations allows for optimization of activity and selectivity, potentially improving atom economy and reducing unwanted byproducts.

4. Milder operating conditions: Aqueous phase reforming typically operates at lower temperatures than traditional high-temperature reforming, potentially reducing energy requirements.

5. Broader feedstock options: The ability to process various oxygenates allows for greater flexibility in adapting to different biomass sources and market demands.

While the literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional methods in all aspects, the advantages of selective oxygenate reforming using bimetallic catalysts suggest significant potential for improving sustainability and efficiency in energy and chemical production from renewable resources.
