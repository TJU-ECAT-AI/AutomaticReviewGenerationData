[1] "The reforming of oxygenates, a hydrogen-production reaction, to further explore the correlation of the electronic and chemical properties of MBS structures."

[2] "The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, operation of direct methanol fuel cells, and methanol reforming to produce hydrogen."

[3] "In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces"

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen, which is a clean energy carrier and can be used in fuel cells or other applications.

2. It can utilize renewable feedstocks like methanol, ethanol, and other biomass-derived oxygenates.

3. It allows for the production of useful chemicals like formaldehyde alongside hydrogen.

4. It can be used to generate syngas (H2 and CO) which is an important intermediate for many chemical processes.

Key advantages include:

- Higher product yields and selectivity compared to traditional reforming methods, due to the ability to tune catalyst properties.

- Potentially lower environmental impact by using renewable feedstocks and producing clean hydrogen.

- More practical implementation as it can be conducted at lower temperatures than conventional reforming.

- Flexibility to produce different products by adjusting reaction conditions and catalysts.

However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of yields, environmental impacts, or implementation details versus traditional methods. Further research would be needed to quantify these advantages more precisely.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献有以下几个方面:

1. 它生产氢气,氢气是一种清洁的能源载体,可用于燃料电池或其他应用。

2. 它可以利用甲醇、乙醇和其他生物质衍生的含氧化合物等可再生原料。

3. 它可以在生产氢气的同时生产甲醛等有用化学品。

4. 它可用于生成合成气(H2和CO),这是许多化学过程的重要中间体。

主要优势包括:

- 由于能够调节催化剂性能,与传统重整方法相比,产品产率和选择性更高。

- 通过使用可再生原料和生产清洁氢气,可能对环境影响较小。

- 实施起来更实际,因为它可以在比常规重整更低的温度下进行。

- 通过调整反应条件和催化剂,可灵活地生产不同产品。

然而,文献并未直接比较与传统方法的产率、环境影响或实施细节。需要进一步研究才能更精确地量化这些优势。
