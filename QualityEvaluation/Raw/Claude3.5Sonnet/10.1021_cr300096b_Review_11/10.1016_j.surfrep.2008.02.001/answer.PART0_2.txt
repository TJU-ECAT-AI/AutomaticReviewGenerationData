[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ- Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. It enables the production of hydrogen and other useful chemicals from biomass-derived oxygenates like ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol and glucose. This allows for renewable feedstocks to be used instead of fossil fuels.

2. Bimetallic catalysts like NiPt, CoPt and FePt have shown increased activity for aqueous phase reforming compared to monometallic catalysts. This improved efficiency can lead to higher product yields.

3. The ability to selectively reform specific bonds allows for better control over product distribution and can minimize unwanted byproducts, reducing environmental impact.

4. Understanding the reforming of smaller oxygenates provides insights that can be applied to larger, more complex biomass-derived molecules. This fundamental knowledge aids in developing practical reforming processes.

5. Aqueous phase reforming occurs under milder conditions than traditional high-temperature reforming, potentially reducing energy requirements.

While the literature does not provide a direct comparison to traditional methods, the use of renewable feedstocks, improved catalysts, and milder conditions suggests selective oxygenate reforming offers advantages in sustainability and efficiency for producing hydrogen and other chemicals. However, more research is needed to fully assess its practical implementation at commercial scales.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它能够从生物质衍生的含氧化合物(如乙醇、乙二醇、甘油和葡萄糖)中生产氢气和其他有用的化学品。这允许使用可再生原料而不是化石燃料。

2. 像NiPt、CoPt和FePt这样的双金属催化剂在水相重整方面表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。这种提高的效率可以带来更高的产品产率。

3. 选择性地重整特定键的能力允许更好地控制产品分布，并可以最大限度地减少不需要的副产品，从而减少环境影响。

4. 了解较小含氧化合物的重整过程为研究更大、更复杂的生物质衍生分子提供了见解。这些基础知识有助于开发实用的重整工艺。

5. 水相重整发生在比传统高温重整更温和的条件下，可能减少能源需求。

虽然文献没有直接与传统方法进行比较，但使用可再生原料、改进的催化剂和更温和的条件表明，选择性含氧化合物重整在生产氢气和其他化学品方面具有可持续性和效率优势。然而，还需要更多的研究来全面评估其在商业规模上的实际实施情况。
