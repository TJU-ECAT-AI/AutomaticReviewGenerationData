[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ- Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates like ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and glucose into hydrogen or biofuels. This process offers several key advantages:

1. Improved product yield: Bimetallic catalysts like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt have shown increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming compared to traditional catalysts, potentially leading to higher yields of desired products.

2. Environmental impact: By utilizing biomass-derived feedstocks, this process reduces reliance on fossil fuels and can potentially lower overall carbon emissions. The ability to produce hydrogen or biofuels from renewable sources aligns with sustainable energy goals.

3. Practical implementation: The use of bimetallic surfaces allows for tuning of catalytic properties, potentially optimizing selectivity and activity for specific reactions. This flexibility can lead to more efficient and targeted processes.

4. Fundamental understanding: Studies on smaller oxygenates provide insights into the chemistry of larger, more complex biomass-derived molecules, facilitating the development of more effective catalysts and processes.

5. Versatility: The ability to produce both hydrogen and biofuels from various oxygenates offers flexibility in meeting different energy needs and adapting to market demands.

While the literature does not provide extensive details on all these aspects, it suggests that selective oxygenate reforming using bimetallic catalysts has the potential to significantly improve upon traditional methods in terms of efficiency, sustainability, and adaptability to various feedstocks and product requirements.
