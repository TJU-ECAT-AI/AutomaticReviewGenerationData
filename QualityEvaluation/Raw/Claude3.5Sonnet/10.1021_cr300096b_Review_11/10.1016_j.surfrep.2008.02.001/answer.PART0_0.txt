[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates like ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and glucose into hydrogen or biofuels. This process offers several key advantages:

1. Improved product yield: Bimetallic surfaces like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt show increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming compared to traditional catalysts, potentially leading to higher yields of desired products.

2. Environmental impact: By utilizing biomass-derived feedstocks, this process reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps decrease overall carbon emissions. The ability to produce hydrogen or biofuels from renewable sources aligns with sustainability goals.

3. Practical implementation: The use of bimetallic catalysts allows for tuning of surface properties to optimize reactivity and selectivity. This flexibility in catalyst design can help address specific challenges in different reforming reactions.

4. Versatility: The similar reactivity trends observed for various oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces suggest that insights gained from studying smaller molecules can be applied to larger, more complex biomass-derived compounds. This approach simplifies research and development efforts.

5. Value-added products: The process converts relatively low-value biomass-derived oxygenates into high-value products like hydrogen and biofuels, improving the economic viability of biomass utilization.

While the literature does not provide a direct comparison to traditional methods, the advantages of selective oxygenate reforming using bimetallic catalysts suggest significant potential for improving sustainability and efficiency in energy and chemical production from renewable resources.
