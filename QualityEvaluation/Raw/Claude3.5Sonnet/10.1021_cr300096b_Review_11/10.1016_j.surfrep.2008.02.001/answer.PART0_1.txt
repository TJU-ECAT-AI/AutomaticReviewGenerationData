[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ- Al2O3 at similar conditions"

[2] "Overall, the results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It enables the production of hydrogen and syngas from biomass-derived oxygenates like ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and glucose. This provides a renewable pathway for producing hydrogen and syngas, which are important feedstocks for fuel cells and chemical synthesis.

2. Bimetallic catalysts like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt show increased activity compared to monometallic catalysts for aqueous phase reforming. This improved catalytic performance can increase product yields and efficiency.

3. Using biomass-derived oxygenates as feedstocks reduces reliance on fossil fuels and provides a more environmentally-friendly carbon source. 

4. The ability to tune catalyst electronic properties through bimetallic formulations allows optimization of activity and selectivity. This can improve atom economy and reduce unwanted byproducts compared to less selective catalysts.

5. Aqueous phase reforming operates at milder conditions than traditional high-temperature reforming, potentially reducing energy requirements.

6. Understanding reforming of smaller oxygenates provides insights into converting larger biomass-derived molecules, expanding feedstock options.

While more research is needed, selective oxygenate reforming shows promise as a sustainable approach for producing hydrogen and chemical building blocks from renewable resources with improved efficiency over traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献主要体现在以下几个方面:

1. 它能够从生物质衍生的含氧化合物(如乙醇、乙二醇、甘油和葡萄糖)中生产氢气和合成气。这为生产氢气和合成气提供了一条可再生途径,而这两种气体是燃料电池和化学合成的重要原料。

2. 双金属催化剂(如NiPt、CoPt和FePt)在水相重整中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。这种改进的催化性能可以提高产品产率和效率。

3. 使用生物质衍生的含氧化合物作为原料减少了对化石燃料的依赖,提供了一种更环保的碳源。

4. 通过双金属配方调节催化剂电子性质的能力允许优化活性和选择性。与选择性较差的催化剂相比,这可以提高原子经济性并减少不需要的副产品。

5. 水相重整在比传统高温重整更温和的条件下进行,可能减少能源需求。

6. 了解小分子含氧化合物的重整为转化更大的生物质衍生分子提供了见解,扩大了原料选择。

虽然还需要更多研究,但选择性含氧化合物重整显示出作为一种可持续方法的前景,可以从可再生资源中生产氢气和化学建筑块,比传统方法效率更高。
