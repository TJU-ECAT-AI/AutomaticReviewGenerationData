          [1] "For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2."

          [2] "The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel"

          [3] "The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production"

          [4] "H2-rich mixtures are industrially produced by steam reforming (SR, Eq. (1)) of natural gas on Ni catalysts"

          [5] "With higher hydrocarbons, moreover, the SR becomes very endothermic, thus the combination of SR and partial oxidation (POX, Eq. (5)), known as autothermal reforming (ATR), is preferred. The hydrocarbons react with H2O and O2 in a process where high energy efficiencies are achieved as the exothermic POX reaction provides the heat needed for the endothermic SR reaction. The process is simple in design and requires low monetary investments"

          While the literature does not specifically address selective oxygenate reforming, it discusses autothermal reforming (ATR), which contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

          1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: ATR produces hydrogen or hydrogen-rich mixtures (syngas) as a substitute for fossil fuels, helping to reduce CO2 emissions.

          2. Fuel flexibility: It allows for the use of diverse primary fuels including natural gas, biomass, and crude oil for hydrogen production.

          3. Clean combustion: The produced hydrogen burns cleanly, further reducing environmental impact.

          4. Energy efficiency: ATR combines steam reforming (SR) and partial oxidation (POX), achieving high energy efficiencies by utilizing the heat from the exothermic POX reaction for the endothermic SR reaction.

          5. Simple design and low investment: The ATR process is simple in design and requires relatively low monetary investments, making it more practical to implement.

          6. Versatility: It can process higher hydrocarbons, which are more challenging for traditional steam reforming alone.

          7. Support for emerging technologies: The process helps meet the growing demand for hydrogen in fuel cell technologies for heat and power production, as well as potential replacements for internal combustion engines.

          Compared to traditional methods like steam reforming of natural gas, ATR offers advantages in terms of energy efficiency, ability to process a wider range of feedstocks, and potentially lower operating costs due to its simpler design. While specific yield comparisons are not provided, the combination of SR and POX in ATR suggests it may offer improved overall yields and process efficiency.

          虽然文献没有具体讨论选择性含氧化合物重整，但它讨论了自热重整（ATR），这种方法以多种方式促进了可持续能源和化学品生产：

          1. 减少温室气体排放：ATR生产氢气或富氢混合物（合成气）来替代化石燃料，有助于减少二氧化碳排放。

          2. 燃料灵活性：它允许使用多种初级燃料，包括天然气、生物质和原油来生产氢气。

          3. 清洁燃烧：生产的氢气燃烧清洁，进一步减少环境影响。

          4. 能源效率：ATR结合了蒸汽重整（SR）和部分氧化（POX），通过利用放热的POX反应的热量来进行吸热的SR反应，实现了高能效。

          5. 简单设计和低投资：ATR过程设计简单，所需投资相对较低，使其更易于实施。

          6. 多功能性：它可以处理更高级的碳氢化合物，这对传统的单独蒸汽重整来说更具挑战性。

          7. 支持新兴技术：该过程有助于满足燃料电池技术在热能和电力生产方面日益增长的氢气需求，以及作为内燃机潜在替代品的需求。

          与传统方法（如天然气蒸汽重整）相比，ATR在能源效率、处理更广泛原料的能力以及由于其简单设计而可能降低运营成本方面具有优势。虽然没有提供具体的产率比较，但SR和POX在ATR中的结合表明，它可能提供改进的整体产率和过程效率。
