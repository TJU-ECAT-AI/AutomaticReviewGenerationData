[1] "For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2."

[2] "The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production"

[3] "H2-rich mixtures are industrially produced by steam reforming (SR, Eq. (1)) of natural gas on Ni catalysts"

[4] "The reforming of higher hydrocarbons (gasoline and diesel), which contain aromatics, increases the risk of carbon deposition, especially on a Ni catalyst"

The literature does not directly discuss selective oxygenate reforming or compare it to traditional methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some potential advantages of hydrogen production through reforming processes:

1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Hydrogen production can help reduce CO2 emissions when used as a substitute for fossil fuels in energy production.

2. Versatility: Hydrogen-rich mixtures can be produced from various sources, including natural gas, biomass, and crude oil, offering flexibility in feedstock selection.

3. Clean combustion: Hydrogen provides clean combustion when used as a fuel, contributing to reduced environmental impact.

4. Applicability to fuel cell technologies: The growing interest in fuel cells for heat, power production, and as alternatives to internal combustion engines increases the demand for hydrogen production.

5. Potential for higher hydrocarbons: While traditional steam reforming of natural gas is common, there is interest in reforming higher hydrocarbons like gasoline and diesel, though this presents challenges such as increased risk of carbon deposition.

The document does not provide specific information on product yields, environmental impacts, or practical implementation of selective oxygenate reforming compared to traditional methods.

文献中没有直接讨论选择性含氧化合物重整或将其与传统方法进行比较。然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出通过重整过程进行氢气生产的一些潜在优势：

1. 减少温室气体排放：当用作能源生产中化石燃料的替代品时，氢气生产可以帮助减少二氧化碳排放。

2. 多功能性：富氢混合物可以从各种来源生产，包括天然气、生物质和原油，为原料选择提供了灵活性。

3. 清洁燃烧：氢气作为燃料使用时提供清洁燃烧，有助于减少环境影响。

4. 适用于燃料电池技术：对热能、电力生产以及作为内燃机替代品的燃料电池的日益增长的兴趣增加了对氢气生产的需求。

5. 高碳氢化合物的潜力：虽然传统的天然气蒸汽重整很常见，但对汽油和柴油等高碳氢化合物的重整也有兴趣，尽管这带来了诸如增加碳沉积风险等挑战。

该文件没有提供有关选择性含氧化合物重整与传统方法相比在产品产量、环境影响或实际实施方面的具体信息。
