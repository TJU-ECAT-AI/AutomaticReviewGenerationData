[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."

[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by producing hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemical and fuel production. It offers several key advantages:

1. Product yield: It efficiently produces hydrogen and syngas, which are valuable for various applications.

2. Environmental impact: When using oxygenates derived from renewable biomass, the process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth.

3. Practical implementation: The reactants have low toxicity and low reactivity, making them compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to producing hydrogen and syngas, while also being practically implementable within current infrastructure systems.
