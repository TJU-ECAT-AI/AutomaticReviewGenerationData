[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."

[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by producing hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemicals and fuels. It offers several key advantages:

1. Environmental impact: When using oxygenates from renewable biomass, the process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct is consumed by future biomass growth.

2. Product yield: It produces valuable products like hydrogen and syngas, which have applications in fuel cells and chemical production.

3. Practical implementation: The reactants have low toxicity and reactivity, making them compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods, potentially reducing carbon emissions while producing useful energy carriers and chemical feedstocks.
