[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."

[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."

[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemicals and fuels production.

2. When using oxygenates from renewable biomass, the process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct is consumed by future biomass growth.

3. It offers advantages in terms of practical implementation, including low toxicity and low reactivity of reactants, making them compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

The process provides a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods by utilizing renewable feedstocks and potentially achieving carbon neutrality. While specific product yields are not mentioned, the ability to produce both hydrogen and syngas offers versatility in applications. The environmental impact is potentially reduced through CO2 neutrality when using biomass-derived oxygenates.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献有以下几个方面：

1. 它生产用于燃料电池的氢气和用于化学品和燃料生产的合成气。

2. 当使用可再生生物质中的含氧化合物时，这个过程可以实现CO2中和，因为CO2副产品会被未来的生物质生长所消耗。

3. 在实际应用方面，它具有诸多优势，包括反应物的低毒性和低反应性，使其与现有的运输和储存基础设施兼容。

与传统方法相比，这个过程通过利用可再生原料并有可能实现碳中和，提供了一种更可持续的替代方案。虽然没有提到具体的产品产量，但能够同时生产氢气和合成气提供了应用上的多样性。当使用生物质衍生的含氧化合物时，环境影响可能会通过CO2中和而降低。
