Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemical and fuel production.

2. When using oxygenates from renewable biomass, the process can be CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct is consumed by future biomass growth.

3. The reactants have low toxicity and reactivity, making them compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure.

These advantages make oxygenate reforming a promising alternative to traditional methods, offering improved environmental impact through potential carbon neutrality and easier practical implementation due to compatibility with existing infrastructure. The literature does not provide specific comparisons of product yields to traditional methods.

选择性含氧化合物重整对可持续能源和化学品生产的贡献有以下几个方面：

1. 它可以生产用于燃料电池的氢气和用于化学品和燃料生产的合成气。

2. 当使用可再生生物质中的含氧化合物时，这个过程可以实现二氧化碳中和，因为副产品二氧化碳可以被未来的生物质生长所消耗。

3. 反应物具有低毒性和低反应性，与现有的运输和储存基础设施兼容。

这些优势使得含氧化合物重整成为传统方法的一个有前景的替代方案，通过潜在的碳中和性提高了环境影响，并且由于与现有基础设施的兼容性，使得实际实施更加容易。文献中没有提供与传统方法的具体产品产率比较。
