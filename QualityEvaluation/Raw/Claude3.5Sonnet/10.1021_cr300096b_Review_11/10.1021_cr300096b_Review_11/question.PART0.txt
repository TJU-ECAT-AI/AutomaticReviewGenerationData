4.3 Reforming of Oxygenates
Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348) If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage. Table 7 summarizes selected reactor studies of oxygenate reforming over supported catalysts; selected UHV studies of reforming over bimetallic surfaces are listed in Table 3.

4.3.1 Reforming of Alcohols and Polyols
4.3.1.1 Pt3d Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
Small oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, have been studied on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces to determine the bond scission sequence of oxygenate molecules. The desirable reaction pathway is selective CC bond scission, to produce H2 and CO. DFT calculations were carried out to study the trend in the binding energies of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. Figure 16 shows the binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol, and ethoxy on Pt(111), Ni(111), PtNiPt(111), and NiPtPt(111) surfaces. (264) A nearly linear correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center was observed, consistent with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nrskov (302) and with the trends observed for other adsorbates in previous sections. The binding energies increase as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, with the NiPtPt(111) surface showing the highest binding energies. The binding energies of molecular oxygenate species are low on all surfaces, between 3 and 12 kcal/mol. After removing the first hydrogen, the methoxy and ethoxy species adsorb more strongly to the surface, with binding energies ranging from 30 to 55 kcal/mol.
TPD measurements were carried out to monitor the reaction pathways of oxygenates on various Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The oxygenate molecules studied included methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. (258, 264, 259) H2 and CO were detected from TPD experiments as the main products from the four oxygenate molecules. No other product was observed with the exception of methane, which was produced after adsorption of ethanol. (258, 264) On Pt(111), methanol adsorbed reversibly on the surface without undergoing decomposition, consistent with previous studies. (255, 369-371) In contrast, significant amounts of H2 and CO were produced from methanol reforming on the NiPtPt(111) surface. On the basis of the H2 and CO yields, the reforming activity follows the order of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111).
Similar trends in the reforming yields are observed for ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. The oxygenate reforming yields obtained experimentally are correlated with the surface d-band center in Figure 17. (257-259) In general, the oxygenate reforming yield displays a somewhat linear correlation and increases as the surface d-band center is shifted closer to the Fermi level. It is important to point out that the trend is opposite of that observed for hydrogenation reactions on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces (Figure 11). The comparison indicates that surfaces that bind adsorbates more strongly, such as NiPtPt(111), promote reforming reactions. One would also predict that at sufficiently high binding energies oxygenates would undergo complete decomposition instead of reforming. This is confirmed experimentally by comparing the reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol (257) on Fe/Pt(111), Ti/Pt(111), and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, where a volcano relationship is observed between reforming yield and binding energies. For example, on the TiPtPt(111) surface the binding energies become too strong, leading to a large fraction of oxygenates undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and oxygen instead of CO. (257)
Using reforming of methanol and ethylene glycol as probe reactions, a similar trend in reforming activity is observed on PtNi surfaces prepared on a polycrystalline Pt substrate. (262) On both substrates the NiPtPt bimetallic surface shows higher reforming yield than PtNiPt, Pt, and Ni surfaces, demonstrating the possibility to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal and polycrystalline materials for reforming reactions.
Reactor studies of aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol show that supported bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe catalysts are significantly more active per gram of catalyst and have higher turnover frequencies (TOFs) for hydrogen production than monometallic Pt catalysts. (349) As shown in Figure 18, the bimetallic catalyst with a 1:1 Pt/Ni ratio shows the higher TOF for H2 production. On the basis of the DFT and UHV results in Figure 17, the enhanced reforming activity observed on the PtNi bimetallic catalyst can be explained by two somewhat conflicting possibilities. (1) If the structure of the supported catalyst is Pt-terminated, i.e., similar to the PtNiPt subsurface structure, the binding of CO and hydrogen would be weaker on the PtNi bimetallic catalyst than on the Pt monometallic catalyst (Figure 10a), thereby increasing the fraction of surface sites available for reaction with ethylene glycol. (349) (2) If the structure of the supported catalyst is transformed to Ni-terminated due to the adsorption of oxygenates, the higher reforming activity would be consistent with the UHV results of NiPtPt(111) being more active than Pt(111) for reforming reactions (Figure 17). The exact origin of the bimetallic enhancement can only be determined by in situ measurement of the surface termination of supported PtNi catalysts, such as by EXAFS under aqueous-phase reforming conditions.
Supported PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were also found to be effective for ethanol reforming. The catalyst was resistant to coke deposition at a ratio of water to ethanol as low as 3.0. As the amount of water was increased, the conversion and H2 production also increased. (366) Soyal-Baltacolu et al. agreed with these findings and found that the optimum metal loading for a PtNi catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 was 0.3 wt % Pt and 15 wt % Ni. (367)
4.3.1.2 Other Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
Pt-based catalysts have shown activity for reforming reactions when alloyed with Ni, (349-352) Co, (349) Sn, (323) Fe, (349, 353) Pd, (353) Ru, (149, 348, 353, 354) Re, (355, 372) Au, (353, 356) and Rh. (373, 374) Selective and facile methanol reforming offers a potential option for the production of hydrogen on board vehicles powered by fuel cells. Production of on-board hydrogen is an attractive option because it allows hydrogen-containing fuels to be stored and transported in liquid form, for which there is an existing infrastructure. (375) Methanol-reforming studies have been performed over a series of bimetallic PtM (M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe) catalysts supported on ZrO2. (353) In these studies, catalysts are prepared by micelle synthesis to mitigate the difference of size and shape, thereby attributing variations in activity to the bimetallic effect. Bimetallic catalysts outperform monometallic Pt for methanol reforming in the order of PtFe > PtRu > PtPd > PtAu > Pt. (353) High activity on the PtFe catalysts is attributed to segregation of Fe to the surface of the nanoparticles during calcination due to the high affinity of Fe for oxygen. (353) The support also plays an important role for methanol reforming. Findings by Miyao et al. show that basic oxide supports improve the selectivity of methanol reforming to CO2 (maximizing H2 production) whereas acidic supports suppress the catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest activity and selectivity to CO2 are achieved over TiO2. (354)
PtRu catalysts have been found to be more active for ethanol steam reforming than either parent metal; however, catalysts derived from organic clusters are more active than those derived from inorganic salts. (149) PtRh bimetallic catalysts are also effective for ethanol reforming when supported on CeO2. PtRh/CeO2 breaks CH bonds before CC bonds in ethanol; (374) therefore, PtRh could enhance H2 production over alkane formation in ethanol reforming. (373) This hypothesis has been confirmed with studies on PtRh/ZrO2 showing that the bimetallic catalyst reaches a conversion of 100% at temperatures above 973 K, with high selectivity for H2 formation. The bimetallic catalyst also shows improved stability over the monometallic Rh/ZrO2 catalyst due to less coke formation. (365)
Another option for reforming is to use glycerol, a waste product from biodiesel production. Reforming of glycerol into syngas in a flow reactor at 548 K shows an increase in H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations upon adding Re to Pt/C catalysts. (348) Re promotes the overall rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt, which makes surface sites more available to participate in reforming. (348) Supported PtRe catalysts are also more tolerant to carbonaceous residues than supported Pt and, therefore, are less likely to deactivate rapidly. (322) The addition of Ru and Os to Pt/C catalysts has also shown to significantly increase the catalytic activity for glycerol reforming at low temperatures (548573 K). (355)
4.3.2 Reforming of Other Oxygenates
Different from the small alcohols and polyols, the CO functional group is also present in the ring-opened structures of C5 and C6 sugars. Glycolaldehyde, (23) the smallest molecule with both COH and CO bonds as well as the same C/O ratio as the larger sugar molecules, is a good probe molecule to determine how the presence of the CO functional group affects the reforming reaction mechanism. In the DFT study, glycolaldehyde is adsorbed on the atop sites of adjacent metal atoms. The optimized geometry on the NiPtPt(111) surface is shown in parts a and b of Figure 19. As shown in Figure 19c, glycolaldehyde-binding energy (23) is found to increase as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, consistent with the trend observed with small alcohols and polyols. According to glycolaldehyde TPD experiments, (23) NiPtPt(111) shows the highest reforming activity and total activity among the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. The activity trend found in experiments is consistent with the DFT prediction based on binding energy and surface d-band center values. On the basis of the comparison of the activity and reaction intermediates of ethylene glycol and glycolaldehyde, the presence of the CO functionality enhances the activity on the Pt(111) surface. In contrast, for surfaces with high activity toward OH bond cleavage, such as the NiPtPt(111) surface, the presence of CO does not significantly affect the activity or reaction pathway of C2 oxygenates. (23)
Figure 19c also includes the glycolaldehyde binding energy and d-band center values on monolayer Ni supported on a tungsten monocarbide (WC) surface. The similar values between the NiPtPt(111) and Ni/WC surfaces suggest similar reforming activity for the two surfaces, which is confirmed experimentally. (23) Such a comparison points out the possibility of using WC to replace Pt in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. More about this subject will be discussed in future research opportunities in section 5.
