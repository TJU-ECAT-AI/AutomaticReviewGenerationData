Methanol 
decomposition 
to adsorbed 
CO and hydrogen 
on Pt(ll1) 
was observed 
using time-resolved 
high resolution 
electron 
energy 
loss spectroscopy. 
No reaction 
was seen at temperatures 
< 180 K, the molecular 
methanol 
desorption 
temperature. 
Between 
180 and 200 K the decomposition 
reaction 
is controlled 
by the small amount 
of defects 
present 
on our carefully 
prepared 
sample. 
This was principally 
demonstrated 
by the fact that only l-2% 
of a monolayer 
of CO was formed 
regardless 
of the initial methanol 
coverage. 
A steady 
state reaction 
run between 
200 and 240 K showed 
only a low rate of CO formation 
(only a few percent 
of a 
monolayer 
even after many langmuir 
exposure 
of methanol). 
At a 300 K surface 
temperature, 
decomposition 
proceeds 
much faster, 
with about 
10% of a monolayer 
of CO being formed. 
The origin of this temperature 
dependence 
is attributed 
to the ability 
of the 
product 
H and CO to diffuse 
away from sites where they were initially 
formed. 
Using a He seeded methanol 
beam, 
there was no 
apparent 
incident 
energy 
dependence 
for the methanol 
decomposition 
reaction. 
1. Introduction 
The effects of steps and defects in controlling 
surface reaction pathways is by now a well known 
phenomenon. 
Molecules, 
weakly bound to large, 
flat terraces can either desorb back into the gas 
phase or rapidly diffuse across the surface until 
they become trapped at defects. Most molecules 
tend to be more tightly bound at defect sites, and 
can often dissociate 
there. Examples of this have 
been shown for the systems NO/stepped 
Pd(ll1) 
[l], 
NH,/ stepped 
Fe(lOO) 
[2], 
NH,/ stepped 
Pt(lll) 
[3], and CO/stepped 
Ni [4]. In all cases, 
little or no dissociation 
is observed on the “per- 
fect” terrace. 
Methanol 
adsorption, 
desorption, 
and decom- 
position on Pt(ll1) 
has been observed by Sexton 
using high resolution 
electron 
energy loss spec- 
troscopy 
(EELS) 
and temperature 
programmed 
desorption (TPD) [5]. The original purpose of our 
experiments 
was to measure the kinetics of this 
decomposition 
reaction 
using time-resolved 
elec- 
tron energy loss spectroscopy 
(TREELS) 
[6]. We 
will show, however, that at low temperatures 
the 
decomposition 
of methanol 
on Pt(lll), 
to ad- 
sorbed CO and hydrogen, appears to occur prim- 
arily at defect sites. As such, the reaction stops 
when the surface CO concentration 
reaches a few 
percent of a monolayer, independent of the initial 
methanol coverage. If the platinum sample is ex- 
posed to methanol 
at elevated surface tempera- 
tures, however, the CO coverage from the methanol 
decomposition 
reaction 
can approach 
10% of a 
monolayer. 
2. Experimental 
All experiments were carried out using a novel 
high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer 
based on the principle of dispersion compensation 
[7]. This technique 
allows an increase 
in signal 
level of two to three orders of magnitude 
over 
conventional 
EELS spectrometers, 
with compara- 
ble resolution. 
It is possible 
therefore 
to record 
spectra in a fraction of a second, which allows us 
to monitor 
surface 
reactions 
in real time. The 
current spectrometer is an advanced version of the 
one previously described [7]. The Pt(ll1) 
sample 
was dosed using a differentially 
pumped, pulsed 
molecular beam source so that gas-exposures could 
be accurately 
controlled 
and reproduced. 
In ad- 
dition, the methanol beam could be seeded readily 
in helium so that the effects of increased transla-

tional 
energy on the decomposition 
reaction 
could 
be studied. 
The Pt(ll1) 
single crystal (Metal Crystals, 
Ltd., 
99.999% 
pure) 
was 
cleaned 
of 
trace 
carbon, 
calcium, 
and silicon 
impurities 
by repeated 
cycles 
of neon ion bombardment 
(1000 eV, 10 PA/cm’) 
at both 450 and 900 K followed 
by annealing 
in 
vacuum 
at 1250 K. In addition, 
heating 
the sample 
to 1000 K in 1 X lo-’ 
Torr 
of 0, 
aided 
in the 
removal 
of surface carbon. 
Sample cleanliness 
and 
order 
were checked 
using 
Auger 
electron 
spec- 
troscopy 
and low-energy 
electron 
diffraction, 
re- 
spectively. 
The absence 
of Si and Ca could also be 
confirmed 
by EELS, 
since their presence 
is indi- 
cated by an intense 
mode 
around 
120 meV after 
oxygen 
treatment. 
We 
note 
that 
although 
the 
surface 
was accurately 
oriented 
using 
Laue back 
reflection, 
a l/2” 
miscut 
is sufficient 
to leave 
- 1% steps and defects. 
3. Results 
The lower trace of fig. 1 shows a high resolu- 
tion EELS spectrum 
of a multilayer 
of methanol 
physisorbed 
on Pt(ll1) 
at 100 K. The mode 
as- 
signments 
are 
similar 
to those 
of bulk, 
liquid 
methanol 
and 
have 
been 
discussed 
in detail 
by 
Sexton 
[5]: 84 meV (O-H 
bend), 
120 meV (C-O 
stretch), 
175 meV (CH, 
deformation), 
363 meV 
(C-H 
stretch), 
399 meV (O-H 
stretch). 
Sexton 
also recorded 
thermal 
desorption 
spectra 
for this 
system 
and found 
that a methanol 
multilayer 
de- 
sorbs at - 140 K, and the monolayer 
desorbs 
at 
about 
180 K. In addition, 
some of the methanol 
was found 
to decompose 
to CO and hydrogen. 
The middle 
trace 
of fig. 1 shows 
a spectrum 
taken 
after 
warming 
a multilayer 
of methanol 
from 100 to 220 K at 20 K/min, 
and holding 
this 
temperature 
for 5 min. There are now three clearly 
resolved 
modes: 
150 meV (adsorbed 
hydrogen 
[S]), 
259 meV 
(C-O 
stretch), 
and 
364 meV 
(C-H 
stretch) 
and a weak sloping 
baseline 
between 
80 
and 200 meV. The elastic peak intensity 
has also 
increased 
by more than 
a factor 
of twenty. 
The 
frequency 
of the C-O 
stretch indicates 
that resid- 
ual carbon 
monoxide 
is adsorbed 
at atop 
sites, 
though 
our current 
resolution 
is not sufficient

distinguish 
between 
adsorption 
on (111) terraces 
and adsorption 
at steps and/or 
defects [9,10]. The 
sloping 
baseline 
may be due to the adsorption 
of 
trace amounts 
of methanol 
since we have previ- 
ously 
observed 
a similar 
feature 
when 
dosing 
a 
clean 
Pt(ll1) 
surface 
with 
a few percent 
of a 
monolayer 
of methanol. 
Unfortunately, 
we are 
unable 
to determine 
whether 
a stable 
surface 
methoxy 
species 
is produced, 
since 
the 
Pt-0 
K. D. Gibson, L. H. Ddois 
/ Step effects in methanol decomposition on Pt(l1 I) 
61 
stretch for this species is at 46 meV, an energy loss 
obscured by tailing from the elastic peak. Other 
modes which could distinguish methoxy from ad- 
sorbed methanol 
could not be spectroscopically 
resolved. 
Finally, the top trace of fig. 1 shows the spec- 
trum obtained when the crystal is further warmed 
to 300 K for 5 min. The same three clearly re- 
solved vibrational modes are still seen, but there is 
no longer the sloping baseline between 80 and 200 
meV. Further warming of the crystal, to about 350 
K, causes the feature due to adsorbed hydrogen to 
disappear. The C-H stretching mode remains un- 
til the crystal has been heated to much higher 
temperatures, 
however. By observing the growth 
of this latter feature on a clean Pt(ll1) 
crystal 
over time, it is clear that only a small amount of 
its intensity is due to adsorption 
from the back- 
ground. 
The amount of methanol decomposition can be 
estimated from the intensity of the C-O 
stretch, 
since appreciable 
CO desorption does not occur 
until the surface temperature is raised above 300 
K. When the intensity of this peak is compared to 
that of a (& 
X fi)R30 
o CO overlayer, 
which 
contains approximately l/4 of a monolayer of CO 
adsorbed at atop sites [9,11], we conclude that the 
surface coverage is only 1 - 2% of a monolayer. 
The exact 
coverage of CO is unclear since the 
scattering cross-sections 
for CO adsorbed at ter- 
race and defect sites may be different #l. Never- 
theless, the CO coverage is low and indicates that 
only a small amount of the methanol has decom- 
posed. Since the amount of adsorbed hydrogen 
can be no more than 4-8% 
of a monolayer, this 
also explains why the Pt-H stretching vibration is 
so weak. The ability to easily see such small fea- 
tures is one of the advantages of using a disper- 
sion compensation 
EELS 
spectrometer 
[7]. We 
note that these same results are observed indepen- 
dent of whether the surface is dosed with sub- 
monolayer 
or multilayer 
amounts 
of methanol. 
Indeed, even when the initial coverage was only 
*I There 
is some controversy here, Hayden et al. [9] state that 
the oscillator strength of CO adsorbed at step and terrace 
sites differs by a factor of 2.7 while Reutt-Robey 
et al. [lo] 
claim that they are the same.

Temperature 
(K) 
Fig. 2. The results of a desorption experiment, where a multi- 
layer of methanol physisorbed on Pt(ll1) 
at 100 K was heated 
to 300 K at 20 K/min. Shown are the peak intensities for some 
of the spectral features, obtained from fits of spectra taken 
while the surface was being heated. The plotted points are for 
the elastic peak (o), 
the C-O stretch (259 meV (a)), the C-H 
stretch (363 meV (A)), and the O-H stretch (399 meV (A)). 
The 
absolute intensity 
of the elastic feature has been arbitrarily 
scaled down. 
5% of a monolayer, l-2% 
of a monolayer of CO 
was still produced. 
Fig. 2 shows the time/ temperature evolution of 
some of the vibrational 
modes when a multilayer 
of methanol was heated from 100 to 300 K at 20 
K/min. 
Spectra were taken in real time as the 
crystal was heated, and the results shown are the 
peak intensities 
obtained from a least-squares 
fit 
of the data to a series of Gaussians. 
Using the 
C-H and O-H 
stretching modes as a measure of 
coverage, 
substantially 
all of the methanol 
has 
desorbed by the time the temperature has reached 
220 K. The C-O 
stretching 
intensity 
does not 
increase until about 250 K. This is also the tem- 
perature 
at which the elastic 
peak intensity 
is 
increasing dramatically, 
however. Since the inten- 
sity of a loss peak is, in general, related to the 
intensity of the elastic peak [12], the C-O stretch- 
ing intensity may not be a precise measure of the 
changing CO coverage as the temperature 
is in- 
creased from below to above 250 K. The same 
results are seen for different heating rates of from 
1 to 20 K/min. 
In all cases, however, the final 
coverage of CO is l-2% 
of a monolayer. 
In an attempt to increase the surface CO con- 
centration 
from the decomposition 
of adsorbed 
methanol, 
we performed 
isothermal 
adsorption 
measurements. 
These experiments

3. The results 
of spectra 
taken 
while the Pt(ll1)

the pulsed 
molecular 
beam, 
where methanol 
with 
100 
Torr 
stagnation 
pressure 
was 
expanded 
through 
a 1 mm nozzle at 300 K. The calculated 
translational 
temperature 
of this beam 
was 
- 90 
meV. The vibrational 
spectrum 
was recorded 
after 
each gas pulse. For surface 
temperatures 
between 
190 and 
210 K, the elastic 
peak 
intensity 
de- 
creased 
after the first pulse. Even after many 
gas 
pulses (enough 
to deposit 
a multilayer 
of methanol 
at 100 K) only a small fraction 
of a monolayer 
of 
methanol 
was observed 
(as indicated 
by the weak 
C-H 
stretching 
mode 
at 363 meV). This 
agrees 
with 
the thermal 
desorption 
data 
of Sexton 
[5], 
which shows that most of a monolayer 
of methanol 
desorbs 
by 180 K. Within 
our counting 
statistics, 
there is no CO formed 
at these temperatures, 
but 
upon subsequent 
warming 
of this sample to above 
220 K, l-2% 
of a monolayer 
of CO is observed. 
For surface 
temperatures 
between 
210 and 240 
K, the elastic 
peak intensity 
still decreases 
after 
the first dose (see fig. 3, bottom 
panel). 
A small 
amount 
of methanol 
also 
accumulated 
on 
the 
surface. As indicated 
by the 259 meV C-O 
stretch, 
however, 
carbon 
monoxide 
is definitely 
forming 
on the surface, 
adsorbed 
at atop sites. The inten- 
sity of this mode 
is slowly 
increasing, 
but 
even 
after exposures 
that would produce 
a multilayer 
of 
methanol 
at 100 K, there is only a few percent 
of a 
monolayer 
of CO formed. 
Finally, 
for a surface 
temperature 
of 300 K, there is considerable 
CO 
produced, 
asymptotically 
approaching 
10% of a 
monolayer. 
This is shown 
in the upper 
panel 
of 
fig. 3. 
To test whether 
there 
might 
be a barrier 
to 
dissociation 
which could 
be surmounted 
with in- 
creased 
translational 
energy 
of 
the 
impinging 
methanol 
molecules, 
we also repeated 
these 
ex- 
periments 
with a helium 
seeded 
methanol 
beam 
(100 Torr 
of methanol 
in 600 Torr 
of He). The 
translational 
temperature 
of the 
methanol 
was 
calculated 
to be 270 meV. For surface 
tempera- 
tures 
between 
210 and 
300 K, the results 
were 
essentially 
the same 
as for the unseeded 
beam, 
including 
the rate at which CO was formed. 
Thus 
a modest 
(factor 
of 3) increase 
in translation 
en- 
ergy is not sufficient 
to increase 
the efficiency 
of 
methanol 
decomposition. 
Finally, 
in order to explicitly 
test for the effects 
of defects, we sputtered 
the surface 
with 1000 eV 
neon 
ions (10 PA/cm’) 
for 5 min 
at 200 K. A 
decrease in the elastic scattering 
intensity 
from the 
annealed 
surface 
indicated 
that defects 
had been 
induced 
on the surface. 
The measured 
intensity 
of 
the C-O 
stretching 
vibration 
was 
- l/2 
that ob- 
served above. 
Since the elastic peak intensity 
was 
a factor of - 4 lower due to the poor reflectivity 
of the surface, 
the actual 
surface 
concentration 
of 
carbon 
monoxide 
must 
have 
increased 
by 
- 2. 
This value is only approximate, 
however, 
since the 
dispersion 
compensation 
EELS system is far more 
sensitive 
to surface 
disorder 
and surface 
reflectiv- 
ity changes 
than 
conventional 
EELS 
spectrome- 
ters [7]. 
4. Discussion 
The 
principal 
conclusion 
from 
these 
experi- 
ments 
is that the low temperature 
decomposition 
of methanol 
on Pt(ll1) 
is controlled 
by steps and 
K. D. Gibson, L. H. Dubois / Step effects in methanol decomposition on Pt(1 I I) 
63 
defects. 
Only 
a small 
amount 
decomposes, 
and 
that amount 
is independent 
of the initial 
surface 
coverage. 
This result is shown by the temperature 
programmed 
desorption 
of both 
monolayers 
and 
multilayers 
of methanol 
as well as the isothermal 
adsorption/ 
decomposition 
measurements. 
The 
surface 
sputtered 
at 200 K, which 
was not an- 
nealed, 
should 
have a larger concentration 
of de- 
fects than the annealed 
surface 
used for the other 
experiments. 
This surface 
shows an increase 
in the 
amount 
of CO produced, 
relative 
to the annealed 
surface, 
which is consistent 
with the idea that low 
temperature 
methanol 
decomposition 
is dominated 
by defects. 
Although 
we do not observe 
a large 
increase 
in methanol 
decomposition, 
this might be 
due to the nature 
of the defects 
that sputtering 
introduces. 
The principle 
defects 
on an annealed 
surface 
are probably 
steps in between 
(111) ter- 
races. 
Sputtering 
defects 
are most 
likely 
point 
defects, 
where 
there 
are holes with a few atoms 
missing, 
or places where a few extra atoms set on 
the surface. 
Sexton 
found 
that multilayer 
methanol 
desorbs 
at - 140 K, and the monolayer 
desorbs 
at about 
180 
K. 
Though 
it is not 
clear 
that 
we have 
methanol 
on the surface 
at much higher tempera- 
tures, 
the specular 
intensity 
does 
not 
reach 
its 
clean surface value until the surface temperature 
is 
approximately 
250 K. For the results 
of the ex- 
periment 
shown 
in the center 
panel 
of fig. 1, the 
specular 
intensity 
was increasing 
throughout 
the 
time that the temperature 
was held at 220 K. We 
have observed 
that even 
a small 
amount 
of ad- 
sorbed 
methanol 
causes a large attenuation 
of the 
elastic peak intensity 
(see fig. 3). Neither 
adsorbed 
hydrogen 
or CO show 
the same 
effect. 
This 
is 
suggestive 
of trace amounts 
of adsorbed 
methanol. 
If this is due to methanol 
on the surface, 
the fact 
that it desorbs 
at a temperature 
much higher than 
180 K is indicative 
of a different 
adsorption 
site, 
most likely a defect site [9,10]. 
We next consider 
the results 
of the isothermal 
adsorption 
experiments. 
Our seeding 
experiments 
demonstrate 
that 
there 
is no 
easily 
accessible 
activation 
barrier 
to 
the 
decomposition 
of 
methanol 
on 
(111) 
terraces. 
The 
next 
question 
then, is why can a large surface 
concentration 
of 
CO 
be 
built-up 
if 
the 
surface 
is dosed 
with 
methanol 
at 300 K? In addition, 
for surface 
tem- 
peratures 
between 
210 and 240 K, we see a much 
slower rate of CO production. 
These results might 
be explained 
by the rate at which 
methanol 
de- 
composes 
at the defects, and the rate at which the 
decomposition 
products 
diffuse away, thus freeing 
up sites for more methanol 
decomposition. 
Reutt- 
Robey 
et al. have already 
shown 
that while 
CO 
diffusion 
away 
from 
steps 
is a relatively 
slow 
process below 
- 240 K, it is facile at temperatures 
above 300 K, increasing 
more than three orders of 
magnitude 
[lo]. In order 
to quantify 
our results 
further, 
new 
experiments 
would 
have 
to be re- 
peated 
on a stepped 
platinum 
crystal 
where 
the 
type and concentration 
of the principal 
defects are 
known 
[lo]. 
5. Conclusion 
The experimental 
observations 
discussed 
in this 
paper 
strongly 
suggest 
that steps and/or 
defects 
control 
the low temperature 
thermal 
decomposi- 
tion of methanol 
on Pt(ll1) 
to adsorbed 
CO and 
hydrogen. 
As explained 
in the Introduction, 
this is 
not a unique 
phenomenon 
as there is evidence 
that 
steps are responsible 
for adsorbate 
decomposition 
in other systems. 
We believe 
that as more detailed 
studies 
of surface 
reaction 
mechanisms 
progress, 
steps and defects will play an ever increasing 
role 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
fundamental 
surface 
processes.
