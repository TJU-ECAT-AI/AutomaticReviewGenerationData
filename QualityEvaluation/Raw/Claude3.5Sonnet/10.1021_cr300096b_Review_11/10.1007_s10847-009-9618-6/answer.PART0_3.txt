[1] "Conversion of biomass to fuels has been a subject of research for many years because of its environmental benefits and renewability. Aqueous phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons, like alcohols and polyols, to produce hydrogen, has been especially of great interest [16]."

[2] "Hydrogen was produced by Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) of 10% (w/w) sorbitol using mono- and bi-metallic catalysts of Ni and Pt supported on alumina nano-fibre (Alnf), mesoporous ZrO2 and mixed oxides of ceriazirconiasilica (CZxS) with varying concentration of silica (where x is silica concentration)."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming, specifically aqueous phase reforming (APR) of biomass-derived compounds, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting renewable biomass resources into hydrogen fuel. Its key advantages include:

1. Environmental benefits: It utilizes renewable biomass feedstocks, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and potentially lowering carbon emissions.

2. Renewability: The process can use various biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons like alcohols and polyols, providing a sustainable source of hydrogen.

3. Versatility: APR can be applied to different feedstocks such as sorbitol, allowing flexibility in raw material selection.

4. Efficient hydrogen production: The process can produce hydrogen from aqueous solutions of oxygenates, which is beneficial for energy applications.

5. Catalytic improvements: The use of bimetallic catalysts (e.g., NiPt) can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on product yield, direct environmental impact comparisons, or practical implementation details compared to traditional methods. More research would be needed to fully assess these aspects of selective oxygenate reforming against conventional hydrogen production techniques.

选择性含氧化合物重整过程，特别是生物质衍生化合物的水相重整（APR），通过将可再生生物质资源转化为氢燃料，为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献。其主要优势包括：

1. 环境效益：利用可再生生物质原料，减少对化石燃料的依赖，潜在降低碳排放。

2. 可再生性：该过程可以利用各种生物质衍生的含氧碳氢化合物，如醇类和多元醇，提供可持续的氢源。

3. 多功能性：APR可应用于不同的原料，如山梨醇，允许原料选择的灵活性。

4. 高效氢气生产：该过程可以从含氧化合物的水溶液中生产氢气，这对能源应用有利。

5. 催化剂改进：使用双金属催化剂（如NiPt）可以提高过程的效率和选择性。

然而，文献并未提供关于产品产率、直接环境影响比较或与传统方法相比的实际实施细节的具体信息。需要进行更多研究来全面评估选择性含氧化合物重整与传统制氢技术相比的这些方面。
