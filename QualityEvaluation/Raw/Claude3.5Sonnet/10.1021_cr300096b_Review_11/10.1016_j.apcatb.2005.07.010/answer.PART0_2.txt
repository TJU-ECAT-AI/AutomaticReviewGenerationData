Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically aqueous-phase reforming (APR), contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived molecules, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol.

2. The process is carbon-neutral, as the CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth, excluding CO2 from fossil fuels used in biomass production and transportation.

3. APR combines C-C bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction in a single reactor, producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), unlike conventional steam reforming which requires multiple reactors.

4. It occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock, thus improving overall thermal efficiency.

These advantages make APR more environmentally friendly and potentially more efficient than traditional methods. The process yields hydrogen with low CO content, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Its practical implementation is simplified by using a single reactor and liquid-phase operation, potentially reducing capital costs and energy requirements compared to conventional reforming processes.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是水相重整（APR），通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它从可再生生物质衍生分子（如乙二醇、甘油和山梨醇）中生产氢气。

2. 这个过程是碳中和的，因为在重整过程中形成的二氧化碳被进一步的生物质生长所消耗，不包括在生物质生产和运输到生物炼制厂过程中使用化石燃料产生的二氧化碳。

3. APR在单个反应器中结合了C-C键断裂和水煤气变换反应，产生低水平的CO（<1000 ppm），而传统的蒸汽重整需要多个反应器。

4. 它发生在液相中，无需将水溶液原料气化，从而提高了整体热效率。

这些优势使APR比传统方法更环保，可能更高效。该过程产生的氢气含有低水平的CO，这对燃料电池应用有利。其实际实施通过使用单个反应器和液相操作得到简化，与传统重整工艺相比，可能降低资本成本和能源需求。
