[1] "We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol)"

[2] "No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth."

[3] "The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production"

[4] "The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically aqueous-phase reforming (APR), contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived oxygenated molecules, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol.

2. The process is carbon-neutral, as the CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth, excluding emissions from biomass production and transportation.

3. It combines C-C bond cleavage and water-gas shift reactions in a single reactor, producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), unlike conventional steam reforming which requires multiple reactors.

4. The process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving overall thermal efficiency.

These advantages make APR a more environmentally friendly and efficient method for hydrogen production compared to traditional reforming processes. It offers improved product yield through efficient conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks, reduces environmental impact by operating in a nearly carbon-neutral cycle, and provides practical implementation benefits through simplified reactor design and improved thermal efficiency.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是水相重整（APR），通过以下方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它从可再生生物质衍生的含氧分子（如乙二醇、甘油和山梨醇）中产生氢气。

2. 这个过程是碳中和的，因为在重整过程中形成的二氧化碳会被进一步的生物质生长所消耗，不包括生物质生产和运输到生物炼制厂过程中产生的二氧化碳排放。

3. 它在单一反应器中结合了C-C键断裂和水煤气变换反应，产生低水平的一氧化碳（<1000 ppm），不像传统的蒸汽重整需要多个反应器。

4. 该过程发生在液相中，消除了气化水溶性原料的需求，提高了整体热效率。

这些优势使APR成为比传统重整过程更环保、更高效的制氢方法。它通过高效转化生物质衍生原料提供了改进的产品收率，通过在近乎碳中和的循环中运行减少了环境影响，并通过简化的反应器设计和改进的热效率提供了实际实施的好处。

Selective oxygenate reforming through the aqueous-phase reforming (APR) process contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived molecules, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process is carbon-neutral, as the CO2 produced during reforming is offset by CO2 consumption during biomass growth.

3. APR combines C-C bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction in a single reactor, producing low levels of CO. This simplifies the process compared to conventional steam reforming, which requires multiple reactors.

4. The liquid-phase reaction eliminates the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock, improving overall thermal efficiency.

These advantages make APR more environmentally friendly and potentially more cost-effective than traditional hydrogen production methods. The process yields hydrogen with low CO content, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, its ability to use renewable feedstocks and operate in the liquid phase offers practical implementation benefits in terms of feedstock flexibility and energy efficiency.
