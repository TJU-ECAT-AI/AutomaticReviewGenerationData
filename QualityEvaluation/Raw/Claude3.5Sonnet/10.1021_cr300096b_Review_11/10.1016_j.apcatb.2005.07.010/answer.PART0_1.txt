[1] "We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol)"

[2] "No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth."

[3] "The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production"

[4] "The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process."

Selective oxygenate reforming through the aqueous-phase reforming (APR) process contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived molecules, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process is carbon-neutral, as the CO2 produced during reforming is offset by CO2 consumption during biomass growth.

3. APR combines C-C bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction in a single reactor, producing low levels of CO. This simplifies the process compared to conventional steam reforming, which requires multiple reactors.

4. The liquid-phase reaction eliminates the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock, improving overall thermal efficiency.

These advantages make APR more environmentally friendly and potentially more cost-effective than traditional hydrogen production methods. The process yields hydrogen with low CO content, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, its ability to use renewable feedstocks and operate in the liquid phase offers practical implementation benefits in terms of feedstock flexibility and energy efficiency.

选择性含氧化合物重整通过水相重整（APR）过程为可持续能源和化学品生产做出了以下贡献：

1. 它从可再生生物质衍生分子中生产氢气，为基于化石燃料的氢气生产提供了可持续的替代方案。

2. 该过程是碳中和的，因为重整过程中产生的二氧化碳被生物质生长过程中消耗的二氧化碳所抵消。

3. APR在单个反应器中结合了C-C键裂解和水气变换反应，产生低水平的一氧化碳。这简化了传统蒸汽重整需要多个反应器的过程。

4. 液相反应消除了水溶性原料汽化的需求，提高了整体热效率。

这些优势使APR比传统的氢气生产方法更加环保，潜在的成本效益也更高。该过程产生的氢气含有低浓度的一氧化碳，这对燃料电池应用有利。此外，它能够使用可再生原料并在液相中操作，在原料灵活性和能源效率方面提供了实际实施的益处。
