[1] "We have recently developed a process to produce H2 by aqueous-phase-reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol)"

[2] "No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery), because CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth."

[3] "The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production"

[4] "The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the process."

Selective oxygenate reforming, specifically aqueous-phase reforming (APR), contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways:

1. It produces hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived molecules, offering a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production.

2. The process is carbon-neutral, as the CO2 produced during reforming is consumed by biomass regrowth, excluding emissions from biomass production and transportation.

3. APR combines C-C bond cleavage and water-gas shift in a single reactor, producing low levels of CO. This is more efficient than conventional steam reforming, which requires multiple reactors.

4. The process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need to vaporize the aqueous feedstock. This improves overall thermal efficiency compared to traditional methods.

These advantages result in better product yield, reduced environmental impact, and more practical implementation compared to traditional reforming methods. The APR process is more energy-efficient and produces cleaner hydrogen with fewer byproducts, making it a promising technology for sustainable energy and chemical production.

选择性含氧化合物重整，特别是水相重整(APR)，通过以下几种方式为可持续能源和化学品生产做出贡献：

1. 它从可再生的生物质衍生分子中生产氢气，为基于化石燃料的氢气生产提供了更可持续的替代方案。

2. 这个过程是碳中和的，因为在重整过程中产生的CO2会被生物质再生过程所消耗，不包括生物质生产和运输到生物炼制厂过程中产生的排放。

3. APR在单一反应器中结合了C-C键断裂和水煤气变换反应，产生低水平的CO。这比传统的蒸汽重整更有效率，后者需要多个反应器。

4. 该过程发生在液相中，消除了将水相原料汽化的需求。与传统方法相比，这提高了整体热效率。

这些优势导致了更好的产品产率、更低的环境影响，以及与传统重整方法相比更实用的实施。APR过程更加节能，生产的氢气更清洁，副产品更少，使其成为可持续能源和化学品生产的一项有前景的技术。
