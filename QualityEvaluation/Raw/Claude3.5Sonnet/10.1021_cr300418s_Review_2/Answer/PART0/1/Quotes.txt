[1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "The starting materials are La2O3 with purity of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%, respectively. The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h."

[3] "After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient. The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at 1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol% hydrogen."

[4] "Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer."

[5] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

[6] "The lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A, which is in agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes increase."

[7] "Though tantalum doping can introduce more carriers, it also introduces scattering centers, especially at high doping level. With the increase of tantalum content, this strong scattering may become dominating factor for electron conduction, resulting in increase of electrical resistivity."

"In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample. In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample)."

"The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

"The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

"It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample."

"The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

"The most active catalyst was obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which led to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area was produced."

"It was found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite."

"Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction."

[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."

[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."

[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed."

[4] "XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

[5] "The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature. The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."
