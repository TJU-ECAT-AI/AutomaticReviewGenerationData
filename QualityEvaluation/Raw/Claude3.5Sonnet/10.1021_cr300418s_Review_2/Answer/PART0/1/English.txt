The literature primarily describes the solid-state synthesis method for preparing Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 ceramics, but does not provide information on the impregnation method or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation. Therefore, a direct comparison between the two methods cannot be made based on this document alone.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and performance in the solid-state synthesis include:

1. Dopant loading: The study examines different tantalum doping levels (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3. The tantalum content affects lattice constants, electrical resistivity, and thermoelectric properties.

2. Calcination temperature: The materials are calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours, then sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours. These high temperatures likely influence grain size and phase formation.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials:

1. XRD patterns show that tantalum is successfully doped into the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 lattice, forming a single-phase compound.
2. All samples exhibit a cubic perovskite structure.
3. Peak shifts in XRD patterns indicate lattice expansion with increasing tantalum content.
4. Lattice constants and volumes are calculated from XRD data, showing an increase with tantalum doping.

While the study doesn't discuss catalytic performance directly, it mentions that tantalum doping introduces more carriers but also scattering centers, especially at high doping levels. This affects electrical resistivity and could potentially influence catalytic properties.

Although the document doesn't provide information on copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, the principles of using XRD to confirm doping and characterize materials would be similar for other doped oxide systems.

The literature primarily compares precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts, rather than solid-state synthesis. However, some key comparisons can be drawn:

1. Preparation methods: 
   - Precipitation involves mixing iron and chromium nitrate solutions before adding ammonium hydroxide.
   - Impregnation involves first producing an iron oxide gel and then impregnating it with chromium nitrate solution.

2. Dopant loading:
   - Impregnation typically allows for higher and more precise dopant loading.
   - The impregnation method led to higher chromium content both on the surface and in the bulk compared to precipitation.

3. Structural characteristics:
   - Both methods produced magnetite as the main phase.
   - Chromium-doped samples showed higher specific surface areas than pure magnetite, with the impregnated sample having the highest.
   - The preparation method significantly affects the textural properties of the doped materials.

4. Calcination temperature:
   - Both methods involved heating to 773 K under nitrogen flow to form the active magnetite phase.
   - Calcination conditions can affect crystallinity, surface area, and dopant distribution in oxide materials.

5. Catalytic performance:
   - The impregnated sample showed higher overall catalytic activity than the precipitated sample in the water gas shift reaction.
   - Chromium doping increased specific surface area but decreased activity per unit area by making Fe2+ production more difficult.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials:
   - XRD showed only magnetite peaks for all samples, indicating chromium incorporation did not form separate phases.
   - This technique can detect new phases, lattice changes, or peak broadening due to doping in oxide systems.

While the study doesn't provide specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar for these systems, focusing on phase identification, lattice parameter changes, and potential effects on crystallite size.

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method are two distinct approaches for preparing doped oxide materials:

1. Solid-state synthesis:
   - Involves mechanically mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant
   - Heated to high temperatures in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion
   - Suitable for thermodynamically stable doped oxides
   - Typically requires higher temperatures and longer processing times

2. Impregnation method:
   - Exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor
   - Dried and heated in air
   - Aims to achieve surface doping
   - Generally uses lower temperatures and shorter processing times

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and catalytic performance:

1. Dopant loading:
   - Critical for both methods
   - Example: In copper-doped ceria, loadings below 3% resulted in successful doping without separate phases
   - Higher loadings led to phase separation

2. Calcination temperature:
   - Affects dopant diffusion and phase formation
   - Higher temperatures can promote better dopant diffusion in solid-state synthesis
   - Can lead to increased phase separation in impregnation methods

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is crucial for confirming successful doping and characterizing materials:

1. Detects changes in crystal structure indicative of doping
2. Can reveal the absence of separate crystalline phases at low dopant concentrations
3. Lattice constant shifts indicate successful incorporation of dopant ions

Examples:
- Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3: XRD showed a single-phase structure with lattice constant shift
- Copper-doped ceria: XRD and Rietveld analysis revealed successful doping at low concentrations

Catalytic performance:
- Doped materials often show improved catalytic activity
- Example: Copper-doped ceria catalysts exhibited higher activity for CO oxidation compared to undoped oxide

In conclusion, both methods can produce doped oxides, but their success depends on factors such as dopant loading, calcination temperature, and the specific host-dopant combination. XRD analysis is essential for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials.
