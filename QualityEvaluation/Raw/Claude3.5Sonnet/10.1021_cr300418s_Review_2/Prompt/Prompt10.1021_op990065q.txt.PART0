Turbulent Mixing and Chemical Reactions.
By Jerzy
Baldyga and John R. Bourne. John Wiley and Sons Ltd.:
Chichester, UK. 1999. 864 pp. 195. ISBN 0-471-98171-0.
This book focuses on the important problem of under-
standing how the selectivity of fast competing reactions in
low-viscosity liquids can be predicted when the reactions
occur on the time scale of liquid mixing transients. It is by
no means uncommon in chemical process development to
obtain unexpected selectivities in reaction vessels or even
laboratory flasks, and for the source of the problem to be
traced to the way in which the reagents are mixed together
or to the configuration of the reactor.
Chapters 1-3 give a good general introduction to the
subject, although in places in a rather academic style, and
provide a comprehensive review of published chemical
examples where the problem has been recognised. In Chapter
2, there is a very good description of the effect of bulk flow
patterns on selectivity and of the influence which the choice
of reactor type has on the performance of common chemical
kinetic schemes. There are some very good learning points
or reminders for chemists and engineers involved in process
development.
Chapters 4-6 deal with turbulence, turbulence modelling,
and the application of turbulence theory to mixing and
concentration transients, in 380 pages. Chapter 4 presents a
useful review of the background and precise definitions prior
to the detailed discussion of turbulence theory and turbulence
models in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 the application of the
theory to the mixing of nonreacting materials is reviewed.
Unfortunately, this part of the book is written in terms which
will be almost incomprehensible to most organic chemists.
Moreover, much of it will be very difficult for most normal
chemical engineering graduates without in-depth prior knowl-
edge of the subject.
It is unfortunate that many symbols remain undefined, and
in some cases even the nomenclature is presented in terms
which require a considerable degree of specialism in the area
in order to be understood.
In Chapter 7 the techniques are described for combining
the models of turbulent mixing with reaction rate equations,
and the simplifying relationships, or closure models
required to enable the calculations to be undertaken within
reasonable computing time and power. A number of worked
examples are used to illustrate the techniques. Chapter 8
provides concise definitions of the commonly used terms,
micro-, meso-, and macro-mixing. The assumptions and
derivations leading to simplified models for the prediction
of reaction selectivity in micro- and meso- mixing regimes
are described and, again, illustrated by application to worked
examples. These two chapters comprise 210 pages but are
not really accessible by anyone without considerable prior
knowledge of the area.
Chapter 9 briefly reviews the planning of experiments and
the criteria for reactions to test the theories, and then in
Chapter 10 a number of test reactions are described. These
are mainly diazo couplings but are useful models for a range
of chemical systems. Looking through these and the worked
examples should give any development chemist food for
thought.
Chapters 11 and 12 deal with the comparison of the
theories with experimental results, in 11 for the micro-mixing
regime and in 12 for the meso-mixing regime. For the micro-
mixing controlled reactions, worked examples show that the
simplified engulfment model can be used, although there still
seems to be a particular difficulty in knowing a priori what
value of the key determining parameter, the local turbulent
energy dissipation rate, should be used. For the meso-mixing
systems, the experimental evidence for the importance of
understanding the basic principles is clearly demonstrated,
and again the analysis is demonstrated by a number of
worked examples. Although most organic chemists will find
even these chapters difficult, working through them will
provide useful insights and pointers to problems common
in process development.
Chapter 12 lists the characteristics of commonly used
mixing equipment, and then Chapters 13, 14, and 15 apply
some of the concepts from the earlier chapters to precipita-
tion, droplet generation, and floc break-up. These are
interesting chapters which add to the already large volume
of literature on these topics, although most organic chemists
would not have the background to appreciate much of the
content.
Scattered throughout the book, and particularly in Chapters
1-4 and 11 and 12, are numerous pointers to how to
recognise and deal with problems caused by reactant
segregation during mixing and reaction. It is a pity that these
ideas are not anywhere brought together in concise form.
This would have greatly enhanced the value of the book to
the organic process development chemist.

Catalysts, a 5 billion per year business worldwide, play
a vital role in the economy. It is often quoted that 90% of
all chemicals involve at least one catalytic step in their
manufacture. Hence, a book about catalyst manufacture is
of interest to all chemists.
This is a revised and expanded second edition of the book
Catalyst Manufacture which was first published in 1985 in
the extensive Marcel Dekker series of Chemical Industries
books. It is divided into two main sections, one describing
typical catalyst manufacturing equipment (laboratory, pilot
plant, and commercial plant scale) and the other describing
preparation methods for a wide range of catalysts for 18
families of catalytic reactions. The catalyst range includes
base metals, precious metals, and zeolites.
This excellent book is written in an informative, easy-to-
read style with a good index. Unfortunately, the extensive
list of references are not specifically referred to in the text.
The book is likely to be of particular interest to academics
as a starting point for a catalyst preparation for a specific
application to allow them to develop an improvement.
Those involved in the commercial manufacture of catalysts
will recognise the generality of the preparation methods. The
book, however, emphasises the requirement for reproduc-
iblecatalysts and highlights the need to avoid cross-
contamination and the efficient extraction of detrimental ions
during manufacture.
For each catalyst type, details are provided for possible
regeneration procedures (if available) to allow catalyst reuse.
Details are also provided for the responsible disposal of spent
catalyst. The appendix lists numerous companies who can
recover metals values from spent catalysts, but not surpris-
ingly, this listing is very biased to North American refiners.
It is very much a practical book. There are 12 chapters in
the section on manufacturing plant which describe the
possible types of equipment for each unit operation, for
example, filtration, drying, calcining, etc. In general this is
very good, but I would have liked details of some of the
latest advances in drying technology such as fluid-bed drying
and vacuum-pan drying.
This second edition specifically addresses the changes that
have been made in zeolites, reviews the application of
enantioselective catalysts in the pharmaceutical and agro-
chemical industries, and updates automotive exhaust cata-
lysts. I would recommend this book to all those involved in
the R&D manufacture and use of catalysts.

Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to
Functional Group Preparations, 2nd edition. By Richard
Larock. Wiley - Vat: New York. 1999. 1581 pp. 96.99.
ISBN 0-4711-9031-4.
We must admire Richard Larocks courage in undertaking
this monumental task, was H. C. Browns comment on the
publication of the first edition of this work. The new edition
is over twice the size of the first edition and comes only 10
years after. The work has always been one of the first
volumes industrial and academics turn to for inspiration. The
new edition is timelysthere have been so many important
synthetic transformations in the 1989-1998 period that the
compendium is needed to summarise the literature. His
problem always is what to leave out, where to draw the line.
One of the limitations of the new volumesas the author
points out in the forwardsis that the number of journals
covered in the 1989-1996 period has been restricted because
of the mammoth task required. Thus, key review articles in
Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Chemical Re-
Views, etc. may not have been abstracted. The journal cov-
erage is mainly to 1996. With this minor quibble in mind,
the term comprehensive in the title is slightly misleading.
Nevertheless, the volume is a great place to browse for
synthetic methodology and is a tremendous value for the
money. It should be on every organic chemists bookshelf!

Grignard Reagents - New Developments. Edited by H.
G. Richey, Jr. Wiley: Chichester, UK. 2000. 418 pp. 145.
ISBN 0-471-99908-3.
The appearance of this multiauthor volume has been timed
to coincide with the centenary of the appearance of Victor
Grignards paper in 1900 on the formation of organomag-
nesium compounds. Whilst many of the chapters are of
theoretical interest on the mechanism of Grignard formation
and reactions and the structure of the organometallic species,
one chapter alone will appeal directly to the process chemist
and engineer, Grignard Reagents - Industrial Applications
and Strategy is a superb review by F. R. Busch and D. M.
de Antonis of the practices used at Pfizer to safely scale-up
Grignard reactions. It includes such topics as reactor con-
figuration, choice of solvent, process hazards, heating and
cooling fluids, reaction initiation as well as some industrial
examples. The book is worth reading for this chapter alone.
The chapter includes industrial examples including the manu-
facture of tamoxifen, droloxifene, veltol, naproxen, and pro-
poxyphene. Of course, the book will be compared to Hand-
book of Grignard Reagents (Marcel Dekker, 1996) but there
is little overlap. Buy both for your library!
