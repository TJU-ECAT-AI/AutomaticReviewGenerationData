<questions>

Compare and contrast the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, discussing how key factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, explain how techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials, using specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation.

The given literature does not contain specific information to compare and contrast solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials. It also does not discuss factors like dopant loading and calcination temperature or provide details on using XRD to confirm doping in materials like Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria catalysts. The text focuses more broadly on general approaches to catalyst preparation, with an emphasis on controlling reactivity and preventing segregation in mixed oxide catalysts. It does not contain the specific examples or technical details requested in the question.
