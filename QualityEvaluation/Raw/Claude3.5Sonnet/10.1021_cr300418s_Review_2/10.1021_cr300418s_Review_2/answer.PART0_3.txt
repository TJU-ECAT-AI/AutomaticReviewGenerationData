[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."

[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."

[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed."

[4] "XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

[5] "The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature. The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."

Solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods are two distinct approaches for preparing doped oxide materials, each with its own characteristics and outcomes.

Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, followed by high-temperature heating in oxygen to facilitate dopant diffusion. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. In contrast, the impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, followed by drying and heating in air, aiming to achieve surface doping.

Dopant loading significantly influences the structural characteristics of the resulting materials. For example, in copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation, Cu loadings below 3% by weight resulted in no observable crystalline copper oxide phases in XRD. However, above 3% Cu loading, phase separation occurred. This demonstrates that there is a critical dopant concentration beyond which the host oxide structure cannot accommodate additional dopant atoms.

Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the final structure and performance of doped oxides. In the case of copper-doped ceria, increasing the calcination temperature led to an increase in the amount of copper oxide phase. This suggests that higher temperatures can promote phase separation and the formation of distinct oxide phases.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. In the case of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, XRD measurements detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping for various compositions (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05). Similarly, for copper-doped ceria catalysts, Rietveld analysis of XRD data revealed a ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, indicating that some Cu ions had substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice.

Regarding catalytic performance, the copper-doped ceria prepared by impregnation showed higher activity for CO oxidation compared to the undoped oxide. This demonstrates that successful doping can enhance the catalytic properties of the host oxide.

In conclusion, both solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods can be used to prepare doped oxide materials, but their outcomes depend on factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. XRD analysis is crucial for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials, as demonstrated in the cases of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts.

固态合成法和浸渍法是制备掺杂氧化物材料的两种不同方法，各有其特点和结果。

固态合成法涉及机械混合主体氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物，然后在氧气中高温加热以促进掺杂剂的扩散。这种方法适用于掺杂氧化物在热力学上稳定的情况。相比之下，浸渍法将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前驱体的液体中，然后干燥并在空气中加热，目的是实现表面掺杂。

掺杂剂的含量显著影响所得材料的结构特性。例如，在通过浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂中，当铜含量低于3%（重量比）时，XRD中没有观察到结晶氧化铜相。然而，当铜含量超过3%时，出现了相分离。这表明存在一个临界掺杂浓度，超过这个浓度，主体氧化物结构就无法容纳更多的掺杂原子。

煅烧温度也在决定掺杂氧化物的最终结构和性能方面起着关键作用。在铜掺杂氧化铈的情况下，提高煅烧温度导致氧化铜相的数量增加。这表明较高的温度可以促进相分离和形成不同的氧化物相。

X射线衍射（XRD）是确认成功掺杂和表征所得材料的有效技术。对于Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，XRD测量检测到单相钛酸锶结构，其晶格常数的变化与置换掺杂一致，这适用于各种组成（x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05）。同样，对于铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂，XRD数据的Rietveld分析显示氧化铈结构的晶格常数略有变化，表明一些Cu离子取代了CeO2晶格中的Ce离子。

关于催化性能，通过浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈在CO氧化方面表现出比未掺杂氧化物更高的活性。这表明成功的掺杂可以增强主体氧化物的催化性能。

总之，固态合成法和浸渍法都可用于制备掺杂氧化物材料，但其结果取决于掺杂剂含量和煅烧温度等因素。XRD分析对于确认成功掺杂和表征所得材料至关重要，这在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的案例中得到了证明。
