[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."

[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."

[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed."

[4] "XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

[5] "The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials differ in their approach and outcomes:

Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, followed by high-temperature heating in oxygen. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable and aims to achieve bulk doping through diffusion.

Impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, followed by drying and heating in air. This method targets surface doping rather than bulk doping.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and catalytic performance:

1. Dopant loading: In the case of copper-doped ceria, loadings below 3% by weight resulted in successful doping without separate copper oxide phases. Above 3%, phase separation occurred.

2. Calcination temperature: Higher temperatures can lead to increased phase separation and affect the distribution of the dopant.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is crucial for confirming successful doping and characterizing materials:

1. For Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, XRD detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift, indicating substitutional doping.

2. In copper-doped ceria catalysts, XRD showed no crystalline copper oxide phases at low loadings, while Rietveld analysis revealed a small lattice constant shift, suggesting Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice.

These characterization techniques help determine the success of doping and its impact on the material's structure. Successfully doped materials often exhibit improved catalytic performance, as seen in the case of copper-doped ceria catalysts, which showed higher activity for CO oxidation compared to undoped oxide.

固态合成法和浸渍法制备掺杂氧化物材料的方法在方法和结果上存在差异：

固态合成法涉及机械混合主体氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物，然后在氧气中高温加热。这种方法适用于掺杂氧化物热力学稳定的情况，旨在通过扩散实现体相掺杂。

浸渍法将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前驱体的液体中，然后干燥并在空气中加热。这种方法的目标是实现表面掺杂，而不是体相掺杂。

影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素：

1. 掺杂剂负载量：以铜掺杂氧化铈为例，质量分数低于3%时成功实现掺杂，没有出现单独的氧化铜相。超过3%时，出现相分离。

2. 焙烧温度：更高的温度可能导致相分离增加，影响掺杂剂的分布。

X射线衍射（XRD）对于确认成功掺杂和表征材料至关重要：

1. 对于Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，XRD检测到单相钛酸锶结构，晶格常数发生移动，表明发生了取代型掺杂。

2. 在铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂中，低负载时XRD未显示结晶氧化铜相，而Rietveld分析显示晶格常数略有移动，表明Cu离子取代了CeO2晶格中的Ce离子。

这些表征技术有助于确定掺杂的成功程度及其对材料结构的影响。成功掺杂的材料通常表现出更好的催化性能，如铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂在CO氧化反应中表现出比未掺杂氧化物更高的活性。
