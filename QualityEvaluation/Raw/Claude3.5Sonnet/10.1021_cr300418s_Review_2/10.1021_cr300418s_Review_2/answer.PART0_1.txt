[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."

[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."

[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed."

[4] "XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

[5] "The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature. The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method are two distinct approaches for preparing doped oxide materials, each with its own characteristics and outcomes.

Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, followed by high-temperature heating in oxygen to promote dopant diffusion. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. In contrast, wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, followed by drying and heating in air. The goal is to achieve surface doping rather than forming a separate dopant oxide phase.

Dopant loading is a critical factor in both methods. In the case of copper-doped ceria prepared by impregnation, low Cu loadings (below 3% by weight) resulted in successful doping without forming separate crystalline copper oxide phases. However, higher loadings led to phase separation. This demonstrates the importance of controlling dopant concentration to achieve desired doping outcomes.

Calcination temperature also plays a crucial role in the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of doped oxides. Higher calcination temperatures can lead to increased formation of separate dopant oxide phases, as observed in the copper-doped ceria example. The doped material showed enhanced catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to the undoped oxide, highlighting the impact of successful doping on performance.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. In the case of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 prepared by solid-state synthesis, XRD measurements detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift, consistent with substitutional doping. Similarly, for copper-doped ceria, XRD analysis combined with Rietveld refinement revealed a ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, indicating the substitution of Cu ions for Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice.

These examples demonstrate how XRD can provide evidence of successful doping by showing the absence of separate crystalline phases and detecting lattice constant shifts that indicate the incorporation of dopant ions into the host oxide structure. Such characterization is crucial for verifying the success of doping methods and understanding the structural properties of the resulting materials.

固态合成法和浸渍法是制备掺杂氧化物材料的两种不同方法，各有其特点和结果。

固态合成法涉及机械混合主体氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物，然后在氧气中高温加热以促进掺杂剂扩散。这种方法适用于掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定相的情况。相比之下，湿法浸渍将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前驱体的液体中，然后干燥并在空气中加热。目标是实现表面掺杂，而不是形成单独的掺杂剂氧化物相。

掺杂剂负载量是两种方法中的关键因素。在用浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈的情况下，低铜负载量（3%以下）成功实现了掺杂，没有形成单独的结晶铜氧化物相。然而，更高的负载量导致相分离。这表明控制掺杂剂浓度对于实现预期的掺杂结果很重要。

煅烧温度也在掺杂氧化物的结构特性和催化性能中起着关键作用。更高的煅烧温度可能导致单独的掺杂剂氧化物相增加，如在铜掺杂氧化铈的例子中所观察到的。掺杂材料对CO氧化显示出增强的催化活性，比未掺杂的氧化物更好，突出了成功掺杂对性能的影响。

X射线衍射（XRD）是确认成功掺杂和表征所得材料的有价值技术。在用固态合成法制备的Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的情况下，XRD测量检测到单相钛酸锶结构，晶格常数发生偏移，与取代型掺杂一致。同样，对于铜掺杂氧化铈，XRD分析结合Rietveld精修显示出氧化铈结构，晶格常数略有偏移，表明Cu离子取代了CeO2晶格中的Ce离子。

这些例子展示了XRD如何通过显示没有单独的结晶相，以及检测到表明掺杂离子被纳入主体氧化物结构的晶格常数偏移，来提供成功掺杂的证据。这种表征对于验证掺杂方法的成功以及理解所得材料的结构性质至关重要。
