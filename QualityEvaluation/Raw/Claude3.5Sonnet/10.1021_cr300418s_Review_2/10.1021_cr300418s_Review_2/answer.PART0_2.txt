[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."

[2] "Wet impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the precursor of the dopant. The mixture is then dried and heated in air. It is hoped that heating causes surface doping rather than a separate phase of the oxide of the dopant or a submonolayer of the dopant oxide on the host oxide."

[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed."

[4] "XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."

[5] "The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method are two different approaches for preparing doped oxide materials, each with its own characteristics and outcomes.

Solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, followed by high-temperature heating in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. It typically requires higher temperatures and longer processing times compared to impregnation.

Impregnation, on the other hand, exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor. After drying, the mixture is heated in air, aiming to cause surface doping. This method generally uses lower temperatures and shorter processing times than solid-state synthesis.

Dopant loading is a crucial factor in both methods. For impregnation, as demonstrated in the copper-doped ceria example, lower dopant loadings (below 3% Cu by weight) resulted in successful doping without separate phase formation. Higher loadings led to phase separation, indicating a limit to the amount of dopant that can be incorporated into the host lattice.

Calcination temperature also plays a significant role. Higher temperatures can promote better dopant diffusion in solid-state synthesis but may lead to increased phase separation in impregnation methods, as seen in the copper-doped ceria case.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. In both the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria examples, XRD was used to detect changes in the crystal structure indicative of doping. For Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, XRD showed a single-phase strontium titanate structure with a lattice constant shift, consistent with substitutional doping. Similarly, for copper-doped ceria, XRD revealed no separate crystalline copper oxide phases at low dopant concentrations, while Rietveld analysis showed a small lattice constant shift, suggesting successful incorporation of Cu ions into the CeO2 lattice.

Regarding catalytic performance, the copper-doped ceria catalysts prepared by impregnation showed improved activity for CO oxidation compared to the undoped oxide, demonstrating how doping can enhance catalytic properties.

In conclusion, both methods can produce doped oxides, but their success depends on factors such as dopant loading, calcination temperature, and the specific host-dopant combination. XRD analysis is crucial for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials.

固态合成法和浸渍法是两种不同的制备掺杂氧化物材料的方法，各有其特点和结果。

固态合成法涉及机械混合主体氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物，然后在氧气中高温加热以允许掺杂剂扩散。这种方法适用于掺杂氧化物在热力学上稳定的情况。与浸渍法相比，它通常需要更高的温度和更长的处理时间。

另一方面，浸渍法将主体氧化物暴露在含有掺杂剂前驱体的液体中。干燥后，混合物在空气中加热，目的是造成表面掺杂。这种方法通常使用比固态合成法更低的温度和更短的处理时间。

掺杂剂含量是两种方法中的关键因素。对于浸渍法，如铜掺杂氧化铈的例子所示，较低的掺杂剂含量（低于3%的铜重量百分比）可以成功掺杂而不形成单独的相。更高的含量会导致相分离，表明主晶格能够容纳的掺杂剂量是有限的。

煅烧温度也起着重要作用。在固态合成中，更高的温度可以促进更好的掺杂剂扩散，但在浸渍法中可能导致相分离增加，就像在铜掺杂氧化铈的例子中所看到的那样。

X射线衍射（XRD）是确认成功掺杂和表征所得材料的有效技术。在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂氧化铈的例子中，XRD都被用来检测晶体结构的变化，这表明发生了掺杂。对于Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，XRD显示了单相钛酸锶结构，晶格常数发生变化，这与取代型掺杂一致。同样，对于铜掺杂氧化铈，XRD在低掺杂剂浓度下没有显示单独的结晶氧化铜相，而Rietveld分析显示晶格常数略有变化，表明Cu离子成功地掺入了CeO2晶格。

关于催化性能，用浸渍法制备的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂对CO氧化的活性比未掺杂的氧化物有所提高，这表明掺杂可以增强催化性能。

总之，两种方法都可以制备掺杂氧化物，但其成功与否取决于掺杂剂含量、煅烧温度以及特定的主体-掺杂剂组合等因素。XRD分析对于确认成功掺杂和表征所得材料至关重要。
