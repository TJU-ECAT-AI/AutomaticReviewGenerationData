          "In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample. In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample)."

"The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

"The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

"It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample."

"The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

"The most active catalyst was obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which led to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area was produced."

"It was found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite."

"Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction."

          The literature primarily compares precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts, rather than solid-state synthesis. However, some key comparisons can be drawn:

1. Preparation methods: 
   - Precipitation involves mixing iron and chromium nitrate solutions before adding ammonium hydroxide.
   - Impregnation involves first producing an iron oxide gel and then impregnating it with chromium nitrate solution.

2. Dopant loading:
   - Impregnation typically allows for higher and more precise dopant loading.
   - The impregnation method led to higher chromium content both on the surface and in the bulk compared to precipitation.

3. Structural characteristics:
   - Both methods produced magnetite as the main phase.
   - Chromium-doped samples showed higher specific surface areas than pure magnetite, with the impregnated sample having the highest.
   - The preparation method significantly affects the textural properties of the doped materials.

4. Calcination temperature:
   - Both methods involved heating to 773 K under nitrogen flow to form the active magnetite phase.
   - Calcination conditions can affect crystallinity, surface area, and dopant distribution in oxide materials.

5. Catalytic performance:
   - The impregnated sample showed higher overall catalytic activity than the precipitated sample in the water gas shift reaction.
   - Chromium doping increased specific surface area but decreased activity per unit area by making Fe2+ production more difficult.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials:
   - XRD showed only magnetite peaks for all samples, indicating chromium incorporation did not form separate phases.
   - This technique can detect new phases, lattice changes, or peak broadening due to doping in oxide systems.

While the study doesn't provide specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar for these systems, focusing on phase identification, lattice parameter changes, and potential effects on crystallite size.

          这篇文献主要比较了沉淀法和浸渍法制备铬掺杂磁铁矿催化剂,而不是固态合成法。然而,可以得出一些关键比较:

1. 制备方法:
   - 沉淀法涉及在加入氢氧化铵之前混合铁和铬的硝酸盐溶液。
   - 浸渍法涉及先制备氧化铁凝胶,然后用硝酸铬溶液浸渍。

2. 掺杂剂含量:
   - 浸渍法通常允许更高和更精确的掺杂剂含量。
   - 与沉淀法相比,浸渍法导致表面和体相中的铬含量更高。

3. 结构特征:
   - 两种方法都产生了主相为磁铁矿的材料。
   - 铬掺杂样品的比表面积高于纯磁铁矿,其中浸渍样品最高。
   - 制备方法显著影响掺杂材料的织构性质。

4. 煅烧温度:
   - 两种方法都在氮气流中加热到773 K以形成活性磁铁矿相。
   - 煅烧条件可以影响氧化物材料的结晶度、表面积和掺杂剂分布。

5. 催化性能:
   - 在水煤气变换反应中,浸渍样品表现出比沉淀样品更高的整体催化活性。
   - 铬掺杂增加了比表面积,但由于使Fe2+的生成更加困难,导致单位面积活性降低。

X射线衍射(XRD)被用来确认成功掺杂并表征材料:
   - XRD显示所有样品只有磁铁矿峰,表明铬的掺入没有形成单独的相。
   - 这种技术可以检测氧化物体系中由于掺杂引起的新相、晶格变化或峰宽化。

虽然该研究没有提供Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3或铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂用于CO氧化的具体例子,但使用XRD表征掺杂材料的原理对这些系统来说是相似的,主要关注相鉴定、晶格参数变化和对晶粒大小的潜在影响。
