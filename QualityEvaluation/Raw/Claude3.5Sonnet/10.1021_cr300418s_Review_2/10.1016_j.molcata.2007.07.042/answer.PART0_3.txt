[1] "It was found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite."

[2] "The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

[3] "The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

[4] "It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample."

[5] "The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

[6] "The most active catalyst can be obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which leads to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area is produced."

The solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials differ in several key aspects:

1. Dopant loading: Impregnation typically allows for higher and more precise control of dopant loading. As seen in the study, the impregnation method led to higher chromium content both on the surface and in the bulk compared to precipitation.

2. Calcination temperature: Both methods usually require high-temperature calcination, but the temperature may differ. In this study, both methods used 773 K for calcination.

3. Structural characteristics: The preparation method affects the textural and catalytic properties of the doped materials. In this case, the impregnated sample showed higher specific surface area than the precipitated one.

4. Catalytic performance: The impregnation method produced a more active catalyst with higher specific surface area.

XRD can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials by:

1. Identifying phases: XRD can show if any new phases form due to doping or if the host structure remains intact. In this study, XRD showed only magnetite phase regardless of the preparation method or chromium presence.

2. Detecting lattice changes: Shifts in peak positions can indicate changes in lattice parameters due to dopant incorporation. Though not explicitly mentioned for XRD in this study, the Mössbauer spectroscopy results showed changes in hyperfine magnetic fields, suggesting lattice modifications due to chromium doping.

3. Estimating crystallite size: Peak broadening in XRD patterns can be used to estimate crystallite size, which can be affected by doping.

While the study doesn't provide specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria catalysts, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar for these systems, focusing on phase identification, lattice parameter changes, and potential effects on crystallite size.

固态合成和浸渍法制备掺杂氧化物材料在几个关键方面存在差异：

1. 掺杂剂含量：浸渍法通常允许更高和更精确地控制掺杂剂含量。从研究中可以看出，与沉淀法相比，浸渍法导致表面和体相中的铬含量更高。

2. 煅烧温度：两种方法通常都需要高温煅烧，但温度可能不同。在这项研究中，两种方法都使用773 K进行煅烧。

3. 结构特征：制备方法影响掺杂材料的织构和催化性能。在这个案例中，浸渍样品表现出比沉淀样品更高的比表面积。

4. 催化性能：浸渍法产生了一种活性更高、比表面积更大的催化剂。

XRD可以用来确认成功掺杂并表征所得材料，方法如下：

1. 鉴定相：XRD可以显示是否由于掺杂而形成新的相，或者主体结构是否保持完整。在这项研究中，XRD显示无论制备方法如何或是否存在铬，只有磁铁矿相。

2. 检测晶格变化：峰位置的移动可以表明由于掺杂剂的引入导致的晶格参数变化。虽然这项研究中没有明确提到XRD的这一作用，但穆斯堡尔光谱结果显示超精细磁场发生变化，表明由于铬掺杂导致了晶格修饰。

3. 估算晶粒大小：XRD图谱中的峰宽化可用于估算晶粒大小，而掺杂可能会影响晶粒大小。

虽然该研究没有提供Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3或铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的具体例子，但使用XRD表征掺杂材料的原理对这些系统来说是相似的，主要关注相鉴定、晶格参数变化和对晶粒大小的潜在影响。
