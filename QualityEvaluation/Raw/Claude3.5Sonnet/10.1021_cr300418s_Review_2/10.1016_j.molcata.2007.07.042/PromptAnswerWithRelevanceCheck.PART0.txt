[1] "In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample."

[2] "In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample)."

[3] "The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

[4] "The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

[5] "It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample. After reaction, however, the opposite was noted and the chromium-doped catalysts showed the lowest values."

[6] "The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

The precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials differ in several key aspects:

1. Dopant incorporation: In precipitation, the dopant (chromium) is mixed with the main component (iron) solution before precipitation. In impregnation, the main component is precipitated first, then the dopant is added to the formed gel.

2. Dopant distribution: Impregnation tends to result in higher surface concentrations of the dopant, while precipitation may lead to more uniform distribution throughout the bulk.

3. Structural characteristics: Both methods produced magnetite as the main phase, but impregnation resulted in higher specific surface areas.

4. Catalytic performance: The impregnated sample showed higher catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction, likely due to its higher surface area and dopant concentration.

Dopant loading influences the structural and catalytic properties:

1. Higher chromium loading increased the specific surface area in both methods.
2. Chromium delayed the reduction of iron to metallic state, improving catalyst stability.
3. Chromium affected the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio on the surface, which impacts catalytic activity.

Calcination temperature was not explicitly discussed in the given text, but it would likely affect crystallinity, particle size, and surface area of the catalysts.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the formation of magnetite phase in all samples, regardless of preparation method or chromium doping. This technique can detect the presence of additional phases or changes in lattice parameters that may result from doping. While the text doesn't provide specific examples for Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria, XRD would similarly be useful for confirming successful doping and phase purity in these systems.

沉淀法和浸渍法制备掺杂氧化物材料的主要区别如下：

1. 掺杂剂的引入：沉淀法中，掺杂剂（铬）在沉淀前与主要成分（铁）的溶液混合。浸渍法中，先沉淀主要成分，然后将掺杂剂加入形成的凝胶中。

2. 掺杂剂分布：浸渍法往往导致掺杂剂在表面浓度更高，而沉淀法可能使掺杂剂在整个体相中分布更均匀。

3. 结构特征：两种方法都产生了主相为磁铁矿的材料，但浸渍法得到的样品比表面积更高。

4. 催化性能：浸渍法制备的样品在水煤气变换反应中表现出更高的催化活性，这可能是由于其更高的比表面积和掺杂剂浓度。

掺杂剂含量影响结构和催化性能：

1. 更高的铬含量增加了两种方法制备的样品的比表面积。
2. 铬延缓了铁还原为金属态的过程，提高了催化剂的稳定性。
3. 铬影响了表面Fe2+/Fe3+比例，这影响催化活性。

文中没有明确讨论焙烧温度，但它可能会影响催化剂的结晶度、粒径和比表面积。

X射线衍射（XRD）被用来确认所有样品中磁铁矿相的形成，不论制备方法或铬掺杂与否。这种技术可以检测由掺杂可能导致的额外相或晶格参数的变化。虽然文本没有提供Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3或铜掺杂CeO2的具体例子，但XRD同样可用于确认这些体系中的成功掺杂和相纯度。

The solid-state synthesis method is not discussed in this literature, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, the precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts are compared:

Precipitation involves mixing iron and chromium nitrate solutions before adding ammonium hydroxide, while impregnation involves first producing an iron oxide gel and then impregnating it with chromium nitrate solution.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and catalytic performance include:

1. Dopant loading: The impregnation method resulted in higher chromium content both in bulk and on the surface compared to precipitation.

2. Calcination temperature: Both methods involved heating to 773 K under nitrogen flow.

3. Surface area: Chromium-doped samples showed higher specific surface areas than pure magnetite, with the impregnated sample having the highest.

4. Catalytic activity: The impregnated sample (MCI) showed higher catalytic activity than the precipitated sample (MCP) in the water gas shift reaction.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the formation of magnetite in both methods, with no other phases detected. This technique can verify successful doping by showing changes in lattice parameters or peak positions due to dopant incorporation.

While the specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria for CO oxidation are not discussed in this literature, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar. XRD could be used to confirm the crystal structure, detect any secondary phases, and observe shifts in peak positions or changes in lattice parameters due to dopant incorporation in these systems as well.

该文献中没有讨论固态合成法,因此无法直接比较。但是,文献比较了制备铬掺杂磁铁矿催化剂的沉淀法和浸渍法:

沉淀法是先将铁和铬的硝酸盐溶液混合,然后加入氢氧化铵;而浸渍法是先制备氧化铁凝胶,然后用硝酸铬溶液浸渍。

影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 掺杂量:浸渍法比沉淀法在体相和表面上的铬含量更高。

2. 煅烧温度:两种方法都在氮气流中加热到773 K。

3. 比表面积:铬掺杂样品的比表面积高于纯磁铁矿,其中浸渍样品最高。

4. 催化活性:在水煤气变换反应中,浸渍样品(MCI)的催化活性高于沉淀样品(MCP)。

X射线衍射(XRD)被用来确认两种方法中磁铁矿的形成,没有检测到其他相。这种技术可以通过显示晶格参数或峰位置的变化来验证掺杂的成功。

虽然本文献中没有讨论Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂CeO2用于CO氧化的具体例子,但使用XRD表征掺杂材料的原理是类似的。在这些体系中,XRD同样可以用来确认晶体结构,检测任何次生相,并观察由于掺杂剂的引入而导致的峰位移动或晶格参数的变化。

The solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials differ in several key aspects:

1. Dopant loading: The impregnation method typically allows for higher and more precise dopant loading compared to solid-state synthesis. As seen in the study, impregnation led to higher chromium content in the final catalyst.

2. Structural characteristics: Solid-state synthesis often results in more homogeneous incorporation of dopants into the crystal structure, while impregnation may lead to surface enrichment of dopants. In this study, impregnation resulted in higher surface chromium content.

3. Calcination temperature: Solid-state synthesis generally requires higher calcination temperatures to promote diffusion and reaction between precursors. Impregnation can often be carried out at lower temperatures.

4. Catalytic performance: The preparation method significantly impacts catalytic properties. In this case, the impregnated sample showed higher activity due to increased surface area and higher chromium content.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing doped materials:

1. Phase identification: XRD can detect the formation of new phases or changes in the crystal structure upon doping. In this study, XRD confirmed that only magnetite was present in both doped and undoped samples.

2. Lattice parameter changes: Doping often causes shifts in peak positions due to changes in lattice parameters. This can be used to confirm dopant incorporation into the crystal structure.

3. Peak broadening: XRD can reveal changes in crystallite size or strain induced by doping, which manifest as peak broadening.

4. Quantitative analysis: Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns can provide quantitative information on dopant occupancy and distribution within the crystal structure.

For specific examples like Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria, XRD could be used to:

1. Confirm the formation of a single-phase perovskite structure in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and detect any secondary phases.

2. Observe shifts in lattice parameters due to La and Ta incorporation in the titanate structure.

3. Detect the presence of CuO or Cu2O phases in copper-doped ceria, or confirm the absence of such phases if copper is fully incorporated into the ceria lattice.

4. Analyze peak broadening to assess changes in crystallite size or strain induced by doping in both systems.

固态合成法和浸渍法制备掺杂氧化物材料在以下几个关键方面存在差异：

1. 掺杂剂含量：浸渍法通常允许更高和更精确的掺杂剂含量，相比于固态合成法。如研究所示，浸渍法导致最终催化剂中铬含量更高。

2. 结构特征：固态合成法通常会使掺杂剂更均匀地掺入晶体结构，而浸渍法可能导致表面掺杂剂富集。在本研究中，浸渍法导致表面铬含量更高。

3. 煅烧温度：固态合成法通常需要更高的煅烧温度以促进前驱体之间的扩散和反应。浸渍法通常可以在较低温度下进行。

4. 催化性能：制备方法显著影响催化性能。在这个案例中，浸渍样品由于比表面积增加和铬含量更高而表现出更高的活性。

X射线衍射（XRD）是确认成功掺杂和表征掺杂材料的有力技术：

1. 相鉴定：XRD可以检测掺杂后新相的形成或晶体结构的变化。在本研究中，XRD确认在掺杂和未掺杂样品中仅存在磁铁矿相。

2. 晶格参数变化：掺杂通常会由于晶格参数的变化导致峰位置移动。这可用于确认掺杂剂掺入晶体结构。

3. 峰宽化：XRD可以揭示掺杂引起的晶粒尺寸或应变变化，表现为峰宽化。

4. 定量分析：XRD图谱的Rietveld精修可以提供掺杂剂占位和在晶体结构中分布的定量信息。

对于Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂的氧化铈等具体例子，XRD可用于：

1. 确认Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3中单相钙钛矿结构的形成，并检测任何次生相。

2. 观察由于La和Ta掺入钛酸盐结构引起的晶格参数变化。

3. 检测铜掺杂氧化铈中CuO或Cu2O相的存在，或者如果铜完全掺入氧化铈晶格，则确认这些相的缺失。

4. 分析峰宽化，以评估两个体系中掺杂引起的晶粒尺寸或应变变化。

The solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials differ in several key aspects:

1. Dopant loading: Impregnation typically allows for higher and more precise control of dopant loading. As seen in the study, the impregnation method led to higher chromium content both on the surface and in the bulk compared to precipitation.

2. Calcination temperature: Both methods usually require high-temperature calcination, but the temperature may differ. In this study, both methods used 773 K for calcination.

3. Structural characteristics: The preparation method affects the textural and catalytic properties of the doped materials. In this case, the impregnated sample showed higher specific surface area than the precipitated one.

4. Catalytic performance: The impregnation method produced a more active catalyst with higher specific surface area.

XRD can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials by:

1. Identifying phases: XRD can show if any new phases form due to doping or if the host structure remains intact. In this study, XRD showed only magnetite phase regardless of the preparation method or chromium presence.

2. Detecting lattice changes: Shifts in peak positions can indicate changes in lattice parameters due to dopant incorporation. Though not explicitly mentioned for XRD in this study, the Mössbauer spectroscopy results showed changes in hyperfine magnetic fields, suggesting lattice modifications due to chromium doping.

3. Estimating crystallite size: Peak broadening in XRD patterns can be used to estimate crystallite size, which can be affected by doping.

While the study doesn't provide specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria catalysts, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar for these systems, focusing on phase identification, lattice parameter changes, and potential effects on crystallite size.

4. 催化性能：浸渍法产生了一种活性更高、比表面积更大的催化剂。

XRD可以用来确认成功掺杂并表征所得材料，方法如下：

1. 鉴定相：XRD可以显示是否由于掺杂而形成新的相，或者主体结构是否保持完整。在这项研究中，XRD显示无论制备方法如何或是否存在铬，只有磁铁矿相。

2. 检测晶格变化：峰位置的移动可以表明由于掺杂剂的引入导致的晶格参数变化。虽然这项研究中没有明确提到XRD的这一作用，但穆斯堡尔光谱结果显示超精细磁场发生变化，表明由于铬掺杂导致了晶格修饰。

3. 估算晶粒大小：XRD图谱中的峰宽化可用于估算晶粒大小，而掺杂可能会影响晶粒大小。

虽然该研究没有提供Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3或铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的具体例子，但使用XRD表征掺杂材料的原理对这些系统来说是相似的，主要关注相鉴定、晶格参数变化和对晶粒大小的潜在影响。

This literature primarily compares precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts, rather than solid-state synthesis. However, some comparisons can be drawn:

The preparation method significantly affects both textural and catalytic properties of the doped oxide materials. Impregnation led to higher chromium loading and specific surface area compared to precipitation, resulting in a more active catalyst for the water gas shift reaction.

Dopant loading influences structural characteristics and performance. Higher chromium content from impregnation increased specific surface area and overall catalytic activity, though it decreased activity per unit area by making Fe2+ production more difficult.

XRD was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials. It showed only magnetite peaks for all samples, indicating chromium incorporation did not form separate phases. This technique can similarly detect new phases or lattice changes in other doped systems.

While calcination temperature was not explicitly varied, the samples were heated to 773 K under nitrogen to form the active magnetite phase. Calcination conditions can affect crystallinity, surface area, and dopant distribution in oxide materials.

The study demonstrates how preparation method and dopant loading impact catalyst properties and performance. Similar principles likely apply when comparing solid-state synthesis to wet chemistry methods for other doped oxide systems, though the specific effects may differ.

这篇文献主要比较了沉淀法和浸渍法制备铬掺杂磁铁矿催化剂,而不是固态合成法。然而,可以得出一些比较:

制备方法显著影响掺杂氧化物材料的织构和催化性能。与沉淀法相比,浸渍法导致更高的铬负载量和比表面积,从而获得了更活跃的水煤气变换反应催化剂。

掺杂剂含量影响结构特性和性能。浸渍法产生的较高铬含量增加了比表面积和整体催化活性,但由于使Fe2+的生成更加困难,导致单位面积活性降低。

XRD被用来确认成功掺杂并表征材料。它显示所有样品只有磁铁矿峰,表明铬的掺入没有形成单独的相。这种技术同样可以检测其他掺杂体系中的新相或晶格变化。

虽然没有明确改变煅烧温度,但样品在氮气下加热到773 K以形成活性磁铁矿相。煅烧条件可以影响氧化物材料的结晶度、表面积和掺杂剂分布。

该研究表明了制备方法和掺杂剂含量如何影响催化剂的性质和性能。类似的原理可能适用于比较其他掺杂氧化物体系的固态合成和湿化学方法,尽管具体影响可能不同。
