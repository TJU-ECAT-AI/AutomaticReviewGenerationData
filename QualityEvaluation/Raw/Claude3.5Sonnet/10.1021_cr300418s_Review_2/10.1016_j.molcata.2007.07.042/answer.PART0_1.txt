[1] "In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample. In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample)."

[2] "The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

[3] "The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

[4] "The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

[5] "Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction."

The solid-state synthesis method is not discussed in this literature, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, the precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts are compared:

Precipitation involves mixing iron and chromium nitrate solutions before adding ammonium hydroxide, while impregnation involves first producing an iron oxide gel and then impregnating it with chromium nitrate solution.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and catalytic performance include:

1. Dopant loading: The impregnation method resulted in higher chromium content both in bulk and on the surface compared to precipitation.

2. Calcination temperature: Both methods involved heating to 773 K under nitrogen flow.

3. Surface area: Chromium-doped samples showed higher specific surface areas than pure magnetite, with the impregnated sample having the highest.

4. Catalytic activity: The impregnated sample (MCI) showed higher catalytic activity than the precipitated sample (MCP) in the water gas shift reaction.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the formation of magnetite in both methods, with no other phases detected. This technique can verify successful doping by showing changes in lattice parameters or peak positions due to dopant incorporation.

While the specific examples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria for CO oxidation are not discussed in this literature, the principles of using XRD to characterize doped materials would be similar. XRD could be used to confirm the crystal structure, detect any secondary phases, and observe shifts in peak positions or changes in lattice parameters due to dopant incorporation in these systems as well.

该文献中没有讨论固态合成法,因此无法直接比较。但是,文献比较了制备铬掺杂磁铁矿催化剂的沉淀法和浸渍法:

沉淀法是先将铁和铬的硝酸盐溶液混合,然后加入氢氧化铵;而浸渍法是先制备氧化铁凝胶,然后用硝酸铬溶液浸渍。

影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 掺杂量:浸渍法比沉淀法在体相和表面上的铬含量更高。

2. 煅烧温度:两种方法都在氮气流中加热到773 K。

3. 比表面积:铬掺杂样品的比表面积高于纯磁铁矿,其中浸渍样品最高。

4. 催化活性:在水煤气变换反应中,浸渍样品(MCI)的催化活性高于沉淀样品(MCP)。

X射线衍射(XRD)被用来确认两种方法中磁铁矿的形成,没有检测到其他相。这种技术可以通过显示晶格参数或峰位置的变化来验证掺杂的成功。

虽然本文献中没有讨论Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂CeO2用于CO氧化的具体例子,但使用XRD表征掺杂材料的原理是类似的。在这些体系中,XRD同样可以用来确认晶体结构,检测任何次生相,并观察由于掺杂剂的引入而导致的峰位移动或晶格参数的变化。
