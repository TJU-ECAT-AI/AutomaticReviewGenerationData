[1] "The precipitation and impregnation methods in the preparation of chromium-doped magnetite for water gas shift reaction (WGSR) were compared in this work."

[2] "It was found that the preparation method affects both the textural and catalytic properties of chromium-doped magnetite."

[3] "The most active catalyst was obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which led to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area was produced."

[4] "The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

[5] "The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter"

[6] "Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction."

This literature primarily compares precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite catalysts, rather than solid-state synthesis. However, some comparisons can be drawn:

The preparation method significantly affects both textural and catalytic properties of the doped oxide materials. Impregnation led to higher chromium loading and specific surface area compared to precipitation, resulting in a more active catalyst for the water gas shift reaction.

Dopant loading influences structural characteristics and performance. Higher chromium content from impregnation increased specific surface area and overall catalytic activity, though it decreased activity per unit area by making Fe2+ production more difficult.

XRD was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials. It showed only magnetite peaks for all samples, indicating chromium incorporation did not form separate phases. This technique can similarly detect new phases or lattice changes in other doped systems.

While calcination temperature was not explicitly varied, the samples were heated to 773 K under nitrogen to form the active magnetite phase. Calcination conditions can affect crystallinity, surface area, and dopant distribution in oxide materials.

The study demonstrates how preparation method and dopant loading impact catalyst properties and performance. Similar principles likely apply when comparing solid-state synthesis to wet chemistry methods for other doped oxide systems, though the specific effects may differ.

这篇文献主要比较了沉淀法和浸渍法制备铬掺杂磁铁矿催化剂,而不是固态合成法。然而,可以得出一些比较:

制备方法显著影响掺杂氧化物材料的织构和催化性能。与沉淀法相比,浸渍法导致更高的铬负载量和比表面积,从而获得了更活跃的水煤气变换反应催化剂。

掺杂剂含量影响结构特性和性能。浸渍法产生的较高铬含量增加了比表面积和整体催化活性,但由于使Fe2+的生成更加困难,导致单位面积活性降低。

XRD被用来确认成功掺杂并表征材料。它显示所有样品只有磁铁矿峰,表明铬的掺入没有形成单独的相。这种技术同样可以检测其他掺杂体系中的新相或晶格变化。

虽然没有明确改变煅烧温度,但样品在氮气下加热到773 K以形成活性磁铁矿相。煅烧条件可以影响氧化物材料的结晶度、表面积和掺杂剂分布。

该研究表明了制备方法和掺杂剂含量如何影响催化剂的性质和性能。类似的原理可能适用于比较其他掺杂氧化物体系的固态合成和湿化学方法,尽管具体影响可能不同。
