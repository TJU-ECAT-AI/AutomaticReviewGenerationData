[1] "In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample."

[2] "In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample)."

[3] "The addition of chromium to magnetite did not affect its reduction profile, but shifted the peaks to high temperatures. It means that chromium made the production of metallic iron more difficult, suggesting that it can delay this process during WGSR, in agreement with previous works"

[4] "The chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter, in accordance with previous works"

[5] "It can be seen that chromium caused an increase of these values and this effect was more pronounced for the impregnated sample. After reaction, however, the opposite was noted and the chromium-doped catalysts showed the lowest values."

[6] "The X-ray diffractograms showed that during heating the solids produced magnetite (JCPDF 88-0315) and no other phase was found, regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium"

The precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials differ in several key aspects:

1. Dopant incorporation: In precipitation, the dopant (chromium) is mixed with the main component (iron) solution before precipitation. In impregnation, the main component is precipitated first, then the dopant is added to the formed gel.

2. Dopant distribution: Impregnation tends to result in higher surface concentrations of the dopant, while precipitation may lead to more uniform distribution throughout the bulk.

3. Structural characteristics: Both methods produced magnetite as the main phase, but impregnation resulted in higher specific surface areas.

4. Catalytic performance: The impregnated sample showed higher catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction, likely due to its higher surface area and dopant concentration.

Dopant loading influences the structural and catalytic properties:

1. Higher chromium loading increased the specific surface area in both methods.
2. Chromium delayed the reduction of iron to metallic state, improving catalyst stability.
3. Chromium affected the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio on the surface, which impacts catalytic activity.

Calcination temperature was not explicitly discussed in the given text, but it would likely affect crystallinity, particle size, and surface area of the catalysts.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the formation of magnetite phase in all samples, regardless of preparation method or chromium doping. This technique can detect the presence of additional phases or changes in lattice parameters that may result from doping. While the text doesn't provide specific examples for Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 or copper-doped ceria, XRD would similarly be useful for confirming successful doping and phase purity in these systems.

沉淀法和浸渍法制备掺杂氧化物材料的主要区别如下：

1. 掺杂剂的引入：沉淀法中，掺杂剂（铬）在沉淀前与主要成分（铁）的溶液混合。浸渍法中，先沉淀主要成分，然后将掺杂剂加入形成的凝胶中。

2. 掺杂剂分布：浸渍法往往导致掺杂剂在表面浓度更高，而沉淀法可能使掺杂剂在整个体相中分布更均匀。

3. 结构特征：两种方法都产生了主相为磁铁矿的材料，但浸渍法得到的样品比表面积更高。

4. 催化性能：浸渍法制备的样品在水煤气变换反应中表现出更高的催化活性，这可能是由于其更高的比表面积和掺杂剂浓度。

掺杂剂含量影响结构和催化性能：

1. 更高的铬含量增加了两种方法制备的样品的比表面积。
2. 铬延缓了铁还原为金属态的过程，提高了催化剂的稳定性。
3. 铬影响了表面Fe2+/Fe3+比例，这影响催化活性。

文中没有明确讨论焙烧温度，但它可能会影响催化剂的结晶度、粒径和比表面积。

X射线衍射（XRD）被用来确认所有样品中磁铁矿相的形成，不论制备方法或铬掺杂与否。这种技术可以检测由掺杂可能导致的额外相或晶格参数的变化。虽然文本没有提供Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3或铜掺杂CeO2的具体例子，但XRD同样可用于确认这些体系中的成功掺杂和相纯度。
