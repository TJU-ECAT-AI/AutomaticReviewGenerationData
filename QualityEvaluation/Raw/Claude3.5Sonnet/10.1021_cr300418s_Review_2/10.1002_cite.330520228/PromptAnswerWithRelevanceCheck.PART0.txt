<questions>

Compare and contrast the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, discussing how key factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, explain how techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials, using specific examples such as Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation.

The provided literature does not contain any information specifically related to solid-state synthesis methods, impregnation methods, or the preparation of doped oxide materials. The text does not discuss dopant loading, calcination temperature, or their effects on structural characteristics and catalytic performance. There is also no mention of X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques or specific examples like Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation. The literature appears to be focused on other topics in chemical engineering and technology, and does not provide the necessary information to answer the given question.
