[1] "Ceramics samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method."

[2] "The starting materials are La2O3 with purity of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%, respectively. The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h."

[3] "After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient."

[4] "Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer."

[5] "It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

The literature only describes the solid-state synthesis method for preparing Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 ceramics, and does not discuss the impregnation method or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation. Therefore, a full comparison cannot be made based solely on this text.

For the solid-state method:

1. Synthesis process: Raw materials are mixed in stoichiometric proportions, ball-milled, pressed into pellets, and calcined at high temperature (1350°C for 6 hours).

2. Dopant loading: Tantalum content was varied (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3.

3. Characterization: X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials. XRD patterns showed that tantalum was incorporated into the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 lattice, forming a single-phase compound.

4. Structural characteristics: All samples showed cubic symmetry with the Pm3m space group. Lattice constants and volumes increased with increasing tantalum content.

The study does not provide information on catalytic performance or compare the solid-state method to the impregnation method. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献仅描述了制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3陶瓷的固相合成方法，没有讨论浸渍法或用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。

关于固相法：

1. 合成过程：原料按化学计量比混合，球磨，压制成型，然后在高温下煅烧（1350°C，6小时）。

2. 掺杂量：在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3中，钽的含量有所变化（x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05）。

3. 表征：使用X射线衍射（XRD）来确认掺杂成功并表征材料。XRD图谱显示钽已经掺入Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格，形成单相化合物。

4. 结构特征：所有样品都呈现立方对称性，属于Pm3m空间群。随着钽含量的增加，晶格常数和体积也随之增大。

该研究没有提供关于催化性能的信息，也没有将固相法与浸渍法进行比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外的信息。
