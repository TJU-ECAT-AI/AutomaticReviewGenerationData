[1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

[3] "The lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A, which is in agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes increase."

[4] "Though tantalum doping can introduce more carriers, it also introduces scattering centers, especially at high doping level. With the increase of tantalum content, this strong scattering may become dominating factor for electron conduction, resulting in increase of electrical resistivity."

The literature does not directly compare solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials. However, it does provide information on the solid-state reaction technique used to prepare Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 samples.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and performance in this solid-state synthesis include:

1. Dopant loading: The tantalum content (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) affects the lattice constants, electrical resistivity, and thermoelectric properties.

2. Calcination temperature: The samples were calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours, then sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials:

1. XRD patterns showed that tantalum was successfully doped into the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 lattice, forming a single-phase compound.

2. XRD analysis revealed that all samples had a cubic perovskite structure.

3. Lattice constants and volumes were calculated from XRD data, showing an increase with tantalum content.

While the literature doesn't discuss copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, it demonstrates how XRD can be used to characterize doped materials and confirm successful incorporation of dopants into the crystal structure.

这篇文献没有直接比较制备掺杂氧化物材料的固相合成法和浸渍法。但是,它提供了使用固相反应技术制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3样品的信息。

在这种固相合成中影响结构特性和性能的关键因素包括:

1. 掺杂量:钽含量(x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05)影响晶格常数、电阻率和热电性能。

2. 煅烧温度:样品在1350°C下煅烧6小时,然后在1460°C下烧结4小时。

X射线衍射(XRD)被用来确认成功掺杂并表征所得材料:

1. XRD图谱显示钽成功掺入Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格,形成单相化合物。

2. XRD分析表明所有样品具有立方钙钛矿结构。

3. 通过XRD数据计算晶格常数和体积,显示随钽含量增加而增大。

虽然文献没有讨论用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂,但它展示了如何使用XRD表征掺杂材料并确认掺杂剂成功掺入晶体结构。
