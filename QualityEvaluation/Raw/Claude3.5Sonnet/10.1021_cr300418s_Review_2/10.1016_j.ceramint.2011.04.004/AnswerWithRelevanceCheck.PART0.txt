          [1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "The starting materials are La2O3 with purity of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%, respectively. The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h."

[3] "After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient. The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at 1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol% hydrogen."

[4] "Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer."

[5] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

[6] "The lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A, which is in agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes increase."

[7] "Though tantalum doping can introduce more carriers, it also introduces scattering centers, especially at high doping level. With the increase of tantalum content, this strong scattering may become dominating factor for electron conduction, resulting in increase of electrical resistivity."

          The literature primarily describes the solid-state synthesis method for preparing Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 ceramics, but does not provide information on the impregnation method or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation. Therefore, a direct comparison between the two methods cannot be made based on this document alone.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics and performance in the solid-state synthesis include:

1. Dopant loading: The study examines different tantalum doping levels (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3. The tantalum content affects lattice constants, electrical resistivity, and thermoelectric properties.

2. Calcination temperature: The materials are calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours, then sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours. These high temperatures likely influence grain size and phase formation.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials:

1. XRD patterns show that tantalum is successfully doped into the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 lattice, forming a single-phase compound.
2. All samples exhibit a cubic perovskite structure.
3. Peak shifts in XRD patterns indicate lattice expansion with increasing tantalum content.
4. Lattice constants and volumes are calculated from XRD data, showing an increase with tantalum doping.

While the study doesn't discuss catalytic performance directly, it mentions that tantalum doping introduces more carriers but also scattering centers, especially at high doping levels. This affects electrical resistivity and could potentially influence catalytic properties.

Although the document doesn't provide information on copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, the principles of using XRD to confirm doping and characterize materials would be similar for other doped oxide systems.

          该文献主要描述了制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3陶瓷的固相合成方法，但没有提供关于浸渍法或用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的信息。因此，仅根据这份文档无法直接比较这两种方法。

在固相合成中影响结构特性和性能的关键因素包括：

1. 掺杂量：研究考察了Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3中不同的钽掺杂水平（x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05）。钽含量影响晶格常数、电阻率和热电性能。

2. 煅烧温度：材料在1350°C下煅烧6小时，然后在1460°C下烧结4小时。这些高温可能影响晶粒大小和相形成。

X射线衍射（XRD）被用来确认成功掺杂并表征所得材料：

1. XRD图谱显示钽成功掺入Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格，形成单相化合物。
2. 所有样品均呈现立方钙钛矿结构。
3. XRD图谱中的峰位移表明随着钽含量的增加晶格膨胀。
4. 从XRD数据计算出晶格常数和体积，显示随钽掺杂而增加。

虽然研究没有直接讨论催化性能，但提到钽掺杂引入了更多载流子，同时也引入了散射中心，特别是在高掺杂水平下。这影响了电阻率，也可能影响催化性能。

尽管文档没有提供关于用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的信息，但使用XRD确认掺杂和表征材料的原理对其他掺杂氧化物系统也是类似的。
