[1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "The starting materials are La2O3 with purity of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%, respectively. The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h."

[3] "After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient. The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at 1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol% hydrogen."

[4] "Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer."

[5] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

The literature describes the solid-state synthesis method for preparing Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 ceramics, but does not mention the impregnation method or copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation. Therefore, a direct comparison between the two methods cannot be made based on this document alone.

For the solid-state synthesis method:

1. Dopant loading: The study examines different tantalum doping levels (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3.

2. Calcination temperature: The materials are calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours, then sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours.

3. Structural characteristics: X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. The XRD patterns show that the tantalum-doped samples have the same structure as the undoped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicating that tantalum has been successfully incorporated into the lattice to form a single-phase compound.

4. Influence on properties: The study investigates how tantalum doping affects various thermoelectric properties, such as electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. However, catalytic performance is not discussed in this document.

XRD plays a crucial role in confirming successful doping by showing that the doped samples maintain the same crystal structure as the undoped sample, with slight shifts in peak positions due to lattice expansion caused by the incorporation of tantalum.

While this study provides insights into the solid-state synthesis method for doped oxide materials, it does not offer information on the impregnation method or copper-doped ceria catalysts, limiting the ability to make a comprehensive comparison between the two preparation techniques.

这篇文献描述了制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3陶瓷的固相合成方法，但没有提到浸渍法或用于CO氧化的铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂。因此，仅根据这份文档无法直接比较这两种方法。

对于固相合成法：

1. 掺杂量：研究考察了Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3中不同的钽掺杂水平（x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05）。

2. 煅烧温度：材料在1350°C下煅烧6小时，然后在1460°C下烧结4小时。

3. 结构特征：使用X射线衍射（XRD）来确认成功掺杂并表征所得材料。XRD图谱显示，掺钽样品与未掺杂的Sr0.9La0.1TiO3样品具有相同的结构，表明钽已成功掺入晶格形成单相化合物。

4. 对性能的影响：研究调查了钽掺杂如何影响各种热电性能，如电阻率、塞贝克系数、热导率和优值系数。但本文档中未讨论催化性能。

XRD在确认成功掺杂方面发挥了关键作用，它显示掺杂样品保持与未掺杂样品相同的晶体结构，峰位置由于钽的掺入导致晶格膨胀而略有偏移。

虽然这项研究提供了有关掺杂氧化物材料固相合成方法的见解，但它没有提供关于浸渍法或铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂的信息，这限制了对这两种制备技术进行全面比较的能力。
