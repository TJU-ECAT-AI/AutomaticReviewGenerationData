[1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "The raw materials are weighted in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient."

[3] "Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer."

[4] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

The literature does not directly compare solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials. However, it does provide information on the solid-state reaction technique used to prepare Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 samples.

For the solid-state synthesis method:

1. Raw materials are weighed in stoichiometric proportions and ball-milled in ethanol.
2. The mixture is dried, pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours.
3. The pellets are then crushed, ball-milled again, repressed, and sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours in an argon-hydrogen atmosphere.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics include:

1. Dopant loading: The study examines different tantalum concentrations (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05).
2. Calcination temperature: The samples undergo calcination at 1350°C and sintering at 1460°C.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials:

1. XRD patterns of doped samples (x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) are compared to the undoped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample.
2. The similarity in XRD patterns indicates that tantalum is successfully doped into the lattice, forming a single-phase compound.
3. XRD analysis reveals that all samples have a cubic perovskite structure.
4. Peak shifts in XRD patterns are used to determine changes in lattice constants and volumes with increasing tantalum content.

While the literature does not discuss copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, the principles of using XRD to confirm doping and characterize materials would be similar for other doped oxide systems.

文献没有直接比较制备掺杂氧化物材料的固态合成法和浸渍法。但是，它提供了使用固态反应技术制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3样品的信息。

对于固态合成法：

1. 按化学计量比称取原料，并在乙醇中球磨。
2. 混合物干燥后压制成片，在1350°C下煅烧6小时。
3. 然后将颗粒破碎，再次球磨，重新压制，并在氩-氢气氛中1460°C烧结4小时。

影响结构特性的关键因素包括：

1. 掺杂量：研究考察了不同的钽浓度（x = 0.00、0.01、0.03、0.05）。
2. 煅烧温度：样品在1350°C下煅烧，1460°C下烧结。

X射线衍射（XRD）用于确认成功掺杂并表征材料：

1. 将掺杂样品（x = 0.01、0.03、0.05）的XRD图谱与未掺杂的Sr0.9La0.1TiO3样品进行比较。
2. XRD图谱的相似性表明钽成功掺入晶格，形成单相化合物。
3. XRD分析表明所有样品具有立方钙钛矿结构。
4. 利用XRD图谱中的峰位移动来确定随钽含量增加的晶格常数和体积变化。

虽然文献没有讨论CO氧化铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂，但使用XRD确认掺杂和表征材料的原理对其他掺杂氧化物系统也是类似的。
