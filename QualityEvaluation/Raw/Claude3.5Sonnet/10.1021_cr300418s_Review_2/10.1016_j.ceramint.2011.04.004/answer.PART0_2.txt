[1] "Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique."

[2] "X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound."

[3] "The lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A, which is in agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes increase."

[4] "The formation of Ti3+ can be considered by Ta doping, using the KrogerVink notation as Sr0.9La0.1(Tax5+-Ti1xy4+Tiy3+)O3."

The literature does not directly compare solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods for preparing doped oxide materials. However, it does provide insights into the solid-state reaction technique used to prepare Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3 ceramics.

Key factors influencing structural characteristics in the solid-state method include:

1. Dopant loading: The study examined different tantalum concentrations (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05), which affected lattice parameters and crystal structure.

2. Calcination temperature: The samples were calcined at 1350°C for 6 hours, then sintered at 1460°C for 4 hours, which likely influenced grain size and phase formation.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials:

1. XRD patterns showed that tantalum was successfully doped into the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 lattice, forming a single-phase compound.

2. XRD revealed a cubic perovskite structure for all samples.

3. Peak shifts in XRD patterns indicated lattice expansion with increasing tantalum content.

4. Lattice constants and volumes were calculated from XRD data, showing an increase with tantalum doping.

While the study doesn't discuss catalytic performance or provide examples of copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, it does mention the formation of Ti3+ due to tantalum doping, which could potentially influence catalytic properties.

该文献并未直接比较制备掺杂氧化物材料的固态合成法和浸渍法。但是，它确实提供了使用固态反应技术制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3陶瓷的见解。

影响固态法结构特性的关键因素包括：

1. 掺杂量：研究考察了不同的钽浓度（x = 0.00、0.01、0.03、0.05），这影响了晶格参数和晶体结构。

2. 煅烧温度：样品在1350°C下煅烧6小时，然后在1460°C下烧结4小时，这可能影响了晶粒大小和相形成。

X射线衍射（XRD）被用来确认成功掺杂并表征材料：

1. XRD图谱显示钽成功掺入Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格，形成单相化合物。

2. XRD显示所有样品均为立方钙钛矿结构。

3. XRD图谱中的峰位移表明随着钽含量的增加晶格膨胀。

4. 从XRD数据计算出晶格常数和体积，显示随钽掺杂而增加。

虽然该研究没有讨论催化性能或提供铜掺杂氧化铈催化剂用于CO氧化的例子，但它确实提到了由于钽掺杂而形成Ti3+，这可能会影响催化性能。
