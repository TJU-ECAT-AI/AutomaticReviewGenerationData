Monolayer platinum supported on tungsten carbides as low-cost electrocatalysts: opportunities and limitations
The high cost and limited supply of platinum (Pt) represent barriers to large-scale commercial applications of several electrochemical devices that utilize Pt as electrocatalysts. In this Perspective we discuss opportunities to replace all but the top atomic layer, or monolayer (ML), of Pt with low-cost, Pt-like tungsten carbide (WC). These ML Pt-WC catalysts represent the lower limit of Pt loading, allowing for a significant decrease in Pt costs in devices such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental measurements indicate that the ML Pt-WC surface exhibits chemical and electronic properties that are very similar to bulk Pt for simple reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, although deviation in behavior is observed for more complex reactions such as the electrooxidation of methanol. In order to further improve the performance of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts and transfer knowledge gained from thin films to high surface area catalysts, a better understanding of the electronic, electrochemical, and catalytic properties of ML Pt-WC is needed. This Perspective provides an overview of these promising ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts and discusses approaches to overcoming limitations based on a better understanding of the Pt-WC interface and its behavior in electrochemical environments.

Broader context
Electrocatalysts are crucial components in clean-energy devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, and photoelectrochemical cells. By facilitating the catalytic conversion of reactants and fuels with minimal overpotential, or voltage losses, state-of the art electrocatalysts enable these devices to run at high efficiencies necessary to compete with conventional energy conversion methods that rely on nonrenewable fossil fuels. However, fuel cells and other low-temperature electrochemical devices currently rely heavily on expensive and scarce Pt-group metal catalysts, presenting a significant barrier to the mass production of these clean-technology devices. This Perspective describes the opportunities and limitations of a novel class of electrocatalysts based on supporting one atomic layer, or monolayer (ML), of Pt on low-cost, Pt-like transition metal carbides such as tungsten monocarbide (WC). By replacing bulk Pt-group metal electrocatalysts with ML Pt-WC, the loading of Pt used in electrochemical devices can be substantially reduced, making clean energy technology more competitive with conventional carbon-emitting energy conversion processes.
I. Introduction
Fuel cells,1 electrolyzers,2 and photoelectrochemical cells3 are electrochemical devices that are commonly touted as core technologies in a clean energy future. Central to the operation of all of these devices are catalysts, more specifically electrocatalysts, which mediate charge transfer processes between the electrolyte and device electrodes with minimal losses in efficiency. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art catalysts used in the aforementioned technologies are comprised of expensive Pt-group metals (Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Pd). The high prices and limited supplies of these precious metals create potentially prohibitive barriers to market penetration and scale-up production of devices requiring large catalyst loadings for efficient operation.4,5 For example, it was estimated that the loading of commonly-used Pt catalysts in a hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) vehicle must be decreased five-fold from the 2005 levels while maintaining performance to achieve large-scale automotive application.6
In order to overcome this barrier to large-scale commercialization of the aforementioned electrochemical devices, many approaches have been taken to decrease or eliminate the loading of precious metals that are currently required for efficient operation. One of the commonly pursued approaches is the development of several classes of low-cost non-precious metal electrocatalysts, including multi-metallic and metal/nonmetal materials (oxides, carbides, sulfides, and nitrides). Although the majority of these attempts have been limited in success, one of the most exciting discoveries in the past 40 years was the finding of Levy and Boudart that low-cost tungsten carbide phases exhibit Pt-like catalytic properties for several reactions that were previously only known to be catalyzed by Pt-group metals.7 Since the discovery of the Pt-like properties of tungsten monocarbide (WC), tungsten carbides (WxC) and related transition metal carbides (TMC) have been extensively investigated, although the instability of TMCs has limited their use in many applications. To date, many review articles812 and book sections13 have focused on TMCs and the potential to use them as replacements for precious metal catalysts through a more thorough understanding of their stability and catalytic activity. In this Perspective, we focus on WC and the potential to use it as a support for one atomic layer, or monolayer (ML), of Pt for use in electrochemical applications. Although Pt is still utilized, this ML Pt-WC electrocatalyst structure approaches the lower limit of Pt loading. Other ML-supported Pt electrocatalysts with core-shell configuration have attracted much attention in recent years,14 but the vast majority of research to date has focused on supporting ML Pt with other precious metals. By using a low cost support material such as WC, the ML Pt-WC structure offers great potential to drive down catalyst costs for various clean technology devices.
This Perspective is organized as follows. In the remainder of Section I, motivation for developing ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts is discussed and the benefits of using single-phase WC thin films for these studies are presented. In Section II, the electrochemical behavior of WC across wide ranges of potential and pH is reviewed, followed by three case studies of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts in Section III. In Section IV, opportunities and challenges associated with replacement of bulk Pt with ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts are discussed. Additionally, a general approach for developing ML metal electrocatalysts supported on TMCs is described.
1.1 Monolayer Pt-WC as a pathway towards low-cost electrocatalysis
The limited demonstration of replacing Pt by TMCs such as WC is largely due to the fact that their Pt-like catalytic properties have only been observed for a limited number of catalytic reaction systems, and in some systems the catalytic activity and stability of WC are much lower than the Pt catalysts.7,11 One explanation for these findings is that WC has similar bulk electronic properties to Pt, but there is notable deviation in electronic properties at the WC surface. These differences in surface electronic properties, which ultimately determine how a surface interacts with reactants, are small enough to translate into similar catalytic behavior for some reaction systems, but not for others. Over the past decade, our research group has attempted to overcome the short-comings of pure WC catalysts by modifying the WC surface with ML amounts of Pt.1520 The hypothesis is that replacement of all but the top ML of bulk Pt catalysts with an electronically similar Pt-like WC core will result in a ML Pt-WC surface that should have electronic and catalytic properties more similar to Pt than WC. The significance of this concept is that it predicts that ML Pt-WC will exhibit catalytic activity that is comparable, though not identical, to bulk Pt catalysts while making full use of every Pt atom. A further expectation that follows from the similar electronic properties of Pt and WC is that they should intuitively result in good adhesion between the Pt ML and WC surface, suppressing any tendency for the Pt ML to agglomerate into bulk Pt particles that would lead to a reduction in catalytic activity.
The tremendous potential to decrease Pt loading by utilizing ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts is shown in Fig. 1, where the cost of a planar Pt electrocatalyst is estimated as a function of the Pt overlayer thickness. For example, Fig. 1 shows that a reduction of Pt film thickness from 10 nm to 1 ML provides more than an order of magnitude reduction in associated Pt cost. Such a large reduction in Pt loading, without compromising catalytic activity, may overcome the barriers in catalyst cost in commercial applications. Although Fig. 1 depicts planar electrode materials for illustrative purposes, the ML Pt-WC core-shell concept and projected cost savings can be extended to particulate and mesoporous catalyst structures.19

In order to probe the electronic similarities of ML Pt-WC and bulk Pt catalysts, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to determine the binding energies of reactant molecules that are relevant to key electrochemical applications. In Table 1, the binding energies for atomic hydrogen (relevant to HFC and water electrolysis), atomic oxygen (relevant to cathode reaction of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, or PEMFC), and methoxy (relevant to the direct methanol fuel cell, or DMFC) are presented for Pt(111), W-terminated WC(0001), and ML Pt-WC(0001). These binding energies are chemical descriptors that directly reflect the electronic properties of each surface and are well correlated with electrocatalytic activity. In all three reaction systems, it is desirable for a catalyst to bond the reactive intermediate with moderate strength, a fundamental concept in catalysis known as Sabatier's Principle that leads to a volcano relationship between catalytic activity and binding energy.21 Previous work has also shown that the hydrogen,22oxygen,23 and methoxy24 binding energies all depend strongly on the electronic structure of the surface as described by the surface d-band density of states (DOS). It is well known that the distribution of the surface d-band DOS, approximated by the d-band center, plays a crucial role in determining how a surface interacts with adsorbed atoms and molecules.25,26 This link between electronic structure and chemical binding energy descriptors is thus very useful for predicting and explaining catalytic activity.
Table 1 DFT-calculated binding energies for 1/9 ML of atomic hydrogen (HBE), oxygen (OBE), and methoxy on WC, Pt, and ML Pt-WC surfaces. All DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), and binding energies correspond to the most stable adsorption site for each surface. More details can be found in references provided in the table
Surface Binding Energy (kcal/mol)
Hydrogen 19 Oxygen 27 Methoxy20
WC(0001) 25.1 173.2 74.0
Pt(111) 10.8 91.7 34.9
1 ML Pt-WC(0001) 10.1 92.9 49.5
The values in Table 1 show that the bare WC(0001) surface binds all three adsorbates much more strongly than Pt(111), but modification of the WC(0001) surface with 1 ML of Pt shifts all three binding energies to values that are more similar to Pt. For the most simple adsorbates, hydrogen and oxygen, the calculated binding energies on ML Pt-WC(0001) are nearly identical to Pt(111), while it is seen that there is still a notable difference in the binding energy of the slightly more complex methoxy intermediate. The consequence of this difference are discussed further in Section 3.3, but for now it is suffice to emphasize that DFT calculations indicate that the ML Pt-WC and bulk Pt surfaces exhibit very similar binding energies for some simple molecules that are often useful descriptors to correlate electronic structure to catalytic properties. In Section 4.1, opportunities to better understand the electronic properties of WC and ML Pt-WC surfaces are discussed, with the hope that such knowledge will guide researchers in identifying and developing more active, stable ML metal-TMC surfaces.
1.2 Tungsten carbide thin films: A platform for optimizing ML Pt-WC catalysts
Although DFT calculations predict that ML Pt-WC surfaces should show catalytic properties similar to Pt for a variety of reactions, it is important to recognize that real catalyst surfaces can be very different from the ideal model surfaces used in DFT calculations. Tungsten carbides in particular have proven to be a class of challenging materials to work with in practice due to complications related to (i) phase purity, (ii) surface termination (W- or C-), (iii) surface oxides, (iv) surface carbon, (v) surface defects, and (vi) surface roughness/area. Not only do these factors influence the catalytic activity of WC, but it is also likely that they have a strong influence on the interaction between the WC surface and supported Pt atoms or particles. Being able to decouple the influences of these six variables is of utmost importance for understanding and optimizing the catalytic performance of WxC and Pt-WxC catalysts. In order to achieve this goal, it is useful to focus research efforts on the electrochemical and catalytic behavior of smooth, single phase WxC thin films with well-controlled surface properties. In addition to allowing for comparable surface roughness/area, thin film samples are well-suited for electrochemical and surface science measurements, and permit well-controlled line-of-sight Pt deposition techniques to be used. As will be illustrated in Sections III and IV, focusing research efforts on this thin-film platform allows for systematic investigation on the influence of ML Pt on the catalytic properties of WC.
The first step to synthesizing single-phase, well-controlled tungsten carbide (WxC) thin films is to understand the WC phase diagram. As discussed in literature,28 single-phase WxC thin films are generally made by reacting a metallic W or W-containing precursor with a carbon-containing species at elevated temperatures. While the hexagonal WC phase is favored at high temperature (>800 C) and carbon-rich conditions, hexagonal W2C is commonly observed at intermediate temperatures and low-carbon conditions, and cubic WC1x is known to predominate at low/intermediate temperatures and carbon-rich conditions.29,30 When an oxygen-containing species is present, the formation of tungsten oxycarbide species is possible as well.31,32 Achieving synthesis of single-phase WxC catalysts can be challenging, and requires a careful balance between carburization temperature, CxHy/H2 ratio, and several other parameters depending on the exact synthesis route. Indeed, many studies on WxC catalysts in literature have been conducted on WxC phase mixtures, but there are several different thin film synthesis techniques that can be used to make single-phase WC, W2C, and WC1x thin films. These techniques are summarized in Table 2, where substrate limitations, previously attained WxC phases, and appropriate references are provided for additional information. In Fig. 2a, glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns for single-phase WC and W2C thin films deposited by magnetron deposition are shown. The synthesis of single-phase samples is critical for elucidating the intrinsic activities of WxC-supported Pt catalysts, as the electrochemical stability33 and catalytic behavior34,35 of WC, W2C, and WC1x have been shown to be very different. In Fig. 2b, representative SEM images of magnetron deposited WC and W2C surfaces are provided, showing the relatively flat morphology of these thin films that make them very useful for fundamental studies of ML-supported surfaces.

In addition to synthesizing WxC catalysts that are single-phase, maintaining proper surface W:C stoichiometry is of utmost importance since the surface is where the subsequent electrochemistry will take place. Because the majority of WxC synthesis methods require the presence of gas phase CxHy species, such as methane or ethylene, an inherent problem in many procedures is the build-up of excess surface carbon.44 Studies on the influence of surface carbon on WxC catalysis generally show that surface carbon is detrimental to catalytic activity.4548 However, proper synthesis procedures have been shown to be very effective at producing WxC surfaces that are nearly free of excess surface carbon.44,49 Even if a clean WC surface is obtained without excess surface carbon, the question of surface termination remains. It is believed that W-termination is favored for the polar WC(0001) crystal plane,50 which is commonly modeled in DFT studies, but experimental evidence has pointed towards mixed C- and W-termination.51 Furthermore, surface termination is likely to vary with the crystal plane, synthesis conditions, and post-synthesis surface treatment.
Another important consideration for the WxC surfaces is the presence or absence of surface oxides, which will readily form on a WxC surface that is exposed to gas phase O2 or atmospheric conditions for any significant amount of time.33,40,44,52 As discussed below, oxide species can also be formed with relative ease at oxidizing potentials in an electrochemical environment.53 Modification of WxC electrocatalysts through oxide formation at the electrolyte interface has been reported to enhance catalytic activity for some electrochemical reactions11,35and suppress activity for others.35 The influence of oxide formation on the WxC stability and activity is often quite complex, with the type of WxOy species formed being dependent on the WxC synthesis method, electrochemical pre-conditioning, and electrode operating conditions.11 In Section II, the influence of operating pH and applied potential on oxide formation and stability of the WC surface will be discussed. Overall, the electrochemical stability and catalytic activity depend on the stoichiometry of the WxC surfaces, as well as on the phase purity of the WxC bulk. Although there is also potential for W2C and WC1x phases to find utilization as electrocatalysts, the remainder of this Perspective will focus on the electrochemical activity, stability, and applications of WC and ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts.
For the case studies of ML Pt-WC thin films to be discussed in Section III, approximately one ML of Pt was deposited on a thin film WC substrate by physical evaporation of Pt from Pt wire wrapped around a resistively heated filament.19 Deposition by this means is a line-of-sight process that is performed in a vacuum environment and affords good control of the amount of Pt deposited due to the slow deposition rates. Physical evaporation of an overlayer metal using a thermal filament is commonly employed for the deposition of MLs in surface science experiments, although other techniques are available as well.54 For the deposition of an overlayer with ML thickness, it is very important to perform proper characterization with surface science techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to determine whether the deposition proceeds in a layer-by-layer or 3-D growth mechanism.55 For detailed overviews of experimental techniques commonly used to characterize ML overlayers in bimetallic surfaces, the reader is referred to literature.54,55 The growth mechanism of the overlayer depends on the chemical nature of the substrate and overlayer, and several deposition parameters.54 Recent AES18 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)19 studies have shown that Pt deposition on the WC thin films by thermal evaporation proceeds by a layer-by-layer growth mechanism.
II. Electrochemical stability of tungsten carbide
An important first step in the development of any electrocatalyst is to investigate the electrochemical stability of that material in the expected operating environment for a given application. For numerous materials, Pourbaix Diagrams56 can serve as useful guides for predicting stability under the expected pH and electrochemical potential (E) conditions. The Pourbaix Diagram shows the thermodynamically stable phase of a given material in an aqueous environment as a function of pH and E, allowing for quick estimation of material stability at expected operating conditions. Although Pourbaix Diagrams do not exist for many multi-component materials for which corrosion mechanisms are complicated or unknown, one can experimentally establish E-pH regions of stability with relative ease through various electroanalytical techniques. In Fig. 3a, the approximate E-pH regions of stability for WC, determined from chronopotentiometric titration measurements,37 are shown at room temperature in a simple aqueous supporting electrolyte consisting of SO42, PO42, and Na+ ions. Although this E-pH diagram differs slightly from the E-pH and Pourbaix Diagrams for metallic W,37,57WC is seen to exhibit three general regions of stability that roughly mirror those of W: (Region I) a region of stability at negative potentials, (Region II) a region of passivation centered at low pH and moderately oxidizing potentials in which the surface layers of WC are oxidized into stable WxOy(s) surface species, and (Region III) a region of instability at positive potentials and neutral to alkaline pH, in which WC undergoes successive oxidation and dissolution to form tungstate species. For more in-depth analyses of the corrosion behavior of WxC electrocatalysts, the reader is referred to the following sources for applications in acidic,33,36,37,53,5860 neutral,35,37,61 and alkaline conditions.37
Fig. 3 a.) Approximate E-pH regions of stability of WC as determined from chronopotentiometric titration measurements in a deaerated H2SO4 / NaOH supporting electrolyte at room temperature. b.) Approximate E-pH regions of operation for several low-temperature electrochemical energy applications.
It is important to note that the degree of stability/instability of WC within each of the regions outlined above will vary depending on the exact location within that region, and the borders of each region are likely to depend on temperature, electrolytic species, dissolved gases, electrode surface pre-treatment, contaminants, and the presence of metal overlayers. Nonetheless, this E-pH diagram can serve as a very useful initial guide for matching WC to an appropriate application or altering electrolyte conditions to improve WC stability. In Fig. 3b, approximate E-pH regions of operation for electrode materials in HFCs, direct alcoholfuel cells (DAFC) and electrolysis cells (cathode only) are shown, along with the reversible hydrogen (EoH2/H+) and oxygen (EoH2O/O2) potentials. A comparison of Fig. 3a and 3b can be used as an initial guide for predicting stability of WC for specific electrochemical applications. Based on Fig. 3, WC should generally be avoided as a potential catalyst for DAFC anode or HFC cathode at neutral and alkaline pH values (Region III). However, WC can be expected to exhibit good stability for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at all pH values (Region I), and potentially as a DAFC anode and HFC cathode at low pH (Region II).
As mentioned above, there are many variables besides E and pH that can influence the stability of WC. For these reasons, Fig. 3 is not meant to be used strictly. Among these influences is the presence of ML amounts of an overlayer metal such as Pt, which has been shown to increase the range of passivation for WC in acidic environments by up to 0.2 V.36 It has been speculated that the source of this enhanced stability is bonding between Pt and W at WC defect sites, where the under-coordinated nature of W atoms normally makes them more susceptible to oxidation.62 However, this hypothesis has not been proven, and more detailed investigation of this interesting finding could be very valuable for successful development of Pt-WC catalysts that operate in the passivated region (Region II) of the E-pH diagram in Fig. 3a.
Although an understanding of the electrochemical stability of bulk WC is useful, the greater concern is stability of the combined ML Pt-WC structure. Pure Pt is known to be one of the most noble, oxidation-resistant metals, but there are other influences besides the dissolution of Pt that can degrade ML Pt electrocatalysts. As described in a review article on degradation of Pt electrocatalysts,63 other concerns include coalescence of Pt atoms into particles through Ostwald ripening and the detachment of Pt from the substrate surface. Both of these degradation mechanisms originate from poor bonding between Pt and the support material, leading to loss of active Pt surface area and a corresponding decrease in catalytic activity. There has been strong evidence for both of these loss mechanisms contributing to the loss of active surface area of Pt nanoparticles supported on commonly used carbon supports.64 In studies of Pt particles supported on WC, significantly better stability has been observed compared to similar loadings of Pt particles supported on C.65,66 These findings are encouraging results for the stability of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts, since the greater stability of Pt particles on WC is likely to arise from good adhesion/bonding between the Pt atoms and the WC support. Consistent with this finding, recent DFT results have indicated strong bonding between ML Pt and the WC substrate.67
III. Case studies of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts
In this section, we present three case studies on the use of thin film WC and ML Pt-WC surfaces in acidic conditions, where the vast majority of research efforts on WC have been focused to date. This emphasis on acidic electrolytes arises from the acidic nature of Nafion-based PEMs and the ability of WC to passivate in acidic conditions, although breakthroughs in anion exchange membranes may warrant investigation in alkaline solutions in the future. In recent years, neutral electrolytes have also gained attention for their potential application in biological fuel cells. For each case study presented below, the stability and catalytic behavior of the WC and ML Pt-WC surfaces are discussed, highlighting the potential advantages and limitations of using ML Pt-WC catalysts.
3.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
The HER is a cathodic reaction that produces H2(g) during water electrolysis and is one of the most fundamental and commonly studied electrochemical reactions. It is thus an excellent probe reaction for studying novel catalysts, but also of great importance for electrochemical hydrogen generation. As discussed below, the use of ML Pt-WC for HER applications also shows great promise because instability of the catalyst arising from electrochemical oxidation is unlikely at the negative operating potentials of a HER cathode.
According to the DFT results of hydrogen binding energies (HBE) in Table 1, WC is expected to bind hydrogen too strongly to be a good HER catalyst, while ML Pt-WC is expected to behave similarly to bulk Pt. To test these predictions, the HER activity of sub-ML to ML amounts of Pt on WC thin films was compared to a Pt foil sample by carrying out linear sweep voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4 at room temperature. The results of these measurements are presented in the form of Tafel curves in Fig. 4a, showing the electrochemical overpotential at each electrode surface as a function of current density. From the kinetically limited linear portion of these curves, the exchange current density for each surface, io, was obtained as a measure of HER activity and plotted against Pt coverage in Fig. 4b. From both Fig. 4a and 4b, it is clear that the HER activity of the WC surface is far less than that of the Pt foil, but the addition of one ML of Pt to WC results in a surface with HER activity comparable to the bulk Pt foil. This finding is in excellent agreement with DFT predictions based on the expected correlation between HBE and HER activity, and demonstrates the great potential of ML Pt-WC to drastically decrease Pt loading for the HER application.

HER exchange current density (io) as a function of Pt coverage on WC thin film. c.) XPS W 4f peaks of WC and 1 ML Pt-WC following HER measurements compared to that of a clean WC surface. All peaks are attributed to WC, including W 4f peaks at 31.8 and 33.9 eV, and a small W 5p3/2 peak at 37.2 eV.
From a stability standpoint, the negative electrochemical potentials encountered in HER applications are favorable because neither the oxidation of Pt or WC is likely at these potentials. Generally, Pt oxidation is not observed below +0.85 V relative to the reversible hydrogen potential,64 reflecting the noble character of Pt. Although the potential window between EoH+/H2 and the onset of oxidation of WC is not nearly as large as for Pt, Fig. 3a shows that the extent of oxidation on the WC surface should be very limited, if not completely absent, during HER operation. Evidence of the resistance of ML Pt-WC and WC to oxidation under HER conditions has been verified by XPS measurements (Fig. 4c), where the W 4f features measured following HER measurements can be attributed solely to carbidic W. The W 4f features arising from W-oxide species would appear at higher binding energies,36 but are not present in Fig. 4c. The XPS measurements in Fig. 4c were recorded after short-term HER measurements, but demonstration of HER stability tests over extended periods of time is required for further development of ML Pt-WC HER catalysts. Given the high electrocatalytic activity towards the HER and promising stability of ML Pt-WC catalysts under negative potentials, ML Pt-WC is immediately appealing for HER applications.
3.2 Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
The ORR is of great importance to both hydrogen and direct alcohol PEMFCs, in which the reduction of O2 serves as the cathodic reaction. The development of active, low-cost ORR catalysts has been a very active area of research because the overpotential losses associated with the kinetically difficult ORR represent the largest efficiency loss in PEMFCs.6 Coupled to the challenge of developing active ORR catalysts is that of developing a catalyst that is stable in the relatively harsh operating conditions for the ORR. In a PEM HFC, the ORR catalyst at the cathode can be expected to experience typical operating and open circuit voltages of around +0.75 and +0.95 V NHE, respectively.64 In accelerated potential cycling tests performed on the cathode of a PEMFC MEA assembly, it has been reported that conventional carbon-supported Pt particles lose nearly 2/3 of their active surface area over the course of 10,000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V NHE,64 underscoring the drastic need for improved ORR catalyst/support combinations. Previous studies have identified the combination of Pt, WC (and/or W2C), and C as a promising composite catalyst for the ORR,10,6871 but no systematic study of ML Pt-WC for the ORR has been reported to date.
According to the DFT-calculated oxygen binding energy (OBE) values in Table 1, and based on the previously established correlation between OBE and ORR activity,72 unmodified WC is expected to bond to atomic oxygen too strongly while ML Pt-WC is predicted to show ORR activity that is similar to bulk Pt. For testing the ORR activity of ML Pt-WC in a rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration, Pt was deposited onto a carburized W disk having a single-phase WC thin film at its surface. In Fig. 5a, linear sweep voltammograms conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 for WC, ML Pt-WC, and Pt are shown. As expected, the WC disk displays no ORR activity, but the ML Pt-WC surface unexpectedly exhibits ORR activity that is significantly below that of bulk Pt. The ORR onset potential for ML Pt-WC is nearly 0.3 V more negative than that of bulk Pt, and the observed limiting ORR current is seen to be about half that of Pt. The later finding suggests that O2 is only partially reduced to the undesired H2O2 product, meaning that only 2 e are extracted per O2.
Fig. 5 a.) ORR polarization curves obtained for WC, ML Pt-WC, and bulk Pt disks in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 and using a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. b.) XPS W 4f peaks of WC and 1 ML Pt-WC thin films following 25 CV cycles between 0.0 and 1.0 V NHE in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. For ease of comparison all W 4f spectra have been normalized to the peak height of the W 4f7/2 peak of a clean WC surface.
The origin of the poor ORR activity of ML Pt-WC can likely be linked to the instability of WC when operated under the strongly oxidizing conditions of an ORR cathode. In Fig. 5b, XPS W 4f spectra are shown for WC and ML Pt-WC thin films following 15 cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans between +0.0 and +1.0 V vs.NHE in O2-saturated H2SO4. In contrast to XPS taken following HER measurements, large W 4f peaks at 35.9 and 38.0 eV, characteristic of WO3, are observed on both WC and ML Pt-WC, revealing that the WC surface is quickly oxidized when exposed to an O2saturated solution at such positive potentials. Consistent with this finding, the Pt 4f/ W 4f atomic signal ratio was observed to decrease 30% during potential cycling, indicating that a portion of the Pt ML is either dissolved or coalesced into Pt particles. The coalescence of Pt atoms into particles and/or the formation of W-oxides beneath the Pt layer will undoubtedly yield a Pt catalyst with significantly different electronic properties than the ML Pt-WC surface, leading to poor ORR activity. Although the exact mechanism for the low ORR activity of ML Pt-WC is not known at this time, it is clear that the strongly oxidizing conditions of the ORR would lead to marked instability in WC-supported ML Pt.
3.3 Methanoloxidation reaction (MOR)
The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is a limiting reaction step in DMFCs, which show promise for portable power applications because methanol can be easily stored and transported as a liquid at room temperature. However, technical hurdles remain for the large scale commercialization of the DMFC technology. Two of the main challenges associated with the anode electrocatalysts are (i) the high cost of Pt and Ru, which are the leading DMFC electrocatalysts, and (ii) the strong binding of carbon monoxide (CO) on Pt, which blocks active sites necessary for the electrooxidation of methanol and contribute to the sluggish kinetics at the anode. The ML Pt-WC thin films have been explored as a low-cost and CO-tolerant alternative catalyst for DMFCs.1517,62
In Fig. 6ac), cyclic voltammograms (CV) for WC, Pt, and 0.8 ML Pt-WC surfaces in 0.2 M methanol and 0.05 M H2SO4 are provided, showing that all three surfaces are active to methanol oxidation. However, chronoamperometry (CA) measurements (Fig. 6e), performed to compare the steady-state electrochemical activity of these surfaces, reveal that the steady-state methanol oxidation current on the Pt foil is significantly lower than that on the WC and the ML Pt-WC surfaces. Comparing the activity trend in Fig. 6e with the binding energies of methoxy in Table 1, it is clear that the latter is not a good descriptor for the activity of methanol electrooxidation. The low electrochemical activity on the Pt foil is at least partially attributed to surface poisoning by strongly bonded CO reaction intermediate. Corresponding surface science experiments have found that the desorption temperature of CO is much higher on Pt than on WC or ML Pt-WC.73 The weaker binding energy of CO on WC and ML Pt-WC likely facilitates the oxidation of CO by surface OH species to produce CO2, thus increasing the availability of active sites as compared to Pt. The improved CO tolerance of WC and ML Pt-WC, combined with a lower onset potential for methanol electrooxidation,17 is responsible for the higher steady-state current. Recent DFT calculations of CO binding energies, performed on Pt(111) and ML Pt-WC(0001) slabs, have also supported this finding of weaker CO binding by ML Pt-WC.67

The electrochemical stability of WC and Pt-WC surfaces under methanol oxidation conditions was determined using XPS to probe the W 4f oxidation state of WC before and after the CV measurements. These measurements were performed without exposing the surfaces to air, using a combined UHV/half-cell experimental set-up36 to study the susceptibility of WC and Pt-WC surfaces to electrochemical oxidation. Fig. 6f shows the W 4f region of the WC and Pt-WC surfaces after 100 CV cycles carried out in 0.05 M H2SO4 and 0.2 M CH3OH while cycling between 0.0 and 1.0 V (NHE). In contrast to XPS results taken after HER measurements (Fig. 4), the W 4f of the WC surface exhibits distinct peaks of oxidized W at 35.9 and 38.0 eV following CV cycles. However, the oxide features detected from the ML Pt-WC surface are very weak, indicating that the presence of Pt enhances the stability of WC under DMFC conditions. Overall, the results in Fig. 6 reveal that ML Pt-WC has higher electrooxidation activity than Pt and higher stability than WC, demonstrating a synergistic effect from supporting ML Pt on WC for the anodic oxidation of methanol.
IV. Challenges and opportunities
In this final section, we discuss several key challenges to commercialization of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts and opportunities for overcoming these challenges.
4.1 Elucidating the electronic properties of ML Pt-WC surfaces
The central hypothesis behind the effectiveness of ML Pt-WC catalysts is that the electronic properties of one ML Pt supported on WC are similar to those of bulk Pt, resulting in a stable structure with similar, though not identical, chemical and electrocatalytic properties. In the interest of proving/disproving this hypothesis and improving catalytic performance, it is desirable to gain a better understanding of the electronic structure of ML Pt-WC through a combination of theoretical calculations and direct experimental measurements of the valence and conduction band DOSs of well-defined ML Pt-WC, WC, and Pt surfaces. Ever since Levy and Boudart's landmark paper on the Pt-like properties of TMCs such as WC,7 numerous studies have sought to understand the similarities of TMCs and Pt on the basis of their electronic properties.50,7479 Although there has been some debate on specific aspects of the electronic structure of TMCs, it is generally agreed that the valence DOS of many TMCs can be described by covalent bonding between hybridized C 2p and metal d electrons at low-lying energies and metallic bonding between d-orbital electrons located near the Fermi level.50,76 Besides covalent bonding between C and W, another key influence on the electronic structure of WC is the expansion of the WC lattice compared to metallic W. As with other TMCs, this expansion results in an increase in the WW bond length, leading to a contraction of the W d-band width80 and a greater d-band DOS near the Fermi level.8 In many TMCs, this increase in DOS with metallic character near the Fermi level is believed to give rise to some of the similarities in the catalytic properties of TMCs and Pt.10,76
DFT calculations offer an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between Pt, WC, and ML Pt-WC surfaces. By using quantum mechanical modeling to analyze the electronic properties of model surfaces, DFT can be used to estimate the surface DOS and partial DOS (PDOS), the binding energies of various adsorbates of interest, and the relative stability of various catalyst configurations. DFT-based studies of surface properties of WC8186 and WC-supported ML metals20,24,67,87 have shown great promise for providing new insights into the chemical and electronic properties of these surfaces. Recently, the general similarities and differences in the PDOS of closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111), WC(0001) and ML Pt/WC(0001) were investigated.19 Comparing to that of Pt(111), the surface PDOS of WC(0001) is much closer to the Fermi level. Upon the addition of one ML Pt on WC, the surface PDOS of ML Pt/WC(0001) is shifted away from the Fermi level and becomes similar to that of Pt(111). This general similarity in the surface PDOS of Pt(111) and ML Pt/WC(0001) is most likely responsible for the similar binding energies of atomic hydrogen and oxygen reported in Table 1.
To date, the vast majority of catalysis-motivated DFT studies have investigated simple model surfaces with a limited number of atomic layers, due in part to the high computational cost of modeling more complex surface structures. These studies on model surfaces have proven useful for studies of many different catalytic materials and reactions, but for structure-sensitive reactions taking place on defect-covered surfaces or nano-structured catalysts with many under-coordinated sites, model terrace sites may be irrelevant compared to defect sites.88 Fortunately, advances in computing technology and DFT methodology continue to yield vastly improved DFT capabilities such that studies of more complicated planar surfaces, defect sites, and particle geometries are becoming more common. For example, the vast majority of DFT studies on WC have focused on the closed-packed WC(0001) surface due to computational ease compared to other crystal faces, but a recent publication by Liet al. presents DFT-calculated DOS of all low-index WC surfaces.86 In a separate study, the electronic properties of WC nanoparticles have recently been investigated.85 Extension of these studies to ML Pt on WC structures with different planes and defect sites will be of great use for gaining a better understanding of more complicated structures that are likely to be encountered on real catalyst surfaces.
Experimentally, the most appropriate techniques for investigation of the electronic properties of the ML Pt-WC surface are ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy. These techniques allow one to probe the DOS of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, near the Fermi level. Several UPS studies of the WC surface have already been performed51,74,89 and will be important references for studies of ML Pt-WC surfaces. However, there are numerous difficulties associated with attaining meaningful results from UPS studies of the ML Pt-WC surface, including separation of DOS signal originating from bulk and surface layers, deconvolution of d- and p-state contributions from different elements, understanding the influence of adsorbate interactions, and preparing samples with homogenous, well-characterized composition and structure. These techniques are best suited for use with well-defined single crystal surfaces, but results can be much more difficult to compare to theory for non-ideal reconstructed or polycrystalline surfaces.50 All of the complexities listed above make direct observation of valence and conduction states challenging, but carefully designed photoemission experiments complemented by DFT calculations and chemical probe reaction measurements such as temperature programmed desorption should provide invaluable insight into the electronic and chemical properties of the ML Pt-WC surface.
Successful elucidation of the electronic properties of well-defined ML Pt-WC structures should provide opportunities for the further improvement and tuning of Pt-WC catalysts. In various synthesis techniques, it may be inherent for various interlayers (X) such as carbon, WxOy, WC1x, or W2C to form between the Pt ML and the WC substrate (Pt-X-WC). These sandwich structures would most likely behave differently from ML Pt-WC, potentially giving a perturbed electronic structure that may be more suitable for specific electrocatalytic applications. Recently, a DFT study was conducted on the influence of excess surface carbon layers on the HBE of WC(0001),83 suggesting that control of the amount of excess carbon on the WC surface may provide a means to tune its HBE. However, experimental work has not yet been performed to verify the DFT predications. DFT is a powerful tool, but is most effective when it can be used in conjunction with experimental techniques, as recently demonstrated in the DFT prediction and experimental verification of reaction networks of methanol on ML Pt-WC.24 To this end, the single-phase WC and W2C thin films described in this review provide an excellent platform for studying the influence of interlayers such as C and WxOy on the electronic properties of the WC and ML Pt-WC surfaces. Knowledge gained from these studies may allow for rational design of interfacial configurations and modification of synthesis procedures for making mesoporous and particulate ML Pt-WC structures with desired electronic properties.
4.2 Development of high surface area, non-planar Pt-WC core-shell catalysts
Although the utilization of WC and ML Pt-WC thin films allows one to directly compare the surface characterization and electrochemical performance of these materials in a half-cell system, it is necessary to develop ML Pt-WC core-shell catalysts with high specific surface area (As, in m2 g1) for most real-world applications. High values of As are required for high current density applications, while the mesoporous and non-continuous particulate catalyst structures needed to achieve high As also allow for fuel transport between anode and cathode in PEM-type devices. However, there are several challenges that must be overcome in order to successfully synthesize such high surface area core-shell structures. These challenges include, but are not limited to, (i) synthesis of WC nanoparticles/structures with high As, (ii) deposition of a uniform ML of Pt on non-planar substrates, and (iii) achieving adequate control of the Pt-WC interface configurations.
The synthesis of small WC particles, necessary for large As, is a challenge that has been commonly encountered in the development of WC catalyst supports.66 The challenge of synthesizing WC with high As arises because the formation of single-phase WC requires high temperature conditions (800 C or higher depending on conditions44), under which there is a strong driving force for smaller particles/structures to agglomerate into larger ones. Most traditional routes for synthesizing single-phase WC particles give powder catalysts with As values below 30 m2 g1, which is significantly less than that of 230 m2 g1 seen for the commercially available Vulcan carbon black XC-72R support.90 Several papers have reported the synthesis of WC powders with surface areas comparable to carbon supports,70,71,91 but most of these report the production of mixed phase WC/W2C/WC1xcatalysts and/or the surface composition of the particle surfaces is either unknown or covered in carbon. In many cases, high surface area WC with small particle sizes is only obtained if it is synthesized as a composite material on a secondary support material such as carbon.11 Such a composite material may still be used for ML Pt-WC structures as long as the Pt can be preferentially deposited on the WC particles. Energy dispersive spectroscopy has been used to clearly show that Pt deposited on a WxC/C catalyst support by a standard NaBH4reduction method preferentially bonds to WxC over C.92 More detailed descriptions of synthesis of high surface area WC or W2C nanoparticles71,9395 and mesoporous structures91,9699 can be found in literature.
Despite the added difficulty of synthesizing single-phase WC with high surface area, it should be noted that the As of the support does not necessarily need to be large if a ML core-shell structure is obtained, with the surfaces of the core-shell being completely coated by ML Pt. For typical PEMFC electrode with support As of 200 m2 g1 and Pt catalyst specific surface area of 70 m2 g1,64 only 1520% of the support surface area is actually covered by catalyst if one assumes a typical 50 weight % Pt/C loading64 and that the contact area between the Pt and C is half of the catalyst surface area. Thus, a WC support with 100% of its surface covered by one ML of the active catalyst phase only requires 1/5 of the original surface area in order to maintain a constant specific surface area for the active catalyst.
Deposition of ML Pt on mesoporous and particulate WC supports is significantly more difficult than deposition on planar substrates because line-of-sight deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition are no longer applicable. However, there are numerous deposition techniques that have been successfully used for synthesis of 3-dimensional (3D) ML core-shell materials, including but not limited to atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), reverse micelle synthesis techniques, and electrodeposition. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, and a thorough investigation of synthesis parameters will be necessary in order to achieve uniform, well-controlled ML Pt-WC structures. One challenge in particular will be to identify appropriate precursor materials and/or pre-treatment steps such that one uniform Pt ML is attained while ensuring that the Pt ML is bonded directly to WC. For example, the synthesis of uniform Pt overlayers by ALD with common Pt-containing precursors is reported to be facilitated on oxide materials with hydroxyl-terminated surfaces that aid in the adsorption and decomposition of the precursor.27 Thus, the as-deposited Pt may be bonded through a WC-WxOy-Pt structure, which is likely to behave differently from Pt-WC. In other synthesis techniques, the presence or formation of W2C96 and/or carbon interlayers may also become relevant. Even when a well-defined ML Pt-WC interface is obtained, the electronic properties may be different from model planar surfaces due to displacements of the crystal lattice that are common for catalyst particles of less than 5 nm.93
Using the various methods and techniques available for the synthesis of ML Pt, the WC and W2C thin films described in Section I should serve as an excellent platform to investigate the nature of the interface between ML Pt and the tungsten carbide substrates. However, careful consideration must be made in order to successfully transfer the knowledge gained from thin film ML Pt-WC studies to mesoporous and particulate WC substrates. The challenge of bridging this materials gap will be critical to successful synthesis and implementation of these catalysts.
4.3 Stability of ML Pt and WC
For operation under oxidizing conditions, the long-term stability of ML Pt may prove to be the biggest challenge to successful commercialization of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts. In an electrochemical environment, the ML Pt-WC structure appears to be stable under HER19 and moderately oxidizing conditions,17,36 but investigations involving cycling tests of thousands of hours will be required to truly test their durability. Under oxidizing conditions in alkaline environments or exceedingly positive potentials in acidic solutions (>1.0 V), the stability of WC is generally poor (Fig. 3a). In alkaline solutions, this instability results from the strong tendency of WC surface oxides to dissolve into solution rather than passivating the surface. However, it is important to keep in mind that catalyst design, pre-conditioning, and operating conditions may allow for a notable expansion in the stability limits of ML Pt-WC catalysts compared to those shown for WC in Fig. 3a. At present only limited studies on Pt-WC catalysts have been conducted in alkaline solutions, therefore further investigation is warranted.
Under moderately oxidizing conditions in acidic electrolytes, such as those encountered in DAFCs, a limited amount of oxidation of the exposed WC surface may be tolerable or even desired.11 In cases where ML Pt-WC does not exhibit acceptable stability, such as under ORR conditions, one may still consider the benefits of supporting nano-scale Pt particles on WC. Although the use of Pt nanoparticles inherently necessitates higher Pt loading compared to ML Pt, Pt particles are likely to be more durable than ML Pt since the gradual loss of one layer of surface atoms from a particle results in significantly less loss in surface area. The multi-layer Pt thickness in a Pt particle should also prevent destabilizing adsorbates such as oxygen from diffusing to the Pt-WC interface and disrupting Pt-W bonds. In contrast to the evidence of instability of ML Pt-WC under ORR conditions in Section 3.2, other ORR studies have indicated that Pt particles supported on WC and/or W2C are notably more stable than Pt supported on commonly used carbon supports.65,66,70
In addition to stability concerns in the electrochemical environment, instability resulting from exposure of ML Pt-WC to humidified atmospheric conditions poses another challenge to long-term durability. Exposure of the electrocatalyst to atmosphere may be encountered in non-flooded, PEM-based devices, or any time the electrochemical device is emptied of its electrolyte. This issue has not often been addressed in literature, but may prove to be a major challenge for the successful incorporation of ML Pt-WC catalysts into electrochemical applications.
4.4 Other electrochemical systems, metal overlayers, and TMC substrates
In addition to the applications discussed in the three case studies within this Perspective, there are many other low-temperature electrocatalytic systems for which ML Pt-WC may be of interest. In particular, three reaction systems worth exploring are the HOR at HFC anode, COx(x = 1,2)reduction for fuel synthesis, and the electrochemical oxidation of other alcohols for DAFC applications. All three of these reaction systems contain similar reaction steps to those in the HER or MOR, for which ML Pt-WC has been established as an active catalyst. There have been several reports on the successful use of WxC-supported Pt nanoparticlecatalysts for the HOR,49,100102 offering the opportunity for the exploration of ML Pt-WxC structure as a means to achieve even lower loadings of Pt.
Although this Perspective has focused on ML Pt electrocatalysts supported on WC, the Pt-like catalytic properties of WC do not make it unique among the transition metal carbides (TMCs). In addition to WC, other TMCs such as MoC, Mo2C, VC, NbC, TaC, TiC, and W2C have attracted significant interest for their catalytic behavior that is similar to group 810 transition metals in many different applications. As with WC, it is believed that the group 810 transition metal character of these TMCs originates from carbide-induced metallic d-band states near the Fermi level.76 In general, this electronic structure causes a given TMC to behave similar to the late transition metals located to the right of the parent metal in the periodic table.76 For this reason, TMC materials besides WC may also serve as suitable substrate materials for supporting ML metal electrocatalysts. Different TMCs are likely to be better suited than WC for supporting different metal (M) MLs, and may offer advantages over WC such as ease of synthesizing high surface area structures. In order to identify promising combinations of metal overlayers (M) and TMC substrates, DFT calculations of binding energies and thermodynamic stability of these surfaces can serve as an effective means to screen the many combinations of potential ML M-TMC catalysts. High throughput computational screening of catalysts has been successfully demonstrated for ML bimetallics for the HER,103 and should also be useful for identifying active, low-cost ML M-TMC electrocatalysts for various applications. Once promising ML M-TMC surfaces are identified, the systematic approach to electrocatalyst evaluation outlined in this Perspective for ML Pt-WC may be applied. This approach is illustrated in the flow chart of Fig. 7.

V. Concluding remarks
The high cost and limited supply of Pt-group metal electrocatalysts represent significant barriers to commercialization of clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, and photoelectrochemical cells. This Perspective summarizes the opportunity to overcome these barriers by using one ML of Pt supported on Pt-like WC as a low-cost alternative to bulk precious metal electrocatalysts. WC is an excellent candidate support material for ML Pt because it exhibits electronic properties that are similar to bulk Pt, leading to good adhesion between ML Pt and WC without drastically altering the catalytic properties of ML Pt. By utilizing the lowest possible loading of Pt, one monolayer, on a low-cost material while maintaining the high catalytic activity of Pt, it is possible to reduce the Pt loading in various electrocatalytic applications by over an order of magnitude.
In order to demonstrate the activity and stability of the ML PtWC electrocatalysts, this Perspective has focused on ML Pt supported on single-phase WC films. These thin films serve as useful platforms to probe the properties of the ML Pt-WC surface by allowing for comparison of well-characterized WC and Pt samples with similar surface areas. Because WC electrocatalysts are susceptible to electrochemical oxidation, an important first step in studying ML Pt-WC catalysts is to understand the stability of these thin films under operating conditions, in particular the pH and potential ranges corresponding to specific applications of interest. When the stability of WC is graphed as a function of potential and pH, WC exhibits three general regions of stability, corresponding to a stable surface, a partially oxidized surface, and an unstable surface. Although the boundaries of these regions are dependent on a variety of factors, an understanding of the corrosion behavior of WC is critical to the development of active and stable WC electrocatalysts.
Using single-phase WC thin films as a platform, three case studies using ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts were presented to illustrate the opportunities and limitations. While ML Pt-WC has proven to be an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, its stability under oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) conditions appears to be a limiting factor for its application as PEMFC cathode. For the oxidation of methanol, ML Pt-WC appears to be a stable and active alternative to Pt, displaying promising activity due to its decreased affinity for CO compared to bulk Pt. The case study of ML Pt-WC as methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst underscores the fact that ML Pt-WC catalysts displays similar, though not identical, properties to bulk Pt catalysts.
On a fundamental level, a better understanding of the ML Pt-WC interface needs to be developed through a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. By indirectly probing the electronic and chemical properties of various ML Pt-WC structures, the stability of such catalysts may be improved while simultaneously tuning the catalytic properties of the surface for a specific electrochemical reaction. DFT calculations of the ML Pt-WC surface have proven extremely useful, and will continue to be invaluable for advances in Pt-WC catalysts. On a more applied level, much research is needed to transfer the successful findings of thin film ML Pt-WC catalysts to high surface area core-shell catalyst structures that will be needed for high current density applications such as PEMFCs. The challenges associated with the synthesis of such structures in a manner that can easily be scaled up in a cost-effective process are numerous. Nonetheless, the opportunity for cost reduction through minimization of Pt loading is tremendous, and there are many candidate processes to be investigated for the synthesis of these 3-D core-shell structures. Finally, although this Perspective focused on the materials combination of Pt and WC, other combinations of metals (M) and TMCs with the ML M-TMC configuration also have great potential to be used as low-cost electrocatalysts in various clean energy devices.
