[1] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

[2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions. The consistency of these structures across different environments allows for accurate modeling and prediction of catalytic behavior.

This strong correlation has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. It suggests that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be reliably applied to the development of supported catalysts for practical applications. This approach enables researchers to use computational methods and controlled experiments on simplified systems to predict and optimize the performance of more complex, real-world catalysts.

The ability to design catalysts using first principles on model surfaces offers a more efficient and targeted approach to catalyst development. It can potentially reduce the time and resources required for experimental trial-and-error methods, leading to faster discovery and optimization of catalysts with desired properties for specific reactions. Furthermore, this approach can provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying catalytic activity, which can inform the development of novel catalytic materials with enhanced performance.
