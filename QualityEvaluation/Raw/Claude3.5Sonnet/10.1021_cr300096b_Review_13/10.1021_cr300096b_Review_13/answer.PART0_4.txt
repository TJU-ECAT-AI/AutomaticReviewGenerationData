[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

[2] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions. The consistency in structure across different environments allows for accurate predictions and modeling of catalytic behavior.

This strong correlation has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. It suggests that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be reliably applied to real-world supported catalysts. This approach enables researchers to use theoretical models and controlled experiments on simplified systems to predict and design catalysts with desired properties for practical applications.

The promise of this approach is particularly evident in the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials. The success in these examples demonstrates the potential for extending this methodology to other reaction types and catalyst systems, potentially revolutionizing the field of catalyst design by making it more predictive and efficient.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在铂-3d系统中具有表面铂层下的亚表面3d原子的结构，在氢化反应中对模型表面和负载催化剂之间的强相关性起着至关重要的作用。这种稳定性在超高真空（UHV）环境和实际氢化反应条件下都能观察到。不同环境下结构的一致性允许对催化行为进行准确的预测和建模。

这种强相关性对于使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂具有重要意义。它表明，从研究模型表面获得的见解可以可靠地应用于实际的负载催化剂。这种方法使研究人员能够使用理论模型和在简化系统上进行的受控实验来预测和设计具有所需性能的实际应用催化剂。

这种方法的潜力在铂-3d双金属材料上进行的CC和CO键氢化反应中尤为明显。这些例子的成功证明了将这种方法扩展到其他反应类型和催化剂系统的潜力，有可能通过使催化剂设计更具预测性和效率而彻底改变催化剂设计领域。
