[1] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

[2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions. The consistent structure across different environments allows for more accurate predictions and modeling of catalyst behavior.

This strong correlation has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. It suggests that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be reliably applied to real-world supported catalysts, at least for hydrogenation reactions. This correlation provides a solid foundation for rational catalyst design, allowing researchers to use simpler model systems to predict and optimize the performance of more complex supported catalysts. Ultimately, this approach could lead to more efficient and targeted development of new catalysts, potentially reducing the time and resources required for catalyst discovery and optimization.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在铂-3d系统中具有表面铂层下的亚表面3d原子的结构，在氢化反应中模型表面和负载催化剂之间的强相关性中起着至关重要的作用。这种稳定性在超高真空（UHV）环境和实际氢化反应条件下都能观察到。在不同环境中结构的一致性允许对催化剂行为进行更准确的预测和建模。

这种强相关性对于使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂有重要意义。它表明，从研究模型表面获得的见解可以可靠地应用于实际的负载催化剂，至少对于氢化反应是如此。这种相关性为理性催化剂设计提供了坚实的基础，使研究人员能够使用更简单的模型系统来预测和优化更复杂的负载催化剂的性能。最终，这种方法可能导致更高效和有针对性的新催化剂开发，可能减少催化剂发现和优化所需的时间和资源。
