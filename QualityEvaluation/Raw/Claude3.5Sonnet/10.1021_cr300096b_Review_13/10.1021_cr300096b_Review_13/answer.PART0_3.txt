[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

[2] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions, which means that the desirable structures remain intact during the catalytic process.

This correlation has important implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. It suggests that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be directly applied to real-world supported catalysts, at least for hydrogenation reactions. This allows researchers to use computational methods and controlled experiments on simplified model systems to predict and design catalysts with improved performance.

The strong correlation also validates the approach of using first principles to design catalysts, as it demonstrates that the fundamental understanding gained from model surfaces can translate into practical improvements in catalyst design. This opens up opportunities for more targeted and efficient catalyst development, potentially leading to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability for hydrogenation reactions.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在铂-3d系统中具有表面铂层下方的亚表面3d原子的结构，对于氢化反应中模型表面和负载催化剂之间的强相关性做出了重要贡献。这种稳定性在超高真空(UHV)环境和实际氢化反应条件下都能观察到，这意味着在催化过程中所需的结构保持完整。

这种相关性对于使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂具有重要意义。它表明，从研究模型表面获得的见解可以直接应用于现实世界中的负载催化剂，至少对于氢化反应是如此。这使研究人员能够使用计算方法和在简化模型系统上进行的受控实验来预测和设计性能更好的催化剂。

这种强相关性也验证了使用第一性原理设计催化剂的方法，因为它证明了从模型表面获得的基本理解可以转化为催化剂设计的实际改进。这为更有针对性和更高效的催化剂开发开辟了机会，有可能导致开发出具有增强活性、选择性和稳定性的氢化反应催化剂。
