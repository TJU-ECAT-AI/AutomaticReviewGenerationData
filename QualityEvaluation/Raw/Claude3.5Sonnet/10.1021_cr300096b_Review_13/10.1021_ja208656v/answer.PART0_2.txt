The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, or their correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The text appears to be a partial citation for an article about electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis, which does not address the specific topics mentioned in the question. Without more relevant information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this question based solely on the given literature.

提供的文献中没有包含任何与回答问题相关的信息,该问题涉及特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性、具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统,或它们与模型表面和支持催化剂在加氢反应中的相关性。文本似乎是一篇关于用于水电解制氢的电催化剂的文章的部分引用,其中并未涉及问题中提到的具体主题。没有更多相关信息,仅凭给定的文献无法对这个问题提供准确的回答。
