The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, or their correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a title and author information for a scientific article about electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis, but does not provide any content that addresses the specific topics mentioned in the question.
