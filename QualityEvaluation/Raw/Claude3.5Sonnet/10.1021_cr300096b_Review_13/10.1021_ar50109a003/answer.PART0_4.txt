Unfortunately, this document does not contain any information directly relevant to answering the question about the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems or their correlation with supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature appears to be focused on other aspects of bimetallic catalysts and does not discuss the specific topics mentioned in the question. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question.

很遗憾,这篇文献中没有直接相关的信息来回答关于Pt-3d体系中特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性,或它们与加氢反应中负载催化剂的相关性的问题。这篇文献似乎主要关注双金属催化剂的其他方面,并未讨论问题中提到的具体主题。由于给定文本中没有相关信息,我无法对这个问题提供准确的回答。
