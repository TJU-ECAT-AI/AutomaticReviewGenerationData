[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts face stability issues under reaction conditions, especially at high temperatures. 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk of Pt, leading to the destruction of both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures.

This instability has important implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts suggests that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be applied to real-world catalysts. However, the instability of Pt-3d systems limits their practical application.

The literature suggests that replacing Pt with WC in bimetallic systems could produce alternative catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability. WC acts as a better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt, while maintaining similar electronic and chemical properties. This implies that using WC as a substrate could lead to more stable bimetallic structures that better maintain their designed properties under reaction conditions.

These findings indicate that when designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, researchers should consider not only the initial structure and properties but also the thermodynamic stability of the bimetallic systems under realistic reaction conditions. This approach could lead to the development of more effective and stable catalysts that bridge the gap between model surfaces and practical supported catalysts.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对于模型表面和负载催化剂在加氢反应中的强相关性起着重要作用。文献强调，基于Pt的双金属催化剂在反应条件下面临稳定性问题，尤其是在高温下。3d金属倾向于扩散到Pt的体相中，导致表面和亚表面双金属结构的破坏。

这种不稳定性对于使用第一性原理在模型表面上设计更有效的催化剂具有重要意义。模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性表明，从研究模型表面获得的见解可以应用于实际催化剂。然而，Pt-3d系统的不稳定性限制了它们的实际应用。

文献表明，在双金属系统中用WC替代Pt可以产生成本更低、热稳定性更高的替代催化剂。WC作为扩散屏障比Pt更好，同时保持了类似的电子和化学性质。这意味着使用WC作为基底可能会导致更稳定的双金属结构，在反应条件下更好地保持其设计的性质。

这些发现表明，在使用第一性原理在模型表面上设计催化剂时，研究人员应该不仅考虑初始结构和性质，还应考虑双金属系统在实际反应条件下的热力学稳定性。这种方法可能会导致开发出更有效和稳定的催化剂，从而缩小模型表面和实际负载催化剂之间的差距。
