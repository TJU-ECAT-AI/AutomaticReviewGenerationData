[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly impacts the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature indicates that Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts, while promising for various reactions, face stability issues under reaction conditions. 

3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk Pt at high temperatures, leading to the destruction of both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the applicability of these model surfaces to supported catalysts in real-world conditions.

However, the literature suggests that replacing Pt with WC in these bimetallic systems could potentially overcome this stability issue. WC acts as a better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, while maintaining similar electronic and chemical properties. This implies that WC-based bimetallic catalysts could provide lower cost and higher thermal stability alternatives to Pt-based systems.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant. By focusing on more stable bimetallic structures, such as those based on WC, researchers can develop model surfaces that more accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts under real reaction conditions. This improved correlation between model and practical catalysts could lead to more efficient design of catalysts with desired properties, potentially accelerating the development of new, more effective catalytic materials for various applications.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对氢化反应中模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性有显著影响。文献表明，Pt-3d双金属催化剂虽然在各种反应中都很有前景，但在反应条件下面临稳定性问题。

3d金属在高温下倾向于扩散到块体Pt中，导致表面和亚表面双金属结构的破坏。这种不稳定性限制了这些模型表面在实际条件下应用于负载催化剂的可能性。

然而，文献表明，在这些双金属系统中用WC替代Pt可能会克服这个稳定性问题。与Pt相比，WC是一种更好的添加金属扩散屏障，同时保持类似的电子和化学性质。这意味着基于WC的双金属催化剂可能提供比基于Pt系统更低成本和更高热稳定性的替代方案。

这对使用第一性原理在模型表面上设计更有效催化剂的影响是显著的。通过关注更稳定的双金属结构，如基于WC的结构，研究人员可以开发出更准确地代表实际反应条件下负载催化剂行为的模型表面。模型催化剂和实际催化剂之间的这种改进相关性可能导致更高效地设计具有所需性质的催化剂，潜在地加速各种应用的新型、更有效催化材料的开发。
