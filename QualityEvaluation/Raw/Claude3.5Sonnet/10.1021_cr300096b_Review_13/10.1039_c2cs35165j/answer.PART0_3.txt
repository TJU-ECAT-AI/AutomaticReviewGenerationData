[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that while Pt-based bimetallics show promise for various catalytic applications, they face stability issues, especially at high temperatures. 

For Pt-3d systems, the tendency of 3d metals to diffuse into the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures leads to the destruction of both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the practical application of these catalysts under real reaction conditions.

However, the literature suggests that replacing Pt with WC as a substrate can significantly improve the stability of these bimetallic structures. WC acts as a better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the admetal even after annealing. This improved stability, combined with the similar electronic and chemical properties of WC to Pt, implies that WC-based bimetallic catalysts could potentially replace Pt-based ones, offering lower cost and higher thermal stability.

The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, therefore, has important implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces:

1. It suggests that insights gained from model surfaces can be reliably translated to practical supported catalysts, provided the stability issues are addressed.

2. It highlights the importance of considering not just the initial activity but also the long-term stability of bimetallic structures when designing catalysts.

3. It points to the potential of using alternative substrates like WC to create more stable and cost-effective bimetallic catalysts that maintain the desirable properties of Pt-based systems.

4. It emphasizes the need for computational studies to focus not only on reactivity but also on the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures under realistic reaction conditions.

By addressing these stability issues through careful design of bimetallic structures and choice of substrates, researchers can develop more effective and durable catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and other applications.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，在加氢反应的模型表面和负载催化剂之间的强相关性中起着至关重要的作用。文献强调，虽然基于Pt的双金属催化剂在各种催化应用中显示出前景，但它们面临稳定性问题，尤其是在高温下。

对于Pt-3d系统，3d金属在高温下倾向于扩散到Pt体相中，导致表面和亚表面双金属结构的破坏。这种不稳定性限制了这些催化剂在实际反应条件下的应用。

然而，文献表明，用WC替代Pt作为基底可以显著提高这些双金属结构的稳定性。与Pt相比，WC作为添加金属的扩散屏障更好，即使在退火后仍能保持较高的添加金属覆盖率。这种改进的稳定性，加上WC与Pt相似的电子和化学性质，意味着基于WC的双金属催化剂可能替代基于Pt的催化剂，提供更低的成本和更高的热稳定性。

因此，模型表面和负载催化剂在加氢反应中的强相关性对于使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂具有重要意义：

1. 这表明，从模型表面获得的见解可以可靠地转化为实际的负载催化剂，前提是解决了稳定性问题。

2. 它强调在设计催化剂时，不仅要考虑初始活性，还要考虑双金属结构的长期稳定性。

3. 它指出了使用WC等替代基底创造更稳定、更具成本效益的双金属催化剂的潜力，同时保持基于Pt系统的理想性质。

4. 它强调计算研究需要不仅关注反应性，还要关注双金属结构在实际反应条件下的热力学稳定性。

通过仔细设计双金属结构和选择基底来解决这些稳定性问题，研究人员可以开发出更有效和更耐用的催化剂，用于加氢反应和其他应用。
