          [1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "The results of similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are included in the same figure. Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt."

[4] "WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability."

          The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is crucial for several reasons:

1. Instability of Pt-3d systems: At high temperatures, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk Pt, destroying both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the practical application of these model surfaces to real catalytic systems.

2. Improved stability with WC: Replacing Pt with tungsten carbide (WC) as the substrate significantly improves the stability of these bimetallic structures. WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the 3d metal even after high-temperature annealing.

3. Bridging model and practical catalysts: The improved stability offered by WC-supported bimetallic structures enhances the applicability of first-principles studies on model surfaces to the design of practical, supported catalysts.

4. Catalyst longevity: More stable structures enable the design of catalysts that can maintain their activity and selectivity for longer periods, potentially increasing their industrial viability.

5. Cost reduction: The use of WC provides a pathway to reduce the use of scarce and expensive Pt-group metals while maintaining desirable catalytic properties.

6. Accurate predictions: Improved stability allows researchers to more accurately predict the behavior of real catalysts based on studies of model surfaces, as the structural integrity of the catalyst is better preserved.

7. New design possibilities: The enhanced stability opens up possibilities for designing new bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that were previously limited by stability issues.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces include:

1. Focusing on more stable bimetallic structures, such as those based on WC, to develop model surfaces that more accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts under real reaction conditions.

2. Considering not just the initial activity but also the long-term stability of bimetallic structures when designing catalysts.

3. Incorporating thermal stability considerations in first-principles studies to better predict the behavior of practical catalysts.

4. Prioritizing both the desired catalytic activity and the structural stability of the bimetallic system under reaction conditions in catalyst design.

By addressing these stability issues through careful design of bimetallic structures and choice of substrates, researchers can develop more effective and durable catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and other applications, bridging the gap between model surfaces and practical supported catalysts.

          特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对于模型表面和负载催化剂在加氢反应中的强相关性起着重要作用。这种稳定性十分关键，原因如下：

1. Pt-3d系统的不稳定性：在高温下，3d金属倾向于扩散到体相Pt中，破坏表面和亚表面的双金属结构。这种不稳定性限制了这些模型表面在实际催化系统中的应用。

2. 使用WC提高稳定性：用碳化钨（WC）替代Pt作为基底可以显著提高这些双金属结构的稳定性。与Pt相比，WC是一个更好的外加金属扩散屏障，即使在高温退火后仍能保持较高的3d金属覆盖率。

3. 连接模型和实际催化剂：WC支持的双金属结构提供的改进稳定性增强了模型表面上第一性原理研究在设计实用的、负载的催化剂中的适用性。

4. 催化剂寿命：更稳定的结构能够设计出可以长期保持活性和选择性的催化剂，可能增加它们的工业可行性。

5. 降低成本：使用WC提供了一种减少稀缺和昂贵的Pt族金属使用的途径，同时保持理想的催化性能。

6. 准确预测：改进的稳定性允许研究人员更准确地根据模型表面的研究预测实际催化剂的行为，因为催化剂的结构完整性得到了更好的保持。

7. 新的设计可能性：增强的稳定性为设计具有独特性能的新型双金属催化剂开辟了可能性，这些性能之前受到稳定性问题的限制。

使用第一性原理在模型表面上设计更有效催化剂的影响包括：

1. 关注更稳定的双金属结构，如基于WC的结构，以开发更准确地代表实际反应条件下负载催化剂行为的模型表面。

2. 在设计催化剂时，不仅要考虑初始活性，还要考虑双金属结构的长期稳定性。

3. 在第一性原理研究中纳入热稳定性考虑，以更好地预测实际催化剂的行为。

4. 在催化剂设计中优先考虑所需的催化活性和反应条件下双金属系统的结构稳定性。

通过仔细设计双金属结构和选择基底来解决这些稳定性问题，研究人员可以开发出更有效和更耐用的催化剂，用于加氢反应和其他应用，从而缩小模型表面和实际负载催化剂之间的差距。
