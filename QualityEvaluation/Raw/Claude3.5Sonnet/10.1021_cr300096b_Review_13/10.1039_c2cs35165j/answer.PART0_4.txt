[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "The results of similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are included in the same figure. Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that while Pt-based bimetallics show promise for various reactions, they face stability issues under reaction conditions. 

For Pt-3d systems, the subsurface configuration (e.g., PtNiPt(111)) is particularly unstable at high temperatures. The 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk Pt, leading to the destruction of both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the practical application of these model surfaces in real catalytic systems.

However, the literature suggests that replacing Pt with tungsten carbide (WC) as the substrate can significantly improve the stability of these bimetallic structures. WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the 3d metal even after annealing at high temperatures.

This improved stability has important implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces:

1. It allows for a stronger correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, as the bimetallic structures remain more intact under reaction conditions when using WC as a substrate.

2. It enables the design of catalysts that can maintain their activity and selectivity for longer periods, potentially increasing their industrial viability.

3. It provides a pathway to reduce the use of scarce and expensive Pt-group metals while maintaining desirable catalytic properties.

4. It allows researchers to more accurately predict the behavior of real catalysts based on studies of model surfaces, as the structural integrity of the catalyst is better preserved.

5. It opens up possibilities for designing new bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that were previously limited by stability issues.

In conclusion, the improved thermodynamic stability offered by WC-supported bimetallic structures enhances the applicability of first-principles studies on model surfaces to the design of practical, supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and potentially other catalytic processes.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对于模型表面和负载催化剂在加氢反应中的强相关性起着至关重要的作用。文献强调，虽然基于Pt的双金属对各种反应显示出前景，但它们在反应条件下面临稳定性问题。

对于Pt-3d系统，亚表面构型（例如PtNiPt(111)）在高温下特别不稳定。3d金属倾向于扩散到体相Pt中，导致表面和亚表面双金属结构的破坏。这种不稳定性限制了这些模型表面在实际催化系统中的应用。

然而，文献表明，用碳化钨（WC）替代Pt作为基底可以显著提高这些双金属结构的稳定性。与Pt相比，WC是一个更好的外加金属扩散屏障，即使在高温退火后仍能保持较高的3d金属覆盖率。

这种改进的稳定性对于使用模型表面的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂有重要影响：

1. 它允许模型表面和负载催化剂之间有更强的相关性，因为使用WC作为基底时，双金属结构在反应条件下保持更完整。

2. 它能够设计出可以长期保持活性和选择性的催化剂，可能增加它们的工业可行性。

3. 它提供了一种减少稀缺和昂贵的Pt族金属使用的途径，同时保持理想的催化性能。

4. 它允许研究人员更准确地根据模型表面的研究预测实际催化剂的行为，因为催化剂的结构完整性得到了更好的保持。

5. 它为设计具有独特性能的新型双金属催化剂开辟了可能性，这些性能之前受到稳定性问题的限制。

总之，WC支持的双金属结构提供的改进热力学稳定性增强了模型表面上第一性原理研究在设计实用的、负载的加氢反应催化剂以及潜在的其他催化过程中的适用性。
