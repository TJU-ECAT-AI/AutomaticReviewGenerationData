[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "The results of similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are included in the same figure. Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature indicates that Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts face stability issues under reaction conditions, especially at high temperatures. For example, when 3d metals like Ni are deposited on Pt, they tend to diffuse into the bulk at elevated temperatures, destroying both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures.

This instability limits the practical application of Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts in industrial settings, despite their promising catalytic properties. However, the research also shows that replacing Pt with tungsten carbide (WC) as the substrate significantly improves the thermal stability of the bimetallic structure. WC acts as a better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the admetal even after annealing.

The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant. It suggests that:

1. Researchers should focus on developing bimetallic systems with improved thermal stability to bridge the gap between model surfaces and practical catalysts.

2. The use of carbide substrates, such as WC, could be a promising avenue for creating more stable bimetallic catalysts that retain their unique catalytic properties under realistic reaction conditions.

3. First-principles studies on model surfaces should incorporate thermal stability considerations to better predict the behavior of practical catalysts.

4. The design of new catalysts should prioritize not only the desired catalytic activity but also the structural stability of the bimetallic system under reaction conditions.

By addressing the stability issues revealed by the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can develop more effective and durable bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and other industrial applications.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对于模型表面和负载催化剂在加氢反应中的强相关性起着至关重要的作用。文献表明，Pt-3d双金属催化剂在反应条件下，特别是在高温下面临稳定性问题。例如，当3d金属如Ni沉积在Pt上时，它们在高温下倾向于扩散到体相中，破坏了表面和亚表面的双金属结构。

这种不稳定性限制了Pt-3d双金属催化剂在工业环境中的实际应用，尽管它们具有promising的催化性能。然而，研究还表明，用碳化钨（WC）替代Pt作为基底可以显著提高双金属结构的热稳定性。与Pt相比，WC是一个更好的添加金属扩散屏障，即使在退火后也能保持更高的添加金属覆盖率。

这种相关性对于使用第一原理在模型表面上设计更有效的催化剂具有重要意义。它表明：

1. 研究人员应该致力于开发具有更好热稳定性的双金属系统，以缩小模型表面和实际催化剂之间的差距。

2. 使用碳化物基底（如WC）可能是创造更稳定的双金属催化剂的一个有前途的途径，这些催化剂在实际反应条件下能保持其独特的催化性能。

3. 模型表面上的第一原理研究应该考虑热稳定性，以更好地预测实际催化剂的行为。

4. 新催化剂的设计不仅应优先考虑所需的催化活性，还应考虑双金属系统在反应条件下的结构稳定性。

通过解决模型表面和负载催化剂之间相关性揭示的稳定性问题，研究人员可以为加氢反应和其他工业应用开发出更有效和更耐用的双金属催化剂。
