The given literature does not contain any information about the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, or their correlation with model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The text primarily focuses on a general overview of bimetallic catalysts, their applications, and characterization techniques, but does not delve into the specific details requested in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
