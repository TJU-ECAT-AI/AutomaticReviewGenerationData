The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the thermodynamic stability of Pt-3d bimetallic structures with subsurface 3d atoms, or their correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The document focuses primarily on dealloyed PtCu catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions, and does not discuss hydrogenation reactions or the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces as described in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有特别涉及具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d双金属结构的热力学稳定性,也没有提到它们在加氢反应中模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性。该文档主要集中讨论了用于氧还原反应的脱合金PtCu催化剂,并未讨论加氢反应或使用模型表面上的第一原理设计催化剂,如问题中所描述的那样。因此,仅基于所提供文献中的信息,无法充分回答这个问题。
