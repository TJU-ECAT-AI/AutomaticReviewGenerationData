The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the thermodynamic stability of Pt-3d bimetallic structures with subsurface 3d atoms, or their correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The document primarily focuses on dealloyed PtCu catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, discussing their structure, strain effects, and catalytic activity. It does not cover the specific aspects of Pt-3d systems in hydrogenation reactions mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献并未包含特别涉及铂-3d双金属结构(亚表面含3d原子)的热力学稳定性,或它们在氢化反应中模型表面与负载催化剂之间相关性的信息。该文档主要集中讨论了用于氧还原反应的脱合金PtCu催化剂,包括它们的结构、应变效应和催化活性。它并未涵盖问题中提到的Pt-3d系统在氢化反应中的具体方面。因此,基于所提供的文献无法直接回答这个问题。
