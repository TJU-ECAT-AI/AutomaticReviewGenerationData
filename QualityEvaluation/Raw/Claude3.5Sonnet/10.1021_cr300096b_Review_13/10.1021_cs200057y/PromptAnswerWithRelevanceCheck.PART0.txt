Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?

This question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the given scientific literature. The document focuses on comparing the catalytic properties of Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces for ethanol reforming reactions, but does not discuss the thermodynamic stability of Pt-3d bimetallic structures or their correlation with supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature does not contain information about subsurface 3d atoms in Pt systems or their implications for catalyst design using first principles on model surfaces.

The given literature does not contain information directly addressing the thermodynamic stability of Pt-3d bimetallic structures with subsurface 3d atoms or their correlation to supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The text focuses on comparing Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces for ethanol reforming reactions, rather than discussing hydrogenation reactions or thermodynamic stability of Pt-3d systems. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
