[1] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

          [2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

          [3] "To truly achieve the rational design of catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the model systems are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions. This is especially true for bimetallic catalysts due to the adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms."

[1] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."

[2] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements. The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures."

[3] "The results of similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are included in the same figure. Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt."

[4] "WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability."
