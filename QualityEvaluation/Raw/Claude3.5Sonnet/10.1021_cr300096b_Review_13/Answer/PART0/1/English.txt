The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems, particularly those with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions, allowing the model surfaces to accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts.

          The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant. It demonstrates that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be directly applied to the development of practical supported catalysts. This correlation enables researchers to use computational methods and controlled experiments on model surfaces to predict and optimize the performance of real-world catalysts.

          The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in Pt-3d systems for hydrogenation reactions provides a promising pathway for rational catalyst design. It allows researchers to leverage the power of first-principles calculations and surface science techniques to develop more effective and efficient catalysts for practical applications.

          However, it's important to note that achieving such correlations requires careful consideration of reaction conditions. The model systems must closely resemble the actual catalysts under reaction conditions to ensure the validity of the predictions. This is particularly challenging for bimetallic catalysts due to potential adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms during reactions.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is crucial for several reasons:

1. Instability of Pt-3d systems: At high temperatures, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk Pt, destroying both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the practical application of these model surfaces to real catalytic systems.

2. Improved stability with WC: Replacing Pt with tungsten carbide (WC) as the substrate significantly improves the stability of these bimetallic structures. WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the 3d metal even after high-temperature annealing.

3. Bridging model and practical catalysts: The improved stability offered by WC-supported bimetallic structures enhances the applicability of first-principles studies on model surfaces to the design of practical, supported catalysts.

4. Catalyst longevity: More stable structures enable the design of catalysts that can maintain their activity and selectivity for longer periods, potentially increasing their industrial viability.

5. Cost reduction: The use of WC provides a pathway to reduce the use of scarce and expensive Pt-group metals while maintaining desirable catalytic properties.

6. Accurate predictions: Improved stability allows researchers to more accurately predict the behavior of real catalysts based on studies of model surfaces, as the structural integrity of the catalyst is better preserved.

7. New design possibilities: The enhanced stability opens up possibilities for designing new bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that were previously limited by stability issues.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces include:

1. Focusing on more stable bimetallic structures, such as those based on WC, to develop model surfaces that more accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts under real reaction conditions.

2. Considering not just the initial activity but also the long-term stability of bimetallic structures when designing catalysts.

3. Incorporating thermal stability considerations in first-principles studies to better predict the behavior of practical catalysts.

4. Prioritizing both the desired catalytic activity and the structural stability of the bimetallic system under reaction conditions in catalyst design.

By addressing these stability issues through careful design of bimetallic structures and choice of substrates, researchers can develop more effective and durable catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and other applications, bridging the gap between model surfaces and practical supported catalysts.
