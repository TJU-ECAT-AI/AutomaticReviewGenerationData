          [1] "The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

          [2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

          [3] "To truly achieve the rational design of catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the model systems are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions. This is especially true for bimetallic catalysts due to the adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms."

          The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems, particularly those with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions, allowing the model surfaces to accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts.

          The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant. It demonstrates that the insights gained from studying model surfaces can be directly applied to the development of practical supported catalysts. This correlation enables researchers to use computational methods and controlled experiments on model surfaces to predict and optimize the performance of real-world catalysts.

          The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in Pt-3d systems for hydrogenation reactions provides a promising pathway for rational catalyst design. It allows researchers to leverage the power of first-principles calculations and surface science techniques to develop more effective and efficient catalysts for practical applications.

          However, it's important to note that achieving such correlations requires careful consideration of reaction conditions. The model systems must closely resemble the actual catalysts under reaction conditions to ensure the validity of the predictions. This is particularly challenging for bimetallic catalysts due to potential adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms during reactions.

          在Pt-3d系统中，特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是那些表面Pt层下方有3d原子的结构，在氢化反应中对模型表面和负载催化剂之间的强相关性起着至关重要的作用。这种稳定性在超高真空（UHV）环境和实际氢化反应条件下都能观察到，使得模型表面能够准确地表示负载催化剂的行为。

          这种相关性对于使用模型表面的第一性原理设计更有效催化剂的影响是显著的。它表明，从研究模型表面获得的见解可以直接应用于实际负载催化剂的开发。这种相关性使研究人员能够使用计算方法和对模型表面的受控实验来预测和优化实际催化剂的性能。

          Pt-3d系统中模型表面和负载催化剂在氢化反应中的强相关性为理性催化剂设计提供了一条有前景的途径。它使研究人员能够利用第一性原理计算和表面科学技术的力量，为实际应用开发更有效和更高效的催化剂。

          然而，值得注意的是，实现这种相关性需要仔细考虑反应条件。模型系统必须与实际反应条件下的催化剂非常相似，以确保预测的有效性。对于双金属催化剂来说，这一点特别具有挑战性，因为在反应过程中可能会出现吸附物诱导的金属原子分离和扩散。
