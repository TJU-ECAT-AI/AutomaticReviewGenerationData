The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions, allowing the model surfaces to accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts [10.1021/cr300096b\_13]. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant, as it demonstrates that insights gained from studying model surfaces can be directly applied to the development of practical supported catalysts.

However, the stability of Pt-3d systems faces challenges, particularly at high temperatures. When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk, destroying both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. For instance, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements show that the coverage of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) decreases upon annealing, reaching less than 0.2 ML at 800 K [10.1039/c2cs35165j]. This instability limits the practical application of these model surfaces to real catalytic systems.

To address this issue, researchers have explored alternative substrates, such as tungsten carbide (WC). WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the 3d metal even after high-temperature annealing. For example, annealing experiments with Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil show a final coverage of 0.6 ML, significantly higher than that observed for Ni/Pt(111) [10.1039/c2cs35165j]. This improved stability enhances the applicability of first-principles studies on model surfaces to the design of practical, supported catalysts.

The use of WC as a substrate offers several advantages:
1. Improved catalyst longevity, potentially increasing industrial viability.
2. Cost reduction by reducing the use of scarce and expensive Pt-group metals.
3. More accurate predictions of real catalyst behavior based on model surface studies.
4. New design possibilities for bimetallic catalysts with unique properties.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces include:
1. Focusing on more stable bimetallic structures, such as those based on WC.
2. Considering both initial activity and long-term stability in catalyst design.
3. Incorporating thermal stability considerations in first-principles studies.
4. Prioritizing both catalytic activity and structural stability under reaction conditions.

To truly achieve the rational design of catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the model systems are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions. This is especially important for bimetallic catalysts due to the adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms [10.1021/cr300096b\_13].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there is a significant opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in catalyst design. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Developing new computational models that incorporate both thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity predictions for bimetallic systems.
2. Exploring a wider range of substrate materials beyond WC that can offer similar or better stability for 3d metals while maintaining desirable catalytic properties.
3. Investigating the effects of different reaction conditions on the stability and performance of bimetallic catalysts to bridge the gap between UHV studies and real-world applications.
4. Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict optimal bimetallic compositions and structures for specific catalytic reactions based on first-principles calculations and experimental data.
5. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to study the dynamic behavior of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions, providing real-time insights into structural changes and catalytic performance.

These future directions could significantly advance our understanding of bimetallic catalysts and lead to the development of more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalytic systems for various industrial applications, including propane dehydrogenation.

The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, has significant implications for hydrogenation reactions and first-principles catalyst design. This relationship is primarily attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, which play a crucial role in determining catalytic activity and selectivity. By understanding these correlations, researchers can develop more accurate predictive models for catalyst performance, enabling the rational design of advanced bimetallic catalysts. The Pt-3d systems, in particular, have garnered considerable attention due to their enhanced catalytic properties compared to monometallic counterparts. The interplay between platinum and 3d transition metals creates unique electronic and geometric structures that can be tailored to optimize catalytic efficiency. This knowledge not only streamlines the catalyst discovery process but also opens up new possibilities for developing more sustainable and efficient hydrogenation reactions across various industrial applications.
