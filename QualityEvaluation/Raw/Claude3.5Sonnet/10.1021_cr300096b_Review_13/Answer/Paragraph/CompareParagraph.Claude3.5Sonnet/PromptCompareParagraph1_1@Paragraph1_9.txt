The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability is observed both in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments and under actual hydrogenation reaction conditions, allowing model surfaces to accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts [10.1021/cr300096b\_13].

The desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, featuring subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, exhibit thermodynamic stability in both UHV environments and under reaction conditions. This stability is fundamental to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a solid foundation for catalyst design using first principles on model surfaces [10.1021/cr300096b\_13].

However, the practical application of Pt-3d systems faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability issues of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions [10.1039/c2cs35165j]. At high temperatures, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk Pt, leading to the destruction of both surface and subsurface bimetallic structures. This instability limits the direct application of these model surfaces to real catalytic systems [10.1039/c2cs35165j].

A promising solution to this stability issue has been found in the use of tungsten carbide (WC) as a substrate. WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt, maintaining a higher coverage of the 3d metal even after high-temperature annealing. This improved stability significantly enhances the applicability of first-principles studies on model surfaces to the design of practical, supported catalysts [10.1039/c2cs35165j].

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant:

1. Researchers can focus on more stable bimetallic structures, such as those based on WC, to develop model surfaces that more accurately represent the behavior of supported catalysts under real reaction conditions.

2. Both the initial activity and long-term stability of bimetallic structures must be considered in catalyst design.

3. Thermal stability considerations should be incorporated into first-principles studies to better predict the behavior of practical catalysts.

4. The design process should prioritize both the desired catalytic activity and the structural stability of the bimetallic system under reaction conditions.

By addressing these stability issues through careful design of bimetallic structures and choice of substrates, researchers can develop more effective and durable catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and other applications, bridging the gap between model surfaces and practical supported catalysts [10.1039/c2cs35165j].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, opens up exciting possibilities for future catalyst design. The use of WC as a substrate material not only addresses stability issues but also provides a pathway to reduce the reliance on scarce and expensive Pt-group metals. This breakthrough could lead to the development of more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts.

Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Exploring a wider range of substrate materials beyond WC that could further enhance the stability and performance of bimetallic catalysts.

2. Developing advanced computational models that can accurately predict the long-term stability and performance of bimetallic catalysts under various reaction conditions.

3. Investigating the potential of these stable bimetallic structures in other important catalytic processes beyond hydrogenation reactions, such as CO2 reduction or water splitting.

4. Integrating machine learning algorithms with first-principles calculations to accelerate the discovery and optimization of novel bimetallic catalyst compositions and structures.

5. Studying the effects of various promoters or dopants on the stability and activity of these bimetallic catalysts, potentially uncovering synergistic effects that could further enhance their performance.

By pursuing these research directions, the field of catalysis could see significant advancements in the coming years, leading to more efficient, stable, and sustainable catalytic processes for a wide range of industrial applications.

5 Conclusions and Future Research Opportunities
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of C═C and C═O bonds over Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions.
In comparison, for other types of reactions, such as dehydrogenation and reforming, the desirable Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic structures should be the 3d-terminated surfaces. However, it is less clear whether these structures are present under dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions. Similarly, more studies are needed to determine the structures and their stability in other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Such understanding is critical in extending the design of bimetallic catalysts from hydrogenation to other types of reactions. Below are some opportunities for future research in the area of bimetallic catalysis:
(1) Characterization of bimetallic catalysts under in situ reaction conditions. Because bimetallic structures would most likely change during reactions, it is critical to identify the atomic arrangement of bimetallic catalysts under temperatures, pressures, and reaction media (vapor phase or aqueous phase) relevant to catalytic reactions. One promising in situ technique is EXAFS, which allows measurements of the coordination numbers of monometallic and bimetallic bonds under in situ conditions. Recently in situ EXAFS and XRD have been combined to determine the short-range bonding environment of metal catalysts and the long-range order of oxide supports, respectively, under reaction conditions. (414, 415) These techniques should provide important information on the bimetallic structures and their stability under reaction conditions, which would in turn provide critical input for constructing relevant model surfaces in DFT calculations and UHV studies. To truly achieve the rational design of catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the model systems are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions. This is especially true for bimetallic catalysts due to the adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms.
(2) Synthesis of stable bimetallic structures. The prevention of metal segregation and diffusion is a challenge under reaction conditions. For example, for the Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic catalysts, ideally one would design Pt-terminated surfaces for hydrogenation reactions and 3d-terminated catalysts for reforming reactions. Although the synthesis of well-defined core&ndash;shell bimetallic catalysts has been demonstrated for Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic electrocatalysts, (407) it is unlikely that such well-defined core&ndash;shell structures, in particular the maintenance of Pt or 3d as the surface atoms, would survive the relatively harsh conditions of calcination and reduction treatment in typical heterogeneous catalysis. One possibility to prevent the metal movement is to increase the activation barriers of segregation/diffusion by anchoring one or both metal atoms by the catalyst supports, although the strong metal&ndash;support interaction might change the electronic and catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts.
(3) Metal carbides as substrates in bimetallic catalysts. Another possibility is to replace Pt with a metal-like substrate that prevents the diffusion of the 3d metals. For example, Ni-terminated Pt&ndash;Ni surfaces are identified as effective catalysts for the reforming of alcohols and polyols. However, under reduction conditions or higher temperatures the surface Ni atoms would diffuse into bulk Pt, losing the high reforming activity. Recently, tungsten carbide (WC) was utilized to replace Pt because WC often shows catalytic properties similar to Pt (416) and is an effective diffusion barrier layer for surface metal atoms. (417) A comparative DFT and UHV study confirms that monolayer Ni&ndash;Pt and Ni&ndash;WC surfaces show nearly identical reforming activity for ethanol. (261) A recent study also demonstrates that other carbides, including W2C and Mo2C, can be used to replace Pt to support monolayer metals. (418-421) Synthesis efforts to extend these model surfaces to powder catalysts will lead to the production of alternative bimetallic catalysts with higher stability and lower cost.
(4) Correlation between model systems and catalytic reactions through theory. In addition to experimental efforts, calculations through multiscale modeling offer additional opportunities to correlate results on model surfaces to catalytic performance over supported catalysts. For example, recently Vlachos and co-workers have demonstrated the feasibility of creating activity maps to predict catalytic activity and selectivity of several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts using a combination of DFT calculations, linear energy correlations, and microkinetic modeling. (252, 422, 423) These types of calculations, coupled with parallel experimental efforts, will offer fruitful opportunities for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with desirable activity, selectivity, and stability.
