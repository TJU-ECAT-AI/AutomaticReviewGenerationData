Abstract
An automotive gasoline engine is operated close to the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio to convert the pollutant emissions simultaneously,
accompanying with redox (reduction and oxidation) fluctuations in exhaust-gas composition through adjusting the air-to-fuel ratio. An
innovative LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, named the intelligent catalyst, has been developed, and which has a new self-regenerative
function of the precious metal in the inherent fluctuations of automotive exhaust-gas.
The LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, La located at the A-site, was prepared by the alkoxide method. Pd located at the B-site of the
perovskite lattice in the oxidative atmosphere, and segregated out to form small metallic particles in the reductive atmosphere. The catalyst
retained a predominantly perovskite structure throughout a redox cycle of the exhaust-gas, while the local structure around Pd could be
changed in a completely reversible manner. The agglomeration and growth of Pd particles is suppressed, even under the severe environment,
as a result of the movement between inside and outside the perovskite lattice. It is revealed that the self-regenerative function of Pd occurs even
at 200 C, unexpectedly low temperature, in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst. Since the high catalytic activity is maintained, the great reduction
of Pd loading has been achieved. The intelligent catalyst is expected as a new application of the rare earth, and then the technology is expected
in the same way in the global standard of the catalyst designing.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Rare earth oxides have widely been applied to the auto-
motive catalyst. Ceria, having an excellent oxygen storage
capacity, is the most popular rare earth oxide in the three-way
catalyst. And La and Nd are doped into alumina, zirconia
and ceria to improve their thermal stabilities. A quite new
application of rare earth was shown in the present paper: a
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst, named the intelligent

catalyst, which has a self-regenerative function of precious
metals in the inherent fluctuations of automotive exhaust-gas
[16].
Emission regulations are getting tighter and tighter, in
order to guarantee cleaner air for the environment, all over
the world. The Japanese government has introduced cleaner
emission standards designated as ULEV and super ultra low
emission vehicle (SULEV), which are in order, 50 and 75%
reductions of HC and NOx in comparison with standards for
emission regulation set in the year 2005.
The increasing amounts of precious metals must be
required to meet these severe regulations when traditional
catalyst technologies are applied. Demand for Pd for use in
automotive catalysts, in particular, has burgeoned from 15 to

150 tonnes per year over the last decade (Fig. 1) [7]. This
drastic increase is due to the strengthening of the worldwide
cold emission regulations, which has made development of
the reduction technologies so urgent.
The intelligent catalyst with the function for self-
regeneration of Pd, through the solid solution and segregation
of Pd in the perovskite crystal, succeeds in utilization and is
supplied to the market from 2002. The Japan super ultra low
emission vehicle standard has been achieved with mount-
ing a single intelligent catalyst at the manifold, right under
the engine position. The intelligent catalyst is expected as the
solution that can reduce the use of precious metals, especially
Pd.
1.2. History of perovskite catalyst
A perovskite-type oxide has an ABO3-type crystal struc-
ture wherein cations with a large ionic radius have 12 coordi-
nation to oxygen atom and occupy A-sites, and cations with a
smaller ionic radius have 6 coordination and occupy B-sites.
A and O form a cubic closest packing, and B is contained in
the octahedral voids in the packing. If the ionic radii are rA, rB
and rO, to form a perovskite crystal structure, the tolerance
factor (t) = (rA + rO)/
2(rB + rO) must lie within the range
0.8 < t < 1.0, and rA > 0.090 nm, rB > 0.051 nm. A great many
elements can form ideal or modified perovskites depending
on the tolerance factor.
Perovskite-typecompounds,especiallywhichcontainrare
earth metals at A-site, are interesting materials for catalytic
applications and for fundamental studies as well. Many stud-
ies on perovskite catalysts have been reported [823].
The characteristics of perovskite catalysts are summarized
as below:
(1) In LnMO3
(Ln = lanthanoid, M = transition metals)
perovskites, the catalytic activity for oxidation is
mainly determined by B-site elements, in the order
Co > Mn > Ni > Fe > Cr.
(2) In LnMO3 perovskites, the structual stability in a reduc-
tive atmosphere is also determined by B-site elements,
in the order Cr > Fe > Mn > Co > Ni.
(3) One of the advantages of the formation of a perovskite
structure is to increase the thermal stability of the transi-
tion metal oxides.
(4) Another advantage is the valency and vacancy control to
enhance their catalytic activity.
It was also reported that Pd containing LaCeFeCoO3
showed the excellent three-way catalytic activity for automo-
tive emissions control [24,25]. But it is required to remove
cobalt (Co), which has been singled out by TA-luft as a car-
cinogenic, for the industrialization of the perovskite catalyst
as the practical intelligent catalyst [5,6,26].
In this paper, the self-regenerative function and its temper-
ature dependency of Co-free perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3,
were investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalyst
2.1.1. Powder catalyst
A Pd-containing LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite powder
catalyst was prepared by the alkoxide method [2]. Metal
ethoxyethylates, M3+ (OC2H4OC2H5)3, of La, Fe were dis-
solved in toluene, a precipitate containing Pd was obtained
by using a diluted palladium nitrate aqueous solution during
hydrolysis, and after drying, the precursor was calcined at
700 C for 4 h in air to obtain a perovskite powder catalyst
containing Pd homogeneously. A Pd/Al2O3 powder catalyst
was prepared as a reference. Al2O3 was impregnated with
palladium nitrate solution, then dried and calcined in an air
furnace at 700 C for 4 h.
2.1.2. Monolithic catalyst
Each powder catalyst was coated on the inner wall of
a monolithic honeycomb substrate (80 mm in diameter and
95 mm in length with the grid of 64 cell cm2), containing
the same amount of Pd (3.24 mg cm3). Table 1 summarizes
the configuration of the monolithic catalysts for fundamental
research.
2.2. Thermal treatment and engine aging
2.2.1. Redox treatment for powder catalyst
To begin with, the possibility of self-regenerative function
of Co-free perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, and its temperature
dependency were investigated. Thermal treatment was car-
ried out in three steps to simulate the redox fluctuations of an
automotive exhaust-gas.

Fig. 2. Redox treatment procedure [27,28].
First, the catalyst was oxidized in an air at 800 C for
1 h. Then, the sample was reduced in 2.5% H2 and 7.5%
CO balanced with N2 for 1 h at 100, 200, 300, 400, 600 and
800 C, respectively. Finally, the sample was re-oxidized in
air for 1 h at the same temperatures as reductive treatment
(Fig. 2).
This successive single-run treatment creates a separate
model for each of the key stages of the engine exhaust atmo-
spheres evolution [4,27,28].
2.2.2. Aging of monolithic catalyst in engine exhaust at
900 C
Next,self-regenerativefunctionofthecatalystintheactual
engine exhaust was investigated. The monolithic catalysts,
for research, were aged at 900 C (catalyst inlet temperature)
for 100 h in exhaust-gas from a real 4000 cm3 V-8 engine.
The fuel for aging was regular grade gasoline that con-
tained approximately 50 ppm of sulphur. During exposure,
two exhaust-gas conditions were alternated: an atmosphere
with large air-to-fuel ratio fluctuations (λ = 4% at 0.6 Hz)
around the stoichiometric point was applied for 870 s, then an
oxidizing atmosphere for 30 s. The total engine aging time
is the sum of 400 cycles. This aging procedure is widely
accepted for the simulation of a driving strategy to achieve
higher fuel economy by introducing fuel cut-off during decel-
eration [29,30].
2.3. Characterization
2.3.1. X-ray analysis for LaFePdO3 powder catalyst
The crystal structure of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 powder cata-
lyst after redox treatments at 800 C was measured by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) using Cu K [5].
The binding energy of Pd after redox treatments at 800 C
was analyzed using Mg K in X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS). The powder of PdO and Pd were measured
as the standard materials [5].
Fig. 3. XRD of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 after redox treatments at 800 C.
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was measured
at bending-magnet beam lines at BL01B1 and BL14B1 in
SPring-8. The spectra were measured near the Pd K-edge in
transmission mode because of the high transmissivity of the
X-ray. The Pd-foil and the powder of PdO were also mea-
sured as the standard materials, and the photon energy was
calibrated with the Pd-foil by assigning 24.350 keV to the
energy at half the edge jump.
2.3.2. Pd particle observation after engine aging
Pd particles of the catalysts, after aging in engine exhaust-
gas at 900 C for 100 h and cooling down in a reductive atmo-
sphere, were observed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM).
2.4. Evaluation of catalytic activity
2.4.1. Switching light-off
Switching light-off test is a method for measuring the acti-
vation response from the cold ambient. The hot gas at 470 C
was rapidly introduced into the catalyst retained at 25 C [5].
The space velocity at the catalyst inlet was maintained at
100,000 h1 and air-to-fuel ratio was set at stoichiometic
point. By using this method, an accurate model of the cat-
alytic performance of actual vehicles at cold start is created
for evaluation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD and XPS analyses for LaFePdO3 powder
catalyst
Fig. 3 shows the result of XRD for the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
powder catalysts after oxidation, reduction and re-oxidation
treatments at 800 C. The durable perovskite structure was
confirmed after redox treatments.
The states of Pd on the surface of powder catalysts, after
oxidation, reduction and re-oxidation treatments at 800 C,
were analyzed by XPS. The results are shown in Fig. 4.

Binding energies were corrected based on measured val-
ues for C 1s. The values for Pd0 and binding energy of Pd in
oxidized LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite indicates an extraor-
dinary high oxidized state of Pd3+ or Pd4+, the same as was
previously reported [2]. The Pd in the reduced sample was
found to be in metallic state. In the re-oxidized sample, the

were determined in the comparison with metallic Pd and PdO,
respectively.

and PdO as the standard materials [31].
After oxidation treatment, the chemical shift observed at
the edge position indicates, equal to the XPS analysis that

Fig. 7. Switching light-off performance.
Pd in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite is in a 3+ or 4+ state. The
edge position of the reduced catalyst, on the other hand, is
identical to that of Pd-foil, suggesting that Pd is in a metallic
state. Finally, after re-oxidation treatment, the edge position
shifted back to higher energy.
The radial structure function around Pd was obtained
by Fourier transform of extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) oscillations (Fig. 6). The local structure
parameters of the first nearest neighbor around the Pd in
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 after redox treatments at 800 C, obtained
by a standard EXAFS analysis according to Mckale et al.,
was shown in Table 2.
At first Pd of the sample oxidized at 800 C (800-O), occu-
pies the B-site, in the six-fold coordination with oxygen, of
the unit formula of ABO3 in a perovskite structure.
When the sample was reduced and Pd was segregated
from perovskite crystal to form small metallic particles, the
first nearest peak height corresponding to the PdO bond
got lower, and the second peak corresponding to the PdPd
bond got higher as the reduction temperature increased from
200 C. At 800 C, the peak shows the mixture of PdPd
and PdFe bonds (800-OR). Note that the summation of the
weight both of PdPd and PdFe is only 0.64, it means the
deposited metal particle is very small.
In a re-oxidative atmosphere, the amount of the PdPd
bond decreased from 200 C (Fig. 6). After re-oxidation at
800 C (800-ORO), the PdPd bond disappeared, and the
local structure around Pd is completely the same as that of
the oxidized catalyst (800-O).
The results of XAFS analysis indicates that Pd of Co-
free LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite moves in a completely
reversible manner in subsequent redox fluctuations. The
agglomeration and growth of the metal particles is suppressed
as a result of the structural change due to the inherent fluctu-
ation between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres
in automotive exhaust from common gasoline engines. Also,
it is revealed that this regenerative function of Pd occurred
from unexpectedly low temperatures.
3.3. Catalytic activity in switching light-off
The results of switching light-off performances of the
monolithic catalysts after aging in engine exhaust-gas at
900 C for 100 h were shown in Fig. 7. LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
showed excellent ability to reduce HC emissions during cold
starting. Note that the amount of precious metals was set
to be equivalent for each catalyst. It would be assumed that
the moving of Pd from very low temperatures gave the good
effect for light-off performance.
3.4. Pd particle observation after engine aging
TEM observations of Pd particles of the monolithic cat-
alysts, after aging in engine exhaust-gas at 900 C for 100 h
and cooling down in a reductive atmosphere, were shown in
Fig. 8. The magnification for LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 is 400,000
times and the white bar shows 10 nm, and the magnification
forPd/Al2O3 is100,000timesandthewhitebarshows50 nm.
Pd metallic particles of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 maintained finer
grain size by about 1 nm in diameter. From EXAFS, the aver-
age particle size of Pd particle is also estimated to be about
1.1 nm [32].
However, the particle of Pd on Al2O3 enlarged up to
120 nm, and the average particle diameter by CO chemisorp-
tion was 32 nm, and the crystallite size measured at Pd(1 1 1)
by XRD was 58 nm.
It is confirmed that LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 has an excellent abil-
ity to suppress the grain growth of Pd. Pd keeps its atomic

size by moving in and out of the crystal according to the
characteristic fluctuation of redox atmospheres in automo-
tive exhaust-gas.
3.5. Self-regenerative function of LaFePdO3
It was reported that a LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 perovskite
catalyst has the function of self-regeneration of Pd in the
previous paper [3]. In this paper, it is confirmed that Pd in
a Co-free LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst also moves back and
forth between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the
metallic particle, when exposed to inherent fluctuations of
the actual engine exhaust. Fig. 9 shows a graphic illustration
of the self-regenerative function that is the core technology,
of the intelligent catalyst. This self-regenerative function of
the intelligent catalyst can suppress the grain growth of Pd
and can save amount of precious metals.
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite catalyst has been industrial-
ized for SULEV. The intelligent catalyst is expected as new
catalyst design technology, which can solve the problem of
the precious metal supply and demand.
4. Conclusion
1. From X-ray research, it has been proved that Pd
in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 reversibly moves back and forth
between the B-site in the perovskite structure and the
metal particle lattice.
2. It is revealed that the self-regenerative function of Pd in
the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst occurs from very low tem-
peratures.
3. Self-regenerative function suppresses the grain growth of
precious metals.
4. Light-off performance of the intelligent catalyst is much
better than that of the contemporary catalyst due to the
suppression of Pd grain growth.
5. Rare earth metal containing LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite
catalyst has been industrialized for SULEV (super ultra
low emission vehicle).
6. The intelligent catalyst is one solution for the Pd supply
and demand problem.
