Abstract
The self-regenerative function of precious metals in the intelligent catalyst is an epoch-making technology in the history of automotive catalysts
after the 1970s. The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is studied by X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analyses. The function was
realized through a cyclic movement of Pd between the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) and the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) of the perovskite
crystal in synchronization with the inherent fluctuations between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust
gases. As the result, the growth of Pd particles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle. Moreover, the speed of this function was
measured at the time resolution of a 10 ms by in situ energy dispersive XAFS, and it is proved that the self-regenerative function occurs at an
extremely high speed. Furthermore, the new perovskite catalysts which have the self-regenerative function of Rh and Pt, as well as Pd, are
discussed here. This self-regenerative function provides a new and useful tool for designing the future catalyst technology.

1. Introduction
An ageless catalyst is a kind of philosophers stone for
automotive engineers. In this paper, the newest research on a
self-regenerative intelligent catalyst is described. The catalyst
has the ability to regain its catalytic activity, should this
deteriorate, in the use environment without any auxiliary
treatment [15]. From the viewpoint of intelligent materials
[6], the intelligence of the catalyst may be defined as its ability
to maintain a high performance by adapting its structure,
responding sensitively to environmental changes.
The important role of the automotive three-way catalyst is
widely recognized for the simultaneous conversion of emis-
sions of three pollutants in engine exhaust gases, carbon
monoxide
(CO),
nitrogen
oxides
(NOx),
and
unburned
hydrocarbons (HC) into harmless non-pollutants. The conven-
tional three-way catalyst consists of fine particles of precious
metals dispersed on ceramic support materials such as alumina,
ceria, and zirconia. However, the catalytic activity of such
catalysts deteriorates, owing to the agglomeration and growth
of precious metal particles during use. It is essential to suppress
the growth of precious metal particles to achieve a high
efficiency and to conserve precious metals.
Automotive emissions regulations are getting tighter and
tighter all over the world. The Japanese government has
introduced cleaner emission standards, designated ultra-low-
emission vehicle (J-ULEV) and a new super-ultra-low-
emission vehicle (J-SULEV), which involve, respectively,
50% and 75% reductions in emissions of both HC and NOx in
comparison with the emission regulation 2005. More and more
precious metals must be used to meet these severe standards
when conventional catalyst technologies are applied. In
particular, the demand for Pd for use in automotive catalysts
has increased explosively from 15 to over 150 t per year [7].
This drastic increase is a result of the strengthening of cold-
emission regulations world wide, which has made development

of technologies to reduce the use of precious metals so urgent.
The objective of the development of the intelligent catalyst is to
reduce of palladium use in automotive industries, and to adjust
these demands proportion into the natural source ratio of Pd, Pt,
and Rh.
The intelligent Pd-perovskite catalyst has a greatly improved
durability as a result of the self-regenerative function of Pd
nano-particles. It has been confirmed that the catalytic activity
can be maintained even when the amount of precious metals is
reduced by 7090% [8,9]. A vehicle equipped with the
intelligent catalyst was supplied to the market and succeeded in
achieving J-ULEV standard in 2002. Moreover, the intelligent
catalyst has also succeeded in achieving a new J-SULEV
standard, adopted promptly from January 2004. The production
of clean vehicles equipped with the intelligent catalyst
exceeded 1.5 million units in September 2005. By this
technology, it not only became possible to achieve a drastic
reduction in the cost of catalysts, but also the technology solved
the problem of the supply and demand of precious metals for
automotive applications, which had caused a negative effect on
other industries. The intelligent catalyst now attracts worldwide
attention and provides a new concept for designing the future
catalyst technology. In this paper, Pd-intelligent catalyst
technology is described in detail, including the brand new
result of in situ synchrotron experimental. In addition, it is
further discussed about progressive development of the
technology into Rh and Pt.
2. Elucidation of the self-regenerative function of
palladium-perovskite
A
palladium-containing
perovskite
(LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3;
Pd-perovskite) powder catalyst was prepared by the alkoxide
method [1,3]. Lanthanum and iron ethoxyethylates
{M3+(OC2H4OC2H5)3 (M = La3+ and Fe3+)} were dissolved
in
toluene.
Palladium
acetylacetonate
{Pd2+(CH3COCH-
COCH3)2} was also dissolved in toluene. The amount of Pd
was adjusted to 5 at.% of that of the B-site element of the
perovskite structure. Precipitate containing Pd was obtained by
hydrolysis with deionized water. The precursor was dried and
then
calcined
at
800 8C
for
2 h
in
an
air
to
obtain
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 perovskite powder catalyst containing homo-
geneously distributed precious metal. To prepare the conven-
tional catalysts, powdered g-Al2O3 (SSA = 120 m2 g1) was
impregnated
with
dilute
aqueous
palladium
nitric
acid
{Pd(NO3)2}, dried, and calcined at 500 8C for 1 h in an air.
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 and Pd/g-Al2O3 powders were coated on
the inner wall of a monolithic honeycomb substrate (80 mm in
diameter and 95 mm in length with the grid of 64 cell cm2),
containing the same amounts of Pd (3.26 mg cm3) [1]. The
two monolithic catalysts were attached to each side bank in the
exhaust system of an automotive 4000 cm3 V-8 engine for
simultaneous ageing treatment. The monolithic catalysts were
then exposed to high-temperature exhaust gas at 900 8C for
100 h, by the alternation of a large redox fluctuating
atmosphere (Dl =  4% at 0.6 Hz) around the stoichiometric
point for 870 s and an oxidation atmosphere for 30 s. This
ageing procedure is widely accepted as simulating a driving
strategy for achieving a high fuel economy by introducing fuel
cutoff during deceleration.

high activity during aging, the same as LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3,
whereas the activity of the Pd/alumina catalyst deteriorated by
about10%[1]. Transmissionelectron microscopy(TEM)images
of theaged catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 [1012]. The Pdparticles

on alumina reached sizes of up to 120 nm, whereas only small
metallic particles of about 1 nm in diameter were found on the
perovskite surface. The remarkable suppression of the growth of
metallic particles directly affects the ability of the Pd-perovskite
catalyst to maintain a high catalytic activity.
In order to explain this unique phenomenon, X-ray
absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was carried out at
the bending-magnet beam lines BL01B1 and BL14B1 of the 8-
GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8, Japan. The
powder for the measurement was exposed to the following
treatments. First, the catalyst was oxidized in air at 800 8C for
1 h (800-O). Secondly, the sample was reduced in 2.5% H2 and
7.5% CO balanced with N2 for 1 h at 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, or
800 8C (100-OR, 200-OR, 300-OR, 400-OR, 600-OR and 800-
OR). Finally, the sample was re-oxidized in air for 1 h at the
same temperatures as in the reduction treatment (100-ORO,
200-ORO, 300-ORO, 400-ORO, 600-ORO and 800-ORO) [12
17]. This successive treatment creates a separate model for each
of the key stages of the evolution of the engine exhaust
atmosphere at various temperatures. The XAFS spectra were
measured near the PdK edge in transmission mode because of
the high transmissivity of the X-ray. The photon energy was
calibrated with a Pd foil by assigning the half of edge jump as
24.350 keV. Fig. 3 shows X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES) spectra of the PdK edge for LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
perovskite, after oxidation, reduction, and re-oxidation treat-
ments at 800 8C, together with the XANES spectra of Pd-foil
and PdO as reference materials [18].
The local structure parameters of the first nearest neighbor
around the Pd in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 after redox treatments at
800 8C are shown in Table 1 [18]. The temperature dependency
of the radial structure function around Pd is shown in Fig. 4
[1216]. At first, Pd in the sample oxidized at 800 8C (800-O)
occupied the B-site, in the six-fold coordination with oxygen,
of the unit formula of ABO3 in the perovskite structure. When
the sample was reduced and Pd was segregated from the
perovskite crystal to form small metallic particles, the first
nearest peak height corresponding to the PdO bond decreased,
and the second peak corresponding to the PdPd bond increased
as the reduction temperature increased from 200 8C. At 800 8C,
the peak showed a mixture of PdPd and PdFe bonds (800-
OR). Note that the summation of the weight of both the PdPd
and PdFe bonds is only 0.64, implying that the deposited metal
particle is very small. In a re-oxidation atmosphere, the height
of the PdPd bond decreased from 200 8C (Fig. 5) [18]. After
re-oxidation at 800 8C (800-ORO), the PdPd bond disap-
peared, and the local structure around Pd was identical to that of
the oxidized catalyst (800-O).
For comparison with XAFS, the behavior of surface Pd in
the reduction treatment was also analyzed by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS). This showed that the ratio of
metallic Pd on the surface is higher than that in the bulk
structure within the temperature range 100300 8C (Fig. 5)
[1214,17]. This suggests that reductive segregation of Pd
begins near the surface, and then Pd from the bulk of the
perovskite framework segregates later. The results of XAFS and
XPS analyses indicate that Pd of the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
perovskite moves in a completely reversible manner during
sequential redox fluctuations. In addition, it is revealed that this
regenerative function of Pd occurs from very low temperatures
[13,17]. The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is
illustrated in Fig. 6 [9].
3. Direct observation of rapid movement of palladium
It became clear that a Pd-peovskite catalyst can maintain
high activity according to the grain growth control effect of Pd
by the self-regeneration function. There are two left-behind big
questions here. The first question: Can this movement of Pd
respond a quick change like reduction-oxidation fluctuation of
an actual automotive engine exhaust gas? The second question:
Is this self-regeneration function the special phenomenon,
which may happen only to Pd? Or is it possible to develop as
universal catalyst technology, which may happen also to Rh and
Pt? In order to answer the first question, the in situ measurement
using energy dispersive XAFS (DXAFS) was carried out at
beamline ID-24 in ESRF, France [19]. The spectra were
consecutively measured in 10 ms time resolution. The silicon

polychrometer crystal was set to the Bragg configuration with
(3 1 1) to obtain dispersed X-ray beam near Pd K-edge
(24.350 keV). A CCD camera was used as a detector to observe
a fluorescent screen [19,20].
For DXAFS, LaFe0.9Pd0.1O3 and Pd/g-Al2O3 containing the
same amount (4.3 mass%) of Pd were prepared by the alkoxide
method. A pellet of each sample was placed in quartz in situ
cells (f = 5.0 mm); 50% O2 (balanced with He) was used as the
oxidizing gas and 50% H2 (balanced with He) was used as the
reducing gas. The total gas flow rate was set at 100 cm3 min1.
This condition was considered to be equivalent to an actual
engine-exhaust gas (Table 2) [21]. A thermal conductivity
detector (TCD), which detected the gases change, was set in
front of the pellet to send the trigger signal starting the
measurement. Just after switching the gas flow from oxidizing
through He to reducing, and from reducing through He to
oxidizing, the spectra were measured with a 10 ms-resolution
during 5 s at a programmed temperature of 400 8C. After
measurement under oxidizing conditions, the temperature was
raised to 700 8C in keeping an oxidizing gas flow for 30 s, to
completely restore the precious metal to the perovskite
structure. The measurement was carried out continuously over
10 repetitions of the reducingoxidizing cycle.
Fig. 7 shows the temporal dependence of coordination
number (CN) of PdO and PdPd bonds. The CN of PdO for
LaFePdO3 originated from the B-site of the perovskite structure
is 6, while that of PdO bond for Pd/Al2O3 originated from PdO
is 4. The CN of PdPd bond originated from the metallic Pd
should be 12 theoretically. In the reduction process, the CN of
the PdO bond for LaFePdO3 perovskite rapidly decreases, and
over 80% of Pd in the perovskite crystal was reduced at 400 8C.
Of particular interest, the generation of PdPd bonds in
LaFePdO3 was instantaneous, and the CN of PdPd bond was
maintained with the small value about 6 after 1 s. The diameter
of metallic Pd particles segregated from LaFePdO3 was
calculated to be about 0.8 nm. On the other hand, the CN of the
PdPd bond of Pd/Al2O3 increased continuously, and it was
estimated to be 8, corresponding to about 1.3 nm of diameter.
Specific surface area (SSA) of Pd/Al2O3 was ten times as large
as that of LaFePdO3. However, the Pd particles size of
LaFePdO3 is smaller. It was thought that there was a certain
interaction between Pd particles and LaFePdO3 matrix. The CN
changes both of PdO and PdPd bonds for LaFePdO3 were
faster than the changes for Pd/Al2O3. That is, the redox changes
in Pd that accompany its segregation from the perovskite crystal
are faster than the simple reduction from PdO to Pd on alumina.
Here it is proved that the dynamic movements of Pd with the
perovskite crystal can respond to the control frequency (1
4 Hz) of an actual gasoline engine.
4. Self-regenerative function of rhodium and platinum
To
study
the
self-regenerative
properties,
perovskite
catalysts containing Rh or Pt were prepared by the alkoxide
method. The oxidation (O), reduction (OR) and re-oxidation
(ORO) treatments of the catalyst were carried out at 800 8C.
XAFS measurements were also carried at BL-01B1 and BL-
14B1 in SPring-8, to determine the distribution of Rh and Pt in
the perovskite crystal structure [22].
The XANES spectrum near Rh K-edge for LaFe0.95Rh0.05O3
after each treatment is shown in Fig. 8a, and the calculated
radial structure function around Rh is shown in Fig. 8b. All the
Rh of LaFe0.95Rh0.05O3 was present as a solid-solution in
perovskite after oxidation, but it segregated with about 35% of
Rh even after reduction at 800 8C. By replacing the perovskite
from La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3, the segregation of metallic
Rh particles after reduction is significantly improved (Fig. 9b).

CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3 shifted towards the energy for metallic Rh
powder, implying that a greater proportion of Rh segregates and
is in the metallic state (Fig. 9a).
The XANES spectrum near Pt LIII-edge for CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3
after each treatment is shown in Fig. 10a, and the calculated
radial structure function around Rh is shown in Fig. 10b. All
the Pt of CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3 was present as a solid-solution in
perovskite in oxidation, segregated to metallic Pt particles in
reduction, and the Pt particles were restored in the perovskite
framework completely in re-oxidation at 800 8C. Thus,
CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3 and CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3 show the excellent
self-regeneration function. The A2+B4+O3 perovskites, of
which CaTiO3 is a natural mineral representative, are not
considered to have catalytic activity. It is mentioned especially
that the various oxides, which were not used as a catalyst until
now, can be used effectively. However, neither Rh nor Pt forms
a solid solution in SrZrO3, and not all A2+B4+O3 perovskite-
type oxides are effective [22].
Finally, the effect on the suppression of growth of Pt
particles in an actual engine exhaust gas was investigated.
CaTi0.98Pt0.02O3 and Pd/g-Al2O3 catalysts were exposed to
actual engine exhaust gas at 900 8C for 100 h and then the Pt
particles were examined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Fig. 11) [22]. The Pt particles on alumina grew to over
100 nm, whereas only fine metallic particles about 13 nm in
diameter were found on the perovskite surface. It is proved that
a precious metal-containing perovskite catalyst can function as
an intelligent catalyst that regenerates itself and maintains a
high activity by the cycle forming a solid-solution and
segregation even in a harsh redox environment at high
temperatures where precious metals normally suffer grain
growth, causing deterioration in their catalytic activity.
It is confirmed that the precious metals Pd, Rh, and Pt in a
Intelligent catalyst move back and forth between the B-site in
the perovskite structure and the metallic nanoparticles when
exposed to inherent redox fluctuations of the actual engine
exhaust, and thus the catalytic activity is maintained during the
lifetime of a vehicle (Fig. 12). The perovskite-type oxides are
very useful because of their structural stability and the
abundance of possible combinations. In designing an intelligent
catalyst, the following technology is important. The oxide,
which makes perovskite representative, should maintain a
stable structure to heal the precious metal at high temperatures
in a redox environment. Under reductive conditions, the
precious metal emerges from the framework of the perovskite
to form metallic clusters or nanoparticles. Under oxidative
conditions, the precious metal comes back to the perovskite
framework to refresh itself. The precious metal repeats the
cycle of solid solution and segregation responding to the
inherent cycling between an oxidative and a reductive
environment.
In addition, a self-regenerative Pd-perovskite catalyst has
been reported by the research group of S.V. Ley and M.D. Smith
to show a high activity and a long life in organic synthesis
reactions, such as the Suzuki coupling [23,24]. The applications
of this technology could be extended not only to pharmaceu-
tical synthesis, but also to a diesel after-treatment; such
technology will be in increasing demand as it solves the
socioeconomic problem relating to the supply and demand for
precious metals.

5. Conclusion
The modern gasoline engine has adopted a feedback control
system that uses an oxygen sensor for three-way catalysts to
function, and the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas
component is always fluctuating. In the intelligent catalyst, all
the precious metals used in automotive catalysts, Pd, Rh and Pt,
are always rejuvenated itself into an active state in a rapid
fluctuation typically encountered in the exhaust gas from the
gasoline engine, and thereby degradation of the catalyst is
prevented. The intelligent catalyst provides a new material
design technology, and it is expected that this technology will
contribute considerably to the solution of the supply-and-
demand problems of precious metals in the automotive
industries. The intelligent catalyst is also expected to be an
important technology, not only for automobiles, but also for
various internal combustion engines. By further development of
this technology, a vehicle that emits an exhaust gas that is
cleaner than ambient air could be achieved. Intelligent catalyst
technology is expected to be the key that opens the window for
clean air to blow in.
