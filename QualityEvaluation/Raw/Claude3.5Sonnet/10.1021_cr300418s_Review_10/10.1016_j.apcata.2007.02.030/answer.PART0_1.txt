[1] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology."

[2] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."

[3] "The reaction of the niobium cations with the structural defects in the NiO lattice disorders the crystal structure and induces a rupture of the larger platelets into smaller ones, thus causing the reduction of crystallite size observed in the Nb-doped catalytic sample."

[4] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Structural changes: Niobium doping causes significant changes in the crystalline morphology of NiO. It leads to the formation of a NiNb solid solution through substitution of Ni2+ cations and/or filling of cationic vacancies in the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by Nb5+ cations.

2. Reduction in crystallite size: The reaction of niobium cations with structural defects in the NiO lattice disorders the crystal structure and causes larger platelets to break into smaller ones, resulting in reduced crystallite size.

3. Increased surface area: The reduction in crystallite size leads to an increase in the surface area of the catalyst, which can enhance its per-weight activity in the ethane ODH reaction.

4. Improved selectivity: The elimination or reduction of vacant sites on NiO through their reaction with niobium cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH. This is because the vacant sites are associated with unselective oxygen species that promote total oxidation to CO2.

5. Formation of new phases: At higher niobium concentrations, new phases such as NiNb2O6 can form, which may have different catalytic properties.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems include:

1. Complexity of the system: The presence of multiple phases (NiNb solid solution, Nb-rich disordered phase, and potentially NiNb2O6) makes it difficult to isolate and study the contribution of each phase to the overall catalytic performance.

2. Nanoscale effects: The formation of nanostructures and the changes in surface properties at the nanoscale may not be fully captured by theoretical models that are based on bulk properties.

3. Dynamic nature of the catalyst: The catalyst structure and composition may change under reaction conditions, making it challenging to correlate ex-situ characterization with in-situ performance.

4. Influence of synthesis conditions: The final structure and properties of the catalyst can be highly dependent on the synthesis conditions, which may not be fully accounted for in theoretical predictions.

5. Limited understanding of active sites: The exact nature of the active sites for ethane ODH on these catalysts is not fully understood, making it difficult to predict catalytic behavior accurately.

These challenges highlight the need for advanced in-situ characterization techniques and more sophisticated modeling approaches that can account for the complexity and dynamic nature of these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，在多个方面显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为：

1. 结构变化：铌掺杂导致NiO的晶体形态发生显著变化。它通过Nb5+阳离子替代Ni2+阳离子和/或填充非化学计量比NiO晶格中的阳离子空位，形成NiNb固溶体。

2. 晶粒尺寸减小：铌阳离子与NiO晶格中的结构缺陷反应，使晶体结构变得无序，并导致较大的晶片破碎成较小的晶片，从而减小晶粒尺寸。

3. 比表面积增加：晶粒尺寸的减小导致催化剂的比表面积增加，这可以提高其在乙烷ODH反应中的单位重量活性。

4. 选择性提高：通过与铌阳离子反应来消除或减少NiO上的空位，这是催化剂在乙烷ODH过程中对乙烯具有高选择性的原因。这是因为空位与非选择性氧物种有关，这些氧物种会促进完全氧化成CO2。

5. 新相的形成：在较高的铌浓度下，可能形成如NiNb2O6等新相，这些新相可能具有不同的催化性能。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，理论预测与实验观察的协调面临以下挑战：

1. 系统的复杂性：存在多个相（NiNb固溶体、富铌无序相和可能的NiNb2O6），这使得难以分离和研究每个相对整体催化性能的贡献。

2. 纳米尺度效应：纳米结构的形成和纳米尺度上的表面性质变化可能无法被基于体相性质的理论模型完全捕捉。

3. 催化剂的动态性质：催化剂的结构和组成可能在反应条件下发生变化，这使得难以将非原位表征与原位性能相关联。

4. 合成条件的影响：催化剂的最终结构和性能可能高度依赖于合成条件，这在理论预测中可能无法完全考虑到。

5. 对活性位点的有限理解：这些催化剂上乙烷ODH的确切活性位点性质尚未完全理解，这使得难以准确预测催化行为。

这些挑战突出了对先进原位表征技术和更复杂建模方法的需求，这些方法能够考虑到这些催化系统的复杂性和动态性质。
