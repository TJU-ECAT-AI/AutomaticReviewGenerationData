          [1] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[2] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "The reaction of the foreign species (Nb5+) with these NiO-defects leading to the formation of two distinct structural features. On the areas of low-density population of cationic vacancies, a small amount of Nb is incorporated in the NiO host lattice, causing distortion of the crystallographic planes and rupture of the larger crystallites that consequently leads to significantly lower crystal size (in the nanorange) and contributes to the higher surface area of the NiNbO catalysts."

[4] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology."

[5] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."

[6] "The reaction of the niobium cations with the structural defects in the NiO lattice disorders the crystal structure and induces a rupture of the larger platelets into smaller ones, thus causing the reduction of crystallite size observed in the Nb-doped catalytic sample."

[7] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

[8] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Formation of distinct structural phases: Niobium cations react with cationic vacancies in NiO to form two main phases - a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, retaining its cubic structure, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase that acts as a precursor for NiNb2O6 formation.

2. Reduction of structural defects: The interaction between niobium ions and NiO structural defects reduces these defects, which correlates with increased selectivity towards ethylene production. This is because the defects typically lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O-) that cause total oxidation to CO2.

3. Modification of crystal structure: Incorporation of Nb causes distortion of NiO crystallographic planes and rupture of larger crystallites, resulting in significantly smaller crystal sizes in the nanometer range.

4. Increased surface area: The reduction in crystal size contributes to a higher overall surface area of the NiNbO catalysts, enhancing their catalytic performance.

5. Improved selectivity: The elimination or reduction of vacant sites on NiO through their reaction with niobium cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH.

6. Modification of oxygen species: Incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice reduces the material's non-stoichiometry and consequently decreases the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems include:

1. Multiple simultaneous effects: Niobium doping causes several concurrent changes in the NiO structure and properties, making it difficult to isolate individual effects.

2. Nanoscale phenomena: The formation of nanostructures and the behavior of materials at the nanoscale may not always align with bulk property predictions.

3. Complex phase interactions: The presence of multiple phases (NiNb solid solution, Nb-rich distorted phase, NiNb2O6) and their interactions complicate the system beyond simple theoretical models.

4. Dynamic nature of the catalyst: The catalyst structure and composition may change under reaction conditions, making it challenging to correlate ex-situ characterization with in-situ performance.

5. Surface vs. bulk properties: The catalytic activity is primarily a surface phenomenon, while many characterization techniques and theoretical models may focus on bulk properties, leading to potential discrepancies.

6. Limited understanding of active sites: The exact nature of the active sites for ethane ODH on these catalysts is not fully understood, making it difficult to predict catalytic behavior accurately.

These challenges highlight the need for advanced in-situ characterization techniques and more sophisticated modeling approaches that can account for the complexity and dynamic nature of these catalytic systems.

          铌氧化物的多样性质在多个方面显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为：

1. 形成不同的结构相：铌阳离子与NiO中的阳离子空位反应，形成两种主要相 - 一种是铌掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体，保持其立方结构，另一种是高度扭曲的富铌相，作为NiNb2O6形成的前驱体。

2. 减少结构缺陷：铌离子与NiO结构缺陷的相互作用减少了这些缺陷，这与乙烯生成选择性的提高相关。这是因为这些缺陷通常会导致强氧化性亲电氧物种（O-）的形成，造成完全氧化为CO2。

3. 改变晶体结构：铌的掺入导致NiO晶格平面扭曲和大晶粒破裂，使晶粒尺寸显著降低到纳米级别。

4. 增加表面积：晶粒尺寸的减小导致NiNbO催化剂整体表面积增加，提高了其催化性能。

5. 提高选择性：通过与铌阳离子反应来消除或减少NiO上的空位，这是催化剂在乙烷ODH过程中对乙烯具有高选择性的原因。

6. 改变氧物种：铌掺入氧化镍晶格减少了材料的非化学计量比，从而减少了负责将乙烷完全氧化成CO2的亲电氧物种（O-）的丰度。

在研究这些复杂催化体系时，理论预测与实验观察之间的调和面临以下挑战：

1. 多重同时效应：铌掺杂同时引起NiO结构和性质的多个变化，难以分离单个效应。

2. 纳米尺度现象：纳米结构的形成和材料在纳米尺度的行为可能与体相性质预测不一致。

3. 复杂的相互作用：多相（NiNb固溶体、富铌扭曲相、NiNb2O6）的存在及其相互作用使系统比简单的理论模型更为复杂。

4. 催化剂的动态性质：催化剂的结构和组成可能在反应条件下发生变化，这使得难以将非原位表征与原位性能相关联。

5. 表面与体相性质：催化活性主要是表面现象，而许多表征技术和理论模型可能集中于体相性质，导致潜在的差异。

6. 对活性位点的有限理解：这些催化剂上乙烷ODH的确切活性位点性质尚未完全理解，这使得难以准确预测催化行为。

这些挑战突出了对先进原位表征技术和更复杂建模方法的需求，这些方法能够考虑到这些催化系统的复杂性和动态性质。
