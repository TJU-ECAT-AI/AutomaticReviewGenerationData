[1] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[2] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "The reaction of the foreign species (Nb5+) with these NiO-defects leading to the formation of two distinct structural features. On the areas of low-density population of cationic vacancies, a small amount of Nb is incorporated in the NiO host lattice, causing distortion of the crystallographic planes and rupture of the larger crystallites that consequently leads to significantly lower crystal size (in the nanorange) and contributes to the higher surface area of the NiNbO catalysts."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Formation of distinct structural phases: Niobium cations react with cationic vacancies in NiO to form two main phases - a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase that acts as a precursor for NiNb2O6 formation. 

2. Reduction of structural defects: The interaction between niobium ions and NiO defects reduces structural defects, which correlates with increased selectivity towards ethylene production. This is because the defects typically lead to formation of strong oxidizing species that cause total oxidation to CO2.

3. Modification of crystal structure: Incorporation of Nb causes distortion of NiO crystallographic planes and rupture of larger crystallites, resulting in significantly smaller crystal sizes in the nanometer range. 

4. Increased surface area: The reduction in crystal size contributes to a higher overall surface area of the NiNbO catalysts.

5. Improved catalytic performance: The elimination of NiO structural defects by niobium doping is responsible for the high selectivity to ethylene, while the increased surface area enhances the per-weight activity of the catalysts.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex systems likely arise from:

1. Multiple simultaneous effects: Niobium doping causes several concurrent changes in the NiO structure and properties, making it difficult to isolate individual effects.

2. Nanoscale phenomena: The formation of nanostructures and the behavior of materials at the nanoscale may not always align with bulk property predictions.

3. Complex phase interactions: The presence of multiple phases (NiNb solid solution, Nb-rich distorted phase, NiNb2O6) and their interactions complicate the system beyond simple theoretical models.

4. Concentration-dependent effects: The impact of niobium doping varies with concentration, leading to different structural features and catalytic behaviors at different Nb/Ni ratios.

5. Surface vs. bulk properties: The catalytic activity is primarily a surface phenomenon, while many characterization techniques and theoretical models may focus on bulk properties, leading to potential discrepancies.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢反应的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 形成不同的结构相：铌阳离子与NiO中的阳离子空位反应，形成两种主要相 - 一种是铌掺入NiO晶格的NiNb固溶体，另一种是高度扭曲的富铌相，作为NiNb2O6形成的前驱体。

2. 减少结构缺陷：铌离子与NiO缺陷的相互作用减少了结构缺陷，这与乙烯生成选择性的提高相关。这是因为这些缺陷通常会导致强氧化物种的形成，造成完全氧化为CO2。

3. 改变晶体结构：铌的掺入导致NiO晶格平面扭曲和大晶粒破裂，使晶粒尺寸显著降低到纳米级别。

4. 增加表面积：晶粒尺寸的减小导致NiNbO催化剂整体表面积增加。

5. 提高催化性能：铌掺杂消除NiO结构缺陷使得催化剂对乙烯具有高选择性，而增加的表面积则提高了催化剂的质量比活性。

在研究这些复杂催化体系时，理论预测与实验观察之间的调和面临以下挑战：

1. 多重同时效应：铌掺杂同时引起NiO结构和性质的多个变化，难以分离单个效应。

2. 纳米尺度现象：纳米结构的形成和材料在纳米尺度的行为可能与体相性质预测不一致。

3. 复杂的相互作用：多相（NiNb固溶体、富铌扭曲相、NiNb2O6）的存在及其相互作用使系统比简单的理论模型更为复杂。

4. 浓度依赖效应：铌掺杂的影响随浓度变化，在不同的Nb/Ni比例下导致不同的结构特征和催化行为。

5. 表面与体相性质：催化活性主要是表面现象，而许多表征技术和理论模型可能集中于体相性质，导致潜在的差异。
