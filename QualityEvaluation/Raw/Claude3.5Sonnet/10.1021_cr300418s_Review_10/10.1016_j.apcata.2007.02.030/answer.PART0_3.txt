[1] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[2] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Formation of distinct structural phases: Niobium cations react with cationic vacancies in NiO to form two distinct phases - a NiNb solid solution where Nb is incorporated into the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase that acts as a precursor for NiNb2O6 formation.

2. Reduction of structural defects: The interaction between niobium ions and NiO structural defects leads to a reduction in these defects, which is correlated with high selectivity towards ethylene production in the ethane ODH reaction.

3. Modification of oxygen species: Incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice reduces the material's non-stoichiometry and consequently decreases the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

4. Improved catalytic performance: The reduction of structural defects and modification of oxygen species results in higher selectivity towards ethylene and improved overall catalytic performance in ethane ODH.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations may arise due to:

1. Complex structural changes: The formation of multiple phases and the intricate relationship between structural modifications and catalytic performance can be difficult to model accurately.

2. Non-uniform distribution: The inhomogeneous distribution of Nb within the NiO structure may lead to localized effects that are challenging to predict theoretically.

3. Surface vs. bulk properties: Differences between surface and bulk properties of the doped catalysts may complicate the correlation between theoretical models and experimental results.

4. Dynamic nature of the catalytic process: The catalytic reaction environment may induce further changes in the catalyst structure, which can be difficult to account for in theoretical predictions.

These factors contribute to the complexity of studying NiNbO catalytic systems and highlight the importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

铌氧化物的多样性质对其作为氧化镍催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为有显著影响，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 形成不同的结构相：铌阳离子与氧化镍中的阳离子空位反应，形成两种不同的相 - 一种是铌掺入氧化镍晶格的NiNb固溶体，另一种是高度扭曲的富铌相，作为NiNb2O6形成的前驱体。

2. 减少结构缺陷：铌离子与氧化镍结构缺陷的相互作用导致这些缺陷的减少，这与乙烷氧化脱氢反应中乙烯高选择性相关。

3. 改变氧物种：铌掺入氧化镍晶格减少了材料的非化学计量比，从而减少了负责将乙烷完全氧化成CO2的亲电氧物种（O-）的丰度。

4. 提高催化性能：结构缺陷的减少和氧物种的改变导致乙烯选择性提高，整体催化性能改善。

在理论预测与实验观察的调和过程中可能出现以下挑战：

1. 复杂的结构变化：多相的形成以及结构修饰与催化性能之间的复杂关系可能难以准确建模。

2. 非均匀分布：铌在氧化镍结构中的不均匀分布可能导致难以理论预测的局部效应。

3. 表面与体相性质差异：掺杂催化剂的表面和体相性质之间的差异可能使理论模型与实验结果的相关性变得复杂。

4. 催化过程的动态性质：催化反应环境可能引起催化剂结构的进一步变化，这在理论预测中难以考虑到。

这些因素共同构成了研究NiNbO催化体系的复杂性，并突出了结合理论和实验方法以全面理解其在乙烷氧化脱氢中行为的重要性。
