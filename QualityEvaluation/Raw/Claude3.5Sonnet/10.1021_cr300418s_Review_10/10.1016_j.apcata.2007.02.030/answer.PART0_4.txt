[1] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology."

[2] "Addition of niobium leads to the reaction of the foreign species (Nb5+) with these NiO-defects leading to the formation of two distinct structural features."

[3] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

[4] "According to literature [11,18,19], the non-stoichiometry of NiO renders the surface able to accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen species (O) on the surface, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. When added to NiO, niobium causes major changes in the crystalline structure, reacting with NiO defects to form two distinct structural features. This interaction reduces vacant sites on NiO, which is key to improving catalyst selectivity for ethylene production.

The main challenge in studying these complex catalytic systems arises from reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations. While theory might predict certain behaviors based on niobium's various stable forms and oxidation states, the actual interactions within the NiO lattice create complex nanostructures that are difficult to isolate and study independently. 

The formation of a NiNb solid solution and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase complicates the analysis, as it becomes challenging to attribute catalytic performance to specific structural features. Additionally, the role of the Nb-rich structural feature in catalytic performance remains unclear, highlighting the difficulty in isolating and evaluating individual phases within these complex mixed oxide systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。当添加到NiO中时，铌会导致晶体结构发生重大变化，与NiO缺陷反应形成两种不同的结构特征。这种相互作用减少了NiO上的空位，这是提高催化剂对乙烯生产选择性的关键。

在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，主要挑战来自于将理论预测与实验观察相协调。虽然理论可能基于铌的各种稳定形式和氧化态预测某些行为，但在NiO晶格内的实际相互作用创造了难以分离和独立研究的复杂纳米结构。

NiNb固溶体和高度扭曲的富Nb相的形成使分析变得复杂，因为很难将催化性能归因于特定的结构特征。此外，富Nb结构特征在催化性能中的作用仍不清楚，这突出了在这些复杂的混合氧化物系统中分离和评估单个相的困难。
