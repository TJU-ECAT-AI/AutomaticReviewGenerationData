[1] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology."

[2] "EDS analysis on each of the two distinct morphologies (included as insets in Fig. 4) shows that phase I is comprised of Nb and Ni in an atomic ratio of 0.1, while phase II is enriched in niobium with Nb and Ni ranging between 1:1 and 2:1 ratio."

[3] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."

[4] "The reaction of the niobium cations with the structural defects in the NiO lattice disorders the crystal structure and induces a rupture of the larger platelets into smaller ones, thus causing the reduction of crystallite size observed in the Nb-doped catalytic sample."

[5] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Crystalline morphology changes: Niobium doping causes significant alterations in the crystal structure of NiO.

2. Formation of multiple phases: Two distinct phases are formed - a NiNb solid solution and a Nb-rich phase.

3. Lattice substitution and vacancy filling: Nb5+ cations substitute Ni2+ in the host lattice and/or fill cationic vacancies in non-stoichiometric NiO.

4. Crystal size reduction: The reaction between niobium and NiO structural defects leads to disorder and rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones.

5. Improved selectivity: The elimination or reduction of vacant sites on NiO through reaction with niobium results in higher selectivity to ethylene during ethane ODH.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may arise from:

1. Multiple phases: The presence of different phases (NiNb solid solution and Nb-rich phase) complicates the analysis and modeling of the system.

2. Structural complexity: The intricate interplay between lattice substitution, vacancy filling, and crystal size reduction makes it difficult to isolate individual effects.

3. Composition variability: The varying ratios of Nb to Ni in different phases add another layer of complexity to the system.

4. Dynamic nature: The catalytic process itself may induce further changes in the material, making it challenging to maintain consistency between theoretical models and experimental results.

5. Multiscale effects: The interplay between nanoscale structural changes and macroscale catalytic performance presents challenges in developing comprehensive models that bridge these scales.

铌氧化物的多样性质对其作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为有显著影响，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 晶体形态变化：铌掺杂导致NiO晶体结构发生显著变化。

2. 多相形成：形成了两种不同的相 - NiNb固溶体和富铌相。

3. 晶格替换和空位填充：Nb5+阳离子替代主晶格中的Ni2+和/或填充非化学计量比NiO中的阳离子空位。

4. 晶体尺寸减小：铌与NiO结构缺陷之间的反应导致晶体结构无序，并使较大晶体破裂成较小晶体。

5. 选择性提高：通过与铌的反应消除或减少NiO上的空位，提高了乙烷ODH过程中对乙烯的选择性。

在研究这些复杂催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察之间的调和面临以下挑战：

1. 多相存在：不同相（NiNb固溶体和富铌相）的存在使系统分析和建模变得复杂。

2. 结构复杂性：晶格替换、空位填充和晶体尺寸减小之间的复杂相互作用使得难以分离单个效应。

3. 成分可变性：不同相中Nb与Ni比例的变化为系统增加了另一层复杂性。

4. 动态特性：催化过程本身可能引起材料的进一步变化，使理论模型与实验结果之间的一致性维持变得具有挑战性。

5. 多尺度效应：纳米尺度结构变化与宏观尺度催化性能之间的相互作用，在开发能够桥接这些尺度的综合模型方面带来了挑战。
