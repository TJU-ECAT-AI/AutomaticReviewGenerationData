          [1] "We have recently reported [1315] the development of highly active and selective nickel-based catalysts for the efficient dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in an oxidizing environment."

[2] "NiNbO exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while NiLiO demonstrated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%."

[3] "Our previous investigations [14] on the NiNbO system revealed that surface-exposed nickel sites constitute the active centers for the activation of the paraffinic substrate."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[6] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[7] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides, particularly their high valence state (+5), significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). When introduced into the NiO structure, niobium forms a solid solution, modifying the NiO lattice and its catalytic properties. The high valence of niobium introduces extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, which reduces the concentration of unselective electrophilic oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity and higher ethylene selectivity.

NiNbO catalysts exhibit the best catalytic performance among the studied dopants, with a 46% ethene yield at 400°C. This superior performance is attributed to the ability of niobium to tune the catalytic properties of NiO effectively. The surface-exposed nickel sites in the NiNbO system constitute the active centers for the activation of the paraffinic substrate.

The main challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in these complex catalytic systems include:

1. Understanding the exact mechanism by which niobium modifies the NiO structure and its catalytic properties.
2. Characterizing the specific interactions between niobium and nickel atoms, as well as the formation of new active sites.
3. Investigating the extent of solid solution formation, the distribution of niobium within the NiO lattice, and the potential formation of new phases.
4. Studying the influence of niobium on oxygen mobility and reactivity in the catalyst, particularly the balance between oxygen availability for the reaction and the prevention of over-oxidation.

While the general principles of how niobium dopants improve NiO catalysts for ethane ODH are understood, the specific atomic-level interactions and their consequent effects on catalytic performance present ongoing challenges in fully reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in these complex systems.

          铌氧化物的多样性质，特别是其高价态（+5），显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的行为。当引入NiO结构时，铌形成固溶体，改变NiO晶格及其催化性能。铌的高价态在NiO晶格中引入额外的正电荷，这降低了非选择性亲电氧物种的浓度，从而增强乙烷ODH活性并提高乙烯选择性。

NiNbO催化剂在研究的掺杂剂中表现出最佳的催化性能，在400°C时乙烯产率达到46%。这种优异的性能归因于铌有效调节NiO催化性能的能力。NiNbO系统中暴露在表面的镍位点构成了活化烷烃底物的活性中心。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，调和理论预测与实验观察之间的主要挑战包括：

1. 理解铌如何精确地改变NiO结构及其催化性能的机制。
2. 表征铌和镍原子之间的具体相互作用，以及新活性位点的形成。
3. 研究固溶体形成的程度、铌在NiO晶格中的分布以及潜在的新相形成。
4. 研究铌对催化剂中氧的移动性和反应性的影响，特别是反应所需氧的可用性与防止过度氧化之间的平衡。

虽然铌掺杂剂如何改善NiO催化剂用于乙烷ODH的一般原理是已知的，但具体的原子级相互作用及其对催化性能的影响仍然是在这些复杂系统中完全调和理论预测与实验观察的持续挑战。
