[1] "We have recently reported [1315] the development of highly active and selective nickel-based catalysts for the efficient dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in an oxidizing environment."

[2] "Our previous investigations [14] on the NiNbO system revealed that surface-exposed nickel sites constitute the active centers for the activation of the paraffinic substrate."

[3] "NiNb exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C"

[4] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[5] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides and their various stable forms and oxidation states. However, it does discuss some aspects of how niobium influences NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation:

Niobium doping of NiO creates highly active and selective catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene. The NiNbO system showed the best catalytic performance among the studied dopants, with a 46% ethylene yield at 400°C. 

The catalytic properties of NiO can be tuned by doping with different metals. The valence of the dopant plays a crucial role in modifying the catalyst's behavior. Higher valence dopants like niobium decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals in NiO, which enhances ethane ODH activity and selectivity.

The main challenge in studying these complex catalytic systems appears to be understanding the precise mechanisms by which different dopants modify NiO's properties and catalytic behavior. While the study provides correlations between dopant properties and catalyst performance, it does not delve into detailed theoretical predictions or discuss challenges in reconciling theory with experiments for these systems.

该文献没有提供关于铌氧化物的多样性质及其各种稳定形态和氧化态的详细信息。但是,它确实讨论了铌如何影响用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO催化剂的一些方面:

NiO掺杂铌可以创造出高活性和高选择性的乙烷脱氢制乙烯催化剂。在研究的掺杂剂中,NiNbO体系表现出最佳的催化性能,在400°C时乙烯产率达到46%。

通过掺杂不同的金属可以调节NiO的催化性能。掺杂剂的价态在改变催化剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用。像铌这样的高价态掺杂剂会减少NiO中非选择性的亲电氧自由基,从而提高乙烷ODH活性和选择性。

研究这些复杂催化体系的主要挑战似乎在于理解不同掺杂剂修饰NiO性质和催化行为的精确机制。虽然该研究提供了掺杂剂性质与催化剂性能之间的相关性,但没有深入探讨这些体系的详细理论预测或讨论调和理论与实验结果的挑战。
