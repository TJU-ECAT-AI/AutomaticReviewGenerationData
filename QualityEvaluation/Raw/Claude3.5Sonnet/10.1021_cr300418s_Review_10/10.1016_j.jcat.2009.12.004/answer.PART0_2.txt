[1] "We have recently reported [1315] the development of highly active and selective nickel-based catalysts for the efficient dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in an oxidizing environment."

[2] "NiNb O exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while NiLiO demonstrated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%."

[3] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[4] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium's high valence state (+5) plays a crucial role in modifying the NiO lattice structure and oxygen species, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complex interactions between the dopant, the host NiO lattice, and the resulting oxygen species. While theory predicts that higher valence dopants should reduce electrophilic oxygen species and improve selectivity, the actual behavior of the catalyst depends on multiple factors such as dopant concentration, preparation method, and reaction conditions.

The study demonstrates that NiNb mixed oxides exhibit the best catalytic performance among the tested materials, suggesting that niobium's properties are particularly well-suited for enhancing ethane ODH activity. However, fully understanding and predicting the exact behavior of these complex catalytic systems requires extensive experimental work and advanced characterization techniques to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and practical outcomes.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态，显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为。铌的高价态（+5）在改变NiO晶格结构和氧物种方面起着关键作用，从而提高了催化性能。

在理论预测与实验观察之间进行调和的主要挑战在于掺杂剂、NiO主体晶格以及由此产生的氧物种之间的复杂相互作用。虽然理论预测高价掺杂剂应该减少亲电氧物种并提高选择性，但催化剂的实际行为取决于多个因素，如掺杂剂浓度、制备方法和反应条件。

研究表明，在测试的材料中，NiNb混合氧化物表现出最佳的催化性能，这表明铌的特性特别适合增强乙烷ODH活性。然而，要充分理解和预测这些复杂催化系统的确切行为，需要进行广泛的实验工作和先进的表征技术，以弥合理论预期和实际结果之间的差距。
