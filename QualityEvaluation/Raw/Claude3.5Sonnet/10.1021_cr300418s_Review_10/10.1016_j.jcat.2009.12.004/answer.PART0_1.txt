[1] "NiNbO exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while NiLiO demonstrated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%."

[2] "Our previous investigations [14] on the NiNbO system revealed that surface-exposed nickel sites constitute the active centers for the activation of the paraffinic substrate."

[3] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[4] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium's high valence state (+5) introduces extra positive charge into the NiO lattice when it forms a solid solution. This reduces the concentration of electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for unselective total oxidation. As a result, NiNbO catalysts exhibit high selectivity towards ethylene formation.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complex interplay between the dopant's electronic properties, its integration into the NiO structure, and the resulting surface chemistry. While theory predicts that higher valence dopants should improve selectivity, the actual performance depends on factors like ionic radius compatibility and the extent of solid solution formation. Additionally, the precise mechanism by which niobium modifies the active nickel sites is not fully elucidated, requiring further in-depth studies to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and experimental results in these complex catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。铌的高价态（+5）在形成固溶体时向NiO晶格引入额外的正电荷。这降低了亲电氧物种的浓度，而这些氧物种负责非选择性的完全氧化。因此，NiNbO催化剂表现出对乙烯形成的高选择性。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的主要挑战在于掺杂剂的电子性质、其在NiO结构中的整合以及由此产生的表面化学之间的复杂相互作用。虽然理论预测高价态掺杂剂应该提高选择性，但实际性能取决于离子半径的兼容性和固溶体形成的程度等因素。此外，铌如何精确地修饰活性镍位点的机制尚未完全阐明，需要进一步深入研究以弥合这些复杂催化体系中理论期望和实验结果之间的差距。
