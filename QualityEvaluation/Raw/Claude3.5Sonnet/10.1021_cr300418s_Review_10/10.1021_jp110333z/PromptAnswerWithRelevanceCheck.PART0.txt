The given literature does not contain any information about niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the chemistry of oxides doped with lower valence cations, particularly discussing La-doped ceria, Mg-doped lanthana, and alkali metal-doped calcium oxide. It does not mention niobium oxides or their use in NiO catalysts. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the information provided in this document.
