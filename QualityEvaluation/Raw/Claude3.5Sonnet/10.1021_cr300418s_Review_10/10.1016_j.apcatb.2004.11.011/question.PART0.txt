Abstract
In order to elucidate the superior start-up activity of LaFePdOx catalysts in practical automotive emission control, the redox property of Pd
species in a Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 8C using X-ray spectroscopic
techniques. In a reductive atmosphere, and even at temperatures as low as 100 8C, Pd0 species is partially segregated out onto the catalyst
surface from the B-site of the Perovskite-type matrix of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3. Passing through successive oxidizing atmospheres, the segregated
Pd0 species is re-oxidized into Pd2+ at 200300 8C. The formation of a solid solution between the re-oxidized Pd species and the Perovskite-
type matrix begins to be seen at around 400 8C and accelerates at higher temperatures. Thus a quasi-reversible redox reaction between the
surface Pd0 and the cationic Pd in the LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 matrix takes place. The start-up activity of LaFePdxOx catalysts can be attributed to Pd0
that segregates under the reductive atmosphere which is a natural part of the redox fluctuation in automotive exhaust gases at 100200 8C.

1. Introduction
Catalytic converters are the industrys standard technol-
ogy for the control automotive emission, such as nitrogen
oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned
hydrocarbons (HC). Conventionally catalysts are finely
divided precious metal particles dispersed on ceramic-
support materials. The catalyst is exposed to heat during
vehicle use, and its catalytic activity deteriorates because of
the agglomeration and growth of the precious metal particles
that reduce the overall surface area available for catalytic
conversion. Today, conventional catalyst systems employ an
excess of precious metals to ensure new high-standard
performance targets for vehicles that have been used over
100,000 km.
The need for global and regional environmental protec-
tion has strengthened regulations for automobile emission
on a worldwide scale. Particularly, with the focus on cold-
emission regulation (emission right after engine starting),
the demand for Pd, which shows good low-temperature
activity, has increased to ten times its level of 1992. A new
automotive catalyst technology that reduces precious metal
consumption, especially Pd, is much sought after.
In the case of three way catalysts, contemporary
automotive gasoline engines are operated close to the

stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio within a narrow operating
window. An electronic feedback control system is usually
coupled with a time lag in order to adjust the air-to-fuel ratio.
This technology creates a redox fluctuation in exhaust-gas
composition.
Perovskite-type
catalysts
have
been
examined
for
catalytic converter applications since the early 1970s
[17]. Recently, we reported that a Perovskite-type catalyst
containing Pd, LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3, maintained high
catalytic activity and high metal dispersion due to the
structural responses to redox atmospheres at 800 8C [8,9].
X-ray anomalous diffraction (XAD) and XAFS measure-
ments near the Pd K-edge clearly showed that cationic Pd
occupied the B-site of the ABO3 type Perovskite crystal
structure in the oxidative atmosphere, and that Pd0
segregated out to form a metallic alloy of PdCo in the
reductive atmosphere. This back and forth movement of Pd,
in accordance with the redox fluctuation of the engine
exhaust, suppresses the agglomeration and growth of the
metal particles. The marked long-term durability of the
LaFeCoPdOx catalyst is due to both the self-regeneration
of Pd and its high dispersion on the catalyst surface.
Because Co has been singled out by TA-luft as a
carcinogenic,
we
studied
a
Co-free
Perovskite,
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 for practical applications of the Perovskite
catalyst [1013]. LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 showed the self-regen-
erative function of Pd as well as excellent overall catalytic
activity, and has been marketed as a commercial automotive
catalyst in Japan since 2002 [11].
Automotive catalysts must maintain a high standard of
purification
ability
immediately
from
engine
startup,
through acceleration and all the way to high speed
driving.
Especially
with
the
strengthening
of
the
worldwide cold emission regulations, start-up catalytic
activity at low temperature has become crucial. The practical
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalyst is characterized by its superior
low-temperature activity [1012]. The back and forth redox
behavior of Pd, thus the self-regenerative function, has
already been proven at 800 8C [1013].
Co free LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 has stability of Perovskite
LaFeO3 phase in a reductive atmosphere [14], so there is a
possibility of inhibiting reductive segregation of Pd. For
start-up catalytic activity, it is effective to oxidize alkene that
has high reactivity to purify the automotive exhaust gas
which contains various hydrocarbonic mixture. Some
studies suggested that metal Pd0 is more active in alkene
oxidation than PdO [15].
The aim of this study is to clarify the active species for
start-up emission control and for probability of the self-
regenerative
behavior
of
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
catalyst
at
temperatures ranging from 100 to 400 8C.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of powder catalysts
A
Perovskite-type
catalyst
containing
Pd,
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, was prepared by the alkoxide method
[1013].
Metal
ethoxyethylates,
M3+(OC2H4OC2H5)3
(M = La, Fe) were dissolved in toluene. Precipitates
containing Pd were obtained by using a diluted Pd(NO3)2
aqueous solution during hydrolysis. After drying, the
precursor was calcined at 700 8C for 4 h in air to obtain a
Perovskite powder catalyst containing Pd homogeneously.
2.2. Redox treatment
Thermal ageing was carried out the following treatments
in three steps to simulate the redox fluctuations of an
automotive exhaust gas (Fig. 1). First, the sample was
oxidized in air at 800 8C for 1 h (notation; 800-O). Then,
the catalyst was reduced in 2.5% hydrogen and 7.5%
carbon monoxide balanced with nitrogen gas at 100, 200,
300, 400 and 800 8C for 1 h, respectively (notation; e.g.
200-OR). Finally, the sample was oxidized in air for 1 h at
the same temperature as the each reductive treatment
(notation; e.g. 400-ORO). Since the redox conditions
employed here are more severe than those found in the
fluctuation of real automotive exhaust gases, catalyst
conditions are compared to practical catalyst conditions
on a qualitative base.

2.3. Characterization of catalysts by use of X-ray
spectroscopy
The crystal structures of Perovskite powder catalysts after
high temperature aging were measured by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) using Cu Ka (RIGAKU RINT-2500V).
X-ray
absorption
spectra
near
the
Pd
K-edge
(24.350 keV) were carried out at bending-magnet Beamline
BL01B1 of the 8-GeV Synchrotron Radiation Source,
SPring-8. Measurements were done at room temperature in
transmission mode with ionization chambers for monitoring
X-ray intensities. The photon energy was calibrated with
foils for each absorption edge. X-ray absorption near
edge structure (XANES) spectra was carefully compared
between the three kinds of aged catalysts for each absorption
edge. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
oscillations were analyzed according to standard procedures
[1618], in order to determine local structure parameters
around the X-ray absorbing atoms.
The binding energy of Pd was analyzed using Mg Ka
in
X-ray
photoelectron
spectroscopy
(ULVAC
PHI
ESCA5600ci/MC). Binding energies were corrected based
on measured values for C1S. The powder of PdO and Pd were
measured as standard materials.
2.4. Activity test
Catalytic tests for the oxidized and reduced forms of the
sample
(800-O
and
800-OR)
were
performed
in
a
temperature programmed reaction apparatus. A continu-
ous-flow fixed-bed reactor, was loaded with 40 mg of the
Perovskite powder catalysts, and a test reaction was carried
out in the range 50300 8C in flowing NO/H2 at a heating
rate of 3 8C/min. The total gas flow was 50 cm3/min
(75,000 ml h1 g1). The reaction mixture consisted of 4%
of NO and 6% of H2 (balanced with He). The exhaust gas
from the reaction was analyzed by quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Bel Japan FMS-TG-Mass).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction
Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction spectra of the
LaFePdO3 powder catalysts resulting from before and after
reduce treatment. Perovskite-type crystal structure of
LaFeO3 is clearly seen on all the spectra shown here, but
no metallic Pd signal is observed by XRD. There are small
signals of lanthanum oxide on 800-OR. This indicates that
the destruction of the Perovskite-type matrix takes place
gradually during the 1 h reduction period at 800 8C, even
though this is a much severer condition than the redox
fluctuation of actual automotive emission. Successive re-
oxidations of 800-ORO at 800 8C eliminate the lanthanum
oxide peaks from the XRD spectra (not shown here). As far
as the structure analysis by XRD is concerned, the
Perovskite-type
framework
of
the
LaFePdOx catalyst
proves to be essentially durable under the present reaction
conditions.
3.2. XANES and EXAFS
Fig. 3 shows X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) spectra at the Pd K-edge for the samples oxidized
and reduced at various temperatures. Compared to the PdO
spectrum, XANES spectrum of 800-O shows a chemical
shift of about 1.7 eV, indicating that the valence of the Pd in
the catalyst is higher than the normal bivalence seen in PdO

[6,13]. This indicates that the Pd in LaFePdO3 Perovskite
after oxidation is in a 3+ and/or 4+ state. Theoretical
calculation has also suggested that Pd has the capacity to
exist at extraordinarily high oxidation states at the B-site [8].
The spectrum of 100-OR similar to that of 800-O indicates
that the reduction at 100 8C does not reduce the concentra-
tion of unusually high valence Pd in the Perovskite-type
framework. The 200-OR and 300-OR edge position of
absorption shifted to low energy. The higher the reduction
temperature was (400-OR and 800-OR), the closer the
spectrum shifted to that of Pd0-foil. After the re-oxidation
treatment, the edge position of absorption shifted back to an
energy higher than that of PdO (see lower half of Fig. 3).
The ratio of reduced Pd0 in LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 can be
calculated from chemical shifts (Fig. 3) in the XANES
spectra at the Pd K-edge [19,20]. Two kinds of species, Pd0
and Pd3+, are assumed here. Fig. 4 summarizes the
percentage of Pd0. The reduction of cationic Pd in the
Perovskite-type crystal into Pd0 began at 200 8C, and had
advanced to about 80% of total Pd at 400 8C. Re-oxidation
of Pd0 also starts at 200 8C, and a quantity of about two-
thirds of the reduced Pd is re-oxidized at 300 8C. Reduction
of cationic Pd is somewhat readier than the oxidation of Pd0.
The radial structure function around Pd was calculated by
Fourier transform of extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) oscillations and is shown in Fig. 5.
When the 800-O sample was reduced, the first nearest peak
originated with PdO bond got lower and the second nearest
peak, i.e. PdPd bond, got higher. This tendency becomes
marked at reduction temperatures higher than 200 8C.
The ratio of PdPd formation increased as the reduction
temperature rose. It is noteworthy that the second nearest
peak (PdPd) got slightly higher even at 100 8C, though the
first nearest peak (PdO) did not change so much. Since the
XRD measurement did not show that diffraction peaks
originated from metallic Pd (Fig. 2), it can be conjectured
that finely dispersed metallic Pd0 is produced on the catalyst
surface in the reductive atmosphere.
During oxidations at 100 and 200 8C, the spectra change
was not remarkable. However, re-oxidation at temperatures

higher than 300 8C causes recovery of the oxidized
spectrum, showing a decrease in the PdPd bond and an
increase in the PdO bond. The quasi-reversible redox
reaction of Pd species requires a temperature of around
300 8C.
3.3. XPS analysis
The
chemical
state
of
Pd
on
the
surface
of
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3
was
analyzed
by
XPS
after
redox
treatments. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The values
for Pd0 and Pd2+ were determined by comparison with
metallic Pd and PdO, respectively. The Pd in the 800-O
sample has an unusual binding energy of Pd3+ or Pd4+, equal
to that estimated from XANES spectra at the Pd K-edge
(Fig. 3). This higher oxidation state once again shows that
cationic Pd is located at the B-site of Perovskite crystals as
solid solution [6,7,9,10]. Reduction of the 800-O sample at
temperatures higher than 200 8C leads to a growth of the Pd0
peak and a decline of the Pd4+/Pd3+ peak. Re-oxidation of
the samples enhances the Pd4+/Pd3+ component in the XPS
spectrum. The form of the peak on 800-O was a little
extended compared with that of 100-OR. This may be
interpreted as showing that the reduction of Pd began,
slightly, at 100 8C. The redox behavior observed by XPS
here is qualitatively identical to the results from the X-ray
absorption analysis (Figs. 3 and 5). The 400-ORO spectrum
shows some evidence of the unusual high valence of Pd. If it
is taken into account that XPS is more sensitive at the surface
than the X-ray absorption analysis, we can say that to some
extent, the incorporation of cationic Pd into the B-site of the
Perovskite-type framework occurs under oxidation atmo-
sphere at 400 8C.
In Fig. 7, the ratio of reduced Pd0 estimated from the XPS
spectra is compared with that of XANES. It was found that
there were some differences in the ratio of Pd0 determined in
these two different ways. The surface-sensitive XPS shows
higher Pd0 ratio at 100300 8C, suggesting that the metallic
Pd0 species segregates out from the Perovskite-type frame-
work and exists at the catalysts surface. It was found that
there were some differences in the ratio of Pd0 determined in

these two different ways. The XANES signals reflect the
bulk chemical state of the tested material, but the surface
chemical state has larger effect on the XPS signal because of
the shallow escape depth of the photo-electrons in XPS. The
surface-sensitive XPS shows higher Pd0 ratio at 100300 8C
in Fig. 7, suggesting that the metallic Pd0 species segregates
out
from
the
Perovskite-type
framework
and
exists
dominantly at the catalysts surface.
3.4. Catalytic activity
Fig. 8 shows the NO removal activity of the oxidized and
reduced LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts (800-O and 800-OR)
during NO + H2 reaction. The pre-reduced catalyst (800-
OR), on which fine Pd0 species is deposited, shows a higher
activity in the low temperature regions. The reaction begins
on the pre-oxidized catalyst (800-O) at temperatures higher
than 150 8C. This temperature is almost identical to that said
for the formation of the surface Pd0 species under reducing
conditions (Fig. 7). From the viewpoint of redox stoichio-
metry, the reaction gas mixture employed here (4%
NO + 6% H2) is in a hydrogen-rich condition. These results
strongly suggest that the fine Pd0 species at the surface is
engendered by the reducing atmosphere of the redox
fluctuation in automotive exhaust gas and that it acts as the
active center for start-up emission control in practical
LaFePdOx catalysts.
4. Conclusion
The redox property of Pd species in the Perovskite-type
LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts was studied at temperatures
ranging from 100 to 400 8C. At temperatures higher than
100 8C, reductive segregation of Pd0 begins near the surface
of catalysts. At temperatures higher than 200 8C, the surface
Pd0 is re-oxidized into Pd2+. The surface Pd2+ partially
dissolves into the Perovskite-type LaFeOx framework to
occupy
the
B-site.
Though
the
usual
crystallization
temperature of Perovskite is around 700 8C, this oxidative
dissolution requires temperatures of about 400 8C. When
both the surface Pd2+ and the Pd3+ or 4+ in the Perovskite-
type framework co-exist in the LaFePdOx catalysts under the
oxidative atmosphere, quasi-reversible redox of the Pd
species takes place at temperatures ranging from 200 to
400 8C. The original LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 is recovered in the
oxidative atmosphere at 800 8C, the temperature of engine
operation at a steady state.
Pd reduction of Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 cata-
lysts occurs at wide temperature range. Pd near the surface
of the catalyst starts to segregate at very low temperature less
than 100 8C. The general catalytic reaction occurs at the
surface of the catalyst. It could be envisaged that the part of
Pd of Perovskite-type LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 for activity is
deposited and the other part of Pd is protected in the
Perovskite-type framework.
Owing to the easy reducibility of the catalyst, the fine Pd0
deposits at the surface can be regenerated in the redox
fluctuation of automotive exhaust even at low temperatures.
This surface Pd0 plays a key role in the start-up activity of
practical automobile emission control and promises the
minimization of Pd usage.
