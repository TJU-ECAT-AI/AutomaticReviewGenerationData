An intelligent catalyst: the self-regenerative palladiumperovskite
catalyst for automotive emissions control

Materials Research and Development Division, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd, Ikeda, Osaka, 563-8651, Japan
An innovative intelligent catalyst that exhibits a greatly improved durability as a result of the self-regenerative function of Pd
nanoparticles has been developed. Self-regeneration was realized through a cycle between solid solution and segregation of Pd in a
perovskite crystal, without any auxiliary treatment. That is, Pd atoms move back and forth between the inside (as Pd cations in the
lattice) and the outside (as Pd nanoparticles) of the perovskite crystal in synchronization with the fluctuations between reductive
and oxidative (redox) atmospheres that occur in real automotive exhaust gases. As a result of this cyclic redox reaction, the growth
of Pd nanoparticles can be suppressed during the entire lifetime of the vehicle. This self-regenerative function provides a new and
useful tool for the development of future automotive catalysts. The mechanism of the self-regenerative function is described, and it
is shown by ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analyses that the self-regenerative function occurs at an
extremely high speed over a wide range of temperatures. In addition, technical solutions for overcoming the weaknesses of general
perovskite catalysts for practical use are described.
1. Introduction
A catalyst that does not age has been a long-held
dream of automotive engineers. In this article, the
outline of an intelligent catalyst is described [15]. This
catalyst has the ability to regain its catalytic activity,
should this deteriorate, without any outside interference.
From the viewpoint of intelligent materials [6], the
intelligence of the catalyst may be defined as its ability to
maintain a high performance by adapting its structure,
responding sensitively to environmental changes.
The important role of the automotive three-way cata-
lyst is widely recognized for the simultaneous conversion
of emissions of three pollutants in engine exhaust gases:
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and un-
burned hydrocarbons (HC). The conventional three-way
catalyst consists of fine particles of precious metals dis-
persed on ceramic support materials such as alumina, ce-
ria, or zirconia; however, the catalytic activity of such
catalysts deteriorates, owing to the agglomeration and
growth of precious-metal particles during use. It is essen-
tial to suppress the growth of precious metal particles to
achieve a high efficiency and to conserve precious metals.
An intelligent Pdperovskite catalyst has been devel-
oped that has a greatly improved durability as a result of
the self-regeneration function of Pd nano-particles. It has
been confirmed that the catalytic activity can be main-
tained even when the amount of precious metals is
reduced by 7090%. A vehicle equipped with the intel-
ligent catalyst was supplied to the market and succeeded
in achieving the ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV)
standard in 2002. Moreover, the intelligent catalyst has
also succeeded in achieving a new super-ultra-low-emis-
sion vehicle (SULEV) standard, adopted from January
2004. The production of clean vehicles equipped with the
intelligent catalyst exceeded one million units in January
2005. By this technology, it not only became possible to
achieve a drastic reduction in the cost of catalysts, but
also the technology solved the problem of the supply and
demand of precious metals for automotive applications,
which had caused a negative effect on other industries.
The
intelligent
catalyst
now
attracts
worldwide
attention and provides a new concept for the develop-
ment
of
future
automotive
catalysts.
Here,
the
background to the development of the catalyst, technical
details of the intelligent catalyst in the study phase,
problems in practical application and their solutions,
and future prospects are described.
2. Background
2.1. Purpose of the study
Automotive emissions regulations are getting tighter
and tighter all over the world. The Japanese government
has introduced cleaner emission standards, designated
ULEV and SULEV, which involve, respectively, 50%
and 75% reductions in emissions of both HC and NOx
in comparison with the emission regulation in force in
2005. The Japanese government offers a tax incentive in
respect of ULEV and SULEV vehicles and is promoting
the introduction of such clean vehicles to the market.

More and more precious metals must be used to meet
these
severe
standards
when
conventional
catalyst
technologies are applied. In particular, the demand for
Pd for use in automotive catalysts has mushroomed
from 15 tonnes per year to over 150 tonnes per year
over the last decade (figure 1) [7]. This drastic increase is
a result of the strengthening of cold-emission regulations
world wide, which has made development of technolo-
gies to reduce the use of precious metals so urgent. The
intelligent catalyst has been developed as a solution to
reduce the use of precious metals, especially Pd.
2.2. History of research on perovskite catalysts
A perovskite-type oxide has an ABO3-type crystal
structure, in which cations with a large ionic radius have
a twelve-fold coordination to oxygen atoms and occupy
the A-sites, and cations with a smaller ionic radius have
a six-fold coordination and occupy the B-sites. A and O
form a cubic close packing, and B is contained in the
octahedral voids within the packing. If the ionic radii
are rA, rB, and rO, for a perovskite crystal structure to be
formed,
the
tolerance
factor
(t) = (rA + rO)/
2(rB + rO) must lie within the range 0.8 < t < 1.0,
and
rA > 0.090 nm,
and
rB > 0.051 nm.
A
large
number
of
elements
can
form
ideal
or
modified
perovskites, depending on the tolerance factor.
Perovskites are interesting materials for catalytic
applications and for fundamental studies of catalysis.
Many studies on the catalytic properties of perovskite-
type mixed oxides have been reported [828]. The
characteristics of perovskite catalysts are summarized as
follows [29,30].
(1) In LnMO3 (Ln
= lanthanide,
M = transition
metal) perovskites, the catalytic activity for oxida-
tion is mainly determined by the B-site elements and
follows the order Co > Mn > Ni
> Fe > Cr
[23].
(2) In LnMO3 perovskites, the structural stability in a
reductive atmosphere is also determined by the
B-site elements, in the order Cr > Fe > Mn > -
Co > Ni [17].
(3) One of the advantages of the formation of a
perovskite structure is the increase in the thermal
stability of the transition metal oxide [13].
(4) Another advantage is the ability to control valencies
and vacancies to enhance the catalytic activity
[10,12,15,19].
(5) Addition of precious metals to perovskites improves
the activity of three-way catalysts for NOx reduction
[2628].
(6) A new function of Pdperovskite has been devel-
oped to regenerate precious metals through the cycle
of solid solution and segregation in a perovskite
crystal under the conditions of use, without any
auxiliary treatment [15].
2.3. Issues relating to the industrialization of perovskite
catalysts
In order to industrialize the perovskite catalyst as an
intelligent catalyst for automotive applications, the
following issues remain:
Issue A: The perovskite catalysts investigated in our
previous studies contain cobalt (Co), which has been
identified in the German clean air regulations TA-luft as
a potential carcinogen.
Issue B: The most important issue is the proof of the
operation of this new self-regenerative function in the
ambience of an actual automotive exhaust gas.
Issue C: In order to put the catalyst into practical use,
it is necessary to overcome the problem of a low surface
area, which is a weak point of the perovskite [20,21]. It is
also required to improve the chemical stability against
sulfur poisoning.
In this article, the self-regenerative function of Pd in a
LaFeCoPdO3 perovskite is elucidated, and the effect of
this function on the catalytic activity of the perovskite is
demonstrated. Next, as a solution of issue A, it is shown
that a perovskite catalyst with a new Co-free LaFePdO3
composition
has
a
self-regenerative
function.
The
temperature dependency and response of the self-
regenerative function of the LaFePdO3 perovskite were
studied in relation to issue B.
Moreover, a composite material technique, which
enhances the surface area by forming and dispersing fine
perovskite particles on support materials, has been
developed to answer issue C. The design of a catalyst for
practical use of perovskite composite materials is
explained, and the results of an examination of the
resistance of the catalyst to poisoning by sulfur are
described. The details of experiment techniques and
procedures have been explained in previous papers,
shown as references.
3. Elucidation of the self-regenerative function
A palladium-containing perovskite (Pdperovskite;
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3) powder catalyst was prepared

by the alkoxide method [1,3]. The monolithic catalysts,
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 and Pd/Al2O3, were aged at
900 C (catalyst inlet temperature) for 100 h in exhaust
gas from a real 4000-cm3 V-8 engine [1]. Figure 2 com-
pares the CONOx crossover point conversion of these
catalysts [1]. The Pdperovskite catalyst maintained its
high activity during aging, whereas the activity of the
Pd/alumina
catalyst
deteriorated
by
about
10%.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the
aged catalysts are shown in figure 3 [1,32]. The magni-
fication is 400,000 times and the white bar measures
20 nm. The Pd particles on alumina reached sizes of up
to 120 nm, whereas only small metallic particles of
about 13 nm in diameter were found on the perovskite
surface. The remarkable suppression of the growth
of metallic particles directly affects the ability of the Pd
perovskite catalyst to maintain a high catalytic activity.
Detailed analyses were carried out to elucidate the
mechanism of suppression of Pd grain growth. The
powder catalyst was exposed to the following treatment.
First, the catalyst was oxidized in air at 800 C for 1 h
(800-O). Then, the sample was reduced in 10% H2
balanced with N2 for 1 h at 800 C (800-OR). Finally,
the sample was re-oxidized in air for 1 h at the same
temperature (800-ORO). This successive single-run of
treatments creates a separate model for each of the key
stages of the evolution of the engine exhaust atmosphere
[1].
The states of Pd on the surface of powder catalysts
after oxidation, reduction and re-oxidation treatments
at 800 C were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS). The results are shown in
figure 4 [2]. Binding energies were corrected based on
measured values for C1S. The values for Pd0 and Pd2+
were determined by comparison with metallic Pd and
PdO, respectively. The binding energy of Pd in oxidized
LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 perovskite indicates an extraor-
dinarily high oxidation state of Pd3+ [2,3,23]. The Pd in
the reduced sample was found to be in the metallic state.
In the re-oxidized sample, the oxidation state of Pd was
once again estimated to be Pd3+.
To determine the distribution of Pd in the catalyst
more precisely, X-ray anomalous diffraction (XAD) was
measured at the bending-magnet beamline BL14B1 of
the 8 GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8 [1].

that the perovskite crystal structure is predominant.
After reduction treatment, the positions of the Bragg
reflections from (100) and (110) shifted to lower angles,
indicating an expansion of the crystal lattice and partial
transformation of the material into La(OH)3 via La2O3.
After re-oxidation
treatment, the

and (110)
reflections returned to the oxidized position, and the
La2O3 and La(OH)3 signals disappeared completely.

intensity for the oxidized catalyst. The cusp of the
intensity of these reflections at the Pd K-edge indicates
that Pd forms a solid solution with the perovskite
crystal. Furthermore, by considering the structure fac-
tors involved, the increase of (100) and the decrease of
(110) reflection intensities at the edge energy prove that

Pd occupies the B-site. On the other hand, the cusp of
the intensity was not observed for the reduced catalyst,
implying that Pd does not occupy any site in the
perovskite lattice of the reduced catalyst.
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was also
measured at the bending-magnet beam line BL14B1 of
the 8-GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8.
The spectra were measured near the PdK edge in
transmission mode because of the high transmissivity of
the X-ray. The photon energy was calibrated with a Pd
foil by assigning 24.350 keV to the energy at half the
edge jump.
