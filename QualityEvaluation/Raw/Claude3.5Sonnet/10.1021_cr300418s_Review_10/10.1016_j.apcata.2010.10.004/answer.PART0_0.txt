[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[5] "No indication of formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly lower than 1% of Nb."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Even small amounts of Nb drastically increase conversion compared to pure NiO, indicating a strong influence on catalytic activity.

2. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb content, related to a decrease in active phase particle size induced by amorphous Nb2O5.

3. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous Nb2O5 phase reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, limiting the beneficial effects.

4. There is little evidence of solid solution formation between NiO and Nb2O5, with any such interaction likely limited to less than 1% Nb.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Understanding the complex interactions between NiO and Nb2O5 at different concentrations.

2. Explaining the mechanisms by which small amounts of Nb drastically improve catalytic performance.

3. Determining the exact nature and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface.

4. Accounting for the formation of the inactive NiNb2O6 phase at higher Nb concentrations.

5. Clarifying the role of amorphous Nb2O5 in modifying the NiO particle size and surface properties.

These challenges arise from the complexity of the NiNbO catalytic system, where multiple factors such as composition, structure, and surface properties interact to determine overall catalytic performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响其作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 即使少量的Nb也能显著提高转化率，相比纯NiO而言，表明其对催化活性有强烈影响。

2. 在15%的Nb含量时观察到最佳活性，这与非晶态Nb2O5引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

3. 当Nb含量超过15%时，非晶态Nb2O5相与NiO反应形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，限制了其有益效果。

4. NiO和Nb2O5之间几乎没有形成固溶体的证据，即使有任何相互作用，也可能限于不到1%的Nb。

在理论预测与实验观察之间存在以下挑战：

1. 理解NiO和Nb2O5在不同浓度下的复杂相互作用。

2. 解释少量Nb如何显著改善催化性能的机制。

3. 确定催化剂表面活性位点的确切性质和分布。

4. 解释在较高Nb浓度下形成无活性NiNb2O6相的原因。

5. 阐明非晶态Nb2O5在改变NiO粒径和表面性质中的作用。

这些挑战源于NiNbO催化体系的复杂性，其中成分、结构和表面性质等多个因素相互作用，共同决定了整体催化性能。
