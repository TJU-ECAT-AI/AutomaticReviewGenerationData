[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[3] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."

[5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."

[6] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. At low concentrations (up to 3-7%), niobium spreads on the NiO surface, reducing the number of accessible O- species. This leads to more isolated and selective O- sites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. At higher concentrations (7-15%), niobium forms an amorphous Nb2O5 phase that prevents sintering of NiO particles, increasing the catalyst's specific surface area and overall activity.

3. Above 15% niobium content, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, decreasing catalytic activity.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations is the complex interplay between these different effects. The optimal niobium content (around 15%) results from a balance between surface modification, particle size control, and prevention of inactive phase formation. Additionally, the exact nature of the active sites and the mechanism of niobium's influence on NiO's oxygen over-stoichiometry are not fully understood, making it difficult to create accurate theoretical models of these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 在低浓度（高达3-7%）时，铌在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种数量。这导致更加孤立和选择性的O-位点，有利于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。

2. 在较高浓度（7-15%）时，铌形成无定形Nb2O5相，防止NiO颗粒烧结，增加催化剂的比表面积和整体活性。

3. 当铌含量超过15%时，形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，降低催化活性。

在协调理论预测和实验观察方面的主要挑战在于这些不同效应之间的复杂相互作用。最佳铌含量（约15%）是表面改性、粒径控制和防止无活性相形成之间平衡的结果。此外，活性位点的确切性质以及铌对NiO氧过量化学计量比的影响机制尚未完全理解，这使得难以为这些催化体系创建准确的理论模型。
