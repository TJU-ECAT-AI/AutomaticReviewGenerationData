[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[5] "It has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric structure"

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Surface interaction: Niobium oxide forms an amorphous Nb2O5 phase that interacts with the NiO active phase at the surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

2. Particle size reduction: The amorphous Nb2O5 phase induces a decrease in the active NiO phase particle size, which contributes to optimal catalytic activity at around 15% Nb content.

3. Formation of inactive phases: Above 15% Nb content, the amorphous Nb2O5 reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, reducing catalytic performance.

4. Potential solid solution formation: It has been proposed that Nb cations may substitute Ni cations or fill cationic vacancies in the NiO structure, forming a Ni1-xNbxO solid solution.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Complexity of phase interactions: The formation of amorphous phases and potential solid solutions makes it difficult to precisely determine the structure and composition of the active sites.

2. Optimal doping level: Predicting the ideal Nb content that balances beneficial effects (particle size reduction, surface interactions) with detrimental effects (inactive phase formation) is challenging.

3. Structural characterization: The presence of amorphous phases and potential solid solutions makes it difficult to fully characterize the catalyst structure using standard techniques.

4. Active site identification: The exact nature and distribution of active sites, which may involve complex interactions between Nb and NiO, are challenging to predict and verify experimentally.

5. Dynamic changes during reaction: The catalyst structure and composition may evolve under reaction conditions, making it difficult to correlate theoretical predictions with observed catalytic performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响表现在以下几个方面：

1. 表面相互作用：铌氧化物形成无定形Nb2O5相，与NiO活性相在表面发生相互作用，提高催化效率。

2. 颗粒尺寸减小：无定形Nb2O5相导致活性NiO相颗粒尺寸减小，这在Nb含量约为15%时贡献于最佳催化活性。

3. 形成非活性相：当Nb含量超过15%时，无定形Nb2O5与NiO反应形成非活性NiNb2O6相，降低催化性能。

4. 潜在的固溶体形成：有人提出Nb阳离子可能取代Ni阳离子或填充NiO结构中的阳离子空位，形成Ni1-xNbxO固溶体。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 相互作用的复杂性：无定形相和潜在固溶体的形成使得准确确定活性位点的结构和组成变得困难。

2. 最佳掺杂水平：预测能平衡有益效果（颗粒尺寸减小，表面相互作用）和有害效果（非活性相形成）的理想Nb含量具有挑战性。

3. 结构表征：无定形相和潜在固溶体的存在使得使用标准技术全面表征催化剂结构变得困难。

4. 活性位点识别：活性位点的确切性质和分布可能涉及Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用，难以预测和实验验证。

5. 反应过程中的动态变化：催化剂的结构和组成可能在反应条件下发生变化，使得难以将理论预测与观察到的催化性能相关联。
