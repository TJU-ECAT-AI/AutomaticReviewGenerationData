[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[5] "No indication of formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly lower than 1% of Nb."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Even small amounts of Nb drastically increase conversion compared to pure NiO, indicating a strong influence on catalytic activity.

2. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb content, related to a decrease in active phase particle size induced by amorphous Nb2O5.

3. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous Nb2O5 phase reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, limiting the beneficial effects.

4. There is little evidence of solid solution formation between NiO and Nb2O5, with any such interaction likely limited to less than 1% Nb.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Understanding the complex interactions between NiO and Nb2O5 at different concentrations.

2. Explaining the mechanisms by which small amounts of Nb drastically improve catalytic performance.

3. Determining the exact nature and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface.

4. Accounting for the formation of the inactive NiNb2O6 phase at higher Nb concentrations.

5. Clarifying the role of amorphous Nb2O5 in modifying the NiO particle size and surface properties.

These challenges arise from the complexity of the NiNbO catalytic system, where multiple factors such as composition, structure, and surface properties interact to determine overall catalytic performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响其作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 即使少量的Nb也能显著提高转化率，相比纯NiO而言，表明其对催化活性有强烈影响。

2. 在15%的Nb含量时观察到最佳活性，这与非晶态Nb2O5引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

3. 当Nb含量超过15%时，非晶态Nb2O5相与NiO反应形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，限制了其有益效果。

4. NiO和Nb2O5之间几乎没有形成固溶体的证据，即使有任何相互作用，也可能限于不到1%的Nb。

在理论预测与实验观察之间存在以下挑战：

1. 理解NiO和Nb2O5在不同浓度下的复杂相互作用。

2. 解释少量Nb如何显著改善催化性能的机制。

3. 确定催化剂表面活性位点的确切性质和分布。

4. 解释在较高Nb浓度下形成无活性NiNb2O6相的原因。

5. 阐明非晶态Nb2O5在改变NiO粒径和表面性质中的作用。

这些挑战源于NiNbO催化体系的复杂性，其中成分、结构和表面性质等多个因素相互作用，共同决定了整体催化性能。

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Surface interaction: Niobium oxide forms an amorphous Nb2O5 phase that interacts with the NiO active phase at the surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency.

2. Particle size reduction: The amorphous Nb2O5 phase induces a decrease in the active NiO phase particle size, which contributes to optimal catalytic activity at around 15% Nb content.

3. Formation of inactive phases: Above 15% Nb content, the amorphous Nb2O5 reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, reducing catalytic performance.

4. Potential solid solution formation: It has been proposed that Nb cations may substitute Ni cations or fill cationic vacancies in the NiO structure, forming a Ni1-xNbxO solid solution.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Complexity of phase interactions: The formation of amorphous phases and potential solid solutions makes it difficult to precisely determine the structure and composition of the active sites.

2. Optimal doping level: Predicting the ideal Nb content that balances beneficial effects (particle size reduction, surface interactions) with detrimental effects (inactive phase formation) is challenging.

3. Structural characterization: The presence of amorphous phases and potential solid solutions makes it difficult to fully characterize the catalyst structure using standard techniques.

4. Active site identification: The exact nature and distribution of active sites, which may involve complex interactions between Nb and NiO, are challenging to predict and verify experimentally.

5. Dynamic changes during reaction: The catalyst structure and composition may evolve under reaction conditions, making it difficult to correlate theoretical predictions with observed catalytic performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响表现在以下几个方面：

1. 表面相互作用：铌氧化物形成无定形Nb2O5相，与NiO活性相在表面发生相互作用，提高催化效率。

2. 颗粒尺寸减小：无定形Nb2O5相导致活性NiO相颗粒尺寸减小，这在Nb含量约为15%时贡献于最佳催化活性。

3. 形成非活性相：当Nb含量超过15%时，无定形Nb2O5与NiO反应形成非活性NiNb2O6相，降低催化性能。

4. 潜在的固溶体形成：有人提出Nb阳离子可能取代Ni阳离子或填充NiO结构中的阳离子空位，形成Ni1-xNbxO固溶体。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 相互作用的复杂性：无定形相和潜在固溶体的形成使得准确确定活性位点的结构和组成变得困难。

2. 最佳掺杂水平：预测能平衡有益效果（颗粒尺寸减小，表面相互作用）和有害效果（非活性相形成）的理想Nb含量具有挑战性。

3. 结构表征：无定形相和潜在固溶体的存在使得使用标准技术全面表征催化剂结构变得困难。

4. 活性位点识别：活性位点的确切性质和分布可能涉及Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用，难以预测和实验验证。

5. 反应过程中的动态变化：催化剂的结构和组成可能在反应条件下发生变化，使得难以将理论预测与观察到的催化性能相关联。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Only a small amount of Nb (up to 15%) is necessary to improve catalyst performance by decreasing the active phase particle size through the formation of an amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

2. At higher Nb contents (above 15%), the amorphous Nb2O5 phase reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, which negatively impacts catalyst activity.

3. The presence of Nb influences the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Niobium oxides contribute to the long-term deactivation of the catalysts through the continuous reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Understanding the complex interactions between Nb and NiO at different concentrations and their impact on catalyst performance.

2. Predicting and controlling the formation of different phases (amorphous Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) and their effects on catalyst activity and stability.

3. Determining the optimal Nb content to balance improved performance with long-term stability.

4. Elucidating the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and developing strategies to mitigate them.

5. Accounting for the dynamic nature of the catalyst system under reaction conditions, which may differ from theoretical predictions based on static models.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢反应的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 只需少量的Nb（最高15%）就能通过形成无定形Nb2O5相来减小活性相粒径，从而提高催化剂性能。

2. 在较高的Nb含量（超过15%）下，无定形Nb2O5相会与NiO反应形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，这对催化剂活性产生负面影响。

3. Nb的存在影响NiO的氧过量比，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

4. 铌氧化物通过持续降低NiO的氧过量比和形成热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相，导致催化剂长期失活。

在理论预测与实验观察之间存在以下挑战：

1. 理解不同浓度下Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用及其对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 预测和控制不同相（无定形Nb2O5、NiNb2O6）的形成及其对催化剂活性和稳定性的影响。

3. 确定最佳Nb含量以平衡性能提升和长期稳定性。

4. 阐明催化剂失活机理并开发缓解策略。

[1] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:"

[2] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase;"

[3] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation.

[4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Even small amounts of niobium can have substantial effects on the catalytic properties, with optimal activity observed at 15% Nb content. This is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

2. The presence of niobium oxide affects the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which is crucial for the catalytic activity. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions from the niobium precursor induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

3. Niobium doping influences the electronic properties of the catalyst, as NiO is a p-type semiconductor with positive holes as the main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple.

4. Over time, NiNbO catalysts undergo systematic deactivation due to continuous reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complex interplay between these various effects. The influence of niobium on particle size, oxygen over-stoichiometry, electronic properties, and phase stability all contribute to the overall catalytic performance in ways that may be difficult to predict theoretically. Additionally, the formation of new phases and changes in the catalyst structure over time further complicate the system, making long-term stability predictions particularly challenging.

铌氧化物的多样性质在以下几个方面显著影响了它们作为乙烷氧化脱氢NiO催化剂掺杂剂的行为：

1. 即使少量的铌也能对催化性能产生实质性影响，最佳活性观察到的铌含量为15%。这与无定形Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

2. 铌氧化物的存在影响NiO的氧过量化学计量比，这对催化活性至关重要。铌前驱体中草酸根离子的热分解会导致NiO氧过量化学计量比降低。

3. 铌掺杂影响催化剂的电子性质，因为NiO是一种p型半导体，其主要载流子为正孔，与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对相关。

4. 随着时间的推移，NiNbO催化剂由于NiO氧过量化学计量比的持续降低和热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相的形成而发生系统性失活。

将理论预测与实验观察结果协调一致的主要挑战在于这些不同效应之间的复杂相互作用。铌对粒径、氧过量化学计量比、电子性质和相稳定性的影响都以可能难以理论预测的方式对整体催化性能产生影响。此外，新相的形成和催化剂结构随时间的变化进一步使系统复杂化，使长期稳定性预测变得特别具有挑战性。

[2] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."

[3] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[4] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."

[5] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."

[6] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. At low concentrations (up to 3-7%), niobium spreads on the NiO surface, reducing the number of accessible O- species. This leads to more isolated and selective O- sites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. At higher concentrations (7-15%), niobium forms an amorphous Nb2O5 phase that prevents sintering of NiO particles, increasing the catalyst's specific surface area and overall activity.

3. Above 15% niobium content, an inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, decreasing catalytic activity.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations is the complex interplay between these different effects. The optimal niobium content (around 15%) results from a balance between surface modification, particle size control, and prevention of inactive phase formation. Additionally, the exact nature of the active sites and the mechanism of niobium's influence on NiO's oxygen over-stoichiometry are not fully understood, making it difficult to create accurate theoretical models of these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 在低浓度（高达3-7%）时，铌在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种数量。这导致更加孤立和选择性的O-位点，有利于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。

2. 在较高浓度（7-15%）时，铌形成无定形Nb2O5相，防止NiO颗粒烧结，增加催化剂的比表面积和整体活性。

3. 当铌含量超过15%时，形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，降低催化活性。

在协调理论预测和实验观察方面的主要挑战在于这些不同效应之间的复杂相互作用。最佳铌含量（约15%）是表面改性、粒径控制和防止无活性相形成之间平衡的结果。此外，活性位点的确切性质以及铌对NiO氧过量化学计量比的影响机制尚未完全理解，这使得难以为这些催化体系创建准确的理论模型。
