[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase;"

[3] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[4] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Only a small amount of Nb (up to 15%) is necessary to improve catalyst performance by decreasing the active phase particle size through the formation of an amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

2. At higher Nb contents (above 15%), the amorphous Nb2O5 phase reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, which negatively impacts catalyst activity.

3. The presence of Nb influences the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Niobium oxides contribute to the long-term deactivation of the catalysts through the continuous reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and the formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Understanding the complex interactions between Nb and NiO at different concentrations and their impact on catalyst performance.

2. Predicting and controlling the formation of different phases (amorphous Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) and their effects on catalyst activity and stability.

3. Determining the optimal Nb content to balance improved performance with long-term stability.

4. Elucidating the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and developing strategies to mitigate them.

5. Accounting for the dynamic nature of the catalyst system under reaction conditions, which may differ from theoretical predictions based on static models.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢反应的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 只需少量的Nb（最高15%）就能通过形成无定形Nb2O5相来减小活性相粒径，从而提高催化剂性能。

2. 在较高的Nb含量（超过15%）下，无定形Nb2O5相会与NiO反应形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，这对催化剂活性产生负面影响。

3. Nb的存在影响NiO的氧过量比，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

4. 铌氧化物通过持续降低NiO的氧过量比和形成热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相，导致催化剂长期失活。

在理论预测与实验观察之间存在以下挑战：

1. 理解不同浓度下Nb和NiO之间的复杂相互作用及其对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 预测和控制不同相（无定形Nb2O5、NiNb2O6）的形成及其对催化剂活性和稳定性的影响。

3. 确定最佳Nb含量以平衡性能提升和长期稳定性。

4. 阐明催化剂失活机理并开发缓解策略。

5. 考虑反应条件下催化剂系统的动态特性，这可能与基于静态模型的理论预测不同。
