[1] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:"

[2] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase;"

[3] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."

[4] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Even small amounts of niobium can have substantial effects on the catalytic properties, with optimal activity observed at 15% Nb content. This is related to the decrease in active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase.

2. The presence of niobium oxide affects the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which is crucial for the catalytic activity. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions from the niobium precursor induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry.

3. Niobium doping influences the electronic properties of the catalyst, as NiO is a p-type semiconductor with positive holes as the main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple.

4. Over time, NiNbO catalysts undergo systematic deactivation due to continuous reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and formation of the thermodynamically stable NiNb2O6 phase.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complex interplay between these various effects. The influence of niobium on particle size, oxygen over-stoichiometry, electronic properties, and phase stability all contribute to the overall catalytic performance in ways that may be difficult to predict theoretically. Additionally, the formation of new phases and changes in the catalyst structure over time further complicate the system, making long-term stability predictions particularly challenging.

铌氧化物的多样性质在以下几个方面显著影响了它们作为乙烷氧化脱氢NiO催化剂掺杂剂的行为：

1. 即使少量的铌也能对催化性能产生实质性影响，最佳活性观察到的铌含量为15%。这与无定形Nb2O5相引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

2. 铌氧化物的存在影响NiO的氧过量化学计量比，这对催化活性至关重要。铌前驱体中草酸根离子的热分解会导致NiO氧过量化学计量比降低。

3. 铌掺杂影响催化剂的电子性质，因为NiO是一种p型半导体，其主要载流子为正孔，与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对相关。

4. 随着时间的推移，NiNbO催化剂由于NiO氧过量化学计量比的持续降低和热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相的形成而发生系统性失活。

将理论预测与实验观察结果协调一致的主要挑战在于这些不同效应之间的复杂相互作用。铌对粒径、氧过量化学计量比、电子性质和相稳定性的影响都以可能难以理论预测的方式对整体催化性能产生影响。此外，新相的形成和催化剂结构随时间的变化进一步使系统复杂化，使长期稳定性预测变得特别具有挑战性。
