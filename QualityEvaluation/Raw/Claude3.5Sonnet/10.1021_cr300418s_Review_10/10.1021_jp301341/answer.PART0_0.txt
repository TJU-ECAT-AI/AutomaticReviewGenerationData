[1] "A more dramatic example of this effect is provided by Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base."

[2] "The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."

[3] "Formally, the adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron. Since this monovalent NbO2 group replaces a divalent Ni atom, it ought to act as a low-valence dopant and turn the surface into a Lewis acid."

[4] "The DFT calculations show that this prediction is correct. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[5] "This surface has another property typical of an oxide doped with a LVD: the oxygen atoms near the NbO2 group help the dissociative adsorption of ethane. Among many possible structures for the dissociation fragments, several involve the binding of H or CH3CH2 to the oxygen atoms in the surface of NiO, which are activated by the presence of the NbO2 dopant. The energy for this dissociative adsorption reaction, for various final fragment configurations, varies between 0.06 and 1.06 eV. This is lower than the dissociation energy on NiO. Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium, with its five valence electrons, acts as a strong Lewis base when replacing divalent Ni atoms in NiO. However, upon adsorption of O2, the resulting NbO2 group behaves as a low-valence dopant (LVD), turning the surface into a Lewis acid.

This transformation from base to acid has several important effects:

1. It lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies near the dopant site.
2. It activates nearby oxygen atoms, facilitating the dissociative adsorption of ethane.
3. It favors the breaking of C-H bonds, which is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

These effects make Nb-doped NiO potentially effective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex nature of these catalytic systems:

1. The strong adsorption of O2 on Nb (8.40 eV) may lead to over-oxidation of the dopant, potentially limiting its catalytic activity.
2. The formation of NbO2 groups changes the surface chemistry dramatically, making it difficult to predict the exact behavior under reaction conditions.
3. The multiple possible configurations for dissociation fragments and varying energies (0.06 to 1.06 eV) introduce complexity in understanding the reaction mechanism.
4. The interplay between the Lewis acid and base properties of the surface at different stages of the reaction may lead to unexpected behaviors not captured by simplified models.

To address these challenges, researchers need to combine theoretical studies with in-situ experimental techniques to observe the catalyst under reaction conditions and validate the predicted behaviors.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。铌有五个价电子，当替代NiO中的二价镍原子时，起到强Lewis碱的作用。然而，当吸附O2后，形成的NbO2基团表现为低价掺杂剂（LVD），使表面变成Lewis酸。

这种从碱到酸的转变产生了几个重要影响：

1. 降低了在掺杂位点附近形成氧空位所需的能量。
2. 活化了附近的氧原子，促进了乙烷的解离吸附。
3. 有利于C-H键的断裂，这对氧化脱氢过程至关重要。

这些效应使得Nb掺杂的NiO可能成为乙烷氧化脱氢的有效催化剂。然而，由于这些催化体系的复杂性，在调和理论预测与实验观察时出现了一些挑战：

1. O2在Nb上的强吸附（8.40 eV）可能导致掺杂剂过度氧化，潜在地限制其催化活性。
2. NbO2基团的形成显著改变了表面化学性质，使得难以预测反应条件下的确切行为。
3. 解离片段的多种可能构型和不同的能量（0.06到1.06 eV）给理解反应机理带来了复杂性。
4. 反应不同阶段表面Lewis酸和碱性质的相互作用可能导致简化模型无法捕捉的意外行为。

为了应对这些挑战，研究人员需要将理论研究与原位实验技术相结合，在反应条件下观察催化剂，并验证预测的行为。
