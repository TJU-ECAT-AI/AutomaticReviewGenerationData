[1] "A more dramatic example of this effect is provided by Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base."

[2] "The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."

[3] "Formally, the adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron. Since this monovalent NbO2 group replaces a divalent Ni atom, it ought to act as a low-valence dopant and turn the surface into a Lewis acid."

[4] "The DFT calculations show that this prediction is correct. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[5] "This surface has another property typical of an oxide doped with a LVD: the oxygen atoms near the NbO2 group help the dissociative adsorption of ethane. Among many possible structures for the dissociation fragments, several involve the binding of H or CH3CH2 to the oxygen atoms in the surface of NiO, which are activated by the presence of the NbO2 dopant. The energy for this dissociative adsorption reaction, for various final fragment configurations, varies between 0.06 and 1.06 eV. This is lower than the dissociation energy on NiO. Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. When Nb is doped into NiO(011), it acts as a very strong base due to its five valence electrons replacing a divalent Ni atom. However, upon exposure to oxygen, the Nb dopant strongly adsorbs O2, forming an NbO2 group. This NbO2 group then behaves as a low-valence dopant (LVD), turning the surface into a Lewis acid.

This transition from a strong base to a Lewis acid has several important effects on the catalytic properties:

1. It lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies near the dopant site, which is crucial for oxidation reactions.

2. It activates nearby oxygen atoms on the NiO surface, making them more reactive.

3. It facilitates the dissociative adsorption of ethane, lowering the energy barrier for C-H bond breaking.

These effects collectively enhance the catalytic activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complexity of these systems:

1. The strong O2 adsorption on Nb (8.40 eV) suggests that the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group would be too strongly bound to participate in reactions, potentially limiting catalytic activity.

2. The multiple possible configurations for ethane dissociation fragments and their varying energies (0.06 to 1.06 eV) indicate a complex reaction landscape that may be difficult to characterize experimentally.

3. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, with potential changes in oxidation states and surface structures, can make it challenging to directly compare theoretical models with experimental results.

4. The interplay between the Lewis acidity induced by the NbO2 group and the remaining NiO surface may lead to complex synergistic effects that are not easily predicted or observed.

These factors highlight the need for advanced in-situ characterization techniques and more sophisticated theoretical models that can account for the dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions to fully understand and optimize these complex catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。当Nb掺杂到NiO(011)中时，由于其五个价电子替换了二价Ni原子，它表现为很强的碱。然而，在暴露于氧气中时，Nb掺杂剂强烈吸附O2，形成NbO2基团。这个NbO2基团随后表现为低价掺杂剂（LVD），将表面转变为Lewis酸。

这种从强碱到Lewis酸的转变对催化性能有几个重要影响：

1. 它降低了在掺杂位点附近形成氧空位所需的能量，这对氧化反应至关重要。

2. 它激活了NiO表面附近的氧原子，使它们更具反应性。

3. 它促进了乙烷的解离吸附，降低了C-H键断裂的能量障碍。

这些效应共同增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战源于这些系统的复杂性：

1. Nb上强烈的O2吸附（8.40 eV）表明NbO2基团中的氧原子可能结合得太紧，无法参与反应，潜在地限制了催化活性。

2. 乙烷解离片段的多种可能构型及其不同的能量（0.06到1.06 eV）表明存在复杂的反应景观，可能难以通过实验进行表征。

3. 在反应条件下催化剂表面的动态性质，包括氧化态和表面结构的潜在变化，可能使理论模型与实验结果的直接比较变得困难。

4. NbO2基团引起的Lewis酸性与剩余NiO表面之间的相互作用可能导致复杂的协同效应，这些效应不容易预测或观察。

这些因素突出了需要先进的原位表征技术和更复杂的理论模型，以考虑催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，从而充分理解和优化这些复杂的催化系统。
