[1] "A more dramatic example of this effect is provided by Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base."

[2] "The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."

[3] "If any catalysis is to take place on this surface, the catalyst is NiO(001) doped with NbO2. Our rules can help guess the behavior of this system. Formally, the adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron. Since this monovalent NbO2 group replaces a divalent Ni atom, it ought to act as a low-valence dopant and turn the surface into a Lewis acid."

[4] "The DFT calculations show that this prediction is correct. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[5] "This surface has another property typical of an oxide doped with a LVD: the oxygen atoms near the NbO2 group help the dissociative adsorption of ethane. Among many possible structures for the dissociation fragments, several involve the binding of H or CH3CH2 to the oxygen atoms in the surface of NiO, which are activated by the presence of the NbO2 dopant. The energy for this dissociative adsorption reaction, for various final fragment configurations, varies between 0.06 and 1.06 eV. This is lower than the dissociation energy on NiO. Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium, with its five valence electrons, acts as a strong Lewis base when doped into NiO, replacing divalent Ni atoms. This leads to strong oxygen adsorption on the Nb dopant, forming NbO2 groups on the surface.

The NbO2 groups then behave as low-valence dopants (LVDs), turning the surface into a Lewis acid. This acidic character activates nearby oxygen atoms, making them more reactive. As a result, the energy required to form oxygen vacancies near the NbO2 groups is significantly lower than on the undoped NiO surface.

The presence of NbO2 dopants also facilitates the dissociative adsorption of ethane. The activated oxygen atoms near the NbO2 groups can more easily bind with H or CH3CH2 fragments, lowering the energy barrier for C-H bond breaking. This property is characteristic of oxides doped with LVDs and is beneficial for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations due to the complex nature of these catalytic systems. The strong oxygen adsorption on Nb dopants (with an energy of 8.40 eV) means that reactions involving these oxygen atoms are unlikely to result in gas-phase products, potentially limiting their catalytic activity. Additionally, the various possible structures for dissociation fragments and the range of energies involved (0.06 to 1.06 eV) indicate a complex reaction landscape that may be difficult to predict or control precisely in experimental settings.

Furthermore, the transition from Nb as a strong base to NbO2 as an LVD introduces additional complexity in understanding and predicting the overall catalytic behavior. This complexity is compounded by the fact that the catalytic properties depend not just on the dopant itself, but on how it interacts with and modifies the surrounding NiO surface.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为。铌具有五个价电子，当掺杂到NiO中时，替代二价镍原子，表现为强Lewis碱。这导致氧气在铌掺杂剂上强烈吸附，在表面形成NbO2基团。

NbO2基团随后表现为低价掺杂剂（LVD），使表面变成Lewis酸。这种酸性特征激活了附近的氧原子，使它们更具反应性。因此，在NbO2基团附近形成氧空位所需的能量显著低于未掺杂的NiO表面。

NbO2掺杂剂的存在还促进了乙烷的解离吸附。NbO2基团附近的活化氧原子可以更容易地与H或CH3CH2片段结合，降低了C-H键断裂的能量障碍。这种特性是LVD掺杂氧化物的典型特征，有利于乙烷的氧化脱氢。

然而，由于这些催化系统的复杂性，在协调理论预测和实验观察之间存在挑战。氧气在铌掺杂剂上的强吸附（能量为8.40 eV）意味着涉及这些氧原子的反应不太可能产生气相产物，可能限制了它们的催化活性。此外，解离片段的各种可能结构和涉及的能量范围（0.06到1.06 eV）表明存在复杂的反应景观，在实验设置中可能难以精确预测或控制。

此外，从铌作为强碱到NbO2作为LVD的转变，在理解和预测整体催化行为方面引入了额外的复杂性。这种复杂性还因为催化性质不仅取决于掺杂剂本身，还取决于它如何与周围的NiO表面相互作用并修饰它而加剧。
