[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

[4] "It seems that the introduction of promoting metals causes additional segregation of the nickel phase, with the largest effect induced by niobium, with NiO crystals of 26.5 nm."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides or their various stable forms and oxidation states. However, it does indicate that niobium has a significant impact as a dopant in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 

Niobium promotion was found to be the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing reactivity towards ethane by over 50%, with only a small decrease in ethene selectivity. This suggests that niobium oxides play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity.

The addition of niobium also significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties of the catalyst. It caused the largest effect on nickel phase segregation, resulting in larger NiO crystals (26.5 nm). This structural change likely contributes to the altered catalytic behavior.

The reduction profile of the NiNb catalyst showed two distinct peaks, indicating that niobium alters the reducibility of the catalyst. This could be related to different oxidation states or interactions between niobium and nickel oxides.

While these experimental observations provide insights into niobium's influence, the literature does not discuss theoretical predictions or challenges in reconciling theory with experiments for these complex catalytic systems. More detailed studies would be needed to fully understand the relationship between niobium oxide properties and catalytic performance in ethane ODH.

文献并未提供关于铌氧化物多样性质或其各种稳定形态和氧化态的详细信息。然而，它确实指出铌作为掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢反应的NiO催化剂有显著影响。

研究发现铌的添加对乙烷ODH最有益，提高了对乙烷的反应活性超过50%，同时乙烯选择性仅略有下降。这表明铌氧化物在提高催化活性方面起着关键作用。

铌的添加还显著改变了催化剂的结构和催化性能。它对镍相的分离产生了最大影响，形成了更大的NiO晶体（26.5纳米）。这种结构变化可能导致了催化行为的改变。

NiNb催化剂的还原曲线显示了两个明显的峰，表明铌改变了催化剂的可还原性。这可能与铌和镍氧化物之间的不同氧化态或相互作用有关。

虽然这些实验观察为铌的影响提供了洞见，但文献并未讨论理论预测或在这些复杂催化体系中协调理论与实验的挑战。需要更详细的研究来充分理解铌氧化物性质与乙烷ODH催化性能之间的关系。
