[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

[4] "It seems that the introduction of promoting metals causes additional segregation of the nickel phase, with the largest effect induced by niobium, with NiO crystals of 26.5 nm."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides or their various stable forms and oxidation states. However, it does indicate that niobium as a dopant has significant effects on NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Niobium promotion was found to be the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing reactivity towards ethane by over 50%, with only a small decrease in ethene selectivity.

2. Niobium significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties of the catalyst.

3. The NiNb catalyst showed a unique reduction profile with two distinct peaks, suggesting the presence of different niobium species or interactions with nickel.

4. Niobium caused the most significant segregation of the nickel phase, resulting in larger NiO crystals.

These observations suggest that niobium interacts strongly with the nickel and alumina support, altering the catalyst's structure and redox properties. However, the literature does not provide detailed explanations of the underlying mechanisms or how they relate to niobium's various oxidation states and stable forms. 

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these systems likely stems from the complexity of the interactions between niobium, nickel, and the support. The multiple effects observed (increased reactivity, structural changes, altered reduction behavior) suggest that simple models may not adequately capture the full range of phenomena occurring in these catalysts. More detailed characterization and in-situ studies would be needed to fully understand the role of niobium's diverse properties in these catalytic systems.

该文献并未提供关于铌氧化物的多样性质或其各种稳定形态和氧化态的全面信息。然而，它确实表明铌作为掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO催化剂有显著影响：

1. 铌的促进被发现对乙烷ODH最有益，增加了对乙烷的反应活性超过50%，仅使乙烯选择性略有下降。

2. 铌显著改变了催化剂的结构和催化性能。

3. NiNb催化剂显示出独特的还原曲线，具有两个明显的峰值，表明存在不同的铌物种或与镍的相互作用。

4. 铌导致镍相最显著的分离，形成了更大的NiO晶体。

这些观察结果表明，铌与镍和氧化铝载体强烈相互作用，改变了催化剂的结构和氧化还原性能。然而，文献并未对潜在机制或它们如何与铌的各种氧化态和稳定形态相关联提供详细解释。

在这些系统中，协调理论预测与实验观察的主要挑战可能源于铌、镍和载体之间相互作用的复杂性。观察到的多重效应（反应活性增加、结构变化、还原行为改变）表明，简单模型可能无法充分捕捉这些催化剂中发生的全部现象。需要更详细的表征和原位研究才能充分理解铌的多样性质在这些催化体系中的作用。
