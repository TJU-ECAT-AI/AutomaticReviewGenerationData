[1] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[3] "The NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides or their various stable forms and oxidation states. It only briefly mentions that niobium promotion significantly modifies the structural and catalytic properties of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 

The introduction of niobium was found to be the most beneficial, increasing ethane reactivity by over 50% with only a small decrease in ethene selectivity. The NiNb catalyst also showed a unique reduction profile with two distinct peaks, suggesting niobium alters the reducibility of nickel species.

However, the document does not discuss theoretical predictions or challenges in reconciling theory with experiments for these catalytic systems. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the complexities of niobium oxide behavior as a dopant in NiO catalysts for this reaction.

文献没有提供关于铌氧化物的多样性质或其各种稳定形式和氧化态的详细信息。它只是简单提到铌的添加显著改变了Ni/Al2O3催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的结构和催化性质。

研究发现铌的引入是最有益的,它使乙烷的反应活性提高了50%以上,同时乙烯选择性只略有下降。NiNb催化剂还表现出独特的还原曲线,有两个明显的峰值,这表明铌改变了镍物种的可还原性。

然而,该文献并未讨论理论预测或在研究这些复杂催化系统时调和理论与实验结果的挑战。要全面解决铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂的复杂行为问题,还需要进行更详细的研究。
