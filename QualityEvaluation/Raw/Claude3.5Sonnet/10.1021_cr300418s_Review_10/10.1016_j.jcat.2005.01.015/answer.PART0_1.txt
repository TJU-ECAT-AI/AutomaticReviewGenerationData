[1] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[3] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides or their various stable forms and oxidation states. It only mentions that niobium promotion significantly modified the structural and catalytic properties of NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium was found to be the most beneficial promoter, increasing reactivity towards ethane by over 50% with only a small decrease in ethene selectivity. The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst showed two distinct reduction peaks, suggesting complex interactions between niobium and nickel species. However, the document does not discuss challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these catalytic systems. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question about the influence of niobium oxides' properties on their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for this reaction.

文献没有提供关于铌氧化物的多样性质或其各种稳定形态和氧化态的详细信息。它只提到铌的添加显著改变了NiO催化剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢的结构和催化性能。铌被发现是最有益的助剂，提高了对乙烷的反应活性超过50%，同时乙烯选择性只略有下降。NiNb催化剂的TPR曲线显示了两个明显的还原峰，表明铌和镍物种之间存在复杂的相互作用。然而，该文献并未讨论在研究这些复杂催化系统时，如何调和理论预测和实验观察之间的挑战。要全面回答关于铌氧化物性质如何影响其作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂行为的问题，还需要进行更详细的研究。
