[1] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[3] "The NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the diverse properties of niobium oxides or their various stable forms and oxidation states. However, it does indicate that niobium as a dopant has a significant impact on NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 

Niobium promotion was found to be the most beneficial for ethane ODH, substantially increasing reactivity towards ethane while only slightly decreasing ethene selectivity. This suggests that niobium oxides interact with the NiO catalyst in a way that enhances its ability to activate ethane molecules.

The presence of two distinct reduction peaks in the NiNb catalyst implies that niobium creates two different types of reducible species or sites on the catalyst surface. This could be related to different oxidation states or structural forms of niobium oxides.

The literature does not discuss challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these catalytic systems. More detailed studies on the nature of niobium species and their interactions with NiO would be needed to fully address the complexities raised in the question.

文献没有提供关于铌氧化物的多样性质或其各种稳定形式和氧化态的详细信息。然而，它确实表明铌作为掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO催化剂有显著影响。

研究发现，铌的促进作用对乙烷ODH最有利，大幅提高了对乙烷的反应活性，同时仅略微降低了乙烯的选择性。这表明铌氧化物与NiO催化剂的相互作用方式增强了其活化乙烷分子的能力。

NiNb催化剂存在两个不同的还原峰，这意味着铌在催化剂表面创造了两种不同类型的可还原物种或位点。这可能与铌氧化物的不同氧化态或结构形式有关。

文献没有讨论在协调这些催化系统的理论预测和实验观察方面的挑战。要充分解决问题中提出的复杂性，需要对铌物种的性质及其与NiO的相互作用进行更详细的研究。
