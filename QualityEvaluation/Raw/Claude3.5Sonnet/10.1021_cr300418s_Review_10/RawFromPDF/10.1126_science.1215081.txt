ically separated before, but the connection to 
subcellular compartments is new. The authors 
tie these points together with previous results 
( 
8,  
11) in a model (see the ﬁ
 gure).
The most surprising ﬁ
 nding from these 
studies is that EDS1 interacts with AvrRps4 
and another bacterial effector protein HopA1. 
Bhattacharjee et al. show that AvrRps4 and 
HopA1 interact directly with EDS1 in vitro 
and disrupt interactions between EDS1, 
SRFR1, and TIR-NB-LRR proteins at the 
endomembrane. Heidrich et al. demonstrate 
that AvrRps4 binds directly to EDS1, but 
not RPS4, in vivo. These results suggest that 
AvrRps4 and HopA1 evolved independently 
to target EDS1 and thereby interfere with 
immunity. Subsequently, multiple TIR-NB-
LRR proteins evolved to guard EDS1.
In this context, EDS1 could be consid-
ered a co-receptor in a surveillance complex. 
Does this contradict the long-standing model 
that predicts a downstream signaling role for 
EDS1? In principle, the necessity of EDS1 
for resistance triggered by RPS4, RPS6, and 
SNC1 could be explained simply by its role 
as a guarded virulence target. That is, the 
absence of the target/guardee in eds1 mutants 
renders the surveillance complex incompe-
tent. However, it is important to consider the 
conservation of EDS1 in monocots (which 
do not have TIR-NB-LRR proteins), along 
with its role in basal resistance (presumably 
independent of TIR-NB-LRR proteins) and 
experiments from previous studies of EDS1 
that support a signaling role in effector-trig-
gered immunity ( 
11). The two functions are 
not mutually exclusive and could be recon-
ciled by an evolutionary model in which 
EDS1 has a relatively ancient signaling func-
tion in basal resistance that was targeted by 
effectors and also co-opted to support effec-
tor-triggered immunity. This could be further 
resolved, such as by testing whether EDS1 is 
guarded by other TIR-NB-LRR proteins.
Bhattacharjee et al. and Heidrich et al. 
provide important clues to the mystery of 
how plant immune surveillance proteins per-
ceive pathogen effectors and activate down-
stream responses. Additionally, the target-
ing of EDS1 generalizes the prediction that 
pathogens exploit “points of vulnerabil-
ity” in the immune network, which in turn 
can be guarded by NB-LRR proteins ( 
12). 
Attention can now be focused on plotting 
the sequence of events in RPS4 activation 
and understanding how effectors manipulate 
EDS1 to enhance virulence. The effector pro-
teins might serve as probes to investigate how 
EDS1 and partners regulate immunity in dif-
ferent cellular compartments. Because EDS1 
supports resistance against diverse pathogens 
in divergent plants, results from these experi-
ments can inform breeding for disease resis-
tance in crops.

lectrochemical splitting of water into 
molecular oxygen (O2), protons, and 
electrons could provide a way to store 
the electricity generated from sustainable but 
intermittent energy sources, such as wind and 
solar power, as fuels ( 
1). Hydrogen would be 
the simplest fuel to make, but the protons and 
electrons could be used to produce hydro-
carbons and alcohols from CO2 or ammonia 
from N2. A major challenge is that efﬁ
 cient 
catalysts for water electrolysis are expen-
sive and contain rare noble metals, so cost-
effective approaches will require the discov-
ery of efﬁ
 cient electrocatalysts that contain 
only Earth-abundant elements. On page 1383 
of this issue, Suntivich et al. ( 
2) describe a 
method for rational design of metal oxide 
catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. 
They discovered perovskite-structure cata-
lysts based on non-noble metals that work 
with a higher efﬁ
 ciency than one of the state-
of-the-art catalysts, iridium oxide.
Most catalyst development has been 
based on trial-and-error approaches. To ratio-
nally design a catalyst, we need to understand 
which intrinsic material characteristics, or 
descriptors, control catalysis. One approach, 
for example, is to change the electronic prop-
erties of the material through the deliberate 
addition of other elements. Finding a descrip-
tor can be very challenging because of the 
complexity of a chemical reaction involving 
several subreactions with numerous inter-
mediates. When a descriptor is identified, 
the catalytic rate typically has a “volcano”-
shaped dependence on the descriptor with 
a maximum at the optimum value of this 
descriptor (see the ﬁ
 gure, panel A) ( 
3).
Suntivich et al. conducted a system-
atic investigation of several transition metal 
oxides and deduced that the number of occu-
pied d orbital states of a speciﬁ
 c symmetry 
(eg) of the active metal can be used as the 
descriptor (see the ﬁ
 gure, panel A). They then 
searched for compositions with a descriptor 
value near the predicted optimum and iden-
tiﬁ
 ed Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3–δ perovskite as a 
good candidate. Subsequent synthesis and 
testing revealed this hypothesis to be correct.
Why does the eg occupation act as a good 
descriptor of the catalytic activity for the oxy-
gen evolution reaction? Suntivich et al. sug-
gest that it must be related to the ability of the 
surface to bond oxygen, given the suggestion, 
based on density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations, that oxygen adsorption energy is a 
good descriptor for this reaction ( 
4). The rea-
son is that all of the reaction intermediates 
(*OH, *O, *OOH, where the asterisk indicates 
a bond to the surface) interact with the sur-
face through an O atom. Some reaction steps 
(such as the formation of *OH or *O from 
H2O) become easier when O atoms interact 
more strongly with the surface, whereas other 
steps (such as *O + H2O → OOH− + H+ + e–)

Discovering descriptors for catalyst performance. (A) For many catalytic 
reactions, intrinsic catalyst parameters, or descriptors, can be identiﬁ
 ed (such as 
changes in electronic properties created by using different metals) that lead to a 
“volcano plot” for the reaction rate. (B) Suntivich et al. identiﬁ
 ed the occupation 
of d states with eg symmetry as a good descriptor for the oxygen evolution reac-
tion over metal oxide catalysts. We include DFT calculations ( 
7) to show that the 
descriptor can also be the t2g symmetry occupation or the adsorption energy of 
oxygen. (C) Schematic of the formation of a bond between an oxygen adsorbate 
level and the d states of the oxide, explaining why the occupancy of the d states

become more difficult because surface-
oxygen bonds are ruptured.
This tradeoff was exploited and led to the 
identiﬁ
 cation of an optimum surface-oxygen 
interaction energy that maximizes the over-
all rate. This approach follows the Sabatier 
principle ( 
5), which states that the interaction 
between the catalysts and the adsorbate should 
be neither too strong nor too weak, but intro-
duces the important new aspect of quantify-
ing this interaction strength ( 
3). The electronic 
structure of these solid oxides is described by 
band theory. Unlike an isolated molecule, 
the valence bands and conduction bands can 
be partially filled with electrons, which is 
described as a density of states (DOS).
We show in the ﬁ
 gure, panel B, that the 
notion that the surface-oxygen bond energy 
scales with the eg occupation is borne out by 
direct DFT calculation. In addition, there is 
a similar correlation with the occupancy of 
the other d symmetry component, t2g. A more 
detailed analysis of the electronic structure 
reveals that the occupation of eg and t2g states 
has two contributions, one from occupied 
valence band states and one from occupied 
conduction band states. The best correlation 
is with the number of occupied conduction 
band states. Hence, it is the reactive states 
near the Fermi level (which separates the 
occupied from the unoccupied states) that are 
responsible for the occupancy of eg/t2g states 
being a good descriptor.
The interaction between these surface 
states and the O 2p adsorbate levels gives rise 
to bonding and antibonding O states (see the 
ﬁ
 gure, panel C). The adsorption strength will 
depend on the occupancy of these bonding 
and antibonding O states and will be strongest 
when the O bonding states are completely 
occupied while the O antibonding states are 
completely unoccupied. This bonding inter-
action resembles the ones between an adsor-
bate and a transition metal surface, in which 
the d-band center of the metal is a descriptor 
( 
3), and between an adsorbate and a transition 
metal carbide surface, in which the center of 
the surface resonance states is a descriptor ( 
6).
The work of Suntivich et al. provides 
a new approach for science-based catalyst 
design and for ﬁ
 nding cheap and efﬁ
 cient 
alternatives to the known inorganic catalysts 
for water splitting. Their work is an important 
step toward sustainable fuel production, and 
could also provide insights into more direct 
approaches in which incident light helps to 
power the water-splitting process.

ivil wars between ethnic or religious 
groups have cost millions of lives in 
recent history ( 
1). In Bosnia and Her-
zegovina alone, tens of thousands were killed 
and millions displaced in the war between 
1992 and 1995. However, although intense 
hatred against other groups can lead to trag-
edy, it often seems to come in tandem with 
stronger altruism and cooperation within 
one’s own group ( 
2,  
3). This combination may 
have played a key role in early human devel-
opment ( 
4). Are there ways to mitigate group 
conﬂ
 ict while at the same time harvesting the 
potential beneﬁ
 ts from stronger cooperation 
within groups? A report by Alexander and 
Christia on page 1392 of this issue ( 
5) sug-
gests that the answer is yes, under the right 
circumstances.
The conditions under which conflicts 
emerge between groups are not well under-
stood. Two African tribes—the Chewas and 
the Tumbukas—provide a stark example: 
They get along with each other in Zambia, 
but relations are hostile in the neighboring 
state of Malawi ( 
6). Ethnoreligious diversity 
alone does not always create conflict. The 
environment in which different groups inter-
act seems to matter for whether the dark side 
of group membership emerges.
It has been suggested that integration of 
different previously warring groups can mit-
