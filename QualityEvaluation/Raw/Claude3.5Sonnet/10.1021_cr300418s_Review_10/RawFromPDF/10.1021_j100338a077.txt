ruthenium complex and viologen to the micellar surface, the result 
being approximately equivalent radical yields whether in the 
presence or absence of SDS micelles. 
However, for 
R u M C ~ ~ + / C ~ V ~ +  
and R u M C ~ ~ + / C ~ ~ V ~ +  
the breakup of the 
self-association of C,V2+ by the SDS micelles dominates, and the 
radical yields decrease in the presence of SDS micelles. 
The interaction between RuMCS2+ 
and C,V2+ is not suggested 
to be intimate enough to allow rapid back-electron-transfer, since 
significant radical yields are observed. While the structural picture 
is rather imperfect, it does seem clear that alkyl chains on the 
electron donor and acceptor generate subtle ultrastructural changes 
that potentially allow control of the photoinduced electron-transfer 
efficiency. 
Conclusions 
The results in Figure 1 indicate a net electron transfer between 
photoexcited tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen when 
bound to SDS micelles at 77 K. Based upon 
the similarity in ESR 
spectral properties, the observed signal is attributed to the viologen 
monocation radical. Noticeably absent from the ESR spectra was 
any indication of another radical species, which one would expect 
to arise from the oxidized ruthenium chromophore. Two very 
distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the 
R~(bpy),~+ 
radi~al,~'J~ 
either of which should have been easily 
recognized in the samples in the present study. Presumably, this 
other radical species is not stable in frozen micellar or frozen 
aqueous solutions. 
The trends shown for the radical yields observed in the different 
samples indicate variability in the average separation distance

between ruthenium and viologen molecules. One explanation of 
these trends is that both the ruthenium complex and the viologen 
molecule become embedded in the SDS micellar interface to 
varying degrees, depending on their alkyl chain length. This 
interpretation explains two major features of Figure 4. 
First, for 
the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ 
to 
CzoV2+,. 
suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being 
inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing 
alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium 
chromophore. 
Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium 
complexes with c6v2+ 
and c8v2+. 
One expects these complexes 
to be embedded deeper into the micelle, and optimum proximity 
to the alkylmethylviologens apparently occurs for hexyl to octyl. 
In 
aqueous solutions without SDS micelles the differences in 
yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the 
alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen 
solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains. The larger 
aggregates have a greater tendency to associate with RuMCS2+, 
but with Ru(bpy)?+, association of the larger aggregates is 
modified by charge effects. In 
the presence of SDS micelles the 
C,V2+ aggregates are broken up and the radical yields are affected 
accordingly.

The dark and photocatalytic properties of Ni-doped WS2 supported on Si02 
were investigated. Adding Ni increases the 
dark catalytic hydrogen evolution activity of WS2. With separate particles of CdS on SiO, to photosensitize WS2/Si02, 
the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Ni-doped WS2 
maximizes at intermediate Ni loading levels. With fluorescein 
as a sensitizer, the addition of Ni lowers the activity of WS2. We interpret the results in terms of a model in which Ni on 
the surface of WS2 plays an important role in controlling the surface geometric and electronic properties of the substrate 
and thereby the efficiency of interfacial energy and charge transfer. 
Introduction 
In 
a previous paper,' we reported catalytic hydrogen evolution 
properties of silica-supported tungsten disulfide, which we studied 
using both electrochemical and photocatalytic methods. Although 
the hydrogen evolution overpotential of WS2/Si02 
was larger than 
that of silica-supported platinum, silica-supported tungsten di- 
sulfide was more active and stable than Pt/SiO, both in the dark 
and under visible light illumination in the presence of cadmium 
sulfide as a sensitizer. 
According to the literature, doping of tungsten or molybdenum 
sulfides with group VIIIB metals (Ni or Co) causes a substantial 
improvement in their catalytic activity for dehydrogenation and 
hydrodesulfurization of organic corn pound^.^-^^ However, dif- 
ferent opinions exist concerning the incorporation of nickel (or

proposed the formation of mixed compounds (nickel and tungsten)

In this paper the catalytic hydrogen evolution properties of 
nickel-doped tungsten disulfide supported on silica were studied 
in several different reaction systems, both dark and photochemical. 
Nickel doping enhances the catalytic properties of WS2/Si02 
for 
dark hydrogen evolution from acidic V2+ 
solution. In photodriven 
systems, the catalytic action of Ni-WS2/Si02 in the presence of 
various sensitizers depends on the kind of sensitizer. A possible 
explanation of the observed phenomena is given in terms of in- 
terfacial charge and energy transfer which we propose is controlled 
by Ni on the WS2 surfaces. 
Experimental Section 
A. Sample Preparation. Ni-WS2/Si02. In the first step, 
W03.nH20/Si02 
(1.15 X 
mol of W 0 3  
per 1 g of SO2) 
was 
prepared in the manner described elsewhere's2 and dried at 100 
OC. The sample contained 30.5 wt % H20 
as established by 
conventional gravimetric analysis. Then 1 g of WO3.nHzO/SiO2 
was impregnated with an appropriate amount of nickel(I1) for- 
mate, dried, calcined in air at 400 O
C
 
for 3 h, and finally annealed 
in H2S 
at 300 O
C
 for 2 h. 
WS2/Si02. 
WS2/Si02 (without Ni doping) was prepared in 
a similar way, except that the Ni impregnation step was omitted. 
NiS/Si02. NiS/Si02 was prepared by impregnation of silica 
(EH-5, Cab-0-Sil) with nickel formate (1.15 X 
mol of Ni2+ 
per 1 g of SO2) and was treated similarly to Ni-WS2/Si02. 
CdS/Si02. CdS/Si02 was prepared as reported in earlier 
work .

B. Experimental Procedures. 1 .  Dark Catalytic Hydrogen 
Evolution from p+ 
Solution. A 0.5 M VC13 solution in 30% 
H2S04 was prepared, and vanadium(II1) ions were reduced on 
Hg/Zn in an argon atmosphere. Twenty milliliters of water was 
poured into a reaction cell (approximate volume 42 mL). The 
reaction cell was stoppered with a septum through which two 
needles penetrated. These allowed for gas flow and sampling for 
gas chromatography (GC). After the water was deaerated with 
flowing argon, 10 mL of the V2+ 
solution was injected into it. A 
catalyst (WS2/Si02, 
Ni-WS2/Si02, or NiS/Si02) slurry in water 
was prepared by sonication of 10 mg of the appropriate powder 
in 10 mL of water under flowing argon. Then 0.2 mL of the 
deaerated catalyst slurry was injected into the reaction cell. The 
cell was kept in the dark, and the reaction mixture was stirred 
by means of a magnetic stirrer (small, Pyrex-covered bar).

Results and Discussion 
Pure WS2/Si02, NiS/Si02, and five nickel-doped tungsten 
disulfide samples supported on silica were prepared. The Ni/(Ni 
+ W) ratios were 0.07, 0.10,0.12, 0.15, and 0.22. The amount 
of WS2 was fixed (1.15 X IU3 
mol of WS2 
per 1 g of Si02). XRD 
analysis was performed for WS2/Si02, 
NiS/Si02, and Ni-doped 
WS2/Si02. All of the Ni-doped WS2/Si02 
samples showed only 
lines characteristic of tungsten disulfide, although their intensities 
varied from sample to sample. No lines characteristic of NiS were 
found in any case. As Ni was added, the c-axis spacing of WS2 
did not change. All the lines characteristic of WS2 broadened, 
suggesting smaller crystallites when Ni was added. This suggests 
a solid solution at the surface of NiS in WS2 rather than two 
separate phases. Because the c-axis spacing was constant, a bulk 
solid solution is unlikely. However, it is impossible to determine, 
on the basis of powder XRD analysis alone, which sites in WS2 
are occupied by nickel ions. 
The results of a dark catalytic hydrogen evolution from acidic 
Vz+ solution (0.1 M H2S04) 
are shown in Figure 1 and in Figure 
2 (curve 2). Nickel doping clearly enhances the catalytic properties 
of WS2 
for dark hydrogen evolution. By comparison, the hydrogen 
evolution properties of NiS/Si02 (Figure 1) are very poor. The 
rate of H2 
evolution on WS2/Si02 
was 120 pL h-' whereas on 
0.22 Ni-WS2/Si02 (the most active sample) the rate was 350 
pL h-'. Because of deteriorating photochemical properties (see 
below), we did not pursue higher Ni loadings. Thus, adding nickel 
modifies the properties of WS2. Based on the XRD data, the

modification may be the result of adding some NiS to the WS2 
lattice or the result of formation of a solid solution (or a new 
compound) on 
the surface of silica-supported tungsten disulfide. 
The results of hydrogen photoproduction with a mixture of 
CdS/Si02 and Ni-WS2/Si02 from water-methanol-KOH

lution are shown in Figure 2 
(curve l). The activity attains a 
maximum with Ni/(Ni + 
W) = 0.12. 
All nickel-doped samples 
are more active than undoped WS2/Si02. The NiS/Si02 (not 
shown) shows an activity about 2 times lower than undoped 
WS2/Si02. The difference in the hydrogen evolution activity of 
Ni-WS2/Si02 in the dark experiment with V2+ acidic solution 
and under visible light irradiation using separate particles of 
CdS/Si02 as a sensitizer can be understood if we assume that, 
in the latter case, the interaction of the two separately supported 
components plays a role in the overall activity. It was shown in 
our previous pap?' that agglomeration of CdS/Si02 and R/Si02 
played an essential role in hydrogen evolution from water- 
methanol-KOH.

results here show that, although the catalytic hydrogen 
evolution properties of Ni-WS2/Si02 increase with added nickel, 
the interaction of CdS/Si02 with Ni-WS2/Si02 becomes poorer 
at higher nickel loading. The reasons are unclear, but one pos- 
sibility is that added Ni has two effects which oppose each other: 
(1) it quenches the excited state of CdS, and (2) 
it catalyzes H2 
evolution. Another possibility is that Ni decreases the interaction 
between particles containing CdS and those containing Ni-WS2. 
The most surprising results were obtained with fluorescein as 
a sensitizer and methanol as a sacrificial electron donor. Only 
undoped WS2/Si02 evolved hydrogen, and the average (4 
h of 
illumination) rate was 2
5
 
pL 
h-l. Neither the nickel-doped samples 
nor the NiS/Si02 
was active. A little hydrogen was evolved during 
the first 30 min of illumination. However, a similar amount was 
observed at the beginning of illumination of the catalysts in 
water-methanol (with and without KOH) with no sensitizers 
present. This small amount of hydrogen is attributed to a pho- 
tochemical reaction between the WS2 surface and the metha- 
nol-water solution. The absence of activity for all the nickel-doped 
WS2/Si02 
samples suggests that the surface sites and the ac- 
companying local electronic structure responsible for the inter- 
action between WS2 and fluorescein are significantly altered,

EDTA (disodium 
salt) solution in the presence of tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) 
chloride as a sensitizer and methylviologen chloride as an electron 
relay are shown in Figure 3. 
Clearly, despite changes in the 
activity at the beginning of illumination (which are due to the 
varying extent of H2 
adsorption by the catalyst; see the discussion 
in our previous paper'), the activities of the catalysts (except 
NiS/Si02) are nearly the same over the time period 2-4 h. 
Moreover, the activities of the undoped WS2/Si02 
and all nick- 
el-doped samples were nearly the same (1

-

8 pL 
h-l) over the 
time period 4-20 h (not shown in Figure 3). Keeping in mind 
that the hydrogen evolution activity of Ni-WS2/Si02 is much 
better than that of undoped WS2/Si02 
and that it increases with 
nickel content, it seems likely that, in this case, hydrogen evolution 
does not control the rate and that Ni does not alter charge transfer 
from the relay to WS2. 
Summing up these results, we conclude that nickel doping 
improves the catalytic hydrogen evolution properties of silica- 
supported tungsten disulfide but that the enhancement of pho- 
tosensitization efficiency is very dependent on 
the sensitizer. For 
CdS/Si02 as a sensitizer, small amounts of Ni doping of 
WS,/Si02 are beneficial. The features are similar to our earlier 
work on 
WS2/Si02-CdS/SiOz.' O
n
 
the other hand, nickel doping 
does not work well when organic molecules are used either to 
absorb light or as relays. Although we did not perform systematic 
structural and physicochemical studies of Ni-WS2/Si02, the very 
different behavior of the various systems allows us to draw some 
conclusions regarding the nickel distribution in the catalysts. Our 
results suggest the importance of Ni on 
the surface of WS2, as 
in the model proposed by Yermak~v.'~ 
This does not exclude the 
buildup of tiny nickel deposits between WS2 
layers (intercalation 
mode13s4), 
but these cannot change the c-axis spacing of WS2. 
While we did not investigate other cases, we expect that other 
metals, such as Co and Mo, may function similarly.
