It was reported that the innovation of ‘‘An Intelligent Catalyst’’ which has the self-regenerative function of Pd, and the
development for application to the Japanese ULEV standard. In this paper, the answer for a left-behind big question was replied to.
It was whether the self-regenerative function is unique to Pd or it can happen to Rh and Pt. X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
measurement at SPring-8 was used effectively to solve this question. The attempt succeeded in the development of ‘‘A Super
Intelligent Catalyst’’ which Rh and Pt can be also realized through the solid solution and segregation as well as Pd in a perovskite
crystal.

1. Introduction
In the last CAPoC6 Congress, it was reported that the
industrialization of ‘‘An Intelligent Catalyst’’ which has
the function for self-regeneration of Pd [1]. The function
was realized through a cyclic movement of Pd between
the inside (as Pd cations in the lattice) and the outside
(as Pd nano-particles) of the LaFePdO3 perovskite
crystal in synchronization with the inherent ﬂuctuations
between reductive and oxidative (redox) atmospheres
that occurred in real automotive exhaust gases. As a
result, the growth of Pd particles can be suppressed
during the entire lifetime of the vehicle and drastic
reductions in Pd consumption for automotive catalysts
can be achieved [2–8].
In this study, a remaining big question was replied to.
The question is ‘‘Is this self-regenerative function the
special phenomenon which may happen only to Pd?’’
Figure 1 shows how the amount of Rh, Pt and Pd
used for automotive catalysts has increased as a whole
over the last decade [9]. In these precious metals,
because the demand of Pd rapidly grew for the reason to
reduce cold start emissions, our initial development of
the self-regenerative function was focused on Pd. As a
result, we have been able to realize drastic reductions in
Pd consumption for automotive catalysts.
The price of Rh ﬂuctuates markedly and over 85% of
the demand for Rh coming from automotive catalyst
manufacture. Recently, demand and price for Pt are also
increasing gradually, because Pt is very useful for many
ways such as diesel catalysts and fuel cell catalysts.
Success in applying self-regenerative intelligent catalyst
technology to Rh and Pt would have immediate socio-
economic results.
X-ray absorption ﬁne structure measurement at
SPring-8 was used eﬀectively to solve this question.
The attempt succeeded in the development of ‘‘A
Super Intelligent Catalyst’’ which Rh and Pt, as well
as Pd, can be also realized through the solid solution
and segregation in a perovskite crystal. This super-
intelligent
catalyst
has
been
commercialized
from
December 2005 for Japanese SULEV catalyst, and is
expected to be the key that opens the windows for
clean air to blow in.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of powder catalyst
Rh-containing
perovskites;
LaFe0.95Rh0.05O3
and
CaTi0.95Rh0.05O3
and
Pt-containing
perovskites;
LaFe0.95Pt0.05O3 and CaTi0.95Pt0.05O3 powder catalysts
were prepared by the alkoxide method.
Metal isopropoxides, Mx+[OCH(CH3)2]x, of Ca, Ti
and
precious
metal
acetylacetonate
(Mx+(CH3CO
CHCOCH3)2) were dissolved in toluene. The amount of
precious metal was adjusted to 5 atom% of that of the
B-site element of the perovskite structure. Precipitate
containing Pd was obtained by hydrolysis with deion-
ized water. The precursor was dried and then calcined at
800 C for 2 h in the air to obtain perovskite powder
catalyst containing homogeneously distributed precious
metal.
Rh/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 powder catalysts were also
prepared as references. AI2O3 was impregnated with
nitrate solution, then dried and calcined at 500 C for
1 h in the air.

2.2. Thermal redox treatment
The Rh- and Pt-perovskite powder catalysts (LaFe-
RhO3, CaTiRhO3, LaFePtO3 and CaTiPtO3) prepared
to investigate the self-regenerative function of precious
metal were exposed to the following treatment: First, the
samples were oxidized in the air at 800 C for 1 h. They
were then reduced in 2.5% H2 and 7.5% CO balanced
with nitrogen gas at 800 C for 1 h. Finally, the catalysts
were re-oxidized in the air at 800 C for 1 h (ﬁgure 2)
[3,5]. These successive single-run treatments created a
separate model for each of the key stages of exhaust gas
from a gasoline engine.
2.3. Characterization
2.3.1. X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS)
In order to investigate the self-regenerative function
of precious metal in perovskite oxides, X-ray absorption
ﬁne structure (XAFS) measurement near the Rh K-edge
or the Pt Liii-edge was carried out using 8-GeV
synchrotron radiation at beam line of BL01B1 in
SPring-8, Japan. Extended X-ray absorption ﬁne struc-
ture (EXAFS) oscillations were analyzed with standard
procedures, in order to know the local structure around
precious metal.
The powder from each catalyst sample was pressed to
form pellets. X-ray absorption spectra were measured by
scanning a Si (311) for Rh or Si (111) for Pt double
crystal monochromator. The photon energy was cali-
brated with Rh or Pt powder by assigning 23.224 or
11.559 keV to the energy at half the edge jump. The
powder of Rh2O3 and PtO2 were also measured as
standard materials for the edge position of the samples
[10,11].
2.3.2. Transmissive electron microscopy (TEM)
Rh and Pt particles of the catalysts after oxidation,
reduction and reoxidation were observed by TEM at the
magniﬁcation of 400,000·.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. XAFS analysis for Rh- and Pt-perovskite powder
Figure 3 shows the calculated radial structure func-
tion around Rh for LaFeRhO3 and CaTiRhO3 per-
ovskties. All the Rh of LaFeRhO3 was present as a
solid-solution in perovskite after oxidation, but only
about 37% of Rh segregated even after reduction at
800 C (table 1). By replacing the perovskite from
La3+Fe3+O3
to
Ca2+Ti4+O3,
the
segregation
of
metallic Rh particles after reduction is signiﬁcantly
improved [10].
Figure 4 shows the calculated radial structure func-
tion around Pt for LaFePtO3 and CaTiPtO3 perovskites.
All the Pt of LaFePtO3 was present as a solid-solution in
perovskite after oxidation, and almost Pt segregated
after reduction, but only about 78% of Pt restored to
the perovskite lattice. By replacing the perovskite from
La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3, the restoration rate of Pt
after re-oxidation is signiﬁcantly improved.
3.2. Rh and Pt particle observation after redox treatment
TEM observations of Rh and Pt particles in CaTi-
RhO3 and CaTiPtO3 after redox treatments are shown
in ﬁgure 5(a–f). The magniﬁcation is 400,000· and the
bar in this ﬁgure measures 10 nm.
In oxidized samples, Rh and Pt particles are not
discoverable by TEM. This indicates that Rh and Pt are
dissolved in the perovskite as a solid-solution. In

reduced samples, metallic nano-particles about 1–3 nm
in diameter are found at the perovskite surface. It is
expected that these ﬁne metallic particles have very high
catalytic activity. In re-oxidized samples, precious metal
particles are once again dissolved in the perovskite
crystal structure and invisible even by the precise TEM
observation.
It
demonstrates
that
CaTiRhO3
and
CaTiPtO3 has the self-regenerative function of Rh and
Pt, moving in and out of the perovskite structure in
relation to the ﬂuctuation of oxidation and reduction
atmospheres.
3.3. Universality of the new catalyst design with the self-
regenerative function
The perovskite-type oxides are very useful because of
their structural durability and the abundance of their
possible combination. The requirement for the self-
regenerative intelligent catalyst is as follows. The oxide,
which makes perovskite representative, should maintain
a stable structure to heal the precious metal at high
temperatures in a redox environment. Under reductive
conditions, the precious metal emerges from the frame-
work of the perovskite to form metallic clusters or nano-
particles. Under oxidative conditions, the precious metal
comes back to the perovskite framework to refresh itself.
The precious metal repeats the cycle of solid-solution
and segregation responding to the inherent cycling
between an oxidative and a reductive environment. For
optimization of the self-regenerative function, it is
important to design the valency, the ionic radius, the
chemical state, etc. of the catalyst and provide it har-
mony of easiness between solid-solution and segrega-
tion.
4. Conclusion
1. The advanced intelligent catalysts with the self-
regenerative function of Rh and Pt were developed
successfully.
2. From X-ray research, by replacing the perovskite
from La3+Fe3+O3 to Ca2+Ti4+O3, the self-regen-
erative function was signiﬁcantly improved.
3. TEM observations of CaTiRhO3 and CaTiPtO3
showed that the segregated Rh and Pt after reduction
were ﬁne (about 1–3 nm).
4. The universal technology for designing the self-
regenerative intelligent catalyst was able to be pro-
posed.
5. This innovative technology is expected not only to
enable further reductions in precious metal use but
also to open the way to new applications, such as for
diesel catalysts.
