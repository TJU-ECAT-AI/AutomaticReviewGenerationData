Abstract
In order to obtain useful information about the effect of Sr, Pd promotion and calcination temperature on the reducibility of La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d
perovskites, CO-TAP in combination with XRD, BET, TG-DTA, and SEM were employed to characterise the perovskite oxides prepared by the
method of sol–gel auto-combustion. Reducibility of the perovskites was studied by means of the oxygen release capacity measurement in which a
TAP reactor system was used to perform the CO pulse or alternate CO–O2 pulse experiments. Partial substitution of La3+ by Sr2+ in LaFeO3
signiﬁcantly enhanced the reducibility and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d showed the highest reducibility among the La1xSrxFeO3d perovskites. An
incorporation of Pd in replacement of 5 mol% of Fe into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d caused a signiﬁcant decrease of reduction temperature and an
enhancement of reducibility. Moreover, the thermal stability was improved in the presence of Pd. It was found that the reducibility was strongly
affected by the calcination temperatures. Extremely high reducibility (ca. 650 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSC and ca. 800 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSCC) was
observed on the 1000 8C calcined La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d although its BET speciﬁc surface area was very low. We concluded that calcination of
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d at relatively high temperatures was favourable of creating more lattice defects and the lattice defects instead of surface
area were mainly responsible for the reducibility.

1. Introduction
Perovskite oxides (ABO3) are suitable functional materials
for many applications owing to their attractive physical and
chemical properties, such as high temperature superconductiv-
ity or thermoelectricity, as well as interesting catalytic
properties for various redox reactions. And perovskite oxides
have the great advantages of low cost and high thermochemical
stability. Because perovskite oxides can efﬁciently oxidize
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and reduce nitrogen
oxides simultaneously, they are regarded as effective three-way
catalysts (TWCs) for controlling automotive exhaust emissions.
Particularly, the Co and Mn based perovskite oxides were
tentatively investigated in the mid-1970s as potential sub-
stitutes for noble metal (Pt, Rh, Pd) auto-exhaust catalysts [1,2].
However, the application of perovskite oxides in industrial
processes is limited, mainly because of their low surface areas
and lower resistance to poisoning by water and sulfur [3].
Though noble metal TWCs show high activity and resistance to
water and sulfur poisoning, these catalysts suffer from the noble
metal sintering and metal volatilisation in the exhaust steam at
high temperatures [4,5]. Many studies reported that proper
incorporation of a small amount of noble metals into perovskite
structure could stabilize the metals against sintering, reaction
with the support and volatilisation [6–8]. Moreover, the
catalytic properties were improved, especially for the reduction
of NOx. For example, the incorporation of Rh into LaMnO3.15
led to high three-way catalytic activity for CO + NO + C3H6
mixture and the catalyst showed high performance in rich/lean
oscillating compositions [9]. For the noble metals incorporated
perovskites, an interesting study of LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 by
Tanaka et al. [10,11] brought new insight into the behaviour of
Pd in perovskite structure that Pd could reversibly move into
and out of the perovskite lattice to suppress the growth of Pd
particles, called self-regeneration of noble metal.

Up to date, several characterisation techniques have been
used to investigate the TWCs’ redox properties which are
responsible for the exhaust gas depollution. TPR (Temperature
Programmed Reduction) is widely applied to characterise the
reduction degree of TWCs as a function of temperature, what is
generally called ‘total’ oxygen storage capacity (OSCC).
However, the transient aspects involved in oxygen exchange
during redox processes are more important and great care
should be paid on the so-called ‘fast’ oxygen storage capacity
(OSC). CO pulse experiment was therefore explored by Yao
and co-worker to measure OSC of automotive exhaust
catalysts [12]. Moreover, the alternate CO–O2 pulse experi-
ment for dynamic OSC measurement was developed to offer a
more appropriate characterization of redox properties of
TWCs [13–16]. TAP (temporal analysis of products) reactor
system, which is usually used to investigate ‘gas–solid’
reactions in many areas of chemical kinetics and hetero-
geneous catalysis reaction, is operated under high vacuum
operation and has the great advantage of accurately quanti-
tative assessment of the accumulation of species on the catalyst
surfaces due to its submillisecond scale resolution [16–18].
Thus, quantitative assessment of TWCs’ OSC can be
accurately achieved by the CO pulse and alternate CO–O2
pulse experiments using TAP reactor.
Ceria-based oxides are widely used as the oxygen storage
components in three-way catalysts and their oxygen storage
capacity has been extensively studied by pulse experiments
[12–16,19–25]. However, the transient redox properties of
perovskite oxides were few reported [9,26,27]. In addition to
the important results of LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 [10,11], the
success of industrial application of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 in
automotive exhaust gas depollution processes [28,29] urges
us to further investigate LaCoO3 or LaFeO3. Although LaCoO3
exhibits high catalytic activity, the application of LaCoO3 is
limited because of its low thermal stability [3] and the heavy
burden of cobalt for environment. LaFeO3 was therefore chosen
as base in the present work. The A-site (La) and B-side (Fe)
were partially substituted by Sr and Pd, respectively, in order to
promote redox property. The La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d perovskites
with a relatively large surface area were prepared by the method
of sol–gel auto-combustion. The transient redox properties of
La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d were studied by TAP using pulses of CO
and O2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Samples preparation
The sol–gel auto-combustion method [30] was employed to
produce
nanoparticles
of
La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d
perovskite
oxides. Analytical grade chemicals La(NO3)36H2O, Sr(NO3)2,
Fe(NO3)39H2O, Pd(CH3COO)2, and C6H8O7 (citric acid) were
used.
The
stoichiometric
reactants
of
La(NO3)36H2O,
Sr(NO3)2, and Fe(NO3)39H2O were dissolved in citric acid
solution, and the molar ratio of citric acid to metal nitrates was
controlled to 1.1. In the case of Pd addition, Pd(CH3COO)2 was
ﬁrst dissolved in acetone then added to the citric acid solution
containing La, Sr, and Fe. The solution was adjusted to pH 1–2
by slowly adding a small amount of ammonia aqueous solution.
Then, evaporation of the solution was performed using a heater
under continuous stirring. After a viscous gel was obtained, the
stabilized nitrate–citrate gel was poured into a tray and heated
slowly. The dried gel burnt in a self-propagating combustion
manner and loose powders were obtained, called as-synthesized
powders. Calcination of the as-synthesized powders was
performed at 500, 750, 1000, and 1200 8C for 5 h in air.
2.2. Samples characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rint
2500 diffractometer (Rigaku. Co. Ltd.) using Cu Ka radiation
with a scanning range (2u) from 108 to 808. BET speciﬁc
surface areas were measured by adsorption of N2 at 196 8C
(Belsorp-mini, BEL JAPAN, INC.). Samples were dehydrated
under N2 ﬂow at 300 8C for 1 h before N2 adsorption
measurement. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inves-
tigation of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d was carried out using a
Hitachi S-2400 instrument.
2.3. TAP reactor system
TAP reactor system consists of gas injection, reactor and
mass spectrometer. Four gas-pulsed valves were arranged to
automatically control the feed of gas injection. A quartz tube
reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm was used in an
electrical oven and pumped to 102 to 103 Pa with a rotary
pump. A part of gas ﬂow from reactor passed through a
capillary and was detected by a mass spectrometer located at
the reactor outlet. A rotary pump combined with a turbo
molecular pump was employed to pump the chamber of mass
spectrometer to high vacuum (106 Pa). The gases were
monitored with a mass spectrometer in the continuous ﬂow
mode with masses m/e = 4(He), 28(CO), 32(O2) and 44(CO2).
The size of each pulse was controlled by adjusting the open
time of the pulse valves from 1 to 25 ms. And the accurate
amount of each pulse was determined by injecting a large
number of gas pulses into a vacuum vessel and measuring the
pressure with a high accuracy pressure gauge. The relative
responses of CO, O2 and CO2 were obtained by calculating
the responding areas of mass spectra before starting the
experiments. The m/e = 28 proﬁle has been adjusted to
eliminate contribution from CO2 (m/e = 44), in which the
peak area of m/e = 28 is amounting to 11% of the peak area of
m/e = 44.
The powder samples were ﬁrst pressed, crushed, sieved with
the size of 32–60 mesh, then 20–50 mg of samples was ﬁlled in
the tube reactor. Prior to measurement, the samples were
pretreated at 500 8C under vacuum for 3 h then O2 pulses were
fully supplied to the reactor. The redox properties of the
samples were studied using successive or alternate pulses of CO
and O2. The alternate CO–O2 pulse experiments were carried
out using the feedstream condition shown in Scheme 1. The
sizes of each CO and O2 pulse are 20.0 and 15.2 mmol,
respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and reducibility of La1xSrxFeO3d
Fig. 1(A) shows the XRD patterns of La1xSrxFeO3d (x = 0,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1) powders prepared by the method of sol–gel
auto-combustion. Exceptfor SrFeO3d (x = 1.0) with amorphous
phase, the as-synthesized La1xSrxFeO3d powders exhibit well-
deﬁned perovskite crystalline structure without the need of
calcination. The heat required for the formation of perovskite
crystalline was supplied by the exothermic, fast and self-
sustaining chemical reaction between metal nitrates and citric
acid. Fig. 1(B) shows the XRD patterns of La1xSrxFeO3d after
calcination of the as-synthesized samples at 750 8C. At x = 0.2
and 0.4, perovskite solid solutions were obtained; whereas at
x = 0.6, the peaks due to SrCO3 appeared, indicating that the
prepared samples were mixture of perovskite oxides and SrCO3.
The crystalline sizes of La1xSrxFeO3d calcined at 750 8C were
evaluated by applying the Scherrer formula [31]:
D ¼ ð0:9lÞ=½dð2uÞ cos u;
where D is the mean crystalline diameter of the particles, l the
Cu wavelength, u the diffraction angle of the perovskite X-ray
reﬂection (16.58), and d(2u) the peak width at half maximum.
The calculated results shown in Table 1 varied between 14 and
36 nm.
With the goal of accurately measuring the reducibility of
La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d perovskites, TAP reactor was employed
and
CO
was
chosen
as
the
model
reducing
agent.
La1xSrxFeO3d calcined at 750 8C were ﬁrst fully oxidized
with O2 then exposed to successive pulses of CO at 500 8C. CO2
was produced upon CO pulses. The dependence of CO2
production on the numbers of CO pulses is shown in Fig. 2(A)
for La1xSrxFeO3d. Upon the ﬁrst CO pulse, the amount of
CO2 produced is in the order of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d > La0.4Sr0.6-
.6FeO3d  La0.8Sr0.2FeO3d > SrFeO3d > LaFeO3. A sig-
niﬁcant increase of CO2 production was observed when the
La3+ ions were partially substituted by the Sr2+ ions. After the
3rd CO pulse, the CO2 production quickly decreased to zero on
LaFeO3, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d, whereas high
production of CO2 was still observed on La0.4Sr0.6FeO3 and
SrFeO3. It was found that the total consumption of CO was
equal to the production of CO2. And CO2 was barely produced
when O2 was added after CO pulses. These results suggested
that the consumed CO was totally conversed to CO2 and
released out from the surface of La1xSrxFeO3d.
As far as redox properties of TWC are concerned, most of
interest is concentrated on oxygen storage capacity. The oxygen
storage capacity of TWC is generally determined by the oxygen
release process because the storage of oxygen proceeds much
faster than the release of oxygen [12]. Thus, reducibility which
reﬂects the ability of releasing oxygen is a very important
assessment parameter for TWCs. Usually the conversion of CO
to CO2 is a measure of the reducibility of TWCs in the absence
of gas oxygen. In this work, the reducibility of La1xSrxFeO3d
was evaluated using the oxygen storage capacity values which
were calculated from the amount of CO2 produced on per gram
of perovskite oxides by CO pulses (mmol-CO2 g1). The
oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen storage complete
capacity (OSCC) were measured. OSC is the amount of CO2
produced upon only one CO pulse after catalysts are fully
oxidized with O2. It corresponds to the amount of the most
‘reactive’ and the most available oxygen atoms. OSCC is the
total amount of CO2 produced on a series of CO pulses until CO
is no longer oxidized, representing the maximum reducibility of
the samples. The OSC and OSCC values of La1xSrxFeO3d,
which were obtained from the successive CO pulse experi-
ments, are shown in Fig. 2(B) as a function of x. Both OSC and
OSCC values increase with the increase of Sr content when x

ranges from 0 to 0.4. With further increasing x above 0.4, the
OSC signiﬁcantly decreases while the OSCC keeps nearly
constant. SrFeO3d gives a low OSC value although its OSCC
value is quite high. These results show that the most ‘reactive’
oxygen atoms have its maximum amount on La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d
while the amount of totally reducible oxygen atoms are
independent of the Sr content on La1xSrxFeO3d when
x  0.4. It is suggested that La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d can rapidly
release oxygen in comparison to La1xSrxFeO3d (x > 0.4) in
spite of almost equivalent amount of reducible oxygen atoms on
these samples.
It is clear that the OSC and OSCC are strongly affected by
the substitution of Sr for La in LaFeO3. The signiﬁcant
enhancement of reducibility due to the small amount of Sr
additive can be explained by the theory of oxygen vacancies
and cationic defects. It is well known that perovskites are
oxides with general formula ABO3, and partial substitution of
A by A0 and B by B0 can result in the compound with formula
A1xA0xB1yB0yO3. However, A- and B-site cations should be
stable in dodecahedral and octahedral coordination states,
respectively, and electroneutrality should be satisﬁed. This
could account for the fact that stable perovskite crystalline of
La1xSrxFeO3d was only obtained at x  0.4. Since Sr2+ is
bivalent ion and La3+ is trivalent ion, the electroneutrality will
be inﬂuenced and cause O2 to change their status when Sr
enters into the LaFeO3 perovskite lattice. With a few Sr2+
cations take up the A-site, a vacancy would be created in this
site. The adjacent O2 anions on the dodecahedron sites
become more active and tend to move from the lattice. The
valence of the B cation (Fe) is consequently changed to the
higher oxidation states by this substitution. As a result, the
partial substitution of Sr for La lead to unusual oxidation states
of Fe and the simultaneous formation of structural defects. In
agreement with the literatures [3,10,32,33], an increase of Fe4+
concentration and formation of oxygen vacancies would be
resulted by doping lower valence Sr2+ cations to the La3+ site.
Thus, the enhanced reducibility of La1xSrxFeO3d due to
partial substitution of Sr for La could be attributed to the
structural oxygen vacancies and the modiﬁed reducibility of Fe
cations.
As for the inﬂuence of substitution of Sr for La on the
structure of La1xSrxFeO3d, a further discussion was made on
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d as an example. The study of the enthalpy of
formation of LaFeO3 showed that the complete solid solution
of La1xSrxFeO3d perovskite was synthesized with oxygen
contents conﬁned in a certain range [34]. La0.6Sr0.4FeO2.8–3 is
the
possible
composition
for
La1xSrxFeO3d
(x = 0.4)
prepared in this work. La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 is the case of neglecting
oxygen nonstoichiometry when strongly oxidizing atmo-
spheres are supplied. The average valence of Fe ions is
calculated in the range of 3.0–3.4 on basis of the charge
balance. For La0.6Sr0.4FeO2.8–3, 700 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSCC
was measured at 500 8C, meaning that same amount of lattice
oxygen was released. La0.6Sr0.4FeO2.65–2.85 would be therefore
obtained after OSCC measurement, and the valence of Fe is in
the range of 2.7–3.1. The average valence of Fe was reduced by
about 0.3 in the CO pulse experiment. Thus, we believed that
the structural oxygen vacancies and the modiﬁed reducibility
of Fe cations were responsible for the enhancement of OSC and
OSCC of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d. Furthermore, the possibility of
decomposition due to the reduction of Fe ions could be
ignored.

is 500 8C.
3.2. Effect of Pd promotion on reducibility and thermal
stability
It is known that OSC is more important than OSCC for TWC
in the actual operating condition of automotive exhaust gas
depollution. Among La1xSrxFeO3d, the highest OSC value
was observed on La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d. Because of the very ﬂexible
structure of perovskites, the composition, the structure and
therefore the properties can be tuned in a broad range. We
subsequently introduced Pd into La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d at the B sites
in order to further improve reducibility as well as thermal
stability.
A
5 mol%
of
Fe was
substituted
by
Pd
in
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d to form the La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d per-
ovskite. The as-synthesized samples of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d were calcined at various tempera-
tures.
The
XRD
patterns
of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d
and
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 500, 750, 1000, and
1200 8C are shown in Fig. 3 together with those of the as-
synthesized ones. A small shift to lower 2u values was observed
on La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d with respect to La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d,
indicating that palladium was incorporated into the perovskite
structure. The XRD intensity increased with an increase of
calcination temperature up to 750 8C, whereas turned to
decrease above 1000 8C. For the as-synthesized and 500 8C
calcined samples, the XRD intensity was not appreciably
different. This indicated that the combustion temperature might
exceed 500 8C during the process of sol–gel auto-combustion.
Although a negative effect on the XRD intensity was shown
upon calcination above 1000 8C, no phase segregation was
observed in the temperature range. Good thermal stability was
conﬁrmed up to 1200 8C for both samples. The particle sizes of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d were evalu-
ated and listed in Table 1 together with the BET speciﬁc surface
areas obtained from N2 adsorption isotherms. When the
calcination temperature was elevated from 500 to 1000 8C, the
particles sizes gradually increased from 14 to 24 nm.
In order to study the promotion effect of Pd on reducibility,
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at
750 8C are chosen for comparison. Fig. 4 shows the reducibility
of two samples as a function of reaction temperatures. S-shaped
curves are exhibited in the ﬁgure. The reduction temperature of
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d is about 50 8C lower than that of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d. In the temperature range 250–400 8C, both
OSC and OSCC increase with an increase of reaction
temperature. And the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d
is obviously higher than that of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d. However, it
would be surprising that above 400 8C, the OSC and OSCC
values of two samples are almost equal. The fact that the
incorporation of Pd into perovskite structure enhanced the
reducibility at relatively low reaction temperatures but not at
relatively high reaction temperatures (>400 8C) pointed to that
the Pd additive promoted the reducibility mainly through
decreasing the reduction temperature. The substitution of Pd for
Fe would favor a quicker oxygen transport through the lattice.
Even small amount of Pd were sufﬁcient to obtain remarkable
improvement of the low temperature reducibility. About the
redox behaviors of Pd in perovskite, the back and forth
movement of Pd from the ABO3 type perovskite crystal
structure have been successfully elucidated by Tanaka et al.
[10,11]. Recently, the effect of Pd on the low-temperature
activity of LaFePdOx-based automobile three-way catalysts
was further studied using thermogravimetry (TG) and NO-
pulse techniques [29]. The results of oxygen release capacity
(ORC)/oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and NO reduction
activity of LaFePdOx pointed to that highly dispersed Pd0

particles on the LaFePdOx catalyst had its own OSC/ORC as
well as overall high catalytic activity.
3.3. Effect of the temperatures of calcination on reducibiliy
Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependent OSC and OSCC of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d calcined at 500, 750, and 1000 8C. The
750 8C calcined La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d owns higher OSC and OSCC
values than the 500 and 1000 8C calcined ones. For the sample
calcined at 1000 8C, the lowest OSC was observed at the
reaction temperatures above 450 8C. But its OSCC is high close
to that of the 750 8C calcined sample. The effect of calcination
temperatures on reducibility was also investigated in the
presence of Pd. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependent OSC
and OSCC of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 500, 750,
1000, and 1200 8C. The highest reducibility was observed on
the 1000 8C calcined La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d. At tempera-
tures above 350 8C, 650 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSC and
800 mmol-CO2 g1 of OSCC were measured. Upon calcina-
tion of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d at 1200 8C, the OSC dropped
off close to that of the sample calcined at 500 8C, but the OSCC
was still quite high. The measured high values of reducibility
suggested the effectiveness of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d in
automotive
exhaust
gas
depollution.
Compared
with
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d, the reducibility and thermal stability were
signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence of Pd.
Dynamic oxygen release and storage of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95
Pd0.05O3d were measured using the alternate CO–O2 pulses. A
pulse cycle included a pair of CO and O2 pulses which were
responsible for reduction and re-oxidation, respectively. An
example is given in Fig. 7 to present the time dependent
compositions of outlet mixture at 500 8C for La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95
Pd0.05O3d calcined at 1000 8C. It was found that reduction and
re-oxidation of the sample were reversible, and full reprodu-
cibility was obtained after the ﬁrst pulse cycle. A steady state
could be very quickly reached in the transient experiment. The
information of dynamic reduction and re-oxidation obtained for
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at different temperatures
showed
that
the
effect
of

reducibility was in agreement with those results obtained in
the continuous mode.
In order to interpret the effect of calcination temperatures on
reducibility, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d was characterized by
TG-DTA, SEM and BET. In the TG-DTA measurement (Fig. 8)
of the as-synthesized La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, no obvious
exothermic peaks were observed. This suggested that the

formation of perovskite crystalline structure was nearly
completed during the process of sol–gel auto-combustion.
The perovskite crystalline structure of the as-synthesized
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d was conﬁrmed by XRD in Fig. 3.
About 11% of weight loss was measured below 500 8C, only
3% between 500 and 800 8C, and almost zero above 800 8C.
The weight loss at low temperatures was attributed to the
incomplete combustion of organics, carbon or nitrates in the as-
synthesized La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d. Whereas, the very
small amount of weight loss above 500 8C was possibly due
to the decomposition of SrCO3 or the released lattice oxygen.
The removal of these residuals at relatively high calcination
temperatures would certainly enhance reducibility. Therefore,
the
fact
that
the
as-synthesized
and
500 8C
calcined
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d showed lower reducibility than the
750 8C calcined one could be partly interpreted by the presence
of these residuals. Fig. 9(A)–(C) shows the SEM images of
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 500, 750, and 1000 8C,
respectively. The microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d
calcined at 500 8C appeared to be sponge-like because of the
vigorous decomposition and combustion of reacting precursors
in a very short period. This proved the usefulness of the method
of sol–gel auto-combustion in obtaining homogeneous, very
ﬁne, crystalline powders with a relatively larger surface area.
When the calcination temperature was elevated, the particles of
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d started to aggregate and a change of
microstructure could be seen in the ﬁgure. The BET speciﬁc

surface areas correspondingly decreased (Table 1). Although
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 1000 8C suffered from
the aggregation of perovskite particles and a very small BET
speciﬁc surface area was resulted, the sample showed the
highest reducibility. Furthermore, there was no observation of
linear relation between the reducibility and the surface areas for
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at different temperatures.
Thus, the surface areas could not account for the measured
reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d.
In order to develop more active perovskite mixed oxides,
much more effort was made to yield larger speciﬁc surface
areas by various synthesis methods. In this work, we
successfully employed the method of sol–gel auto-combustion
to
prepare
nanoparticles
of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d
and
La0.6
Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d with relatively large BET speciﬁc surface
areas (30 m2/g) even after calcination of 500 8C. When the
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d perovskites
were calcined at 750 8C, the reducibility of both samples was
enhanced in accompany with a signiﬁcant decrease of BET
speciﬁc surface areas. This was interpreted that more complete
formation of perovskite structure was required at relatively
higher calcination temperatures. It is well accepted that the
defect positions induced additives make perovskite more
active. And the activity of perovskites is related to high oxygen
mobility and redox properties of the precious metal (Pd) and
transition metal (Fe). When the La and Fe ion were partially
substituted by Sr and Pd, respectively, the perovskite lattice was
distorted and structural defection was formed. An enhancement
would be resulted for the lattice oxygen mobility and the
catalytic properties of active B cation. But for the Sr-, Pd-doped
perovskites prepared by the method of sol–gel auto-combus-
tion, the heat provided by the combustion of organic and nitrate
precursors as well as the calcination of 500 8C is not enough to
achieve the complete perovskite forms. The reason is that
perovskites are essentially high temperature oxide phase. In the
case of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, the necessary calcination
possibly exceeds 1000 8C for forming the most active
perovskite. In the temperature range 500–1000 8C, the higher

more

the
perovskite forms of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d, and the higher
the reducibility was. As a result, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d
calcined at 1000 8C showed the highest reducibility despite a
low BET speciﬁc surface area of 4 m2/g. In this work, the below
facts were obtained for the relation between the defects of
perovskite structure and reducibility: (1) partial substitution of
La by Sr in La1xSrxFeO3d (0 < x  0.4) could result in pure
perovskite crystalline structure and create structural defects; (2)
the structural oxygen vacancies and the modiﬁed reducibility of
Fe cations contributed to the enhanced OSC and OSCC of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d when La was substituted by Sr; (3) increasing
the calcination temperature of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d from
500 to 1000 8C resulted in an obvious decrease of surface area
but a signiﬁcant increase of reducibility. We therefore
concluded that the defects of perovskite structure were most
important while the surface area played a less pronounced role
on the reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d. The CO
oxidation on La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 1000 8C
was consequently considered through intra-facial mechanism
especially at high temperatures [35,36]. The oxygen reacted
with CO was mainly originating from the bulk of the solid. As
reported in literatures [37,38], two kinds of oxygen, a-oxygen
and b-oxygen, can be supplied by perovskites. The a-oxygen
was ascribed to surface oxygen whereas the b-oxygen was
attributed to lattice oxygen by the method of oxygen thermo-
desorption. The low BET surface area resulted by the high
temperature calcination of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d would
cause a signiﬁcant reduction of the amount of a-oxygen. As for
b-oxygen, its amount did not depend on the BET surface area,
but was strongly inﬂuenced by the morphology of the sample.
The high reducibility of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at
1000 8C was mainly due to b-oxygen. When the temperature of
calcination of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d was elevated to
1200 8C, a severe sintering was resulted. As a result, not only
the speciﬁc surface area of the material but also the density of
surface defects was reduced.
4. Conclusions
The CO-TAP method was employed in investigating the
reducibility of La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d prepared by the sol–gel
auto-combustion
method.
The
obtained
information
for
La1xSrxFe(Pd)O3d was summarized as the follows:
(i) The partial substitution of La by Sr enhanced the red-
ucibility of La1xSrxFeO3d. Among La1xSrxFeO3d,
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d with pure perovskite crystalline structure
exhibited the highest OSC at 500 8C.
(ii) The substitution of Pd for Fe in La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d improved
reducibility and thermal stability. The enhancement of low
temperature reducibility was interpreted that the presence
of Pd caused a decrease of reduction temperature.
(iii) The
calcination
temperatures
strongly
affected
the
reducibility
of
La0.6Sr0.4FeO3d
and
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95
Pd0.05O3d. The highest reducibility was observed on
La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.95Pd0.05O3d calcined at 1000 8C although
the calcination at this temperature caused aggregation of
perovskite particles and resulted in a very low surface area.
Finally, we concluded that suitable calcination of the Sr-
and Pd-doped perovskite oxides would be helpful for
inducing more oxygen vacancies, and the defects of
perovskite structure were most important for obtaining
high reducibility.
