Abstract
In this study, we report the development of efﬁcient Al2O3-supported Ni and promoted Ni–Me (Me = Mo, V, Nb, Ta, Co) catalysts for the
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The effect of nickel loading and the impact of the promoters on the performance of the materials are
discussed in the light of a detailed physico-chemical characterization of the catalysts by N2 adsorption, XRD, XPS, TGA-H2, and UV-DRS.
Nickel was found to interact strongly with alumina, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, whereas
NiO crystallites formed on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages. XPS revealed a chemical modiﬁcation of the NiO
particles accommodated on the alumina support. In terms of catalytic performance, increasing the Ni loading was beneﬁcial and boosted
ethane conversion, which surpassed 40% at 450 ◦C for the highest nickel loading catalyst, whereas ethene selectivity was retained at high
levels for all Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta signiﬁcantly modiﬁed both structural and catalytic properties in
ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The introduction of niobium was the most beneﬁcial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward
ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is a major building block of the petrochemical
industry and is used in the production of diverse products
ranging from solvents to plastics. Currently, ethylene is pro-
duced by steam cracking of various hydrocarbon feedstocks
(ethane, LPG, naphtha, gas oils), a process that operates un-
der severe conditions. In fact, the conversion of ethane to
ethylene via steam cracking is the most energy-consuming
step of the petrochemical industry, with energy requirements

estimated around 26 GJ/ton ethylene produced. With the
ethylene market growing at 2–3% per year [1] and fuel costs
constantly rising, research efforts have been focused on the
development of less energy-intensive processes for the pro-
duction of ethylene.
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is an at-
tractive alternative route for the production of ethylene. Its
major advantage, compared with the conventional method,
is its high energy efﬁciency, since the process operates at
low temperatures and involves an exothermic reaction, thus
has considerably lower energy requirements. However, for a
viable industrial application of this process, a highly active
and selective catalytic system, able to efﬁciently transform
ethane to ethylene and not to total oxidation products, COx,
is necessary. Several catalytic systems have been proposed

in the last decades as efﬁcient for the ethane ODH reac-
tion [2–9]. One of the best-performing catalysts has been
reported since 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [8] and consists of
a mixture of Mo–V–Nb oxides operating at low temperature
(< 400 ◦C) with relatively high efﬁciency. Ever since the
pioneering work of Thorsteinson, a great variety of mixed
metal oxides have been tested, with a great increase in re-
cent years in the number of tested materials, by applica-
tion of combinatorial methods [9]. Recently, Lopez Nieto
and co-workers have developed a very promising catalytic
formulation based on mixed Mo–V–Te–Nb oxides, exhibit-
ing about 75% ethylene yields at low reaction temperature
(350–400 ◦C). The enhanced catalytic activity of the pro-
posed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a mul-
tifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic
phase [10].
Nickel catalysts constitute an important class of catalytic
materials and are widely applied in many important reac-
tions, such as hydrogenation [11], natural gas reforming for
syngas production [12], dealkylation [13], etc. The good
performance of nickel-containing materials in oxidative de-
hydrogenation was ﬁrst reported by Schuurman et al. [14].
Alumina-supported nickel catalysts were tested in the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of ethane and exhibited very promising
results [15,16], and multicomponent nickel-based materi-
als for ethane ODH have recently been patented by Symyx
Technologies [17,18]. The promotion of nickel with several
metals has a great effect on the ability of the catalysts to both
activate the ethane feed and selectively convert it to ethene.
However, reports in literature dealing with the nature of the
active sites in such materials in correlation with their perfor-
mance in oxidative dehydrogenation are scarce.
In this study, we report the development of efﬁcient
Al2O3-supported Ni and promoted Ni–Me (Me = Mo, V,
Nb, Ta, Co) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane. The effect of nickel loading and the impact of the
promoters on the performance of the materials are discussed
in the light of a detailed characterization of the physico-
chemical properties of the catalysts by N2 adsorption, XRD,
XPS, TGA-H2, and UV-DRS. These complementary meth-
ods provided valuable insight into the nature of the surface
species on the supported catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by conventional wet impregna-
tion of the γ -Al2O3 support (Engelhard) with aqueous solu-
tions of nickel nitrate, Ni(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Fisher), except in
the case of the Ni–Ta catalyst, where an ethanol solution of
nickel acetate, Ni(C2H3O2)2 · 6H2O (Fisher), was used. The
promoted Al2O3-supported Ni–Me catalysts were prepared
by simultaneous impregnation, with the use of NH4VO3
(J.T. Baker), Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Merck), (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·
4H2O (Fisher), ammonium niobium oxalate (Aldrich), and
(CH3CH2O)5Ta (Aldrich) as precursor compounds for V,
Co, Mo, Nb, and Ta, respectively. The Me/Ni atomic ratio
was kept constant and equal to 0.176 in all samples. Mild
heating of the aqueous solutions ensured full dissolution of
the precursor salts. Before impregnation, the support was
crushed and sieved to a particle size of 106–180 µm. After
impregnation, the solvent was removed by evaporation under
reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was dried overnight
at 120 ◦C and calcined in synthetic air at 450 ◦C for 5 h. The
unpromoted catalysts are referred to as xNiAl, where x in-
dicates the weight percentage of Ni related to the weight of
the catalyst, and the promoted samples are referred to as Ni–
Me, where Me indicates the promoting metal (V, Co, Mo,
Nb, and Ta). The total metal weight loading of the catalysts
did not exceed 30 wt% in any sample.
Nickel aluminate (NiAl2O4), used as a reference com-
pound, was prepared as described in the literature [19] by co-
precipitation of a stoichiometric mixture of aluminum and
nickel nitrate with 1 M NH4OH solution to a ﬁnal pH of 8.
After ﬁltering, washing, and drying, the precipitate was cal-
cined in synthetic air at 900 ◦C for 11 h.
The NiO(II) reference compound was provided by Acros
Organics and used without further treatment.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Surface areas of the samples were determined by N2 ad-
sorption at 77 K, with the multipoint BET analysis method,
with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome ﬂow apparatus. Before
the measurements, the samples were dehydrated in vacuum
at 250 ◦C overnight.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a
Siemens D500 diffractometer employing Cu-Kα radiation.
The reduction characteristics of the catalysts were stud-
ied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-H2) on a Stanton-
Redcroft STA750 thermobalance. Typically, 20–30 mg of
the sample was loaded into an alumina crucible, and the
temperature was raised from room temperature to 1100 ◦C
at a heating rate of 20 ◦C/min, in a 10% H2/He ﬂow
(20 cm3/min). The system was maintained isothermally at
1100 ◦C for 15 min.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra (UV-DRS) were re-
corded in the 50,000–11,000 cm−1 range on a JASCO V-550
UV/vis spectrophotometer.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed with a Kratos AXIS HSi instrument e-
quipped with a charge neutralizer and a Mg-Kα X-ray
source. Spectra were recorded at normal emission, with
an analyzer pass energy of 20 eV and X-ray power of
225 W. Before spectral acquisition samples were outgassed
overnight in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer.
Each spectral region was signal-averaged for ∼20 scans to
obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Peak ﬁtting involved a
Shirley background subtraction and subsequent deconvolu-
tion with the use of mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions.

Fitting was performed with CASAXPS, Version 2.0.35, us-
ing the minimum number of peaks required to minimize the
R-factor. Binding energies were referenced to C 1s of ad-
ventitious carbon at 285 eV.
2.3. Reactivity studies
The catalytic performance of the samples was measured
in a ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor. The catalyst particles were di-
luted with an equal amount of quartz particles of the same
size to achieve isothermal operation. The temperature in the
middle of the catalytic bed was measured with a coaxial ther-
mocouple. The samples were activated in ﬂowing oxygen at
450 ◦C for 30 min. The composition of the reaction mixture
used was C2H6/O2/He = 7:7:63.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was investi-
gated in the temperature range from 300 to 500 ◦C. For the
determination of the activity of the catalysts as a function
of temperature, the weight of the sample was 0.7 g and the
total ﬂow was 77 cm3/min. To obtain different ethane con-
version levels at constant reaction temperature (400 ◦C), the
W/F ratio was varied from 0.02 to 1.33 g s/cm3. Com-
plementary experiments investigating the reactivity of the
catalysts toward the main product of interest, ethene, were
also conducted. For the ethene oxidation experiments, the
reaction conditions were kept identical to the ethane ODH
experiments (T = 300–500 ◦C, 0.7 g catalyst, total ﬂow
77 cm3/min, reaction mixture composition C2H4/O2/He =
7:7:63).
The reaction products were analyzed on-line with a
Perkin–Elmer gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector (TCD). Two columns in a series-by-
pass conﬁguration were used in the analysis: a Porapak Q
and a MS 5A. The main reaction products were C2H4, CO2,
CO, and H2O. Negligible amounts of oxygenates were ob-
served at the reactor exit. The ethane/ethene conversion and
the selectivity to the reaction products were calculated on a
carbon basis. Closure of the carbon mass balance was better
than ±1%.
The contribution of gas-phase initiated reactions was
tested with experiments using an empty-volume reactor. The
conversion of ethane/ethene at these experiments was lower

than 1%, conﬁrming that gas-phase reactions are negligible
at the experimental conditions used for the activity tests.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The composition and physico-chemical characteristics of
the prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. For the unpro-
moted catalysts, deposition of Ni on Al2O3 caused a grad-
ual decrease in the speciﬁc surface area expressed per gram
of catalyst, which drops from 184 m2/g for pure calcined
γ -Al2O3 to 137 m2/g for the highest loading 24NiAl cata-
lyst. However, the values of the surface area expressed per
gram of support remain virtually unchanged, indicating that
this apparent decrease is only a result of the fact that the
deposited nickel does not contribute to the surface area. Pro-
motion of the catalysts also did not cause signiﬁcant varia-
tions in the surface area, except in the case of the Ni–Nb and
Ni–Ta catalysts, where an increase was recorded. This latter
observation was in line with expectations, since the Nb and
Ta precursors have an organic nature and their decomposi-
tion during calcination should yield a more porous structure
than for the inorganic nitrate precursor salts.
Investigation of the crystalline phases present in the cat-
alysts was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The resulting diffractograms appear in Fig. 1. All samples
exhibited diffraction lines characteristic of the γ -Al2O3 sup-
port. For the 8NiAl catalyst, no Ni-containing phases were
detected, indicating a well-dispersed, amorphous nickel
structure on the surface of the support [20]. As the load-
ing increases to 15 wt% Ni, diffraction lines at 2θ 43.3◦,
162

63◦, 75.5◦, and 79.5◦originating from bulk NiO begin to
appear, becoming sharper and more intense in the 24NiAl
sample, indicating larger nickel oxide particles with high
crystallinity. Indeed, with the use of Scherrer’s formula, av-
erage NiO particle sizes of 8 and 15 nm were found for the
15NiAl and 24NiAl catalysts, respectively. Bulk NiAl2O4
was not detected by XRD, as shown by the diffractogram of
the pure phase that is included for comparison in Fig. 1.
The monolayer dispersion capacity of NiO on Al2O3 has
been reported to range from 13 to 20 wt% Ni loading, as
determined by ion scattering spectroscopy [21], XRD [22],
and XPS [23]. The appearance of crystalline NiO in the
15NiAl sample indicates saturation of the alumina surface
by two-dimensional Ni species and the genesis of multi-
layer/crystalline nickel phases.
The diffraction patterns of the promoted Ni–Me catalysts
are also illustrated in Fig. 1. Again, only diffraction lines
corresponding to crystalline NiO and Al2O3 were detected
on the catalysts, except in the case of Ni–Co, where a small
fraction of CoAl2O4 spinel phase was identiﬁed. Although
NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 spinels give similar diffraction pat-
terns, the lines at 2θ 59◦and 65◦in the diffractogram of the
Ni–Co catalyst can be clearly assigned to cobalt aluminate,
compared with the corresponding shifted lines of NiAl2O4
at 60◦and 66◦, respectively. However, the amount and size
of the NiO crystallites (see Table 1) formed vary for the dif-
ferent promoters, even though the weight percentage of Ni
loading remains essentially constant (with the exception of
Ni–Ta catalyst). It seems that the introduction of promot-
ing metals causes additional segregation of the nickel phase,
with the largest effect induced by niobium, with NiO crystals
of ∼26.5 nm.
Thermogravimetric analysis in the presence of a reduc-
tive atmosphere (TGA-H2) was used to assess the reduction
behavior of the prepared catalysts. The differential weight
loss versus temperature allows the extraction of the reduc-
tion curves presented in Figs. 2A and 2B. The reduction
proﬁles of the unsupported NiO and NiAl2O4 are also shown
(Fig. 2A). Pure NiO exhibits a sharp reduction peak at
370 ◦C, whereas NiAl2O4 is much harder to reduce, exhibit-
ing a broader peak with a maximum at 870 ◦C. For all un-
promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, a single broad reduction peak
in the 490–560 ◦C range was recorded, with the T max of
reduction shifting to lower temperature with increasing Ni
loading. These results conﬁrm the strong metal–support in-
teraction between nickel and alumina. The high temperature
peak of the lowest loading 8NiAl catalyst could be attributed
to surface nickel aluminate-like spinel species formed on the
surface of the catalyst. The decrease in the reduction tem-
perature maximum and the broad peaks recorded for the
15NiAl and 24NiAl catalysts are a result of contributions
from strongly interacting surface nickel aluminate species
and NiO crystallites (detected by XRD) accommodated on
top of the nickel/alumina interface.
Many authors have postulated the existence of a “surface
spinel” on the interface of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Lo Jacono et

al. [24] proposed that this “surface spinel” accommodates
nickel ions in octahedral and tetrahedral sites. According to
Wu and Hercules [21], tetrahedrally coordinated nickel ions
are hard to reduce, whereas octahedral nickel ions are read-
ily reduced species, with the Nitetr/Nioct ratio decreasing
with increasing loading. This rearrangement of nickel ions
in octahedral sites with increasing loading could explain the
shift in the temperature of reduction observed over the un-
promoted catalysts.
The introduction of the promoters induces signiﬁcant
changes in the reduction characteristics of the materials
(Fig. 2B). Incorporation of the early transition metals V and
Mo stimulates similar changes and shifts the temperature
maximum at 445 ◦C, while the reduction proﬁles become
narrower than in the case of the 24NiAl catalyst. The Ni–Co
catalyst is reduced at an even lower temperature range; how-

163
ever, the peak is rather broad, with a maximum at 370 ◦C and
shoulders at 300 and 490 ◦C. Cobalt, which is itself very re-
ducible, seems also to signiﬁcantly promote reduction of Ni
species at lower temperature. The TPR proﬁle of the Ni–Nb
catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima
at 335 and 510 ◦C. Experiments performed with the Nb2O5
reference showed that the pure oxide remains essentially
unreducible at temperatures up to 1100 ◦C, whereas studies
on Nb2O5/Al2O3 catalysts report no hydrogen consumption
for catalysts with loadings below 30 wt% Nb2O5 [25]. The
two peaks in the Ni–Nb reduction proﬁle are thus reasonably
ascribed to two different distinct Ni species on the cata-
lyst. Tantalum exhibits a reduction behavior similar to that
of niobium, since neither pure Ta2O5 nor Ta2O5/Al2O3 can
be reduced at the temperatures explored in this study [26].
Therefore, the single peak observed at 325 ◦C in the Ni–Ta
spectrum is assigned to easily reducible modiﬁed Ni species
on the surface of the catalyst.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectroscopy was used to
study the symmetry and coordination of the surface species
of the catalysts under study. The reﬂectance spectra of un-
supported NiO and pure NiAl2O4 phase, shown in Fig. 3,
are ﬁrst discussed. NiO has a rock salt structure with Ni ions
in an octahedral coordination. The NiO spectrum is domi-
nated by the NiO charge transfer band (CTB) at 19,600 cm−1
[27] and absorption bands in the 19,500–11,000 cm−1 range,
due to the d–d transitions of octahedral Ni(II) in the NiO
lattice. The band at 26,500 cm−1 and the strong band at
14,000 cm−1, ascribed to the 3A2g →3T1g(F) transition
of octahedral Ni(II), are ﬁngerprints for NiO [28]. The
NiAl2O4 spectrum differs signiﬁcantly from that of NiO;
absorption bands at 18,000, 16,700–15,600 (doublet), and
14,000 cm−1 represent the 3T1 →1T2, 3T1 →3T1(P)
and 3T1 →1E transitions of tetrahedral Ni(II) ions in the
Al2O3 lattice, and the band at 27,000 cm−1 is ascribed to
Fig. 3. Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra of the unpromoted Ni/Al2O3 cat-
alysts and NiO, NiAl2O4 reference compounds.
the 3A2g →3T1g(P) transition of octahedrally coordinated
Ni ions [29]. Therefore, nickel aluminate can be described as
a partial inverse spinel, which means that Ni(II) ions occupy
both octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the oxygen lattice.
The spectra acquired for the 8NiAl, 15NiAl, and 24NiAl
catalysts are presented together with the spectra of the ref-
erence compounds in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that
high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured
wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the
samples, indicating the presence of nickel in a nonstoichio-
metric form, which resulted in weak reﬂected bands. The
spectrum of the 24NiAl closely resembles that of NiO with
bands at 14,000 and 26,500 cm−1 indicating, in accordance
with the XRD results, that the surface is mostly covered by
NiO crystallites. The band at 14,000 cm−1, indicating the
presence of NiO crystals, is also present in the spectrum of
the 15NiAl catalyst. However, in the spectra of both 8 and
15NiAl samples, contributions from Ni ions with tetrahedral
coordination in the Al2O3 lattice are apparent from the band
at 16,000 cm−1. This conﬁrms the formation of a “surface
spinel” phase, as suggested by the TGA-H2 data, even at cal-
cination temperatures as low as 450 ◦C, and the migration of
Ni ions from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination with in-
creasing loading.
Because of the dark color and the high overall absorbance
of the promoted nickel catalysts, no additional useful in-
formation could be extracted. Their spectra exhibited only
strong NiO absorption bands, indicating the presence of
nickel oxide crystallites on the surface of the materials.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to pro-
vide information about the oxidation state and the chemical
environment of the elements present on the surface of the
catalysts. Table 2 lists the binding energies (BEs) corre-
sponding to the Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p1/2, and O 1s levels for all the
catalysts under study. Figs. 4 and 5 present the background
subtracted Ni 2p and O 1s XP spectra obtained for the three
unpromoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, together with those of pure
NiO and nickel aluminate used as standards, and for the pro-
moted catalysts, respectively. The values indicated in Table 2
and the included peaks shown in Figs. 4 and 5 arise from the
deconvolution of the overall experimental peaks, according
to the procedure described in the Section 2.
The Ni 2p spectrum of nickel oxide exhibits a clearly re-
solvable multiplet splitting of the 2p3/2 transition, with two
states present at BEs of 853.4 and 855.1 eV, and a shake-
up satellite at ∼860.5 eV, all characteristic of unsupported
NiO [30,31]. The origin of this double structure in the Ni
2p3/2 core-level photoemission spectra of NiO remains a
matter of controversy, and no unambiguous theoretical ex-
planation of this phenomenon has yet been offered. Reports
in the literature have correlated this extra high BE peak with
changes in the ionic charge and coordination induced by
nearby cation vacancies and thus indicate the presence of
Ni3+ ions [32–34]. However, the enhancement of this extra
peak upon sputtering of NiO single crystals [35], wherein
the surface becomes oxygen deﬁcient and the Ni valency is

thus expected to decrease, renders this interpretation doubt-
ful. Another interpretation offered by van Veenendaal and
Sawatzky [36] suggests that this second peak is the result of a
nonlocal screening mechanism, i.e., the result of a screening
process by an electron that does not come from the oxygen
atoms directly around the ionized Ni atom, but from neigh-
boring NiO6 units. If the double peak of the Ni 2p3/2 tran-
sition is explained by this non-local screening mechanism,
then the appearance and intensity of this high BE feature

lysts. (A) Ni 2p transition; (B) O 1s transition.
will clearly be dependent on the structure arrangement and
the nature and the valence of the surrounding atoms.
The O 1s spectrum for the NiO standard shows a main
peak at 529.3 eV with contributions from a peak located at
531 eV. These can be ascribed to Ni–O and Ni–OH bonds
[31], respectively, indicating substantial hydroxylation of the
oxidic surface (37% contribution to the total oxygen con-
tent). It should be mentioned that the high BE component of
the Ni 2p3/2 doublet cannot be assigned to Ni–OH species,
since in situ heating of the sample caused the disappearance

in accordance with data from the literature [37]. The envi-
ronment of nickel on the surface of the 8NiAl and 15NiAl
catalysts is characteristic of Ni2+ ions present as highly dis-
persed surface nickel aluminate species, as shown by the
binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 at 855.8 eV and the spin-orbit
splitting value of 17.5 eV, which coincides with that of the
NiAl2O4 standard but not with that of NiO, which is sig-
niﬁcantly larger (18.6 eV). As the nickel loading increases
to 24 wt%, the Ni 2p3/2 peak becomes asymmetric, with a
shoulder emerging at lower BE, concomitant with a decrease
in the spin-orbit splitting. Best ﬁtting is achieved with two
peaks with maxima at 855.9 and 854 eV, indicating the pres-
ence of both nickel aluminate and NiO-like species on the
surface. If we assume, based on our data, that monolayer sat-
uration is achieved at ∼15 wt% Ni content, then the total Ni
coverage on 24NiAl equals ∼1.6 ML. The relative contribu-
tions of the deconvoluted NiAl2O4 and NiO species (67 and
33%, respectively) support the notion that all of the surface
nickel is strongly bound to the alumina support until com-
pletion of the monolayer. Above this threshold coverage, the
excess nickel forms NiO particles atop the nickel–alumina
interface. The BE of this surface nickel oxide species is up-
shifted compared with the reference bulk oxide, indicating
either chemically modiﬁed NiO particles due to interaction
with the alumina support or the nickel/alumina interface or
reduced core-hole screening in the dispersed oxide thin ﬁlm.
This former observation nicely explains the absence of a
low-temperature reduction peak, characteristic of bulk NiO,
in the TPR pattern of 24NiAl, even though NiO was de-
tected by XRD on the surface of the catalyst. It has been
postulated that dispersed NiO loses its bulk electronic char-
acteristics because of spin delocalization of 3d electrons
toward the support, but retains the bulk crystallography, as
indicated by XRD [38]. Concerning the O 1s XP spectra, no
additional information can be extracted, since for the unpro-
moted alumina-supported nickel samples the major oxygen
contribution is from the alumina itself, with a binding energy
of 531.2 eV.
The introduction of metal promoters modiﬁes the nickel
environment at the alumina surface, as indicated by changes
in Ni 2p3/2 and O 1s XP spectra presented in Figs. 5A and
5B, respectively. In the case of the Ni–Mo catalyst, the Ni
2p spectrum resembles that of the NiAl2O4 reference, con-
sistent with a strong interaction between the surface nickel
and the alumina support. There was no evidence for a nickel
oxide component in the outermost surface of the catalyst,
despite the observation of NiO crystallites by XRD for this
Ni–Mo system. Together these suggest that such NiO parti-
cles may be encapsulated within a shell of nonstoichiometric
nickel aluminate phase, rendering the oxide XPS invisible.
The formation of a surface nickel molybdate, and thus the
existence of strong interaction between Ni and Mo, can be
excluded, since the spin-orbit splitting of NiMoO4 has been
reported as 18.6 eV [39], signiﬁcantly higher than that mea-
sured for our catalyst (17.8 eV). Molybdenum is present on
the surface as Mo6+, as indicated by the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo
3d3/2 peak positions at 232.7 and 235.8 eV (not shown). The
slight shift to lower BE (0.5 eV) and accompanying Mo 3d
peak broadening relative to that of a measured MoO3 refer-
ence (FWHM = 2 eV for Ni–Mo versus 1.3 eV for MoO3)
may reﬂect the inﬂuence of the underlying alumina sup-
port [40].
The nickel surface environment is strongly perturbed by
the presence of vanadium. The Ni 2p3/2 spectrum exhibits
the doublet structure typical of the oxide, with peaks at 855.4
and 853.5 eV BE. Vanadium appears to hinder the strong in-
teraction between nickel and alumina seen for the 24NiAl
and Mo-promoted samples, thus favoring enhanced nickel
oxide formation. The peak at 855.4 eV is at slightly higher
BE than that of bulk NiO and may contain contributions
from NiAl2O4-like species still present on the surface, or
reﬂect particle-size effects and non-local screening mecha-
nisms as discussed previously. The enhanced NiO formation
is also conﬁrmed by the O 1s XP spectrum, which can be
deconvoluted into two states, attributed to Ni–O and Al–O
bonds at 529.4 and 531 eV, respectively. The V 2p3/2 tran-
sition occurs at 516.7 eV, and comparison with values for
reference V5+ compounds (517.2–517.6 eV) [41] suggests
that vanadium in the Ni–V catalyst is stabilized in a partially
reduced V4+ state [42].
Tantalum incorporation led to similar changes in the
shapes of Ni 2p and O 1s spectra, suggesting a similar weak-
ening of the nickel–alumina interaction, resulting in (albeit
less pronounced) NiO formation. Tantalum, in turn, appears
to exist in its surface oxidic form as Ta5+ species, indicated
by a characteristic Ta 3d doublet at 231 and 242.4 eV [43].

There was no evidence for nickel aluminate-like species
in the XPS spectra of the Ni–Nb and Ni–Co catalysts, with
the Ni 2p and O 1s lineshapes and BE identical to those of
pure bulk NiO. It seems that in the presence of these two pro-
moters, the interaction between nickel and alumina is much
weaker than for all the other samples. There was also no evi-
dence for any interaction between nickel and either niobium
or cobalt. The Nb 3d spectrum contained a doublet at BEs
of 207.5 eV (3d5/2) and 210.3 eV, indicative of Nb5+ in the
oxidic form [44]. Cobalt, on the other hand, appears to be
stabilized on the surface as Co2+, with Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2
peaks at 780.2 and 795.6 eV. Although Co2+ and Co3+ give
very similar Co 2p XP features, Co2+ high-spin compounds
are characterized by an intense shake-up satellite structure
at ca. 786 and 803 eV, which is weak or missing in the
low-spin Co3+ compounds [45]. This satellite structure was
indeed present in the Co 2p spectrum of Ni–Co at 785.7 and
802.4 eV, allowing the unequivocal assignment of the Co +2
oxidation state on the catalyst surface.
The contribution of the ∼855 eV peak in the nickel spec-
trum, which may arise from screening electrons from neigh-
boring NiOx units, is lower in Ni–Nb and higher in Ni–Co
compared with the reference NiO (see Table 3). As men-
tioned above, the appearance and intensity of this high BE
satellite depend strongly on the local structure around Ni
surface atoms. Although XPS only identiﬁed the presence
of NiO on the Ni–Nb catalyst, the corresponding reduction
proﬁle suggests the presence of two kinds of reducible nickel
species. Based on the temperature of these two reduction
processes, they may be attributed to Ni–O–Ni and Ni–O–
Nb bonds, although it is not possible to discount the role of
particle size effects and defects within a pure NiO surface
phase arising indirectly from the coadsorbed Nb.
In addition to the nature and oxidation state of supported
metal species, XPS also offers valuable information regard-
ing the surface composition of these bimetallic catalysts. The
values of the nominal and surface (determined by XPS us-
ing the appropriate sensitivity correction factors) Ni/Al and
Me/Ni (where Me = V, Co, Mo, Nb, and Ta) atomic ratios
are listed in Table 3, with the use of the appropriate sen-
sitivity correction factors. The surface Ni/Al atomic ratios
are generally higher than the corresponding nominal ones,

indicating a nickel-enriched surface. This is not surprising,
given that the materials were prepared by impregnation of
the alumina support, wherein the active Ni phase is dis-
persed across the surface. In the series of the unpromoted
Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, increasing the total Ni loading gave a
nonlinear rise in the surface Ni content, with a more pro-
nounced increase for the highest loading 24NiAl catalyst.
This observation is consistent with the previous characteri-
zation results, which show that Ni loadings greater than 15
wt% saturate the alumina monolayer, inducing a switchover
from NiAl2O4 growth (exposing signiﬁcant surface Al) to a
crystalline NiO capping overlayer. This attenuates the under-
lying NiAl2O4 interface and alumina support, signiﬁcantly
increasing the Ni/Al surface ratio.
The surface Ni content of the Me-promoted nickel cata-
lysts provides interesting comparisons. Note that the nom-
inal Ni/Al ratios were very similar for the 24NiAl cata-
lyst and all of the promoted samples, with the exception
of the Ni–Ta catalyst. However, the surface Ni/Al atomic
ratio exhibits large variance between samples. In general,
the presence of the promoting metals results in a signiﬁ-
cant enrichment of the surface nickel in comparison with the
unpromoted 24NiAl catalyst (from ∼2 to 6 times higher).
Ni–Mo was the only exception, in which the surface was
impoverished in nickel and enriched in Mo, as shown by
the high Mo/Ni surface ratio compared with the nominal
one. This ﬁnding coincides with the previous conclusion that
over this Ni–Mo catalyst, NiO particles are encapsulated
within a nickel aluminate shell, reducing the total exposed
nickel, whereas molybdate species seem to segregate to the
topmost surface layers, possibly coating some of the nickel
sites. Vanadium also surface segregates, as indicated by the
higher surface versus total V/Ni ratio. These experimen-
tal observations coincide with thermodynamic arguments,
which demonstrate that surface for most multicomponent
systems becomes enriched in the constituent possessing the
lowest surface energy. The surface energies of MoO3 and
V2O5 are reported to be very low (6 and 9 × 10−6 J/cm2,
respectively) [46]. Although no direct experimental data for
NiO are available in the literature, theoretical calculations
show that the NiO surface free energy is similar to that of
MgO [47], which has been experimentally determined to be
110 × 10−6 J/cm2 [46]. The surface energies of MoO3 and
V2O5 are clearly more than an order of magnitude lower
than that predicted for NiO, and thus the Mo and V surface
segregation observed over the Ni–Mo and Ni–V catalysts is
in line with predictions.
Co, Nb, and Ta metal promoters are less exposed, as re-
ﬂected by the lower surface Me/Ni ratios, each showing
strong surface enrichment by nickel, with the Ni–Nb catalyst
exposing the most surface nickel. These interesting results
indicate that these particular promoters improve dispersion
of the nickel phase, possibly via their intercalation between
nickel (oxide) phase and alumina, thus weakening the in-
ﬂuence of the underlying support, in accordance with the
previous observations, with NiO particles accommodated on

the promoting metal/alumina interface. One may also infer
that the surface energies of CoO, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 are
higher than that of NiO, this providing the thermodynamic
driving force for the formation of a nickel oxide capping
layer. Unfortunately, there are few reports of experimental
surface energies for oxides, and this hypothesis awaits fu-
ture veriﬁcation.
3.2. Catalytic performance in ethane ODH reaction and
ethene oxidation
The activities of the unpromoted and Me-promoted
Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were explored under steady-state con-
ditions between 300 and 500 ◦C, with a constant W/F
(0.54 g s/cm3) and ethane/oxygen (1:1) ratio. Ethane con-
version is plotted as a function of temperature in Figs. 6A
and 6B. In the series of the unpromoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts
(Fig. 6A), increasing Ni loading improved the reactivity.
A 50% initial “jump” in conversion occurred when the Ni
loading was increased from 8 to 15 wt%, and a further 10%
enhancement in activity was found for the 24NiAl catalyst.

This nonlinear increase of conversion with loading can be
attributed to the presence of large NiO crystals on the sur-
face of 24NiAl, as indicated by the characterization results,
for which a signiﬁcant fraction of the Ni was inaccessible to
reactants. However, the formation of crystalline NiO phase
did not impair the reaction, since no decline in the conver-
sion was observed, and certainly helps to generate active
sites.
The promoted Me–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 6B) pre-
sented a large variation in the catalytic behavior, depending
on the promoting metal, with conversions ranging from 1
to 33% at 400 ◦C (see Table 4) compared with 18% exhib-
ited by the unpromoted 24NiAl catalyst. The activities of the
samples under study decreased in the following order:
Ni–Co > Ni–Nb > 24NiAl > 15NiAl > Ni–Ta
> 8NiAl = Ni–V ≫Ni–Mo.
Comparison of the catalysts in terms of speciﬁc surface ac-
tivity (molC2H6/(m2 s)) does not change the above sequence.
Besides activity, selectivity to the corresponding alkene is
also of paramount importance for the evaluation of ODH cat-
alysts. Since selectivity is strongly related to conversion, we
conducted a second series of experiments at constant temper-
ature (400 ◦C), constant ethane/oxygen ratio (1:1), and vary-
ing W/F from 0.02 to 1.33 g s/cm3 in order to attain differ-
ent conversion levels. Typical product distributions recorded
at 15% ethane conversion over the catalysts are tabulated
in Table 4. Ethylene selectivity versus ethane conversion is
presented in Figs. 7A and 7B. The unpromoted catalysts ex-
hibited high selectivity (80–90%) in the 0–20% conversion
range and showed only a slight drop in selectivity for eth-
ylene with increasing conversion due to secondary reactions
of the oleﬁn product. A more pronounced decrease was seen
for the 8NiAl catalyst, which initially appeared more selec-
tive, but ﬁnally reached the same limiting selectivity as the
24NiAl for 15% ethane conversion.
The introduction of metal promoters to the Ni–Al system
had a great impact on the catalytic performance of the re-
sulting materials in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Com-
pared to the 24NiAl catalyst, the incorporation of Co and V
induced a major drop in ethylene selectivity to ∼50–55%.
However, the trend of selectivity versus conversion was dif-
ferent for the two samples, indicating that Ni–Co mainly

promotes the primary oxidation of ethane to CO2, whereas
over Ni–V both primary and secondary routes of oxidation
of ethane and ethylene are enhanced. A similar decrease in
selectivity with conversion was also observed for the Ni–Mo
catalyst, showing that as in the case of V, early transition
metals favor the overoxidation of ethylene. This is also ob-
vious from the product distributions over Ni–V and Ni–Mo
catalysts, wherein CO was formed, whereas C2H4 and CO2
were the only carbon-containing reaction products over all of
the other samples. Carbon monoxide principally originates
from the secondary oxidation of ethene, as demonstrated by
our recent studies on MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts [48]. Ni–Mo,
on the other hand, does not seem to favor primary ethane
oxidation, since it had a very high initial selectivity (90%).
Ni–Nb caused a 10% decrease in ethene selectivity (com-
pared with the 24NiAl catalyst), which, however, remained
constant with conversion (i.e., there were no secondary reac-
tions). Finally, Ni–Ta proved to be the most effective catalyst
in terms of selectivity, being the only catalyst that exhibited
a higher selectivity than the 24NiAl sample, which was rel-
atively independent of conversion.
The high ethene selectivities recorded in general over the
materials under study imply a low extent of secondary ethene

oxidation reactions. To study the reactivity of our catalysts
toward the oleﬁn product in more detail, complementary
experiments were conducted to examine ethene oxidation
between 300 and 500 ◦C. Ethene conversion as a function
of temperature is illustrated in Fig. 8. The main product of
C2H4 oxidation was CO2, with selectivity for CO ranging
under 5%, with the exception of Ni–V and Ni–Mo catalysts,
where an average selectivity for CO of 15 and 40%, respec-
tively, was recorded. The relative reactivity of the promoted
catalysts toward ethene decreased in the sequence Ni–Co >
Ni–V > Ni–Nb > 24NiAl > 15NiAl > Ni–Ta > 8NiAl >
Ni–Mo. However, if we compare the ratio of ethylene to
ethane consumption rate under identical reaction conditions
(reaction temperature, W/F , reaction mixture composition),
the sequence changes to the following: Ni–Mo (2.79) >
Ni–V (1.95) > Ni–Co (0.95) > 8NiAl (0.74) > 15NiAl
(0.58) > 24NiAl (0.55) > Ni–Nb (0.47) > Ni–Ta (0.45).
Only Mo- and V-promoted nickel catalysts exhibit a
higher afﬁnity toward ethylene than toward ethane. This
clearly presents a serious drawback in the use of these con-
ventional transition metals for light alkane oxidative dehy-
drogenation, since V and Mo activate ethylene almost twice
as efﬁciently as they do ethane [48]. This also appears to be
the case for Ni–Mo and Ni–V catalysts, consistent with their
characterization, which reveals the preferential exposure of
Mo and V on the surface at the expense of nickel, and the
ethane ODH reaction experiments, which show a high ex-
tent of secondary reactions on the aforementioned catalysts.
Ni–Co is equally reactive toward ethane and ethylene; how-
ever, the absence of secondary reactions in ethane ODH, as
shown in Fig. 7B, indicates that in the presence of a mix-
ture of alkane and alkene, ethane is preferentially activated.
However, it should also be borne in mind that under our
working conditions, the partial pressure of ethane in the re-
action mixture was much higher than that of ethene, and this
may explain this preferential ethane activation. Over all of
the other catalysts, reactivity to C2H4 is lower, with the Ni–

Nb and Ni–Ta catalysts exhibiting the greatest preference for
ethane over ethene activation.
As shown above, the promotion of NiAl catalysts with
different metals caused signiﬁcant changes in the catalytic
performance for ethane ODH, with some metals increasing
activity but decreasing selectivity for the desired product,
etc. To get a clearer picture, ethylene production rates at
400 ◦C are presented in Fig. 9 for all the samples. It is now
apparent that the optimum performance in ethane oxidative
dehydrogenation occurs for Ni–Nb, which exhibits the high-
est rate of ethene production. This is due to the fact that
Nb addition caused a great increase in reactivity (over 50%
higher conversion) at the expense of a relatively small drop
in ethene selectivity. Unfortunately, no direct correlation of
the performance of the Ni–Nb catalyst can be made with the
data in Symyx patents [17,18]. Compared with NiO/Al2O3
catalysts reported in the literature [15,16], our Ni–Nb cata-
lyst exhibits a much improved performance, with over 25%
higher ethene productivity.
4. Discussion
The preceding results demonstrate the promise of alu-
mina-supported Ni-based catalysts for the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of ethane. Nickel, a low-cost metal, appears
to be effective in the activation and selective conversion
of ethane to ethylene at temperatures below 450 ◦C, offer-
ing ethylene yields much higher than conventional transition
metal catalysts used for this reaction. Moreover, the produc-
tion principally of CO2 and not CO as the major by-product
makes Ni catalysts very attractive from an engineering point
of view, since the separation costs downstream from the re-
actor would be greatly reduced in a potential industrial ap-
plication of such a process.
The characterization results showed that nickel interacts
strongly with alumina, forming a non-stoichiometric surface
nickel aluminate phase. At loading higher than 15 wt% Ni,
the alumina surface becomes saturated by a two-dimensional
NiAl2O4-like ﬁlm, and capping islands of NiO particles with
increasing size begin to form atop the nickel/alumina inter-
face, as detected by XRD and XPS. In terms of catalytic
performance, increasing the Ni loading was beneﬁcial and
boosted ethane conversion as a consequence of a rise in the
number of active metal-oxide sites, whereas ethylene selec-
tivity levels remained at high levels (∼90%), even though
larger three-dimensional NiO particles were formed on the
catalyst surface. This indicates that both nickel aluminate-
like species and NiO particles are active and selective. At
this point, it should be mentioned that unsupported NiO was
also tested in the reaction and exhibited a similar activity per
mole of nickel with the 24NiAl catalyst. However, the selec-
tivity for ethylene was very low, with 90% CO2 production
even at low conversion levels. This indicates that free NiO,
though active, is unselective, whereas NiO crystallites dis-
persed on alumina have modiﬁed electronic properties, ren-
dering them capable of selectively activating ethane to eth-
ylene but not to CO2. Even though NiO particles on alumina
maintain their crystallographic identity (detected by XRD),
the XPS results indicate electronic differences and chemical
modiﬁcation of these NiO particles, indicated by perturbed
Ni 2p peak positions for NiO crystallites on 24NiAl com-
pared with that of bulk NiO.
The introduction of promoters (Mo, V, Co, Nb, Ta) in the
Ni/Al system induced signiﬁcant changes in both ethane ac-
tivity and selectivity for ethene. The most important feature
from a structural perspective was the signiﬁcant nickel sur-
face enrichment, evidenced by XPS, following addition of
the second metal. The only exception to this occurred for
molybdenum incorporation, wherein Mo preferentially seg-
regates above the nickel/alumina interface, thereby blocking
nickel sites. For the rest of the promoting metals, the pro-
moters are accommodated between the alumina support and
nickel phase. This reduces the strong metal–support interac-
tion, inhibiting the incorporation of nickel into the alumina
lattice, and results in a larger number of exposed Ni reaction
sites.
The most positive effect in the performance of nickel cat-
alysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation was realized by
niobium. The addition of niobium mainly inﬂuenced the ac-
tivation step of the reaction, resulting in an increase in ethane
conversion of over 50%, while maintaining a high selectivity
for ethene (selectivity fell by only 10% compared with the
unpromoted 24NiAl catalyst). Niobium oxide has been re-
ported to enhance metal oxide catalysis in the production of
oleﬁns from light alkanes in numerous systems [8,49–53],
such as mixed Mo–V–Nb or Mo–V–Te–Nb oxides. It has
been postulated that Nb acts as both a structural and elec-
tron transfer promoter, enhancing the alkane activation by
facilitating the redox cycle of the active metal [53]. If we
assume that ethane ODH over Ni-based catalysts proceeds
through the classical Mars and van Krevelen redox mecha-
nism occurring over transition metals, then the ease of ethane
activation could be related to the ease of the Ni2+/Ni0 tran-
sition, facilitated by the presence of Nb acting as an elec-
170

tron transfer promoter. The XPS results show that niobium
causes a considerable nickel surface enrichment, and the Ni
2p3/2 BE suggests that Nb weakens the strong interaction
between nickel and alumina, with nickel existing in almost
pure NiO-like form on the surface of the catalyst. The re-
ducibility studies add additional evidence for a close Ni–Nb
interaction, with two reduction processes attributable to Ni–
O–Ni and Ni–O–Nb environments. Thus the enhanced ac-
tivity of the Ni–Nb catalyst in ethane ODH may be related
to a highly dispersed pure NiO phase and/or a more facile
electron transfer process facilitated by niobium.
5. Conclusions
This study demonstrates that Ni-based alumina-supported
catalysts are attractive candidates for the oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane to ethylene, since they exhibit high ethane
reactivity at low temperature (< 450 ◦C), low afﬁnity to eth-
ylene oxidation, and very high selectivity for the desired
product.
Nickel interacts strongly with alumina, forming surface
nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime,
while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina
interface for multilayer coverages. XPS reveals a chemical
modiﬁcation of the NiO particles on alumina, which possess
a bulk-like crystallography but exhibit modiﬁed electronic
properties that render them selective in ethane ODH; in con-
trast, unsupported NiO is unselective toward ethene.
Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta signiﬁcantly
modiﬁes both structural and catalytic properties in ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation. Promoters were generally inter-
calated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong
nickel–alumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorpora-
tion into the alumina lattice. This enriches the catalyst sur-
face with nickel oxide compared with the undoped catalysts.
The introduction of niobium was the most beneﬁcial for
ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by
more than 50% while maintaining the high ethene selectiv-
ity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of
the nickel phase, niobium facilitates the C–H bond activation
by acting as an electron transfer promoter.
