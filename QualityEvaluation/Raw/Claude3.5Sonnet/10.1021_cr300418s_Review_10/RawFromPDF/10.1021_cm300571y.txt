Abstract
Incorporation of palladium within the perovskite-type lattice is a valuable strategy to prevent sintering phenomena that reduce the performance of automotive catalysts. However, occupation of B-site coordination sites by Pd can strongly depend on the nature of the perovskite-type oxide and care must be taken for structural interpretation. Pd-based La(B,Pd)O3±δ (B = Mn, Fe, Co) perovskite-type oxides and Y(Fe,Pd)O3±δ have been prepared by the amorphous citrate method by introducing the Pd salt to the precursors solution with the aim to substitute the B-site. The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen. Pd incorporation was achieved for La(Fe,Pd)O3±δ and La(Co,Pd)O3±δ that showed the XANES white line of Pd in octahedral coordination. On the contrary, La(Mn,Pd)O3±δ showed XANES features and reduction behavior typical of segregated PdO particles. The state of Pd in Y(Fe,Pd)O3±δ appeared to be dependent on the calcination temperature. Calcination at 700 °C produced cationic palladium with strong interaction with the YFeO3 structure but likely in a different coordination environment than in LaFeO3. Calcination at 800 °C provided improved crystallinity and forced Pd to form a PdO phase. The markedly different states of Pd are interpreted on the base of ionic radii arguments. The smaller size of Mn cations does not favor occupation of octahedral sites by the larger Pd3+. The observed states adopted by Pd strongly influenced methane oxidation activity. The highest catalytic activity was found for the samples where palladium was predominantly dispersed as supported PdO particles. Lowest catalytic activity was measured for samples containing octahedral Pd, thus confirming that Pd incorporation in the perovskite-type lattice may not be favorable for methane oxidation.

Synopsis
Depending on the formulation of typical perovskite-type oxide oxidation catalysts Pd can be found in the form of supported PdO particles or incorporated in the octahedral B-sites. The different oxidation and coordination states of Pd strongly influence the oxidation performance of the catalysts.
1 Introduction
The A- and B-site cations of perovskite-type oxides of general formula ABO3 can be partly substituted to generate a vast range of functional materials whose properties can be tailored according to the application, including fuel cell cathodes and anodes, (1) catalysts, (2, 3) photocatalysts, (4, 5) and thermoelectric materials. (6) Perovskite-type oxides have been reported since the 1970s as oxidation catalysts and represent a valid alternative to automotive emission control catalysts based on precious metals. The interest for perovskite-type oxides in the field has been renewed by the observation that some formulations (7, 8) enable precious metal atoms to reversibly segregate out of and reintegrate into the perovskite lattice under reductive and oxidative atmosphere, respectively. This “self-regenerating property” is capable of limiting precious metal particle sintering under periodic redox fluctuations of the feedstock, like in the case of catalysts used for exhaust after treatment of stoichiometric engines. Similarly, it was earlier realized that perovskite-type oxides could be used as precursors of supported metal catalysts by exploitation of the segregation of metallic particles upon reduction. (2, 9, 10)
Various works report on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties of perovskite-type oxides with substitution of the B-site cation by Pd. In their pioneering work, the group at Daihatsu (7, 11) prepared La(Fe,Co,Pd)O3 and La(Fe,Pd)O3 by the alkoxide method and studied the origin of their three-way catalytic activity using mainly X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxidation and coordination states of Pd were analyzed after reduction and reoxidation of catalysts in a wide temperature range. The shift of the Pd K-edge energy justified the interpretation that reduction and successive reoxidation at constant temperature induce reversible structural changes related to the periodic segregation and reincorporation of Pd out of and into the perovskite-type structure. XPS confirmed that the oxidation state of Pd changes reversibly between Pd0 and the unusually high oxidation state Pd3+, corresponding to palladium in solid solution with the perovskite lattice. (11) Such a high valence state of palladium is considered crucial for low temperature catalysis. (12) A useful scale for the formation of Pd-, Pt-, and Rh-perovskite solid solutions was provided for various perovskite-type oxides, including LaAlO3, BaZrO3, CaTiO3, BaTiO3, SrTiO3, and SrZrO3. (8)
In addition to the shift of the Pd K-edge energy compared to Pd2+ in PdO, a doublet at the white line was considered the fingerprint of cationic palladium in the distorted octahedral coordination of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3±δ prepared by the amorphous citrate method. (13, 14) XAS and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were used to demonstrate that Pd in flame made 0.5 wt % Pd-LaCoO3±δ had been incorporated within LaCoO3. However, the Pd white line significantly differed from that of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3±δ. (13) La(Fe,Pd)O3±δ prepared by ultrasonic spray combustion (USC) evidenced the formation of the Pd-LaFeO3 solid solution that was confirmed by the same XANES fingerprint. (15) On the contrary, La(Mn,Pd)O3 prepared by a wet chemistry route did not exhibit the same white line shape but rather that of PdO in supported Pd catalysts. The dual site Pd-LaMnO3 catalyst prepared by the solution combustion method has the property to activate incorporated palladium by its reduction and segregation out of the LaMnO3 lattice upon treatment at temperatures above the threshold temperature of PdOx decomposition. (16) XPS showed that Pd is present predominantly as Pd2+; however, a fraction of Pd4+ strongly interacting with the perovskite structure was also observed. Similarly, platinum group metals in La(Mn,PGM)O3 (PGM = Pd, Pt, Rh) have shown strong interaction with the perovskite structure by H2-TPR and O2-TPD. (17) Pd in SrFeOx exhibited a stronger white line feature than that of PdO, therefore underlying the strong degree of interaction responsible for the improved exhaust emission control properties. (18)
The state of Pd was thoroughly characterized in the case of two formulations. Pd2+ in the BaCe1–xPdxO3 exhibits an oxygen-deficient square-planar coordination not reported before for Pd in a perovskite-type structure. (12) XANES data showed an anomalous white line shape at the Pd K-edge, with respect to that of dispersed PdO catalysts and of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 and in this sense representing novel surface truncated square pyramidal PdO5 species characterized by unusual coordination geometry of the palladium site adjacent to an oxygen vacancy. The material demonstrated high CO oxidation activity that was attributed to the presence of this species. (19) Since the missing surface oxygen coordination site in this structure can be reversibly replenished by gas phase oxygen under oxygen rich conditions, the “ingress and egress” mechanism resembles that proposed by DFT simulation considering that the self-regenerative function originates from oxygen mobility rather than from the mobility of Pd. (20) Further, YFe1–xPdxO3−δ tested for CO oxidation exhibits the same self-regenerative property of perovskite-type oxides. (21) In this case, Pd2+ occupies the Fe sites in 5-fold coordination and contributes to the stabilization of the hexagonal structure.
These studies demonstrate that Pd can in principle adapt to the crystal structure of the host lattice and therefore adopt various coordination environments. We shall show here that this might depend on the nature of the host structure in the case of lanthanum-based perovskite-type oxide oxidation catalysts containing Mn, Fe, or Co. (22) In this work we investigate the substitution of Pd at the B-site of perovskite-type LaBO3 (B = Mn, Fe, Co) and of the perovskite-related YFeO3 using a range of characterization techniques aiming at identifying the state of the catalytically active Pd phase as a function of the nature of the B-site cation and of the bulk structure. Methane oxidation is used to probe the catalytic properties of the oxidation state and coordination environment of Pd in these samples.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
Pd-containing perovskite-type catalysts of the formula LaB0.95Pd0.05O3±δ (B = Mn, Fe, Co) and hexagonal YFe0.95Pd0.05O3 were prepared by the amorphous citrate method. (23) Aqueous solutions of the metal nitrates (La(NO3)3·6H2O (puriss. > 99%, Fluka), Fe(NO3)3·xH2O (x = 7.5, estimated by TGA; 98+% A.C.S., Sigma-Aldrich), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>97%, Merck), Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar), Y(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), and Pd(NO3)2·2H2O (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed with an aqueous solution of citric acid (assay 99.5–100.5%, Riedel-de Haën) in a 1:1 molar ratio with respect to the sum of metal salts. The solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator (60 °C, 60 mbar) until a viscous product was obtained, which was then dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h (80 °C, 60–80 mbar). The obtained dry foam was crushed and calcined at 700 °C for 2 h in flowing synthetic air (99.995 vol %) at atmospheric pressure. The Y-containing sample was additionally calcined at 750 and 800 °C. The samples are denoted as La(Mn,Pd)O3, La(Fe,Pd)O3, La(Co,Pd)O3, Y(Fe,Pd)O3, Y(Fe,Pd)O3-750, and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800. LaMnO3, LaFeO3, LaCoO3, YFeO3, and YFeO3-800 were prepared by the same synthesis route. A commercial 2 wt % Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (kindly provided by Umicore; surface area, 135 m2/g; Pd dispersion, 20%) was used as a reference sample for XPS and XAS measurements.
2.2 Characterization
The palladium loading of the catalysts was determined by ICP-OES. (13) The specific surface area (SSA) was determined with a Quantachrome CHEMBET 3000 instrument. Prior to the measurements, catalysts were pretreated in a nitrogen flow (25 mL/min) for 30 min at 200 °C to remove moisture and physisorbed species. The specific surface area was then determined from nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C using 30 vol % N2/He and applying the single-point differential BET method. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed with the same Quantachrome CHEMBET 3000 instrument. Prior to TPR, all samples were calcined at 500 °C for 30 min in synthetic air (60 mL/min), cooled to room temperature, and flushed with nitrogen for 30 min at 200 °C to remove physisorbed oxygen. A quartz glass reactor was loaded with 100 mg sample powder, and a K-Type thermo couple was inserted into the middle of the catalyst bed. H2-TPR experiments in 5 vol % H2/N2 (25 mL/min) were performed in the temperature range −25 to 900 °C. The crystal structure and phase composition of the catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction using an X’Pert Pro diffractometer (PANalytical) and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
Atomic concentrations and valence states of the surface elements were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Spectra were recorded with a Physical Electronics (PHI) Quantum 2000 photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα radiation and a hemispherical capacitor electron-energy analyzer equipped with a channel plate and a position sensitive detector operating in the constant pass energy mode. Quantitative analysis was performed using Spectral Data Processor V4.3 and PHI MultiPak V6.1A. The C 1s signal position at the binding energy (BE) of 284.8 eV was used as an internal standard for calibration of the XP-signal positions.
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed ex situ on sample pellets at the Pd K-edge (24.35 keV) in the transmission mode (monochromatic radiation, Si(311) double crystal) at beamline X1 at Hasylab (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). In situ XANES spectra were collected at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villigen, Switzerland) in fluorescence mode using a germanium 13-element detector equipped with a Ni slit. The sample (50–70 mg, sieve fraction 0.1–0.15 mm) was firmly fixed between quartz wool plugs in quartz capillaries (di = 2.8 mm, 0.1 mm wall thickness, Hilgenberg). (24, 25) The capillaries were mounted in a sample holder with gas supply and sealed with Teflon fittings. Temperature programmed reduction was performed in the 25–600 °C temperature range in 5 vol % H2/He (45 mL/min). All data processing, analysis, and plotting were carried out using IFEFFIT 1.2.11c. (26) The spectra were background-corrected and normalized by subtracting a linear fit and by dividing the post-edge region by a third-degree polynomial fit. The radial distribution function was obtained from Fourier transforming k3-weighted χ(k) data in the range of 1.5–12.8 Å–1 using a Bessel window function.
2.3 Catalytic Oxidation of Methane
Catalytic activity measurements for the oxidation of methane were carried out in a quartz glass reactor (di = 6 mm) that was placed inside a vertical electrically heated tubular furnace. The reactor was loaded with 100 mg of catalyst (sieved fraction, 0.15–0.2 mm) that was mixed in the mass ratio 1:4 with sea sand (p.a., cleaned and calcined at 1000 °C, Roth GmbH) and firmly fixed between quartz wool plugs (bed length, 15 mm). The temperature was measured on top of the catalyst bed using a K-type thermocouple. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was activated in 20 vol % O2/He (50 mL/min) at 500 °C for 2 h. After cooling to 200 °C the gas flow was changed to the reaction mixture (1 vol % CH4/4.4 vol % O2, balance He, 130 mL/min; GHSV = 18 400 h–1). Methane oxidation was carried out in the 200–900 °C temperature range at a rate of 5 °C/min. The cooling rate strongly deviated from 5 °C/min below 600 °C; nevertheless, all samples experienced identical conditions thus allowing comparison within the cooling segment. The exhaust gas stream was monitored with a gas chromatograph (3000A micro GC, Agilent Technologies) equipped with PoraPlot-Q and molecular sieve 5 Å columns. GC data were treated with the EZChrom Elite software package. In all measurements, CO2 and H2O were the only detected products. Methane conversion is expressed as X% = 100(CH40 – CH4T)/CH40, where CH40 is the area of the GC peak of CH4 at 200 °C and CH4T the area at a given temperature T.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical Properties
Table 1 demonstrates that the Pd-substituted samples exhibited Pd loadings between 1.86 and 2.37 wt %, which corresponds to 0.0435–0.0463 mol Pd. The specific surface area varied in the range 9–22 m2/g, the highest value being observed for Y(Fe,Pd)O3, suggesting a smaller average particle size compared to the other samples. The Mn-containing sample experienced the largest variation of surface area upon addition of Pd, the value decreasing from 20 m2/g of LaMnO3 to 12 m2/g of La(Mn,Pd)O3.

aDetermined by ICP-OES.
bDetermined by quantitative XPS analysis.
Y(Fe,Pd)O3 calcined at 700 °C displayed a diffraction pattern with few broad reflections indicating the poor crystallinity of the sample (Figure 1). The small and broad peaks at 2θ 30.3° (101) and 33.2° (102) were identified as the main peaks of the hexagonal phase. (27) The crystallinity of the sample improved manifestly after calcination at 750 and 800 °C but Fe2O3 and Y2O3 were still detected, thus proving the difficulty to obtain pure phase YFeO3 by the amorphous citrate method at these temperatures. (21, 28) Y(Fe,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 were used for further comparison with the other samples. Figure 2 compares the XRD pattern of Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 with those of the La(B,Pd)O3 (B = Mn, Fe, Co) samples calcined at 700 °C. The rhombohedral (La(Mn,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3) (29, 30) and the orthorhombic (La(Fe,Pd)O3) (31) crystal structures were identified. No secondary phases, including PdO, were detected in the perovskite-type oxides LaBO3 and La(B,Pd)O3. The absence of any reflection of the PdO phase is however not conclusive about the actual state of Pd. Moreover, the crystal structure of the Pd-free samples was identical to that of the doped samples shown in Figure 2 (Table 1). No appreciable shift of the perovskite-type reflections could be observed following addition of Pd that could have revealed occupation of the B-site by Pd. However, the characteristic doublet features typical of the rhombohedral structure of LaCoO3 were less pronounced upon addition of Pd, indicating an influence of Pd on the crystallization of the sample.

3.2 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
The local environment of palladium in La(Mn,Pd)O3, La(Fe,Pd)O3, La(Co,Pd)O3, Y(Fe,Pd)O3, and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). First, the XANES spectra of all samples were simulated under the assumption that, irrespective of the perovskite-type formulation, Pd substitutes the B-site cation and adopts its coordination environment. Simulation of the spectra was performed by adding a Pd atom in the coordination site of Mn, Fe, and Co using the crystal structures determined from the XRD data of Figure 2 and Table 1. The simulated XANES spectra shown in Figure 3a predict the white line of the Pd K-edge to exhibit a doublet that fingerprints Pd in distorted octahedral coordination in perovskite-type oxides. (13) The difference with the white line of the PdO reference is obvious. The second derivative of the spectra is also shown in Figure 3b. In the case of the octahedral coordination, a clear signal appears ca. 20 eV above the Fermi energy that is absent in PdO in square planar coordination. This peak has been associated with shakeup processes involving 1s → 5p transitions or multiple scattering. (14) The occurrence of this feature in the samples prepared in this work was experimentally verified for La(Fe,Pd)O3 and the spectrum of this sample is shown in Figure 4a. The white line of PdO in the form of particles exposed at the ABO3 surface was shown to be clearly different and resembles the situation encountered for PdO/Al2O3 (Figure 4a), taken as characteristic of Pd2+ in square planar coordination (as in PdO) in a supported PdO catalyst. The difference between the two Pd coordination states is again evident from the second derivative of the experimental XANES spectra depicted in Figure 4b. The good agreement between simulated and experimental XANES data for La(Fe,Pd)O3 is taken as proof of incorporation of Pd within the perovskite-type structure.
Figure 3

Figure 4

Figure 4a also shows the experimental XANES data of the other samples together with their second derivatives (Figure 4b). Clearly, the white line of La(Co,Pd)O3 exhibited the same doublet that is reflected in the peak at 20 eV above the Fermi energy in the second derivative. Hence, in this sample Pd adopts the same coordination and probably oxidation state as in La(Fe,Pd)O3.
On the contrary, the white line of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, and La(Mn,Pd)O3 reflects a state of Pd that is more similar to that of Pd in PdO/Al2O3. Therefore, the XANES data indicate that in these samples Pd is most likely in square planar coordination characteristic of Pd2+ in PdO particles. It is evident from comparison of Figures 3a and 4a that the experimental XANES data of these samples contradict the simulated data predicting a similar Pd coordination for all samples. Therefore, either the solid solution between Pd and LaMnO3 is not formed or Pd exhibits a different coordination environment providing a white line profile very similar to that of PdO. Pd was shown to occupy FeO5 trigonal bipyramids in hexagonal YFe1–xPdxO3, but no XANES data have been reported. (21) The spectrum in Figure 4a is also different from that of square planar Pd2+ adjacent to an oxygen vacancy in BaCe1–xPdxO3. (19)
The nonphase shift corrected Fourier transformed k3-weighted EXAFS spectra are shown in Figure 5 together with those of PdO and the Pd foil. All samples exhibit a first neighbor distance at 2.14 Å (32) corresponding to Pd–O bonds well matching the spectrum of PdO. The FT spectra of La(Fe,Pd)O3, La(Co,Pd)O3, and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 do not display additional defined features suggesting the fine dispersion of Pd. On the contrary, an important second Pd–O–Pd coordination shell is clearly observed at 3.42 Å in the case of La(Mn,Pd)O3. Therefore, the EXAFS data confirm the formation of PdO-like particles on this sample in agreement with the Pd2+ oxidation state deduced from the XANES data. The well-defined PdO-like phase could explain the surface area loss after addition of Pd to LaMnO3 (Table 1).

3.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Information about the oxidation state of palladium at the near surface of the perovskite-type oxides was obtained by XPS. Figure 6 shows the Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 core level spectra of (a) Y(Fe,Pd)O3, (b) Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, (c) La(Mn,Pd)O3, (d) La(Fe,Pd)O3, and (e) La(Co,Pd)O3. The spectrum of PdO/Al2O3 (Figure 6f) was used as a reference for palladium stabilized in the oxidation state +2 (PdO) that is confirmed by the XANES data (Figure 4a). The vertical lines in Figure 6 denote the reported ranges of the BE of Pd0 (Pd = 335.1–335.4 eV), Pd2+ (PdO = 336.1–336.6 eV), and Pd4+ (PdO2 = 337.8–338.2 eV). (33)
Figure 6

Starting from La(Fe,Pd)O3, the unusually high BE of Pd 3d5/2 at 337.36 eV and the symmetric photopeak (Figure 6d) indicate the existence of a dominant Pdn+ (n > 2) species. Pd replaces Fe at the B-site of LaFeO3 where it could be stabilized in the oxidation state +3, and the high BE reflects the higher degree of ionicity of Pd and its stronger interaction with the LaFeO3 lattice. Therefore, the state of Pd in La(Fe,Pd)O3 is homogeneous with respect to coordination environment and oxidation state. The XPS data of La(Fe,Pd)O3 can be taken as diagnostic of Pd in solid solution with the perovskite oxide.
The Pd 3d5/2 peak of La(Co,Pd)O3 (337.17 eV, Figure 6e) indicates the same Pd state as in La(Fe,Pd)O3 in agreement with previous reports (7, 34-36) and corroborates the XAS observation that in the two samples Pd is effectively in solid solution with the perovskite-type phase.
Figure 6a shows a narrow and symmetric Pd 3d5/2 photopeak for Y(Fe,Pd)O3 that is centered at 337.45 eV (fwhm = 2.08 eV). It is tempting to associate the high BE with stabilized ionic Pdn+ as in La(Fe,Pd)O3 and therefore with the octahedral coordination of Pd. However, this does not seem feasible based on the hexagonal structure of the sample and from coordination arguments. (21) The similar white line to that of PdO/Al2O3 (Figure 4a) encourages us to assume that palladium is stabilized in the square planar geometry (at least from the XANES viewpoint) but that it is not organized into PdO particles, because of the difference observed by XPS. The adopted coordination may be similar to that of the oxygen deficient BO5 square pyramid observed in BaCe1–xPdxO3−δ, therefore suggesting Pd2+ in a strong ionic environment. (12, 19) Calcination at 800 °C produces a sample exhibiting a peak at 336.58 eV (Figure 6b) that has a closer BE value to that of Pd2+ in PdO/Al2O3 (Figure 6f) indicating that Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 Pd is in a very similar state to that of dispersed PdO. The peak width (fwhm = 3.1 eV) and its asymmetry would indicate the presence of at least two Pd species, therefore including the one observed after calcination at 700 °C.
In support of the XAS data, La(Mn,Pd)O3 exhibited a narrow Pd 3d5/2 peak at 336.79 eV that unambiguously verifies that palladium is in the oxidation state +2 (Figure 6c) and does not substitute Mn.
The BE values of the Pd 3d5/2 photopeaks of the various samples are in line with the surface Pd concentrations (Table 1). The quantitative data of the palladium content reflect the palladium concentration in the near surface region accessible to XPS. The absolute Pd content determined by ICP-OES is also provided. Although the Pd loadings are comparable, the values measured by XPS are low for La(Fe,Pd)O3, La(Co,Pd)O3, and Y(Fe,Pd)O3. This information evokes the palladium depletion from the surface and its incorporation into the perovskite lattice. On the contrary, the higher Pd concentrations observed for La(Mn,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 suggest Pd enrichment at the near surface that can be associated with the formation of a clearly defined PdO phase. In the case of La(Mn,Pd)O3, this confirms the XANES data and provides an explanation for the significant drop of specific surface area observed after addition of Pd to LaMnO3 (Table 1). Calcination of Y(Fe,Pd)O3 at 800 °C seems to force palladium to form PdO particles that together with the evolution of the hexagonal phase confirm the difficulty to insert Pd into YFeO3.
3.4 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR)
H2-TPR is a useful complementary characterization method because it allows distinguishing between Pd incorporated within LaFeO3 and Pd segregated on LaFeO3, thus indicating the different availability of Pd. (13) Reduction of the former species requires higher temperature than exposed PdO nanoparticles. Figure 7 shows the TPR profiles of all samples. The TPR profile of La(Fe,Pd)O3 (Figure 7b) is characterized by a single peak at 270 °C. The character of the Pd species of La(Fe,Pd)O3 in octahedral coordination observed by, for example, XPS and XAS indicates that this reduction event belongs to the reduction of Pd occupying the octahedral Fe sites. (13, 37, 38)

Reduction of La(Mn,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3 is complicated by the reducible perovskite structure. The main peak at 140 °C in the TPR profile of La(Co,Pd)O3 (Figure 7a) is assigned to the reduction of LaCoO3 to La3CoO8 and simultaneous reduction of PdO species to metallic palladium. (35, 39) The absence of any further reduction event at low temperature reveals that this Pd species corresponds to that providing the characteristic XANES profile and therefore of Pd incorporated in LaCoO3. Since LaCoO3 exhibits two H2-consumption events at approximately 355 and 400 °C (LaCoO3 → LaCoO2.67 and LaCoO2.67 → LaCoO2.5), (40) the addition of Pd induces reduction of LaCoO3 at lower temperature. Therefore, the lower reduction temperature than in La(Fe,Pd)O3 for the same coordination state of Pd is caused by the reducibility of LaCoO3. The further peaks observed in the TPR profile are associated with the subsequent Co3O4 → CoO reduction (180 °C), the reduction of La3Co3O8 to La2Co2O5 (240 °C), and of La2Co2O5 to metallic cobalt and La2O3 (505 °C). (35, 39-42)
The reduction profile of LaMnO3 is also characterized by reduction peaks at 340 °C, approximately 400 °C, and above 700 °C (Figure 7c), corresponding to the reduction sequence Mn4+ → Mn3+, Mn3+ → Mn2+. (17, 43, 44) Similarly to La(Co,Pd)O3, addition of Pd shifts the TPR profile to lower temperature. However, the weak but sharp low temperature peak at 65 °C is assigned to the reduction of Pd2+ to Pd0, whereas the envelope at 180 °C coincides with the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ that is followed by the further reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ above 700 °C. (17, 45)
The TPR profiles of Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 shown in Figure 7d–e differ essentially in the low temperature peak observed at 45 and 140 °C, respectively. Since low temperature reduction is not observed in the case of the Pd-free samples, we assign both features to reduction of Pd2+ to metallic Pd. However, the different temperature reveals the different nature of Pd in the two samples that already emerged from the XPS data of Figure 6. The width of the peak at 140 °C suggests slow reduction of PdO, which may be typical of large PdO particles or of palladium in strong interaction with the support. The peak at 45 °C reveals instead the presence of defined PdO-like particles. Further reduction peaks between 250 and 900 °C are attributed to reduction of Fe2O3 ((1) Fe2O3 → Fe3O4, 250–400 °C, (2) Fe3O4 → FeO, 350–900 °C, and (3) FeO → Fe, above 700 °C) (25, 46-48) and of YFeO3 to Fe and Y2O3 above 700 °C. (49) Participation of Fe2O3 present beside the hexagonal phase was confirmed by comparison with H2-TPR of Fe2O3 (not shown). Phase impurities of Y2O3 (Table 1) could also participate into the reduction profile since Y2O3 nanoparticles can reduce below 700 °C. (50, 51) This could be confirmed by the fact that reduction of the samples calcined at 800 °C, thus with improved crystallinity and larger Y2O3 particles, did not display the reduction peak at approximately 600 °C.
3.5 In Situ XANES during H2-TPR
The interpretation of the H2-TPR profiles of Pd-containing samples with respect to reduction of the Pd phase is supported by in situ XANES measurements. Figure 8a–d illustrates the results for La(Co,Pd)O3, La(Mn,Pd)O3, La(Fe,Pd)O3, and Y(Fe,Pd)O3. The initial state of Pd in the various samples is identical to that of Figure 3. The XANES spectra of PdO/Al2O3 and of the Pd foil, representative of Pd2+ and Pd0 states, respectively, are also shown for clarity. During the H2-TPR, the white line of La(Fe,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 slowly and continuously attenuates, indicating the slow reduction of Pd, thus confirming the broad TPR reduction peaks observed in Figure 7. The final XANES spectrum of Y(Fe,Pd)O3 measured at approximately 500 °C reveals the characteristic features of palladium fcc particles. On the contrary, the spectrum of La(Fe,Pd)O3 reduced at approximately 600 °C is featureless. (13) The small size of the Pd particles formed by in situ reduction results in the damped spectrum of Figure 8b. The substantial difference between the two reduced states could be attributed to the ease of reduction of Pd coordinated to YFeO3 compared to the La(Fe,Pd)O3 solid solution.

La(Mn,Pd)O3 (Figure 8c) and La(Co,Pd)O3 (Figure 8a) show sharp reduction events at low temperature (25–80 °C and 80–200 °C, respectively) in agreement with the reduction peaks of Figure 7c,e. Reduction of Pd in the two samples is accomplished at 327 °C for La(Mn,Pd)O3 and at 550 °C for La(Co,Pd)O3. The EXAFS oscillations characteristic of reduced Pd are more pronounced for La(Mn,Pd)O3. In this case, Pd particles are larger upon reduction than on La(Co,Pd)O3 because reduction of PdO on LaMnO3 occurs at lower temperature. On the contrary, La(Co,Pd)O3 is able to stabilize incorporated palladium up to 140 °C (Figure 7e), thus diminishing the probability to observe particle sintering. Moreover, this difference also characterizes the reducibility of the existing PdO particles on La(Mn,Pd)O3.
3.6 Catalytic Activity
The effect of the different Pd states on the catalytic activity for methane oxidation was studied in the 200–900 °C temperature range during a full heating–cooling cycle. Activity was compared in terms of the temperature at which 50% CH4 conversion is attained (T50%). The results for Pd-free and Pd-containing samples are shown in Figure 9a,b, respectively. The activity order of the Pd-free samples LaMnO3 (T50%= 505 °C) > LaCoO3 (555 °C) > LaFeO3 (585 °C) > YFeO3 (610 °C) > YFeO3-800 (650 °C) remains similar during cooling, LaMnO3 (585 °C) > LaCoO3 (630 °C) > YFeO3 (650 °C) > YFeO3-800 (660 °C) > LaFeO3 (680 °C). All catalysts lost activity after reaching 900 °C and exhibited a hysteresis in the activity most likely because of the loss of specific surface area caused by exposure to higher temperature than that of calcination (700 °C). The loss is larger for LaMnO3, LaCoO3, and LaFeO3 (ΔT50% = 80–95 °C) than for YFeO3 (ΔT50% = 40 °C) and YFeO3-800 (ΔT50% = 10 °C). The T50% of YFeO3 is more affected than that of YFeO3-800, since YFeO3 experienced a larger loss of specific surface area upon heating above the calcination temperature and formation of the hexagonal phase (Figure 1).

Addition of Pd leaves the activity order in the heating segment unaltered. The T50% values increase in the order La(Mn,Pd)O3 (T50% = 485 °C) = Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 (485 °C) < La(Co,Pd)O3 (550 °C) < La(Fe,Pd)O3 (565 °C) < Y(Fe,Pd)O3 (575 °C). The CH4 conversion profiles in the cooling segment can be divided into three activity regions: (52) region I (900 °C to ca. 660 °C), where activity drops; region II (ca. 660–540 °C), where activity increases again; and region III (ca. 540–200 °C), where catalytic activity finally vanishes. This behavior is typical of supported PdO catalysts. (53) The activity of the perovskite-type support dominates in the high temperature region I and the order of activity follows that of the Pd-free samples during cooling (Figure 9a). Under these conditions, Pd is most likely in the metallic state. This observation should be verified further using, for example, in situ XANES. (52) Region II is typically associated with Pd reoxidation and redispersion, and the catalyst gains activity because PdO is the necessary active phase for methane oxidation. (52, 54) In region III, where Pd is mostly present as PdO, the activity changes in the order Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 (T50% = 405 °C) < La(Mn,Pd)O3 (416 °C) ≈ Y(Fe,Pd)O3 (420 °C) < La(Co,Pd)O3 (466 °C) < La(Fe,Pd)O3 (550 °C). The activity of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, and La(Mn,Pd)O3 improved significantly, thus confirming the presence of surface PdO on these samples. The observation of the hysteresis in methane oxidation activity at high temperature during the cooling segment, even in the samples where Pd is incorporated within the support lattice, suggests that Pd reduces above the PdO–Pd transition threshold. (13) Upon reoxidation in region II, either partial reincorporation of Pd or complete restoration of the original structure may occur in La(Fe,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3. This does not appear to be the case for Y(Fe,Pd)O3. Clearly, PdO species reduce at high temperature. However, the improvement of activity demonstrated by the T50% values of this sample indicates that exposure of the sample to higher temperature than for calcination under the reactants atmosphere most likely produces structural changes in YFeO3 and in Pd that render the sample similar to Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800. The likely improved crystallinity of YFeO3 during reaction at high temperature as revealed by the XRD data of Figure 1 does not allow to regenerate the Pd species characterizing the initial state of the sample calcined at 700 °C.
4 Discussion
Palladium can occupy the B-site of perovskite-structured materials and exhibits interesting redox properties that can be exploited to generate catalysts with peculiar catalytic performance. The data reported above clearly demonstrate that Pd can adopt different local environments depending on the nature of the perovskite-type oxide and on the crystal structure. We shall provide here a tentative structural interpretation of the reason.
Depending on the host matrix, the oxidation state of Pd varies between +2 and +3 and its coordination environment from square planar to octahedral. In the typical oxidation catalysts of the ABO3 series (A = La, B = Mn, Fe, Co) where the coordination geometry of the B-site is octahedral (BO6 octahedra), it is generally assumed that a doping element such as Pd adopts the same coordination state, at least within the paradigm of the substitution levels used for catalytic applications. LaPdO3, BaCe1–xPdxO3, and YFe1–xPdxO3 are symptomatic of three different coordination environments and two oxidation states of Pd. (12, 14, 21) In LaPdO3, Pd adopted the unusual oxidation state +3 and octahedral coordination. Such a situation is not allowed in BaCeO3, where Pd2+ enters the perovskite-type lattice in square planar coordination (BO4) adjacent to an oxygen vacancy. In hexagonal YFeO3, Pd occupies the trigonal pyramidal 5-fold coordination of the Fe cations but is still able to adopt oxidation state +2.
The characterization data presented in this work clearly show that in this specific series of perovskite-type oxides and irrespective of the fact that the same synthesis procedure has been applied, Pd is able to adopt the coordination state of the B-site in the case of Fe and Co. Therefore, it exhibits a higher oxidation state than the characteristic Pd2+ and a distorted octahedral coordination. On the contrary, with the same substitution level Pd segregates at the surface of LaMnO3. Whether Pd can adopt the same coordination environment of the B-site can be tentatively rationalized on the base of ionic radii arguments and on the electronic structure of the cations considered in this work. Formation of the perovskite-like crystal structure can be predicted using the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t = (rA + rO)/√2(rB + rO), where rA, rB, and rO are the ionic radii of the ions (A- and B-sites and oxygen). Perovskites are formed for 0.75 < t < 1. Distortion of the BO6 octahedra decreases the value of t from that of the ideal cubic unit cell (t = 1). The tolerance factor of the various samples was determined considering the ionic radii by Shannon and Prewitt (Table 2). (55) All cations were assumed in the oxidation state +3 with the 6-fold B-site coordination, 12-fold A-site coordinated, and complete incorporation of palladium within the substituted samples (similarly to the simulated XANES data of Figure 3). Moreover, the spin state of the B-cation was selected high for Fe (56) and Mn (57) and low for Co. (58) The values reported in Table 2 show that t for LaMnO3 is always lower than that of LaFeO3 and LaCoO3, thus already indicating structural differences with implications for B-site substitution. However, it is also clear from Table 2 that t cannot predict whether Pd substitutes the B-site cation in the perovskite-type structure with this substitution level.

Electroneutrality, that is, the sum of the charges of A and B cations in an ABO3 structure which equals the total charge of oxygen anions, must also be satisfied in order to obtain a perovskite-type structure. Electroneutrality is achieved by charge distribution such as A1+B5+O3, A2+B4+O3, or A3+B3+O3. However, anionic or cationic vacancies are typically observed, the oxygen deficiency being rather common given the difficulty to insert interstitial oxygen in the perovskite-type structure. Reductive or oxidative nonstoichiometry can compensate the charge differences to satisfy electroneutrality. (2, 59) The difference between the oxidative nonstoichiometry of manganates (e.g., LaMnO3, Mn3+/4+) and the reductive nonstoichiometry of ferrates (Fe2+/3+) and cobaltites (Co2+/3+) may help to explain the observed tendency of Pd to adopt octahedral coordination in the latter and therefore to occupy the B-site position, which is not observed for LaMnO3. Assuming that this is also the situation in the samples prepared in this work, it is considered that palladium can be hosted as Pd3+ (rPd3+= 76 pm) in LaFeO3 (rFe2+,hs= 78 pm) and LaCoO3 (rCo2+,hs= 75 pm) because its ionic radius better matches that of the B-site cation. On the contrary, the oxidative nonstoichiometry of LaMnO3 causes the formation of the Mn3+–Mn4+ pair with ionic radii that cannot be matched by the larger Pd3+. Rather, a square planar coordination of Pd in oxidation state +2 (rPd2+ = 64 pm) would be preferred based on this argument. As a consequence, either Pd adopts a coordination similar to that described in BaCeO3 (12) or is forced into the square planar coordination of PdO to form particles at the surface of LaMnO3. However, BaCeO3 was shown to exhibit oxygen deficiency. Hence, we consider that palladium prefers a square planar coordination in LaMnO3 with formation of PdO.
In the hexagonal structure, the A-site cation is sevenfold coordinated, and the B-site cation possesses fivefold coordination. In YFeO3, Fe3+ is in trigonal bypiramidal coordination (BO5). Pd2+ fits into this geometry and stabilizes the hexagonal structure versus the high-temperature perovskite structure. (21) The characterization data indicate that Y(Fe,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800 possess very similar XANES white lines and TPR profiles but are clearly different with respect to their oxidation state determined by XPS. Therefore, while the short-range coordination environment of Pd may be very similar, the degree of interaction with YFeO3 varies, most likely depending on the crystallinity of the support oxide. Calcination as low as 700 °C seems to confer Pd a stronger ionic environment, which is probably that corresponding to fivefold coordinated Pd2+. (21) Thus, the XANES profiles of the two samples calcined at different temperatures appear similar. Calcination at 800 °C results in improved crystallinity of YFeO3 and a Pd state similar to that of PdO, thus revealing the formation of PdO particles. Therefore, we do not have evidence for incorporation of Pd in fivefold coordination at this temperature but rather of a bulk PdO phase on the surface of hexagonal YFeO3.
The observed palladium states differently affected the catalytic activity for CH4 oxidation of the La(B,Pd)O3 (B = Mn, Fe, Co) series and Y(Fe,Pd)O3 samples. Catalysts with Pd predominantly in the form of PdO particles reveal highest catalytic activity (La(Mn,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,Pd)O3-800, Pd2+, square planar) because supported PdO nanoparticles are highly active for methane oxidation. On the contrary, catalysts with incorporated (La(Fe,Pd)O3, La(Co,Pd)O3, Pd3+, octahedral) or strongly bound Pd (Y(Fe,Pd)O3, Pd2+, square planar) show lowest catalytic activity probably because Pd is not accessible to methane. Therefore, the high temperature activity is basically dictated by the perovskite structure.
Oxidation reactions on perovskite-type oxides can be influenced by different oxygen species. Low temperature oxidation (T < 400 °C) is considered a suprafacial process, where adsorbed oxygen provided by the gas phase is used as the oxidant and the reaction may follow the Eley–Rideal mechanism. (5) Therefore, catalytic activity can depend on structural defects. CO oxidation is a typical suprafacial reaction on perovskite-structured catalysts where oxygen vacancies play a major role. (19) With increasing temperature the surface coverage of molecular oxygen decreases and the mobility of lattice oxygen increases. Therefore, at higher temperature the reactions become intrafacial processes, where the oxygen provided by the catalyst lattice plays a major role and the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice is faster than its consumption. (5, 60, 61) The intrafacial process typically follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism involving consumption of lattice oxygen and its backfilling from gas phase oxygen. Methane oxidation on perovskite-type catalysts is an example of an intrafacial process where the increased oxygen mobility dominates catalytic activity. We can use this approach to follow the effect of Pd addition on catalytic activity. Therefore, if Pd is incorporated within the perovskite-type structure, it should not affect activity since CH4 oxidation occurs at high temperature. On the contrary, the presence of segregated Pd(O) would improve activity for CH4 oxidation with respect to the mixed oxide, because PdO particles are generally more active at low temperature than a Pd-free perovskite-type catalyst. (62) In line with the characterization data, the better activity demonstrated by La(Mn,Pd)O3 and Y(Fe,PdO)3-800 can be attributed to the presence of Pd2+ exposed in the form of PdO-like particles. The low temperature catalytic activity of these two samples is also consistent with their ease of reduction observed in H2-TPR experiments, pointing to the presence of readily available PdO particles.
The structural difference between the samples becomes also evident after reaching the maximum reaction temperature of 900 °C and during the subsequent cooling. The CH4 conversion profiles of the Pd-containing samples show typical hysteresis and an activity loss. The activity minimum is attributed to the formation of metallic Pd at temperatures above the PdO–Pd equilibrium threshold. The PdO–Pd decomposition temperature is different for the samples and depends on the possible stabilization of the PdO species by the perovskite-type lattice. Bulk-like PdO decomposes at low temperature and consequently forms larger Pd particles due to sintering compared to Pd in solid solution that emerges gradually and at higher temperature from the perovskite-type support. During cooling, metallic palladium reoxidizes either partly or completely below the PdO–Pd threshold, depending on the size of formed metallic Pd particles. This explains the observed different “reactivation” levels between 530 and 590 °C. Additionally, when enabled by the structure (i.e., LaFeO3 and LaCoO3), Pd can be reincorporated upon further cooling. This situation accounts for the lower catalytic activity observed for La(Fe,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3.
5 Conclusions
A series of palladium doped perovskite-type oxides of nominal formula LaB1–xPdxO3±δ (B = Co, Fe, Mn, denoted as La(B,Pd)O3) and YFe1–xPdxO3±δ have been synthesized by the amorphous citrate method. Characterization data of XPS, XANES, EXAFS, and H2-TPR reveal that at least two Pd species populate the various samples and that their distribution is dependent on the catalyst formulation. The two identified species are supported PdO-like particles and well-dispersed octahedral Pd–O species substituting the B-site cation. In the case of perovskite-type catalysts, the latter species was found for Fe and Co B-site cations, in agreement with the reported self-regenerative property of LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3. For Mn as the B-site cation, a widely reported methane oxidation catalyst, Pd deposits in the form of PdO particles on LaMnO3. The influence of the palladium state has been related to the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in the temperature range 200–900 °C. The activity of the catalysts strongly depends on the state of Pd, since typically PdO is considered the active phase for the reaction. Therefore, exposed PdO particles make La(Mn,Pd)O3 more active than La(Co,Pd)O3 and La(Fe,Pd)O3. The different behavior of Pd with respect to the perovskite-type formulation is explained in terms of ionic radii arguments and of the different redox properties of LaMnO3 vs LaFeO3/LaCoO3.
In the case of Y(Fe,Pd)O3, the state of Pd appears to be calcination temperature dependent. When YFeO3 is largely still amorphous, a strong interaction between Pd and the support is observed that is similar in terms of influence on catalytic activity to that exhibited by La(Fe,Pd)O3 and La(Co,Pd)O3. The improved crystallinity of YFeO3 after higher calcination temperature forces Pd to form PdO particles, which strongly promotes catalytic activity. The data reveal that YFeO3 may be a promising support for Pd for methane oxidation.
The data also suggest that the formation of a solid solution between Pd and common perovskite-type oxidation catalysts needs to be carefully ascertained and strongly depends on the composition of the perovskite oxide.
