[1] "Doping with Nb possibly reduces the active sites available for dissociation, making diffusion the fast step of the process, leading to a lower exchange rate and production of larger amounts of doubly exchanged species."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

[4] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium doping reduces the number of active sites available for oxygen dissociation on the NiO surface. This changes the rate-limiting step of the process from dissociation to diffusion.

2. The addition of niobium leads to the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface. These species are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

3. Niobium doping eliminates or reduces the nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species present on pure NiO, which are responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

4. The presence of niobium creates two types of active sites on the catalyst surface: Type I sites responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation, and Type II sites active for direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may arise from:

1. The difficulty in accurately modeling the interaction between niobium dopants and the NiO lattice.

2. The complexity of the reaction network, involving multiple reaction pathways and types of active sites.

3. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, which may not be captured by static models.

4. The potential for synergistic effects between niobium and nickel that are not easily predicted by theory.

5. The challenge of accurately representing the electronic and structural changes induced by niobium doping in theoretical models.

These factors make it challenging to develop comprehensive theoretical models that can fully predict the experimental behavior of Nb-doped NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响有以下几个方面：

1. 铌掺杂减少了NiO表面可用于氧解离的活性位点数量。这改变了过程的限速步骤从解离到扩散。

2. 铌的添加导致催化剂表面形成强结合、活性较低的亲核氧物种。这些物种对将乙烷选择性转化为乙烯有利。

3. 铌掺杂消除或减少了纯NiO上存在的非化学计量的亲电氧物种，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化为CO2。

4. 铌的存在在催化剂表面创造了两种类型的活性位点：负责乙烷ODH和乙烯过度氧化的I型位点，以及活跃于乙烷直接氧化为CO2的II型位点。

在这些复杂催化系统中，调和理论预测与实验观察时可能会遇到以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟铌掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间相互作用的困难。

2. 反应网络的复杂性，涉及多重反应途径和活性位点类型。

3. 催化剂表面在反应条件下的动态特性，这可能无法被静态模型捕捉。

4. 铌和镍之间可能存在的协同效应，这些效应不易通过理论预测。

5. 在理论模型中准确表示铌掺杂引起的电子和结构变化的挑战。

这些因素使得开发全面的理论模型来完全预测Nb掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的实验行为变得具有挑战性。
