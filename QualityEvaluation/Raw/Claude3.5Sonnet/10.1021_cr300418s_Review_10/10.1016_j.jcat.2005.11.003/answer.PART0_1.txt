[1] "Introducing niobium induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2- species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium doping increases the activation energy for oxygen exchange, resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

2. Niobium fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation and making oxygen diffusion the rate-limiting step.

3. Niobium incorporation promotes the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species (O2-) that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

4. A limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remain on the surface after niobium doping, which act as type II active sites for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accounting for the multiple oxidation states and stable forms of niobium oxides in the doped catalyst structure.

2. Modeling the complex interactions between niobium dopants and the NiO lattice, including effects on oxygen mobility and reactivity.

3. Predicting the distribution and nature of active sites created by niobium doping, given the multiple types of oxygen species involved.

4. Incorporating the effects of niobium on catalyst reducibility and reoxidation kinetics into theoretical models.

5. Reconciling atomic-scale predictions with observed macroscopic catalytic behavior and kinetics.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为,主要表现在以下几个方面:

1. 铌掺杂提高了氧交换的活化能,导致催化剂表面上的氧物种结合更强。

2. 铌填充了NiO中的阳离子空位,减少了氧解离的活性位点,使氧扩散成为限速步骤。

3. 铌的引入促进了强结合、不易移动的亲核氧物种(O2-)的形成,这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

4. 铌掺杂后,表面仍保留有少量非化学计量的O-物种,作为直接将乙烷氧化为CO2的II型活性位点。

在研究这些复杂催化系统时,理论预测与实验观察的协调面临以下挑战:

1. 解释掺杂催化剂结构中铌氧化物的多种氧化态和稳定形式。

2. 模拟铌掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用,包括对氧移动性和反应性的影响。

3. 预测铌掺杂产生的活性位点的分布和性质,考虑到涉及多种氧物种。

4. 将铌对催化剂可还原性和再氧化动力学的影响纳入理论模型。

5. 协调原子尺度预测与观察到的宏观催化行为和动力学。
