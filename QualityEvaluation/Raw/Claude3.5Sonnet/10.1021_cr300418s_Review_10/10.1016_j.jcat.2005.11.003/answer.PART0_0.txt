Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium doping alters the oxygen species on the catalyst surface. It eliminates nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation, leading to more selective catalysts.

2. Niobium fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation. This changes the rate-limiting step from incorporation/diffusion to dissociation, favoring the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

3. The addition of niobium creates two types of active sites on the catalyst surface: type I sites responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation, and type II sites active for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

4. Niobium doping decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, which impacts the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accurately modeling the complex interactions between niobium dopants and the NiO lattice.

2. Predicting the exact distribution and nature of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

3. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which niobium alters the catalytic properties of NiO.

4. Accounting for potential synergistic effects between different types of active sites.

5. Accurately predicting catalytic performance across a wide range of reaction conditions and catalyst compositions.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 铌掺杂改变了催化剂表面的氧物种。它消除了负责完全氧化的非化学计量的亲电氧物种，从而提高了催化剂的选择性。

2. 铌填充了NiO中的阳离子空位，减少了氧解离的活性位点。这将反应的速率限制步骤从掺入/扩散改变为解离，有利于形成强键合、不易流失的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

3. 添加铌在催化剂表面创造了两种类型的活性位点：负责乙烷ODH和乙烯过度氧化的I型位点，以及负责乙烷直接氧化为CO2的II型位点。

4. 铌掺杂降低了标记氧的活化能和交换速率，这影响了整体催化活性和选择性。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，理论预测与实验观察之间的协调可能面临以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟铌掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 预测催化剂表面氧物种的确切分布和性质。

3. 理解铌改变NiO催化性质的精确机制。

4. 考虑不同类型活性位点之间可能存在的协同效应。

5. 在广泛的反应条件和催化剂组成范围内准确预测催化性能。
