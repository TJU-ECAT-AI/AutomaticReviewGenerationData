[1] "Nb-doped NiO (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), which demonstrates a very high activity and selectivity in ethylene production via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium doping alters the oxygen species on the catalyst surface. It eliminates nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation, leading to more selective catalysts.

2. Niobium fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites for oxygen dissociation. This changes the rate-limiting step from incorporation/diffusion to dissociation, favoring the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for ethane to ethylene conversion.

3. The addition of niobium creates two types of active sites on the catalyst surface: type I sites responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation, and type II sites active for direct ethane oxidation to CO2.

4. Niobium doping decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, which impacts the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accurately modeling the complex interactions between niobium dopants and the NiO lattice.

2. Predicting the exact distribution and nature of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

3. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which niobium alters the catalytic properties of NiO.

4. Accounting for potential synergistic effects between different types of active sites.

5. Accurately predicting catalytic performance across a wide range of reaction conditions and catalyst compositions.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 铌掺杂改变了催化剂表面的氧物种。它消除了负责完全氧化的非化学计量的亲电氧物种，从而提高了催化剂的选择性。

2. 铌填充了NiO中的阳离子空位，减少了氧解离的活性位点。这将反应的速率限制步骤从掺入/扩散改变为解离，有利于形成强键合、不易流失的亲核氧物种，这些物种对乙烷转化为乙烯具有选择性。

3. 添加铌在催化剂表面创造了两种类型的活性位点：负责乙烷ODH和乙烯过度氧化的I型位点，以及负责乙烷直接氧化为CO2的II型位点。

4. 铌掺杂降低了标记氧的活化能和交换速率，这影响了整体催化活性和选择性。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，理论预测与实验观察之间的协调可能面临以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟铌掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用。

2. 预测催化剂表面氧物种的确切分布和性质。

3. 理解铌改变NiO催化性质的精确机制。

4. 考虑不同类型活性位点之间可能存在的协同效应。

[1] "Introducing niobium induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[2] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2- species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

3. Predicting the distribution and nature of active sites created by niobium doping, given the multiple types of oxygen species involved.

4. Incorporating the effects of niobium on catalyst reducibility and reoxidation kinetics into theoretical models.

[1] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Formation of NiNb solid solution: Small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material by forming a NiNb solid solution.

2. Modification of oxygen species: Niobium doping eliminates nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2. Instead, it promotes the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

3. Alteration of catalyst surface properties: Niobium fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites available for oxygen dissociation. This makes oxygen diffusion the fast step of the process rather than dissociation.

4. Decrease in activation energy: Niobium doping significantly decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may arise from:

1. The complexity of the NiNb solid solution structure and its effect on catalytic properties.
2. The precise nature and distribution of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
3. The interplay between different types of active sites and their role in the reaction mechanism.
4. The influence of reaction conditions on the catalyst's behavior and performance.

These factors make it difficult to develop accurate theoretical models that can fully predict the experimental observations, necessitating a combination of advanced characterization techniques and careful kinetic studies to elucidate the catalytic behavior of these complex systems.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations may arise due to:

1. Complexity of the catalytic system: The presence of multiple active site types and oxygen species makes it difficult to develop accurate theoretical models.

2. Dynamic nature of the catalyst: The catalyst's behavior may change under reaction conditions, complicating the correlation between ex-situ characterization and in-situ performance.

3. Limited understanding of the exact role of niobium: While its overall effect is known, the precise mechanisms by which niobium influences the catalyst's properties at an atomic level may be challenging to predict theoretically.

4. Difficulty in isolating individual effects: The synergistic effects of niobium doping on catalyst structure, oxygen mobility, and surface properties may be hard to separate and study independently.

These factors make it challenging to develop comprehensive theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of these complex NiNbO catalytic systems for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
