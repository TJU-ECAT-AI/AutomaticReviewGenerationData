The literature provided does not directly address the specific question about niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The text mainly discusses Nb-doped pyrochlore catalysts in the context of automotive applications, rather than NiO catalysts for ethane reactions.

However, the document does touch on some relevant aspects of doped oxide catalysts:

1. Structural stability is an important consideration for doped oxide catalysts, as mentioned in the context of Nb-doped pyrochlore catalysts.

2. The reducing atmosphere in practical applications (such as exhaust conditions) can affect the stability of oxide catalysts.

3. Doping with elements like niobium can influence both the catalytic activity and structural stability of oxide materials.

4. There is a relationship between the structural stability of doped catalysts and their catalytic activity, which is investigated in the study.

5. Practical testing conditions are important for evaluating the performance of doped oxide catalysts.

While these points don't directly answer the question about niobium oxides in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, they highlight some of the general challenges and considerations in studying complex catalytic systems involving doped oxides. The document suggests that reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations would likely involve careful consideration of structural stability, practical operating conditions, and the relationship between dopant effects and catalytic activity.

提供的文献并未直接回答关于铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为的具体问题。文本主要讨论了在汽车应用的实际条件下铌掺杂的铱铌酸盐催化剂，而不是用于乙烷反应的NiO催化剂。

然而，该文档确实涉及了掺杂氧化物催化剂的一些相关方面：

1. 结构稳定性是掺杂氧化物催化剂的一个重要考虑因素，在铌掺杂的铱铌酸盐催化剂的背景下提到了这一点。

2. 实际应用中的还原性气氛（如排气条件）可能会影响氧化物催化剂的稳定性。

3. 用铌等元素掺杂可以影响氧化物材料的催化活性和结构稳定性。

4. 掺杂催化剂的结构稳定性与其催化活性之间存在关系，这在研究中进行了调查。

5. 实际测试条件对于评估掺杂氧化物催化剂的性能很重要。

虽然这些点并没有直接回答关于NiO催化剂中铌氧化物在乙烷氧化脱氢中的问题，但它们强调了研究涉及掺杂氧化物的复杂催化系统时的一些一般挑战和考虑因素。文档表明，将理论预测与实验观察进行调和可能需要仔细考虑结构稳定性、实际操作条件以及掺杂效应与催化活性之间的关系。
