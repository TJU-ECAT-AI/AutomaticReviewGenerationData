Abstract
The aim of this work was to study the effect of cation-substitution on the reducibility of the perovskite, as well as the effect on the catalytic
activity for the CH4 oxidation reaction. Six perovskites (LaCoO3, LaMnO3, La1xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.2, 0.4), and La1xCexMnO3 (x = 0.05, 0.1))
were synthesized by reactive grinding. The reducibility of the perovskite was studied by means of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC)
measurement. OSC was performed at different temperatures on LaCoO3 and LaMnO3, in order to elucidate the different mechanisms of
reduction involved at each temperature. The substituted samples showed that reduction profile is modified at high-substitution degrees;
however, no differences were observed on the OSC values (amount of most active oxygen, calculated after one pulse of CO) between the pure
lanthanum sample and the substituted ones.
Tested in the CH4 oxidation reaction, the LaCoO3 sample was found to present a little higher activity than LaMnO3, even if the cobalt-
based sample presented a smaller specific surface area. Moreover, all the substituted samples presented very slightly higher activities than the
pure LaMnO3 solid. Because of the supposed redox oxidation mechanism (Mars-Van-Krevelen), this agrees well with the OSC results
obtained for the reducibility of the manganese on these samples, by which it was observed that substitution does not clearly affect the
immediate reduction of the manganese.

1. Introduction
The perovskites (general formula ABO3) were exten-
sively studied as catalysts during the past 30 years [15],
since some of these solids were found to compete with
supported
noble metals in
oxidation reactions
[2,6].
Generally, perovskite formation can be achieved when the
tolerance factor, t
t 
rArO

, is in the range 0.751
and the A and B cations are stable in octahedral and
dodecahedral
environments,
respectively.
Under
these
considerations, it is possible to obtain perovskites with a
wide range of different compositions. Moreover, these solids
support partial substitutions and compounds with formula
A1xA0
xB1  yB0
yO3 can be obtained. However, only a minor
part of the perovskite mixed oxides presents an interesting
activity
in
oxidation
reactions.
Among
the
possible
compositions, the cobalt- and manganese-based perovskites
were found to be the most active. Then, systems with
lanthanum in A position, and Co or Mn in position B, were
the most studied for catalytic oxidation [710]. It was
however observed that substituting La for some other rare
earths (from Pr to Gd) yields a high activity [11,12]. Much
more efforts were also made in order to increase activity by
partial substitution of the A cation by cations of different
valencies, like Sr2+ and Ce4+ [1318]. These substitutions

were observed to modify the vacancy concentrations. The
mean transition metal valency (Co3+/Co2+ or Mn4+/Mn3+)
and the oxygen mobility are strongly influenced by these
substitutions.
In two previous works, the oxygen mobility in LaCoO3
was investigated by means of oxygen thermo-desorption,
temperature programmed reduction [19], and oxygen
isotopic exchange [20]. Oxygen thermo-desorption is a
method largely used to characterize the oxygen mobility,
since the pioneer works of Misono and co-workers
[8,13,21] and Yamazoe and co-workers [2224]. By this
method, two kinds of oxygens, a- and b-oxygens, are
distinguished. In the literature, the a-oxygen desorption is
ascribed to the desorption of surface oxygen superoxide
species (O2
). The b-oxygen desorption, because of the
large amount desorbed (several monolayers), is described
as lattice oxygen (O2) which desorbs when some bulk
Co3+ reduce into Co2+. This cobalt reduction was clearly
observed in [19], by XRD analysis on the samples after the
oxygen desorption experiments. However, the obtained
results suggest a desorption of oxygens from the grain
boundaries of the solids, more than a desorption from the
crystal. The oxygen isotopic exchange (OIE) [20] permitted
to access the bulk oxygen mobility, by measurement of the
rate of exchange. The Arrhenius plots, obtained for the OIE,
presented similar activation energies than those obtained
for the methane oxidation reaction [19]. Moreover, the
same order of activity than that for the CH4 oxidation
reaction was also obtained. In addition to the role of the
bulk oxygen mobility, an effect of the specific surface area
was clearly observed.
In this work, the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) method
is proposed as a means to evaluate the surface and bulk
oxygen reactivity. The OSC method was first used for the
characterization of three way catalysts [2528]. This
method rests on the pulse injection of a small amount of
gas (CO or O2), at regular time intervals, and is used to
study the stability of the catalysts under three way
conditions, by alternating oxidizing and reducing periods.
This method presents many advantages in comparison to
the temperature programmed reduction experiments. For
example, the amount of the most active oxygen is
calculated from the amount of CO2 produced after the
first pulse of reducing gas. The total amount of oxygen,
available for the oxidation reaction, is obtained by the total
amount of CO2 produced after a series of reducing pulses
[29]. However, Holmgren et al. [28] clearly showed by
OSC that the amount of CO2 produced can strongly differ
from the CO uptake. The authors showed, on Pt/CeO2
catalysts, that the amount of residual oxygen (defined as
the difference between the total oxygen uptake and
release) can be positive or negative, showing that there can
be a net oxygen storage on the catalysts, or an irreversible
loss of oxygen. Finally, the stability of the structure can
also be determined by the alternation between reducing
and oxidizing cycles.
In this work, a series of perovskites, from LaCoO3 to
La1xBxMnO3 (with B = Sr, Ce), were synthesized by
reactive grinding [30]. These systems were chosen, because
of the abundant literature on the redox and catalytic
properties of these compounds. All these solids were tested
in the OSC test. The obtained results were compared to the
performances of the catalysts for the CH4 oxidation reaction,
in order to evaluate the effect of the transition metal
reducibility on the catalytic activity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Six samples were synthesized by reactive grinding.
Reactive grinding is a recent method developed and patented
in our laboratory [30,31]. By this method, the perovskite
crystallization is performed at ambient temperature, by
replacing the thermal energy, necessary for the crystal-
lization, by the mechanical grinding energy. Then, large
specific surface areas can be obtained, depending on the
grinding conditions [30,32]. For this work, the grinding
conditions were adjusted to maximize the specific surface
area.
For the LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 synthesis, the precursor
masses (La2O3, Co3O4, and Mn2O3) were adjusted to obtain
15 g of each perovskite. The precursors were first calcined
at
600 8C,
and
introduced
in
a
stainless
steel
vial
(Vvial = 183.5 cm3) with nine stainless steel balls. The vial
was purged under O2 and hermetically closed. Then, the
powder blend was ground for the first step (4 h at 700 rpm)
in a laboratory SPEX grinder. At the end of this step, a pure
perovskite phase was obtained. The perovskite was then
ground for 20 h, with ZnO as additive (weight ratio
perovskite/ZnO = 1). The obtained mixture was washed
repeatedly with dilute ammonium nitrate and water in order
to
remove
completely
the
additive
(similar
washing
procedure was found to leave less than 0.1wt% of ZnO in
the solid). Such low amounts of ZnO are not supposed to
strongly modify the properties of the solid. Finally, the
perovskite was dried for one night at 80 8C and calcined
under air (20 mL/min10 K/min) at temperatures between
200 8C and 500 8C (Table 1).
For the other four samples, precursor masses were
adjusted to obtain 5 g of perovskite. The volume of the vial
used was 64.6 cm3 and only three balls were used for the
grinding. The agitation speed of the grinder was 1040 rpm.
All the samples were ground in two steps, following the
same procedure than for LaCoO3 and LaMnO3.
For simplicity, even if all the manganese-based sam-
ples presented an oxygen excess due to an important part
of the manganese ions in the 4+ valency (general for-
mula La1  xA0
xMnO3 + d), the manganese-based samples
were denominated with the stoichiometry in oxygen equal
to 3.

2.2. Physical characterization
XRD patterns of the fresh samples were collected on a
SIEMENS D5000 difractometer using the Cu Ka radiation
(l = 1.54184 A
 ). Spectra were recorded for 2u values
ranging from 158 to 758 by 0.058 step, with a step duration
of 2.4 s. Phase recognition was made by comparison with
JCPDS files. Particle sizes (D1) were evaluated by means of
the Scherrer equation D 
Kl
b cos u, after Warrens correction
for instrumental broadening. K is a constant equal to 0.86
[33] and l is the wavelength of the X-ray used. b is the
effective linewidth of the X-ray reflexion, calculated by
the formula b2 = B2  b2, where B is the FWHM and b is the
instrumental broadening determined by the FWHM of the
X-ray reflexion of SiO2, having particles larger than 150 nm,
at 2u  278. Specific surface areas were obtained from N2
adsorption at 196 8C, using an OMNISORP 100 apparatus.
About 0.5 g of catalyst was evacuated for 6 h at 200 8C. The
specific surface area was determined from the linear part of
the BET curve.
2.3. OSC measurements
OSC measurements were performed in a chromato-
graphic pulsed U-shaped microreactor. This system was
equipped with a GC Intersmat IGC120ML, equipped with a
catharometer. Product separation was made on a Porapak Q
column (i.d. = 1/4 in., L = 0.5 m). Catalyst (20 mg) was
weighed, introduced in the reactor between two quartz wool
plugs, and calcined under He (30 mL/min). Then, the
temperature was decreased until the reaction temperature.
The test consisted in four steps:
1. a first series of O2 pulses, until saturation of the solid;
2. a series of CO pulses, until zero conversion of CO or
constant CO consumption;
3. a series of O2 pulses, until complete reoxidation of the
sample;
4. a series of alternated pulses: COO2COO2COO2.
The results obtained on the Co-500 sample (Table 1), at
different temperatures, are presented in Fig. 1. The different
steps are clearly observed.
The oxygen storage capacity value (OSC value in
Table 2) is calculated from the amount of CO2 produced by
the CO pulses from the alternated series (step 4). This value
corresponds to the amount of the most active oxygen,
which is considered immediately available for the reaction.
The oxygen storage complete capacity value (OSCC value
in Table 3) is a measure of the total amount of reactive
oxygen. Then, the OSCC value is evaluated from the total
amount of CO consumed at the end of the CO pulse series
(when zero conversion of CO is attained) (step 2). For the
OSC tests performed at 480 8C, the CO pulses are stopped
even if CO is still being consumed. Then, reduction is not
finished (NF in Table 3). In order to compare the samples
for which the reduction is not finished at the end of the CO
pulse series, a OSCC-10 value was defined. This value
corresponds to the total amount of CO consumed during the
first 10 CO pulses.
For each pulse, the amount of CO2 produced allows us to
calculate the reduction state of the perovskite, i.e. the value
of j in ABOj.
If one assumes that only Co cations are reduced during
the experiment (Co3+ into Co2+), the reduction degree of B
(R%) is given by:
R%  100 3  j
0:5  2003  j
When all the cobalt is reduced to the 2+ valency, R% = 100,
and j = 2.5. LaCoO2.5 is then obtained.
For the Mn-based samples, we previously mentioned that
an important part of the Mn cations is in the 4+ valency (this
will be discussed in Section 3.1). Then, R% refers to the
reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+, and is given by:
R%  100 3:15  j
0:15
When all the Mn4+ initially present in the sample is reduced
to the 3+ valency, R% = 100, and j = 3.

2.4. CH4 oxidation reaction
CH4 activity measurements were performed on cata-
lysts calcined at 500 8C. Perovskite (0.200 g) was weighed
and introduced in a U-shaped microreactor (i.d. = 5 mm).
The reactor was inserted in a furnace. The temperature was
monitored by two K-type thermocouples (on the top
and the bottom of the catalytic bed). The catalyst was first
purged under He (20 mL/min) for 1 h. Thereafter, a flow
composed of 0.25% CH4, 1% Ne, balance O2 was passed
through the reactor, and the temperature was raised. The
total flow rate was adjusted at 15 N mL/min, 22.5 N mL/
min, 30 N mL/min, and 40 N mL/min, which corresponds
to a VHSV between 5625 h1 and 13,875 h1. Conver-
sions were measured in steady-state regime at tempera-
tures between calcination temperature and zero conversion

temperature (decreasing the reaction temperature). Reac-
tants and products were analyzed using a gas chromato-
graph (HP 6890 series), equipped with a TCD. A
HayeSep DB column (i.d. = 1 mm, L = 2 m  5 m) was
used for separation. Calculations of the activation ener-
gies and pre-exponential factors were made by assuming
first-order reaction with respect to CH4: r = kPCH4.
Corrected pre-exponential factor (A0 cor) was calculated
by fitting the Arrhenius plots with a common value of
activation energy (mean value of the activation energies).
Details concerning the kinetic data treatment can be found
in [34].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical properties
The XRD analysis showed the reflexions characteristic of
the perovskite structure for all the samples, whatever the
calcination temperature (Table 1). The XRD spectra for the
samples calcined at 500 8C are given in Fig. 2.
The three cobalt-based perovskites presented intense
reflexions attributed to the rhombohedral LaCoO3 structure
(JCPDS card 48-0123). However, a weak signal for Co3O4

All
the
manganese-based samples presented the rhombohedral
LaMnO3.15 perovskite structure (JCPDS card 50-0298).
This oxygen excess, d in LaMnO3 + d, was often reported in
the literature, when samples were prepared in air. For
example, Tofield and Scott [35] reported a Mn(III)/Mn(IV)
ratio, measured by redox titration, of 3.17. Van Roosmalen
et al. [36] and Porta et al. [37] reported Mn(III)/Mn(IV)
ratios of 2.17 and 1.85, respectively. For all this work, the
oxygen content of the manganese-based perovskites was
assumed to be 3.15, a value usually accepted in the literature
(JCPDS file 50-0298), which represents an average of the
most reliable redox titration data [3537]. This corresponds
to the well-accepted fact that a significant fraction (about
30%) of the manganese is in the 4+ valency state in fully
oxidized perovskite structures. Then, an important part of
the manganese is in the 4+ valency in the structure. As in the
case
of
the
Co-based
perovskites,
minor
crystalline
impurities were also observed on some of these samples
(Table 1). The patterns of the pure LaMn samples presented
weak signals for La2O3 (JCPDS card 74-2430). A weak
signal for SrO (JCPDS card 27-1304) was also observed for
the Sr04-500 sample. The cerium-substituted samples
presented pure perovskite phase, without any CeO2,
La2O3 or manganese oxide contamination. EDX analyses
were performed only on the sample La0.8Sr0.2Mn1xFexO3.
The atomic Fe/Mn ratio was found to be equal to 0.064. This
corresponds to the composition La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.95Fe0.05O3.
The other samples will present similar degree of contam-
ination, because the samples were ground exactly in the
same conditions. Iron from the grinder probably incorpo-
rates
into
the
perovskite
structure
because
LaFeO3
perovskite is easily synthesized. Nevertheless, we cannot
totally exclude the possible formation of small particles of
Fe2O3 on the samples. At low contamination degree, it was
observed that iron does not strongly alter the redox and
catalytic properties of the solid [19,20]. Moreover, in this
work it is presumable that iron is present at similar amount in
all samples, and then the effect will be the same for all
samples.
The crystal sizes, calculated from X-ray line broadening
(D1 in Table 1), were found to vary between 13.2 nm
(Ce005-500) and 15.2 nm (Sr02-500). A small increase of
D1 (from 13.5 nm to 15.1 nm) with the calcination
temperature was
observed
for
the
LaCoO3
samples.
However, such increase was not observed with the LaMnO3
samples. No clear effect of the substitution, neither by Ce,
nor by Sr, was observed on the crystal size, which varies
between 13.2 nm and 15.2 nm. These values agree well with
previous values reported for LaCoO3 prepared by reactive
grinding [19,32]. The obtained crystal sizes are lower than
those of perovskite samples prepared by other methods
[18,19,37].
All the specific surface areas were found to vary between
36.4 m2/g (Sr02-500 in Table 1) and 66.8 m2/g (Ce01-200).
The LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 samples prepared by the citrate
complexation method presented specific surface areas of
6.6 m2/g
and
13.1 m2/g,
respectively
(Table
4).
For
comparison, Alifanti et al. [18] reported specific surface
areas of 16.5 m2/g and 11.3 m2/g for LaMnO3 and LaCoO3,
respectively, prepared by the citrate method. The effect
of the calcination temperature on the specific surface
area is clearly observed in Table 1. The specific surface
area of LaMnO3 is more stable than the one of LaCoO3.

This explains why LaMnO3 is often reported as presenting a
higher specific surface area than LaCoO3 [8,18,37]. It is
observed that the specific surface areas remain constant at
low calcination temperatures (<500 8C). This is in line with
the observation noted above, that the crystal domain size of
LaCoO3 is only slightly affected by a raise of the calcination
temperature whereas the same parameter is not affected in
the case of LaMnO3. A similar trend was already described
in ref. [30]. The specific surface area was, however, found to
decrease dramatically, until it reaches values of specific
surface areas close to those obtained for samples prepared by
conventional methods, when samples were calcined at
temperatures higher than 600 8C. The decrease in specific
surface area observed at high calcination temperature is the
result of two different processes: a crystal domain size
enlargement, and an increase of the fraction of surface lost
by adhesion of nanosized domains inside the agglomerates
(Sth/SBET ratio) [19].
In conclusion, all the samples present similar morphol-
ogies (D1, SBET, Sth/SBET ratio). This will eliminate the
morphology effect on the catalytic activity, discussed in
previous works [19,20].
3.2. OSC measurement
3.2.1. LaCoO3 sample
3.2.1.1. Reduction mechanism. Fig. 3 and Table 4 present
the result of H2 reduction experiment for LaCoO3 prepared
by citrate complexation [19]. Two successive steps are
observed (Fig. 3A). The first step is described as the
reduction of the Co3+ into Co2+, whereas the second
reduction step corresponds to the reduction of the Co2+ into
Co0, with the destruction of the perovskite structure [3842].
However, Fig. 3B showed that a little more than 1 e was
consumed in the first reduction step (below 550 8C). This
deviation with respect to 1 e can be logically explained by
the higher reactivity of the surface relative to the bulk [43].
Then, some cobalt is supposed to be reduced to metallic
cobalt at the end of the first reduction step.
3.2.1.2. Effect of temperature of the pulsed reduction by
CO (OSC reaction). The LaCoO3 sample was calcined at
three temperatures: 200 8C, 350 8C, and 500 8C and tested in
OSC at 180 8C, 330 8C, and 480 8C. These temperatures
were chosen on the basis of the temperature of the reduction
steps (Fig. 3). Then, at 180 8C, no reduction is observed
by TPR-H2. At 330 8C, the reduction of Co3+ into Co2+
begins, and the reduction of the Co2+ into Co0 starts above
480 8C.

ramp = 5 K/min from 25 8C to 900 8C.
The OSC results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. It can be
observed that even at low temperature (180 8C), the Co-500
sample presents an activity in OSC (Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 4A).
However, the values of OSC and OSCC values (Tables 2 and
3) showed that reduction probably occurs only on the surface
(j = 2.91 at the end of the CO pulse cycle, Table 3). At
330 8C (Fig. 4B), the Co-500 sample presents an oxygen
stoichiometry of 2.62 after 13 CO pulses reduction cycle
(Table 3). It is however seen that the oxygen stoichiometry is
tending slowly and asymptotically toward the 2.50 value,
corresponding to the complete reduction of Co3+ cations into
Co2+. Finally, at 480 8C (Fig. 4C), a quick reduction until
j = 2.50, followed by a linear decrease of j, is observed.
Then, the reduction of Co2+ into Co0 (second step in Fig. 3A)
occurs at this temperature. At the end of the CO pulses
series, the obtained compound presents an oxygen stoichio-
metry equal to 2.39, showing that the reduction is not
completed and that additional CO pulses would lead to more
reduced products.
It is also observed by comparison between the OSCC
values (calculated from the total amount of CO consumed)
and the amount CO2 produced (Fig. 1 and Table 3), that the
amount of CO2 produced is always lower than the amount of
CO consumed. This was also observed during the alternate
pulse series. Then, CO adsorbs on the surface and, because
of the lack of available oxygen, stays adsorbed on the
vacancies. From the beginning of the O2 pulse series, CO is
oxidized when gaseous oxygen is adsorbed and activated on
the surface.
In conclusion, depending on the test temperature, the
oxygen consumed during the OSC test can be related to the
following processes:
180 8C: slow surface Co3+ reduction into Co2+;
330 8C: immediate Co3+ surface reduction, followed by the
slow bulk Co3+ reduction into Co2+;
480 8C: quick surface and bulk Co3+ reduction, followed by
the slow Co2+ reduction into Co0.
3.2.1.3. Effect of the calcination temperature. Fig. 5 pre-
sents the results of the OSC experiments performed at 180 8C
on the Co-200, Co-350, and Co-500 samples. It is observed
that the lower the calcination temperature, the higher the
reduction degree. Then, the OSC and OSCC-10 values de-
creasewhen the calcination temperatureisincreased(Tables2
and3). Whateverthecalcination temperature, only the surface
Co3+ of LaCoO3 seems to be reducible at 180 8C. However,
the observed decrease is not directly proportional to the sp-
ecific surface area. This can be explained by the surface
changes induced by a raise in calcination temperature. It was

previously observed that the Co2+ surface concentration,
measured by XPS, increases with the calcination temperature
[30]. Decreasing the Co3+ surface concentration results in
a decrease of the amount of CO consumed for the reduction
of the surface. A similar decrease of the OSCC-10 value
(Table 3) was observed between Co-350 and Co-500, both
tested at 330 8C. The OSC values at 330 8C seem not to
be affected by the calcination temperature.
3.2.1.4. Reduction reversibility. It is clearly observed in
Figs. 4 and 5 that reduction is reversible. Indeed, after
reduction, pulsing O2 results in a reoxidation of the
perovskite until the initial oxygen stoichiometry. Moreover,
it was observed that reoxidation proceeds more rapidly
than the reduction. This reversibility was also observed
even when some cobalt is reduced to metallic cobalt,
showing that metallic cobalt is stable in the structure and
does not undergo sintering. Crespin and Hall [38] and
Simono et al. [40] already observed this reversibility for the
LaCoO3 perovskite. However, even if it is possible to return
to the initial structure by reoxidation, the crystal structure
was found to be slightly altered upon reduction [38].

perature
programmed
reduction

experiment,
obtained on LaMnO3 prepared by the citrate complexa-
tion method, are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 4. Based

content

all
the
manganese-based
perovskite was
assumed to be 3.15 (JCPDS file 50-0298). REF \*
MERGEFORMAT REF \* MERGEFORMAT A reduction
in two steps, as in the case of the LaCoO3 sample, is
observed (Fig. 6A). The amount of H2 consumed during
the reduction (Table 4) showed however that manganese is
not reduce to metal when the 900 8C temperature is
reached. Similar results were presented by Irusta et al.
[42] and Lisi et al. [44]. The first reduction step
corresponds to less than 1 e (Fig. 6B), and can be
ascribed to the reduction of the Mn4+ into Mn3+, added to
the reduction of some Mn3+ from the surface into Mn2+.
During the second reduction step (above 600 8C), Mn3+
reduces to Mn2+. However, at 900 8C, the reduction is not
complete. It is supposed that, at the end of the reduction
(temperature higher than 900 8C), the compound is a solid
in which all the manganese ions are in the 2+ valency
state. Contrarily to what was supposed for LaCoO3 after
reduction of the cobalt to the 2+ valency, the reduction of
the manganese ion to the 2+ valency probably leads to the
loss of the perovskite structure, as observed by XRD by
Ponce et al. [45], and the formation of La2O3 and MnO
oxides.

3.2.2.2. Effect of temperature of the pulsed reduction by
CO (OSC reaction). Just like for the LaCoO3 sample, the
LaMnO3 sample was calcined at 200 8C, 350 8C, and
500 8C, and tested at 180 8C, 330 8C, and 480 8C. The
results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. It is observed
(Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 7) that the OSCC and OSC values at
200 8C, obtained on Mn-500, are very low (47 mmol/g and
29 mmol/g, respectively) in comparison to those obtained
on
the
Co-500
sample
at
the
same
temperature
(OSCC = 381 mmol/g and OSC = 203 mmol/g). This corre-
sponds to an oxygen stoichiometry decrease from 3.15 to
3.14 (Tables 2 and 3). At this temperature, the process
responsible for the OSC activity is the reduction of the Mn4+
surface ions. However, the LaMnO3 surface is less reactive
than the one of LaCoO3. This indicates a more difficult
reduction of the Mn4+ ions in comparison to the reduction
of the Co3+ ions. Tested at 330 8C, the Mn-500 sample
oxygen content at the end of the reduction falls to 2.96
(Fig. 7B). This value is close to 3, which should be obtained
if all the Mn4+ reduces to Mn3+. Then a minor part of the
Mn3+ (on the surface) probably reduces to Mn2+ at this
temperature. At 480 8C, a value of oxygen stoichiometry
close to 3 is obtained after the first CO pulse (3.04 in the
case
of
the
alternate
pulses,
which
corresponds
to
R% = 73). At this temperature, all the Mn4+ are easily
reduced into Mn3+. An OSCC of 2246 mmol/g was obtained
at the end of the reduction pulses. This corresponds to an
oxygen content of 2.60. However, reduction is not finished
(Fig. 7C), and it seems that the reduction will proceed
asymptotically until complete reduction of Mn3+ into Mn2+
(j = 2.5).
In conclusion, depending on the temperature of test, the
mechanisms responsible for the OSC activity on LaMnO3
are:
180 8C: activity due to the Mn4+ surface reduction into
Mn3+;
330 8C: immediate Mn4+ surface reduction and reduction of
the bulk Mn4+ into Mn3+, probable reduction of the surface
Mn3+ into Mn2+;
480 8C: immediate reduction of all the Mn4+ into Mn3+,
followed by a slow reduction of the Mn3+ into Mn2+.
3.2.2.3. Effect of the calcination temperature. At 180 8C, it
was previously supposed that only surface oxygen reacts
with CO. However, the two samples calcined at higher
temperatures (Mn-350 and Mn-500) present much lower-
OSCC and OSC values than those obtained on the Mn-200
samples, even if the specific surface area was not clearly
affected by the calcination temperature (Table 1). The value
of OSCC-10 obtained on Mn-350 at 330 8C is equal
to 699 mmol/g, whereas an OSCC-10 of 683 mmol/g was-
obtained for Mn-500. The OSC values are 301 mmol/g and
306 mmol/g for Mn-350 and Mn-500, respectively. Then,
similar values of OSCC-10 and OSC were obtained for these
two samples. Then, at 330 8C, manganese reducibility is not
clearly affected by the calcination temperature.
3.2.2.4. Reduction reversibility. Fig. 7 shows that at the
three temperature examined, the LaMn perovskite can be
reoxidized until the initial value of oxygen content, whatever
the reduction degree (Mn3+ or Mn2+). This result is similar to
the one presented above for LaCoO3. In opposition to the
LaCoO3 sample, in which the cobalt reduces to metallic
cobalt (Co-500 at 480 8C, Fig. 4), the manganese does not
reduce to the metallic state in the conditions of these tests. It
seems however that the perovskite structure is lost when all
the manganese is reduced into Mn2+ [45]. Nevertheless, the
perovskite structure is surely recovered by reoxidation, as
for the LaCoO3 sample.
3.2.3. Substitution effect
The results of the OSC experiments on the Ce- and Sr-
substituted manganese samples are presented in Tables2 and 3.

from 25 8C to 900 8C.
Surprisingly, the OSC values, obtained at 480 8C with the
four catalysts calcined at 500 8C, are close to those obtained
for Mn-500. The Mn-500 sample presented an OSC equal to
452 mmol/g. The substituted samples presented OSC values
comprised between 425 mmol/g (Sr04-500) and 470 mmol/g
(Ce005-500), which corresponds to an oxygen content in the
perovskites, remaining after a single CO pulse, close to 3
(between 3.03 and 3.05, see Table 2) and a reduction degree
of Mn4+ into Mn3+ (R%, see Table 2) between 67% and 80%
if the same Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio is maintained after substitution.
Then, for all these samples, most of the Mn4+ in the
perovskite is immediately reduced into Mn3+. However, an
increase of the Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio should be logically
expected in order to maintain the electroneutrality of the
structure. Then, the OSC values should be higher for Sr02-
500 and Sr04-500 than for Mn-500. Surprisingly, the OSC
values obtained for the Sr-substituted samples are only a
little lower than that of Mn-500. This result suggests that the
Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio is not clearly affected by the substitution by
Sr. Following the same approach for the Ce4+-substituted
samples, a decrease of the Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio, and then a
decrease of the OSC values, should be observed. This is not
the case (see Table 3) and the OSC values are a little higher
than (Ce005-500) or equal to (Ce01-500) that of Mn-500.
This can be explained by the fact that the lower oxygen
amount from the Mn4+ reduction is compensated by the
reduction of some Ce4+ into Ce2+ at this temperature.
Even if no real differences are observed in the OSC
values, the samples present differences in their pulse
reduction profile (Fig. 8). After a fast initial reduction of the
Mn4+, some of the samples show a continuous decrease of
the oxygen stoichiometry with the pulse number. This is the
case for Mn-500, Sr02-500, and Ce005-500. The other two
samples, Sr04-500 and Ce01-500, present a faster decrease
of the oxygen content during the first four to six CO pulses.
However, after this quick initial process, reduction proceeds
more slowly than for Mn-500, Sr02-500, and Ce005-500,
and the oxygen content in the perovskite seems to reach a

plateau (reduction rate = 0 e/pulse). From the OSCC-10
values (Table 3), it is observed that reduction rate on the
different samples vary as follow:
Sr02-500 < Ce01-500 < Mn-500 < Ce005-500 < Sr04-500
However, because of the different reduction profiles,
observed in Fig. 8, this does not correspond to the real
OSCC value. Then, from the reduction traces (Fig. 8), it can
be extrapolated that the reduction degree of the samples,
after complete reduction, will vary as:
Ce01-500 < Sr04-500 < Sr02-500 < Mn-500 < Ce005-500
3.3. Catalytic activity in CH4 oxidation reaction
The results of catalytic activity for the CH4 oxidation
reaction are presented in Fig. 9. The Mn-500 sample
presents a slightly lower activity than Co-500, even if its
specific surface area is higher than the one of Co-500
(Table 1). For the substituted samples, the following order of
activity is obtained:
Sr04-500  Ce005-500 > Ce01-500  Sr02-500 > Mn-500
Except for the Sr02-500 sample (SBET = 36.4 m2/g in
Table 1), all samples present similar specific surface areas
(50  4 m2/g). The differences in catalytic activity between
the samples are very small, especially at the low conversion
temperatures. At the high conversion temperatures, a
difference of 20 8C maximum is observed to obtain the
same conversions between the most active catalyst and the
least active one, showing that the substitution (Sr- or Ce-
substitution) does not strongly affect the catalytic properties
of the solids.
For the kinetic treatment, a simple first-order reaction rate
was used [19,32]. The values of pre-exponential factor (A0)
and activation energy (E), obtained by linear regression on
the Arrhenius plots, are summarized in Table 5. The
corresponding Arrhenius plots are presented in Fig. 10. The
calculated activation energies were found to vary between
20.2 kcal/mol (Co-500) and 23.6 kcal/mol (Mn-500). These
values are in good agreement with the ones obtained on
previous works (between 20.6 kcal/mol and 25.7 kcal/mol
for a variety of LaCo1xFexO3 prepared by different
methods [19] and between 21.0 kcal/mol and 26.3 kcal/
mol for a series of LaCo1xFex prepared by reactive grinding
[32]). Moreover, the values of activation energy, reported in
the literature for this reaction, often vary in the same range
[12,18,42]. The pre-exponential factors obtained by direct
regression on the Arrhenius plots (A0 in Table 5) were

recalculated by arbitrarily setting the activation energy to a
common value (22.2 kcal/mol, A0 cor in Table 5). This still
yields a reasonable fit (dotted lines in Fig. 10). Then, the so
obtained A0 cor factors (Table 5) may be regarded as a means
to measure the catalyst activity whatever the test tempera-
ture. They can be plotted as a function of the specific surface
area of the solids (Fig. 11). It is observed, as mentioned
above, that all the substituted samples presented activities
comprised between the ones of the Sr04-500 and the Mn-500
samples. Furthermore, the specific activity of the solids can
be obtained by dividing A0 cor by the specific surface area.
The obtained specific activities were found to vary between
16.0 mol/m2 s atm (Mn-500) and 28.9 mol/m2 s atm (Sr04-
500) (Table 5). Then, the following specific activity order
was obtained (Table 5; Fig. 11):
Sr04-500  Co-500 > Sr02-500 > Ce005-500 >
Ce01-500 > Mn-500
As mentioned above, the differences in activity observed
between the samples are very small. The A0 cor factors and
the Arrhenius plots confirm the higher specific activity
obtained for the Co-500 sample than for the Mn-500 sample.
This result differs from what was reported by Alifanti et al.
[18] and Kirchnerova et al. [46], who reported a significantly
higher specific activity for the CH4 oxidation reaction for
LaCoO3 than for LaMnO3. Nevertheless, Rossetti and
Forni [47] observed a higher activity at low conversion
temperatures, and a lower activity at high conversion
temperatures for LaMnO3 than for LaCoO3; unfortunately,
the authors did not give the exact values of specific surface
areas of the samples.
For the substituted samples, we mentioned above that the
differences in activity are very weak (Figs. 9 and 10). Ponce
et al. [45], who studied the effect of the Sr-substitution on
LaMnO3, observed an increase in specific activity until
x = 0.2. For higher substitutions, the specific activity was
found to decrease. Nevertheless, the specific activity was
found to be multiplied by a factor of 2 and more for
La1xSrxMnO3 when x = 0.1 and 0.2. On La1xCexMnO3,
Alifanti et al. [18] observed a significant increase in activity
for the CH4 oxidation reaction when x = 0.1. Substitutions at
a higher degree result in a decrease of the catalytic activity.

The authors reported specific surface area of 16.5 m2/g for
LaMnO3 and around 30 m2/g for the substituted samples.
When calculated per unit surface area, all the substituted
samples presented lower specific activities than the one of
LaMnO3.
Activity was generally discussed in terms of oxygen
mobility (and especially bulk oxygen mobility for the CH4
oxidation reaction) by many authors. This oxygen mobility
can be related to the reducibility of the transition metal
used, as proposed in ref. [20]. For LaCoO3, the redox
couple
Co3+/Co2+
was
found
to
be
active
in
the
temperature range of the CH4 oxidation reaction (Fig. 4;
ref. [19]). The reduction of a surface Co3+ (into Co2+)
makes the solid able of being reoxidized by gaseous O2,
from 180 8C as observed by OSC. The O2 molecule,
adsorbed
and
dissociated
on
the
surface,
can
be
incorporated into the lattice of the crystal as O2 species.
This oxygen species is supposed to be consumed by the
molecule to be oxidized, following a Mars-Van-Krevelen
mechanism. This lattice oxygen is especially mobile in the
bulk because of the occurrence of the anionic vacancies,
which permit the oxygen diffusion. Whatever the crystal,
oxygen mobility is strongly influenced by the morphology
of the solid. Then, it was observed that the specific surface
area was not the only critical parameter for the catalytic
activity, and that morphology (because of its effect on the
bulk oxygen mobility and cobalt reducibility) can create
significant differences in catalytic activity. The CH4
oxidation mechanism proposed in [20] supposed that only
some outer layers are responsible of the catalytic activity
in the conditions of test. So, when two samples present
large differences in specific surface area or crystal domain
size, the comparison of the activities of the two samples
cannot be done simply per unit surface area. For the
present series of substituted samples, all had similar
specific
surface
areas
(within
5 m2/g,
except
for
Sr02C500) and same crystal size (Table 1). Then, all
the substituted solids present similar morphologies and the
OSC value can be logically considered as an appropriate
measure of the amount of active oxygen at each test
temperature. On the manganese-based perovskites, it was
observed that for temperatures between 330 8C and
500 8C, all the Mn4+ ions can be reduced to Mn3+ (slow
reduction at 330 8C (OSCC) and immediate reduction at
480 8C (OSC), see in Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 7). Then at
480 8C, all the tested solids presented a reduction of all the
Mn4+ into Mn3+ at the first CO pulse. This Mn4+ cannot be
segregated on the surface and an important part is probably
located in the crystal domains. The active bulk oxygen is
coming from the reduction of some bulk Mn4+ into Mn3+.
Nevertheless, it was not possible to observe significant
differences in reducibility between the substituted sam-
ples. Then, the amount of available oxygen being not
strongly influenced by the substitutions, similar activities
were logically obtained on these samples for the CH4

4. Conclusion
In this work, LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 were tested for their
oxygen storage capacity at different temperatures. By this
method, a variety of reduction processes was clearly
observed. Depending on the OSC test temperature, only
surface, or surface and bulk, can be activated. Then, for
LaCoO3, it was observed that at 180 8C, only the Co3+
surface ions are activated and reduced. At 330 8C, all the
Co3+ of the solid were found to be reduced to Co2+.
However, no reduction of Co2+ into Co0 was observed at
this temperature. This reduction to the metal began only
when the test was performed at 480 8C, after the complete
reduction of Co3+ into Co2+. The manganese-based
perovskite presents reduction processes different from
those observed for LaCoO3. At 180 8C, the LaMnO3
sample showed a very low oxygen mobility in comparison
to
the
LaCoO3
sample.
The
oxygen
involved
was
associated to the reduction of surface Mn4+ ions. At
330 8C, the reduction process observed was attributed to
the slow reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+, and a LaMn3+O3
compound is obtained at the end of the reduction cycle. At
480 8C, it was observed that all the Mn4+ reduced
immediately into Mn3+ (the amount of CO2 produced in
the first reducing pulse (OSC value) corresponded to the
reduction of all the Mn4+). At this temperature, a slow
reduction of the Mn3+ into Mn2+ followed. The Sr- and Ce-
substituted samples (La1x(Sr, Ce)xMnO3.15) were tested in
OSC at 480 8C. It was observed that the substitution affects
the pulse reduction profile. However, no real effect of the
substitution was observed on the immediate amount of
oxygen available (OSC value), showing that Sr- and Ce-
substitutions do not strongly modify the amount of
manganese immediately reduced.
All these samples were also tested in the CH4 oxidation
reaction. It was observed that the pure cobalt-based
perovskite was more active than the manganese-based
perovskite, even if its specific surface area was lower. The
substituted samples were found to be only slightly more
active than the pure LaMnO3 sample, especially at low
temperature. This correlated well with the results obtained
for the OSC measurement. The mechanism of CH4 oxidation
could then be discussed in term of oxygen mobility and
transition metal reducibility.
