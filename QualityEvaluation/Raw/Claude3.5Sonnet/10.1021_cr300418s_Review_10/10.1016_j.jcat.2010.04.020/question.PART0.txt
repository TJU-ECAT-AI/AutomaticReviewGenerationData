Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 perovskite is an unusual catalyst for CO oxidation by O2, given its low surface area. The rate
law for the catalytic reaction was evaluated under CO-lean and CO-rich conditions, as well as near-stoi-
chiometric conditions. When O2 is present in excess, the kinetics show CO inhibition, consistent with a
LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism in which both reactants compete for the same adsorption sites.
The Arrhenius activation energy for this mechanism is surprisingly low, (7.8  0.3) kcal/mol. It is attrib-
uted to weak adsorption of CO on ionic surface Pd(II) sites. When O2 is limiting, the reaction orders for
both CO and O2 show a strong dependence on P(CO)/P(O2), and eventually become independent of both
P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO). This suggests a new BaCeO3-mediated mechanism which dominates the
reaction at high P(CO)/P(O2). Its Arrhenius activation energy is (9.7  0.3) kcal/mol, probably reflecting
the barrier to oxygen migration in the oxide phase. Both mechanisms contribute significantly for
P(CO)/P(O2)  1. The catalytic activity of Pd-substituted BaCeO3 is attributed to the increased bulk oxygen
mobility in the presence of square-planar Pd(II) ions that are located on the perovskite B-sites, each adja-
cent to an oxygen vacancy.

1. Introduction
CeO2 has been a major component of automotive exhaust emis-
sions catalysts since the early 1980s [1]. Both CeO2 and its mixed
oxides, such as CeO2ZrO2, are well known for their oxygen storage
capacity (OSC) [15] and dynamic oxygen exchange capacity (OEC)
[3,610]. The Ce4+/3+ redox couple allows these materials to store
and release oxygen under fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions,
respectively. There are many synthetic routes to CeO2-based oxi-
des, including solgel methods [11,12], coprecipitation [13,14],
flame synthesis [6,15,16], solid-state reactions [17,18], and electro-
synthesis [19,20]. Noble metals are readily dispersed on their sur-
faces, promoting catalytic activity at the metalsupport interface
[2126]. Oxidation of CO [2731] and soot [3234] can occur via
a CeO2-mediated mechanism, making use of lattice oxygen
rather than adsorbed O2(g).
Preventing thermal deactivation in emissions catalysts remains
a challenge [35]. The temperature of the exhaust gases can rise
transiently to ca. 1000 C, while the exhaust gas fluctuates be-
tween oxidizing and reducing compositions. Under these condi-
tions, catalysts composed of highly dispersed noble metals on
CeO2-based supports are gradually deactivated by phase transi-
tions, loss of surface area in the support, and sintering of the metal
particles [1,36,37]. Redispersion of the noble metal is required to
regenerate a sintered catalyst, but successful in situ examples are
limited. For example, 2 wt.% Pt on a CeZrY mixed oxide under-
went redistribution of large Pt particles to smaller particles in re-
sponse
to
redox
changes
[38].
It
was
also
reported
that
La(Co,Fe)O3 perovskites doped with noble metals can generate
and regenerate highly dispersed noble metal nanoparticles by cyc-
lic ingress and egress of the metal during redox cycling [39].
Mixing CeO2 with other oxides, such as in CeO2La2O3 [40], CeO2
Y2O3 [41], CeO2Al2O3 [42], and CeO2SiO2 [43], can increase its
thermal stability, however, these materials still lose surface area
over time at 1000 C. Since CeO2 itself also shows poor resistance
to sulfur poisoning [44,45], BaO may be added in the role of SOx ab-
sorber [46]. In addition, BaO is used in automotive emissions cata-
lysts for NOx storage [47,48] and to reduce washcoat (Al2O3)
sintering [49]. The properties of the stable perovskite BaCeO3 as a
catalyst support and promoter of noble metal catalysis are therefore
relevant. Doped barium cerate, BaCe1xMxO3d (M = Gd, Y, In, etc.),
has found widespread use as proton conductor in solid-oxide fuel
cells, where conduction is attributed to the presence of hydroxyl
groups in the oxygen sublattice [5052]. The low-temperature com-
bustion and high-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
are catalyzed by doped Ba(Ce1xMx)O3d and (Ba1yMy)CeO3d
(M = Ca, La, Y, Nd), where enhanced activity was attributed to the in-
creased efficiency of oxygen transport [53].

Pd-containing catalysts have been widely studied for treating
cold-start emissions, because of their high activity at low temper-
ature. Recently, we showed that BaCeO3 can accommodate low lev-
els of Pd(II) on the perovskites B-sites [54,55]. Since the solid-state
synthesis is conducted at 1000 C, its B.E.T. surface area is very low
(ca. 1 m2/g). However, Pd-substituted BaCeO3 and highly dispersed
Pd/c-Al2O3 with comparable total masses of Pd have very similar
light-off temperatures, T50, for CO oxidation under lean conditions
[55]. Furthermore, the perovskite allows Pd to move out of and
back into the oxide lattice in response to reducing or oxidizing con-
ditions, respectively. The complete reversibility of this migration
was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [54,55]. The thermo-
dynamic stability of BaCeO3 enables the catalyst to recover its
activity fully even after exposure to temperature extremes.
In this contribution, we evaluate the rate laws for CO oxidation
under a range of reaction conditions (lean, rich, near-stoichiome-
tric) over Ba(Ce,Pd)O3. Due to the crystalline nature of the BaCeO3
host, the local environment of Pd(II) is highly uniform. Using X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we determine the coordination of
the Pd(II) sites and the location of their accompanying oxygen
vacancies, thereby linking catalytic activity with the structure of
the noble metal sites.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The solid-state synthesis of BaCe1xPdxO3x (q = 6.27 g/cm3 for
x = 0.10) in flowing O2 at 1000 C was described previously [54].
With an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 (99.5% purity, Aldrich),
2.0 wt.% PdO/c-Al2O3 was prepared by incipient wetness impreg-
nation of c-Al2O3 (HTA 102; 78 m2/g), followed by calcination in
air at 600 C for 4 h.
CO oxidation under lean conditions was performed using a pre-
mixed feed containing 1000 ppm CO and 10% O2, balanced by ar-
gon. The calibration gas was a premixed cylinder of 1000 ppm
CO2 in N2 (Praxair). CO oxidation under rich conditions was per-
formed by mixing CO and O2 (both 99.99%, Praxair) with Ar
(99.999%, Praxair) in the desired ratios. The CO stream was further
purified by passage through a coil of Teflon tubing immersed in a
liquid nitrogen cold trap, to remove traces of metal carbonyls
and residual CO2.
2.2. Differential kinetics
Kinetics measurements were made in a Hiden CATLAB fixed-
bed tubular quartz microreactor (18.50  0.48 cm i.d.) located in
a tubular furnace with temperature control between ambient
temperature and 1100 C. The catalyst (520 mg) and inert BN
(Aldrich) were sieved separately to either 3060 mesh (0.25
0.60 mm) or 80100 mesh (0.150.18 mm), then mixed in a 1:3
w/w ratio, and loaded into the reactor to give a bed length of ca.
1.0 cm, held in place with plugs of quartz wool. The temperature
was monitored by a K-type thermocouple touching the catalyst
bed. The reactant gas composition was controlled by varying the
flow rates of CO, O2, and Ar, while the total flow rate remained con-
stant at 50 mL/min. The amount of catalyst in the reactor was cho-
sen so that the reaction conditions were always differential, with
conversions usually well below 1% of the limiting reagent. The
operating pressure was 1 atm, and the pressure drop (<0.03 atm)
was neglected.
Product compositions were monitored with an online quadru-
pole mass spectrometer (HR-20, Hiden Analytical). The electron
energy and emission current were set to 70.0 eV and 250 lA,
respectively. A secondary electron multiplier (SEM) detector was
used to monitor the MS signal at m/z = 44 CO
2 , 32 O
2  and 28
(CO+). The outlet concentration of CO2 (ppm) was calculated from
the signal at m/z = 44, using a premixed calibration gas containing
1000 ppm CO2 balanced by N2. Similarly, the outlet concentration
of O2 was calculated from the signal at m/z = 32, using a premixed
calibration gas containing 4780 ppm O2 balanced by Ar. Since CO
and CO2 have a common ion at m/z = 28 (CO+), the CO signal was
corrected for the contribution from the ionization of CO2. The out-
let concentration of CO was calculated from the remaining signal at
m/z = 28, using a premixed calibration gas containing 1050 ppm CO
balanced by He.
Prior to measuring rates, each catalyst sample was exposed to a
standard pretreatment involving flowing 1000 ppm CO/10% O2 at
423 K for 1 h to ensure complete incorporation of Pd into the
perovskite host as Pd(II). After the feed gas composition was chan-
ged and the MS signal had been stable for at least 20 min, the con-
version X was calculated from the inlet and outlet concentrations
of the limiting reagent, assuming 100% mass balance. Reaction
rates were obtained from measured values of X, according to the
equation rate = X  F/W, where F is the molar flow rate of CO
(mol/s) and W is the catalyst weight (g). Turnover frequencies
(TOF) were calculated by estimating the number of surface Pd(II)
sites; for details see Supplementary material. The uncertainties in
the activation energies were estimated using error propagation,

where rEa is the calculated uncertainty in the activation energy; rT
and rk are the measurement errors in the temperatures T and the
rate constants k, respectively, and DT and D(ln k) are the ranges
of temperature and ln k used in the Arrhenius plot.
2.3. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
BaCe0.93Pd0.07O2.93 powder (ca. 200 mg) was packed in air into a
slotted polycarbonate sample holder (slot size 24  8  0.8 mm),
without dilution. The slot was sealed on each side with Kapton film
(0.50 mm, Chemplex). The X-ray absorption experiment was per-
formed at the Pd K-edge (24,350 keV) on beamline BL2-3 (Bend)
at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). X-rays
were monochromatized via reflection from a pair of Si(220) crys-
tals, u = 90, through a 2  12-mm entrance slit.
The beam was detuned by 25% to remove higher harmonics. Its
intensity was measured with a N2-filled ionization chamber. Trans-
mitted X-rays were detected in a second, Ar-filled ionization cham-
ber, then passed through a Pd foil (for energy calibration) into a
third, Ar-filled ionization chamber. Fluorescence from the sample
was recorded simultaneously using a germanium 13-element
detector equipped with a Soller slit. The spectrum was recorded
using a 0.35 eV step size in the pre-edge region and up to 30 eV
after the edge. In the post-edge (EXAFS) region, a step size of
0.05 Å1 was used in order to generate equally spaced data points
in k-space. The spectrum was acquired in six scans over 3 h at
room temperature. Serially acquired spectra were compared and
found to be identical in initial and subsequent sweeps, verifying
that no sample decomposition occurred during data collection.
Data were acquired using the SSRL MicroEXAFS Data Collector
1.0. Data processing, analysis, and plotting were carried out using
IFEFFIT 1.2.10 [57]. The EXAFS spectrum was generated from the
average of six ASCII files. The spectrum was background-corrected
and normalized by first subtracting a linear fit to the pre-edge re-
gion extrapolated the length of the entire spectrum, then dividing
by a third-degree polynomial fitted to the post-edge region. The
84

v(k) data were k3-weighted and fitted by a polynomial spline with
six knots between 2.0 and 16.0 Å1. This k-weighting was chosen
because it generates a uniform v amplitude across the range of
usable data [58]. Subtraction of the spline decreases contributions
from low-frequency atomic X-ray absorption fine structure (AX-
AFS) [59]. A Bessel window was applied to the data range before
Fourier-transformation to R-space.
Curve fitting was performed in R-space on the k3-weighted data.
FEFF6 was used to calculate theoretical values for the bond dis-
tances R, based on the computed structure. Refinements were per-
formed
by
non-linear least-squares fitting
of
the
structural
parameters Ri and r2
i , using Artemis [60]. Coordination numbers
(N) were held fixed at integer values. The energy shift (DE0) was
constrained to be the same for all scatterers. The amplitude reduc-
tion factor S2
0 was obtained by curve fitting the EXAFS of fcc-Pd to
its published crystal structure [61] and was then fixed as a global
parameter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. CO oxidation activity of the crystalline perovskite catalyst
The extremely low surface area of Pd-substituted BaCeO3 (ca.
1 m2/g) is, surprisingly, not incompatible with high activity for
CO
oxidation.
Previously,
we
reported
that
BaCe0.9Pd0.1O2.9
(3.3 wt.% Pd) and a conventional high surface area Pd/c-Al2O3 cat-
alyst (2.0 wt.% Pd) showed very similar light-off behavior in CO
oxidation under lean conditions, with T50 values of 83 and 85 C,
respectively [55]. The turnover frequency (TOF) is therefore in-
ferred to be much higher for the perovskite than for dispersed
Pd/Al2O3, since the fraction of Pd at the surface of the former is nec-
essarily much lower.
In this work, turnover frequencies (TOF) were compared under
near-stoichiometric reaction conditions (4.4 Torr CO, 2.3 Torr O2,
450 K). A TOF of 0.013 s1 was reported for 0.1 wt.% Pd/c-Al2O3,
where the authors assumed 100% dispersion of the Pd because of
the very low loading [62]. The TOF for Pd-substituted BaCeO3 is
estimated to be 0.15 s1 under the same reaction conditions, based
on the number of Pd(II) sites exposed on the perovskite surface
(0.037 lmol for a 30 mg catalyst sample, see Supplementary mate-
rial). The higher reactivity therefore compensates for the lower
surface area of the perovskite catalyst. The mechanistic origin of
the reactivity difference was investigated by exploring the rate
laws for CO oxidation over Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 under CO-lean, CO-rich,
and near-stoichiometric reaction conditions.
3.2. Kinetics of CO oxidation over BaCe0.9Pd0.1O2.9
Conventional supported noble metal catalysts show strong CO
inhibition during the oxidation of CO. This well-known phenome-
non is caused by CO poisoning of the exposed metal surface, which
prevents adsorption of O2 and thereby suppresses the formation of
adsorbed atomic oxygen required by the LangmuirHinshelwood
mechanism. The oxidation of CO over Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 under CO-lean
conditions is similarly first-order in O2 and negative first-order in
CO, Fig. 1. Diffusion limitations were assessed according to the
Koros-Nowak criteria [63]. External diffusion was investigated by
simultaneously doubling both the volumetric flow rate and the
amount of catalyst. No external diffusion limitations were discern-
able under differential reaction conditions, Fig. 1a. No internal
diffusion limitations were expected for Ba(Ce,Pd)O3, since it is
non-porous; consistent with this expectation, there was no effect
of varying the grain size (3060 mesh or 80100 mesh).
Under CO-rich conditions, the P(CO)-dependence of the rate is
quite
different.
At
constant
P(O2) = 3.8 Torr
and
1 6 P(CO)/
P(O2) 6 10, the reaction order m in P(CO) is 0.41; as P(CO)/P(O2)
increases, the reaction order changes to 0.00, Fig. 2. The P(CO)-
dependence of the CO oxidation rate over 2.0 wt.% Pd/c-Al2O3 is
also shown for comparison. Under the same conditions, its reaction
order m is 0.84 for 3.8 6 P(CO) 6 182 Torr, in agreement with a
report of negative first-order P(CO) dependence over a similar cat-
alyst [64]. The higher reaction orders for Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 imply a
weaker poisoning effect of CO. A similar result was reported for
CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2, whose reaction order m increased from
ca. 1 at low P(CO) to zero at high P(CO) [65]. A CeO2-mediated
reaction mechanism was inferred to dominate under the latter
conditions. As a result of the lability of its lattice oxygen, CeO2
supplies atomic oxygen for the oxidation of CO [27,65], and the
resulting vacancies provide additional sites for the activation of
O2(g) [66].

Our previous study [55] demonstrated that the OSC of undoped
BaCeO3 is mediocre, but is significantly enhanced when Pd cations
are present. No enhancement is observed in the presence of Pd(0).
Neutron diffraction studies revealed that oxygen vacancies are cre-
ated to maintain charge balance when Pd(II) cations occupy B-sites
of the perovskite lattice, replacing Ce(IV) [54]. The abundance of
these vacancies in such complex metal oxides correlates with their
fast oxygen mobility [67]. At 423 K and P(CO)/P(O2) = 10, the in-
crease in the apparent order of the reaction in CO from 0.41 to zero
suggests a contribution from, and the eventual dominance of, a
Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. BaCeO3 plays a role similar to that
of CeO2 itself, whereby CO and O2 are no longer required to compete
for the same adsorption sites. At lower P(CO)/P(O2), the behavior is
intermediate between negative first-order and zero-order in CO
(although the non-integer value of m does not have a simple physical
meaning under these conditions  see below).
The apparent reaction order n for O2 under CO-rich conditions
varies with P(CO), Fig. 3. For P(CO) = 3.2 Torr, n is close to 1;
when P(CO) increases to 15.2 Torr, n decreases to 0.49 (similar
to Pd/CeO2, for which n = 0.44 was reported under CO-rich condi-
tions [65]). However, the value of n continues to decrease, until it
is close to zero at P(CO) = 91.2 Torr. The changing apparent reac-
tion order for O2 confirms that there is another source of atomic
oxygen to convert CO into CO2, viz., the lattice oxygen of Ba(Ce,P-
d)O3. Its participation in the reaction depends on the P(CO)/P(O2)
ratio, accounting for virtually all of the conversion at high P(CO)/
P(O2).
3.3. Rate laws under limiting conditions
For a given set of reaction conditions, the empirical rate law for
CO oxidation over Pd-substituted BaCeO3 can be described with
the simple power form shown in Eq. (2):
rate  kobsPCOmPO2n
2
where m and n are the apparent reaction orders with respect to CO
and O2, respectively. The kinetics described above show that under
CO-lean conditions, only the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism
contributes, hence m = 1 and n = +1. Only the BaCeO3-mediated
Marsvan Krevelen mechanism contributes under very CO-rich con-
ditions, with m = n = 0. Both mechanisms contribute to the overall
reaction under slightly CO-rich conditions (1 6 P(CO)/P(O2) 6 10).
In this near-stoichiometric regime, we expect the apparent values
of m and n to vary with P(CO)/P(O2).
The elementary steps for the standard LangmuirHinshelwood
(LH) mechanism are as follows:
[1] CO(g) +   CO(ad)
K1
[2] O2(g) +  ? O2(ad)
k2
[3] O2(ad) +  ? 2O(ad)
[4] CO(ad) + O(ad) ? CO2(ad) + 
[5] CO2(ad)  CO2(g) + 
where  is a vacant active site (assumed to be a surface Pd site), K1
is the equilibrium constant for reversible adsorption of CO on this
site, and k2 is the rate coefficient for the non-dissociative adsorp-
tion of O2 on this site. The desorption of O2 and the recombination
of atomic oxygen are assumed to be kinetically insignificant. If step
[2] is rate-determining, the rate law for the formation of CO2
becomes that shown in Eq. (3) [68,69]:
rateLH 
2k2PO2
1  K1PCO  2k2PO2
K1PCO
3
where the rate is usually measured per unit weight of catalyst, since
the number of active sites is not accurately known. Assuming K1
P(CO)  1, this equation is consistent with the reaction orders ob-
served under CO-lean conditions. (The observed inverse first-order
dependence on P(CO) requires that the rate-limiting O2 adsorption
be molecular. A similar conclusion has been reached by others
[64,65,69].) However, we note (as have others) [7072] that the ob-
served kinetics do not exclude an EleyRideal mechanism involving
the reaction of CO(g) with adsorbed oxygen, which gives rise to the
same rate law since the surface reaction (step [4]) is not rate-deter-
mining. The LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism thus corresponds

to the suprafacial reaction regime (involving adsorbed oxygen) of
perovskite-catalyzed oxidations [73].
Under very CO-rich conditions, the reaction orders m and n are
both zero, which might suggest that the rate is determined by
desorption of CO2 (step [5]). This was ruled out by the negligible
effect on CO conversion of CO2 (400 ppm) added to the feed (and
further confirming that surface BaCO3, if present, does not inhibit
the reaction). Alternately, the rate-limiting step may involve inter-
mediates whose concentrations are independent of each other (i.e.,
they are formed by adsorption on different active sites) and con-
stant (i.e., the active sites are saturated). We propose the following
steps corresponding to an intrafacial [73], BaCeO3-mediated (BC)
oxidation mechanism:
[20] O2(g) + s ? OL + O(ad)
[40] CO(ad) + OL ? CO2(ad) + s
k40
where s is an oxygen vacancy in the perovskite surface. According
to this mechanism, Pd2+ ions in the BaCeO3 host still serve to
adsorb CO(g), step [1]. Step [20] is analogous to the activation of
O2 over transition metal-doped CeO2 [31], involving vacancy filling
by molecular O2 and the formation of active oxygen adspecies.
However, unlike for Pd/CeO2 [65], step [20] cannot be rate-limiting,
since the reaction order n varies with P(CO)/P(O2). It is possible
that O2 adsorbs molecularly on BaCeO3, prior to its dissociation
[74]; however, this step is not kinetically observable. The O(ad)
species are expected to be highly mobile and to react rapidly with
CO(ad) according to step [4].
We note that regeneration of the vacancy (s) requires the re-
moval of lattice oxygen in step [40]. This appears to be rate-deter-
mining, since the resulting rate law is consistent with the absence
of any partial pressure dependence, Eq. (4):
rateBC  2k40hCOhOL  2k40
4
Both h(CO), the coverage of CO on accessible, surface Pd sites, and
h(OL), the fraction of occupied lattice oxygen sites available for reac-
tion, are essentially unity. The lattice oxygen that participates in the
reaction is presumably limited to specific oxygen ions located adja-
cent to surface Pd sites, but this is not shown explicitly in Eq. (3)
since their quantity is not known.
3.4. Rate law under near-stoichiometric reaction conditions
When CO is in slight excess (1 6 P(CO)/P(O2) 6 10), the ob-
served reaction orders are intermediate between those for the
LangmuirHinshelwood and BaCeO3-mediated mechanisms (e.g.,
m = 0.41 and n = 0.49 at 423 K). Under these conditions, the over-
all rate law includes contributions from both mechanisms, Eq. (5):
rate  rateLH  rateBC  2k2PO2
K1PCO  2k40
5
The same Pd(II) sites serve to adsorb CO in both mechanisms, but
the O2 adsorption sites differ (they are Pd(II) and CeO2 vacancies
for the LH and BC terms, respectively). This relationship illustrates
why physically meaningful reaction orders cannot be assigned for
either CO or O2 under near-stoichiometric reaction conditions, a
point also made by Nibbelke et al. for CO oxidation over Pt/Rh/
CeO2/c-Al2O3 [69]. The non-linear curvefits of this expression to
the observed rates are shown in Fig. 4. The temperature-dependent
fitted values for k2/K1 and k40 are given in Table 1.
3.5. Temperature effects
Under CO-lean conditions at fixed P(O2) = 76 Torr, the value of
the apparent reaction order m is 1.0 at 373, 423, and 473 K,
Fig. 5a. Thus, the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism dominates
over the entire temperature range under these conditions. Under

CO-rich conditions, at fixed P(O2) = 3.8 Torr and P(CO)/P(O2) > 10,
there is no P(CO) dependence of the rate from 423 to 523 K, con-
firming that the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism dominates under
these conditions, Fig. 5b. However, for 1 6 P(CO)/P(O2) 6 10, the
apparent value of m decreases as the temperature increases, from
0.41 at 423 K to 0.32 at 523 K. This trend implies that the con-
tribution of the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism increases with tem-
perature when the feed is close to stoichiometric.
Arrhenius plots for the two limiting reactivity regimes are
shown in Fig. 6a. For CO-lean conditions, the activation energy
for the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism was obtained directly,
Ea,LH = (7.8  0.3) kcal/mol. The activation energy for the BaCeO3-
mediated mechanism, Ea,BC, from the temperature dependence of
the rate under CO-rich conditions, is (9.7  0.3) kcal/mol. As ex-
pected, the apparent activation energy when the reaction condi-
tions are near-stoichiometric, (8.6  0.3) kcal/mol, is intermediate.
Although the corresponding Arrhenius plot appears linear (not
shown), the fractional contribution of each mechanism, and conse-
quently the apparent activation energy, is temperature-dependent.
The approximately linear Arrhenius behavior is due to the similar-
ity of Ea,LH and Ea,BC.
Arrhenius plots for near-stoichiometric conditions can also be
constructed using the temperature-dependent kinetic parameters,
k2/K1 (for LH) and k40 (for BC). The results are shown in Fig. 6b. The
resulting
activation
energies,
E0
a;BC = (9.7  0.5) kcal/mol
and
E0
a;LH = (8.5  0.5) kcal/mol, agree with those measured under limit-
ing reaction conditions within the stated errors.
The apparent activation energy for CO oxidation by the Lang-
muirHinshelwood
mechanism
over
Pd-substituted
BaCeO3,
(7.8  0.3) kcal/mol, is much lower than that reported for CO oxida-
tion over Pd/Al2O3 (32 kcal/mol) [65]. In both cases, the barrier
Ea,LH comprises both the barrier for O2 adsorption (Ea,[2]) and the
CO desorption energy DE[1], approximated as Eq. (6)
Ea;LH  Ea;2  DE1
6
where for simplicity, the coverage dependence of the desorption en-
ergy has been neglected. For metallic catalysts, the second term
dominates and the activation energy is close to the CO desorption
energy. The heat of adsorption of CO on Pd(0) (both as single crys-
tals and supported nanoparticles) varies from 22 to 37 kcal/mol,
depending on the adsorption site and the CO coverage [75]. The
binding energy for CO on Pd(II) (e.g., surface sites in BaCe0.9P-
d0.1O2.9) may be much lower, due to reduced p-back-donation from
the highly ionic metal site [76,77]. The large difference in Ea,LH for
these two catalysts, despite identical rate laws, is consistent with
the active sites on the surface of BaCe0.9Pd0.1O2.9 under CO-lean
conditions being Pd(II) rather than Pd(0). The much smaller value
of Ea,LH for BaCe0.9Pd0.1O2.9 implies that it is dominated by the first
term in Eq (6).
The addition of ceria to Pd/Al2O3 was reported to result in a
large decrease in the activation barrier for CO oxidation, from 26
to 13 kcal/mol at high P(CO) [65]. In contrast, the activation barrier
for the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism described here is slightly
higher than the barrier for the LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism
over Pd-substituted BaCeO3. However, at 9.7 kcal/mol, the barrier
for the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism is still lower than the barrier
for the CeO2-mediated mechanism. This may be related to differ-
ences in their rate laws (see above). Since Ea,BC is the barrier for
the elementary step [40], it is interesting to compare it to the oxy-
gen migration barrier in undoped BaCeO3, 20 kcal/mol [78]. Substi-
tution of a dopant such as Pd(II) into the perovskite creates
distortions in the lattice and introduces permanent oxygen vacan-
cies, both of which are expected to facilitate oxygen migration
[79,80].
3.6. Local structure of Pd(II) substituted into BaCeO3
Our kinetics results imply that the mechanism for BaCeO3-med-
iated oxidation involves the participation of lattice oxygen and the
transient creation of oxygen vacancies. Since the replacement of
Ce(IV) by Pd(II) also requires the formation of permanent oxygen
vacancies by removal of a corresponding number of O2 ions for
charge neutrality, we investigated the effect of the latter vacancies
on the local Pd environment using X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) at the Pd K-edge. The XANES region is shown for BaCe0.93P-

different from that of either Pd or PdO.
In order to extract detailed structural information, the EXAFS
was analyzed quantitatively. The signal quality is high; the EXAFS
region provides usable data up to 16 Å1 in k-space and from 1 to
5 Å in R-space, Fig. 8. Our FEFF model is based on the results of a
recent DFT study [55], which predicted PdO4 square-planes adja-
cent to tilted CeO5 square pyramids and intervening oxygen vacan-
cies, Fig. 9. The curvefit to this model is shown in Fig. 8, with fit
parameters given in Table 2. The nearest neighbors consist of a
shell of four oxygens at 2.02 Å corresponding to oxygen atoms di-
rectly bonded to Pd in square-planar PdO4. There is also a much
longer (weakly-bonded) Pd  O interaction at 2.72 Å.
In the region from 3.0 to 4.5 Å, we expect eight inequivalent Pd
Ba paths and six inequivalent PdCe paths. These were not refined
independently, due to the large number of parameters required,
but were grouped into a smaller number of similar paths. In partic-
ular, tilting of the CeO5 square pyramid to accommodate square-
planar Pd(II) generates three types of PdCe paths: four in the
PdO4 plane, one perpendicular to the PdO4 plane across the oxygen
vacancy, and one perpendicular to the PdO4 plane across the long
Pd  O path. In addition, there are several linear (focused) multi-
ple-scattering paths. PdO1Ce1, PdO2Ce2, and PdO1Ce1
O1 were all predicted to have significant intensity by FEFF and
were included in the fit. There is no PdOCe3 path because of
the oxygen vacancy. The triple-scattering PdO2Ce2O2 path
was neglected because of its very low FEFF-predicted amplitude.
Fig. 8 shows the agreement between the EXAFS data and the
curvefit. All features between 1 and 5 Å in R-space are adequately

reproduced, with fit parameters that are reasonable, Table 2. The
only r2 value that is rather too large is associated with the Pd
Ba1 path; it includes PdBa distances from 3.6 to 3.8 Å in the
DFT model. In contrast, the fit to a model containing octahedral
Pd(IV) sites is poor especially in the first coordination sphere (see
Fig. S2 in Supplementary material). Consequently, the EXAFS sup-
ports the computational prediction of square-planar Pd(II) ions
with adjacent oxygen vacancies in the bulk.
3.7. Proposed surface structure
On the surface of the Pd-substituted perovskite, the vacancy
may be manifested as an open axial coordination site, available
for binding reactants, above the PdO4 plane. This is shown in
Fig. 10. Such sites could be created by simple truncation of the bulk
structure, although it is also possible that the surface reconstructs
[81,82]. In the presence of excess O2, the oxygen lattice sites are
fully populated at the surface, therefore O2 must compete with
CO to bind at the Pd(II) sites. Under CO-rich conditions, the redox
flexibility of the Ce4+/Ce3+ couple allows the removal of lattice oxy-
gen to create additional oxygen vacancies at the surface. Oxygen
adsorption should occur readily at such vacancies, avoiding com-
petition with CO adsorption and forming mobile oxygen adspecies
that rapidly oxidize chemisorbed CO. Surface oxygen vacancies
may also be filled by oxygen from the bulk, whose mobility is facil-
itated by the permanent oxygen vacancies created by the substitu-
tion of Pd(II) on the Ce(IV) sites. This should allow for the
participation of a large fraction of the lattice oxygen in the surface
reaction.
4. Conclusions
Despite its low surface area and lack of porosity, crystalline
Ba(Ce,Pd)O3 is competent for CO oxidation in both lean and rich
reaction conditions. However, the mechanism of CO oxidation
changes as a function of P(CO)/P(O2). Strong CO inhibition in the
presence of excess O2, when the oxygen sublattice of the BaCeO3
surface is highly occupied, demonstrates that CO and O2 compete
for
the
same
adsorption
sites,
which
are
assumed
to

Pd(II)
cations.
The
lower
activation
energy
of
the
LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism for Pd-doped BaCeO3 relative
to Pd/c-Al2O3 is ascribed to the lower CO binding energy on Pd(II)
compared to Pd(0). When CO is present in excess, oxygen vacancies
are created in the BaCeO3 surface, allowing O2 activation to occur
independent of CO adsorption. At high P(CO)/P(O2), this BaCeO3-
mediated mechanism dominates the kinetics. Under near-stoichi-
ometric
reaction
conditions,
both
mechanisms
contribute
significantly. Since the activation barrier for the BaCeO3-mediated
mechanism is slightly higher than for the LangmuirHinshelwood
mechanism, its contribution increases with temperature.
The similarity of the BaCeO3-mediated mechanism to a previ-
ously reported CeO2-mediated mechanism leads us to propose that
the perovskite be considered a BaO-stabilized form of CeO2. Pd(II)
cations are present in the bulk of the BaCeO3 host as PdO4 square-
planes, separated from an adjacent, tilted CeO5 square pyramid by
an oxygen vacancy. The abundance of these oxygen vacancies
probably enhances oxygen mobility in the perovskite. High oxygen
mobility compensates for the low number of surface adsorption
sites. The high thermal stability of the perovskite is potentially
advantageous because of the demanding thermal transients expe-
rienced by automotive emissions catalysts. The three-way activity
and
sulfur
tolerance
of
Pd-substituted
BaCeO3
are
under
investigation.
