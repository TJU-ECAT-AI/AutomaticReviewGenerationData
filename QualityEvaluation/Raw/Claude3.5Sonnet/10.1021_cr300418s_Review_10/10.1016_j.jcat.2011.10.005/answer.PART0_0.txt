[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[2] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[4] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[5] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Redox properties: Niobium oxides alter the redox properties of NiO nanooxides, which affects their activity in low-temperature ethane ODH.

2. Crystallite size limitation: The presence of niobium-rich phases helps limit the size of NiO crystallites, potentially increasing the catalyst's surface area.

3. Reducibility inhibition: Niobium oxides inhibit the reducibility of NiO, which can affect the catalyst's performance.

4. Selectivity enhancement: At higher Nb content (>5 at.%), the composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This is likely due to the Nb-rich phase covering some of the unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species on NiO.

5. Formation of mixed oxide layers: At Nb contents above 3 at.%, an amorphous thin layer (1-2 nm) of niobium-rich mixed oxide forms, with a structure similar to NiNb2O6.

6. Catalyst deactivation: At high Nb loadings, the close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, along with possible restructuring under ODH conditions, can lead to significant catalyst deactivation.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. Complex interactions: The interplay between NiO and niobium oxides creates complex nanocomposite structures that are difficult to predict theoretically.

2. Dynamic behavior: The potential restructuring of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions adds another layer of complexity to the system.

3. Multiple effects: Niobium oxides simultaneously affect crystallite size, reducibility, and active site coverage, making it challenging to isolate individual effects.

4. Concentration-dependent behavior: The impact of niobium oxides varies with their concentration, requiring a nuanced understanding of the system across different compositions.

These factors make it difficult to develop comprehensive theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of these complex catalytic systems, necessitating extensive experimental validation and refinement of theoretical approaches.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的影响表现在以下几个方面：

1. 氧化还原性质：铌氧化物改变了NiO纳米氧化物的氧化还原性质，这影响了它们在低温乙烷ODH反应中的活性。

2. 晶粒尺寸限制：富铌相的存在有助于限制NiO晶粒的尺寸，可能增加催化剂的比表面积。

3. 抑制还原性：铌氧化物抑制NiO的还原性，这可能影响催化剂的性能。

4. 提高选择性：在较高的Nb含量（>5原子%）下，复合物的活性降低但对乙烷ODH的选择性提高。这可能是由于富铌相覆盖了NiO上一些非选择性的、非化学计量的活性氧物种。

5. 形成混合氧化物层：当Nb含量超过3原子%时，会形成一层结构类似于NiNb2O6的非晶态富铌混合氧化物薄层（1-2 nm）。

6. 催化剂失活：在高Nb负载量下，NiO与富铌混合氧化物层之间的紧密相互作用，以及在ODH条件下可能发生的重构，可能导致显著的催化剂失活。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 复杂相互作用：NiO和铌氧化物之间的相互作用形成复杂的纳米复合结构，这在理论上难以预测。

2. 动态行为：纳米复合物在ODH条件下可能发生重构，这为系统增加了另一层复杂性。

3. 多重效应：铌氧化物同时影响晶粒尺寸、还原性和活性位点覆盖，使得难以分离单个效应。

4. 浓度依赖行为：铌氧化物的影响随其浓度而变化，需要对不同组成的系统有深入的理解。

这些因素使得开发能准确预测这些复杂催化系统行为的综合理论模型变得困难，需要进行广泛的实验验证和理论方法的改进。
