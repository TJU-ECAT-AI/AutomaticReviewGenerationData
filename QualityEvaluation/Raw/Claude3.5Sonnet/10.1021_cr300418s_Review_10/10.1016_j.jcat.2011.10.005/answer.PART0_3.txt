[1] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[2] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[3] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[4] "Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the diffractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented. This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture."

[5] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium has been found to be the most effective dopant among various elements for improving NiO catalysts.

2. Niobium affects the oxygen species in the catalyst. It reduces active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective oxygen species in the bulk and increases selective oxygen species on the surface.

3. The presence of niobium creates an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) that covers part of the NiO crystallite surface, reducing the number of active but non-selective sites.

4. Niobium prevents the formation of metallic Ni during the catalyst preparation process, which is likely due to the change in the metal to citric acid ratio in the synthesis mixture.

5. XPS studies show a close interaction between Nb and Ni atoms in the catalyst structure, indicating the formation of a mixed oxide phase.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complexity of the catalyst system. While theoretical models often assume uniform doping of Nb into the NiO structure, experimental evidence suggests that the reality is more complex, involving the formation of separate Nb-rich phases and surface coverage effects. This discrepancy makes it difficult to directly correlate theoretical predictions based on simple doping models with the observed catalytic behavior.

Additionally, the limited structural doping of Nb into NiO (only a few percent) and the presence of amorphous phases complicate the characterization of these catalysts, making it challenging to precisely determine the local structure and distribution of Nb within the catalyst. This uncertainty in the catalyst's exact composition and structure further complicates the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

铌氧化物的多样性质在几个方面显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为：

1. 在各种元素中，铌被发现是改善NiO催化剂最有效的掺杂剂。

2. 铌影响催化剂中的氧物种。它通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点，这增强了非选择性氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了表面上选择性氧物种的数量。

3. 铌的存在创造了一个非晶态的富铌氧化物相（Nb2O5，NiNb2O6），覆盖了部分NiO晶粒表面，减少了活性但非选择性位点的数量。

4. 在催化剂制备过程中，铌防止了金属Ni的形成，这可能是由于合成混合物中金属与柠檬酸比例的变化。

5. XPS研究显示催化剂结构中Nb和Ni原子之间存在密切相互作用，表明形成了混合氧化物相。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的主要挑战在于催化剂系统的复杂性。理论模型通常假设Nb均匀掺杂到NiO结构中，但实验证据表明实际情况更为复杂，涉及单独富铌相的形成和表面覆盖效应。这种差异使得难以直接将基于简单掺杂模型的理论预测与观察到的催化行为相关联。

此外，Nb在NiO中有限的结构掺杂（只有几个百分点）和非晶相的存在使这些催化剂的表征变得复杂，难以精确确定催化剂中Nb的局部结构和分布。这种对催化剂确切组成和结构的不确定性进一步复杂化了理论预测和实验结果之间的比较。
