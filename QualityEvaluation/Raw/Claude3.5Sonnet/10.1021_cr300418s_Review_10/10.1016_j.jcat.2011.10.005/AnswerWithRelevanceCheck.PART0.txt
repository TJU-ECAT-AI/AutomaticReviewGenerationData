          [1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[2] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[4] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[5] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

[6] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[7] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[8] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[9] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

[10] "This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Redox properties: Niobium oxides alter the redox properties of NiO nanooxides, affecting their activity in low-temperature ethane ODH.

2. Crystallite size limitation: The presence of niobium-rich phases helps limit the size of NiO crystallites, potentially increasing the catalyst's surface area.

3. Reducibility inhibition: Niobium oxides inhibit the reducibility of NiO, affecting the catalyst's performance.

4. Selectivity enhancement: At higher Nb content (>5 at.%), the composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This is likely due to the Nb-rich phase covering some of the unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species on NiO.

5. Formation of mixed oxide layers: At Nb contents above 3 at.%, an amorphous thin layer (1-2 nm) of niobium-rich mixed oxide forms, with a structure similar to NiNb2O6.

6. Oxygen species modification: Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies, enhancing the diffusion of unselective oxygen species in the bulk and increasing selective oxygen species on the surface.

7. Limited structural doping: The occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, with the formation of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of the NiO crystallite surface.

8. Close interaction between Nb and Ni: XPS studies indicate a shift in binding energy for Nb, suggesting a close interaction between Nb and Ni atoms in the catalyst structure.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. Complex interactions: The interplay between NiO and niobium oxides creates complex nanocomposite structures that are difficult to predict theoretically.

2. Dynamic behavior: The potential restructuring of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions adds another layer of complexity to the system.

3. Multiple effects: Niobium oxides simultaneously affect crystallite size, reducibility, and active site coverage, making it challenging to isolate individual effects.

4. Concentration-dependent behavior: The impact of niobium oxides varies with their concentration, requiring a nuanced understanding of the system across different compositions.

5. Presence of amorphous phases: The formation of amorphous Nb-rich phases complicates structural analysis and modeling.

6. Limited structural doping: The restricted extent of Nb incorporation into the NiO structure challenges simple doping models.

These factors make it difficult to develop comprehensive theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of these complex catalytic systems, necessitating extensive experimental validation and refinement of theoretical approaches.

          铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的影响表现在以下几个方面：

1. 氧化还原性质：铌氧化物改变了NiO纳米氧化物的氧化还原性质，这影响了它们在低温乙烷ODH反应中的活性。

2. 晶粒尺寸限制：富铌相的存在有助于限制NiO晶粒的尺寸，可能增加催化剂的比表面积。

3. 抑制还原性：铌氧化物抑制NiO的还原性，这可能影响催化剂的性能。

4. 提高选择性：在较高的Nb含量（>5原子%）下，复合物的活性降低但对乙烷ODH的选择性提高。这可能是由于富铌相覆盖了NiO上一些非选择性的、非化学计量的活性氧物种。

5. 形成混合氧化物层：当Nb含量超过3原子%时，会形成一层结构类似于NiNb2O6的非晶态富铌混合氧化物薄层（1-2 nm）。

6. 氧物种修饰：铌通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点，增强了非选择性氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了表面上选择性氧物种的数量。

7. 有限的结构掺杂：结构掺杂仅限于几个百分点的Nb，同时形成覆盖部分NiO晶粒表面的非晶态富铌氧化物相（Nb2O5，NiNb2O6）。

8. Nb和Ni之间的密切相互作用：XPS研究显示Nb的结合能发生偏移，表明催化剂结构中Nb和Ni原子之间存在密切相互作用。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 复杂相互作用：NiO和铌氧化物之间的相互作用形成复杂的纳米复合结构，这在理论上难以预测。

2. 动态行为：纳米复合物在ODH条件下可能发生重构，这为系统增加了另一层复杂性。

3. 多重效应：铌氧化物同时影响晶粒尺寸、还原性和活性位点覆盖，使得难以分离单个效应。

4. 浓度依赖行为：铌氧化物的影响随其浓度而变化，需要对不同组成的系统有深入的理解。

5. 非晶相的存在：富铌非晶相的形成使结构分析和建模变得复杂。

6. 有限的结构掺杂：Nb在NiO结构中的有限掺入对简单掺杂模型提出了挑战。

这些因素使得开发能准确预测这些复杂催化系统行为的综合理论模型变得困难，需要进行广泛的实验验证和理论方法的改进。
