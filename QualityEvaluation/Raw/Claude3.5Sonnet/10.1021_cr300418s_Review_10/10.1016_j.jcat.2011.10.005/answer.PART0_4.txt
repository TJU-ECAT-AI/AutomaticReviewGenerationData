[1] "Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the diffractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented."

[2] "This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component upon TGA in air (at about 450 C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20Ni0.80O instead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4)."

[3] "It also suggests that the presence of Nb in the Nicitrate gel hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate. This can possibly be due to a kind of geometric effect: the Nb atoms located near the nickel atoms would increase the distance between the citrate component and the nickel atoms and thus act as a kind of barrier."

[4] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

[5] "This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium prevents the formation of metallic Ni during calcination of the NbNi-citrate gel. This is likely due to the higher metal-to-citric acid ratio when NbCl5 is added to the synthetic mixture.

2. The presence of Nb hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate, possibly through a geometric effect where Nb atoms increase the distance between citrate and Ni atoms, acting as a barrier.

3. XPS studies show a shift in the binding energy of Nb 3d core levels, indicating a close interaction between Nb and Ni. This supports the formation of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6.

4. The addition of Nb leads to the formation of a Nb-rich amorphous phase, which affects the overall structure and surface properties of the catalyst.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. The complex nature of the mixed oxide phases formed, which can be difficult to characterize precisely.

2. The presence of amorphous phases alongside crystalline structures, complicating structural analysis.

3. The interplay between geometric and electronic effects of Nb doping on the NiO catalyst, which may not be easily separable or predictable.

4. The potential for dynamic changes in the catalyst structure under reaction conditions, which may not be captured by ex-situ characterization techniques.

These factors make it challenging to develop accurate theoretical models that fully account for the observed catalytic behavior and structural characteristics of Nb-doped NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

铌氧化物的多样性质在作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢反应时，以多种方式显著影响其行为：

1. 铌防止了NbNi-柠檬酸凝胶在焙烧过程中金属Ni的形成。这可能是由于在合成混合物中添加NbCl5时，金属与柠檬酸的比例升高所致。

2. 铌的存在阻碍了柠檬酸对Ni的还原，可能是通过一种几何效应，即铌原子增加了柠檬酸和镍原子之间的距离，起到屏障作用。

3. XPS研究显示Nb 3d核能级的结合能发生了偏移，表明Nb和Ni之间存在密切相互作用。这支持了形成非晶态NiNb混合氧化物相（如NiNb2O6）的观点。

4. 铌的添加导致了富铌非晶相的形成，这影响了催化剂的整体结构和表面性质。

在调和理论预测与实验观察时遇到的挑战包括：

1. 形成的混合氧化物相性质复杂，难以精确表征。

2. 非晶相与晶态结构并存，使结构分析变得复杂。

3. 铌掺杂对NiO催化剂的几何和电子效应之间的相互作用可能不易分离或预测。

4. 在反应条件下催化剂结构可能发生动态变化，这可能无法通过非原位表征技术捕捉到。

这些因素使得开发准确的理论模型来充分解释Nb掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中观察到的催化行为和结构特征变得具有挑战性。
