[1] "The diffraction patterns are slightly broadened and can be fitted with the bunsenite NiO phase with a lattice parameter of 4.179 ± 0.001 Å and a crystallite size of about 9–10 nm (Table 2), regardless of the Nb loading."

[2] "This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component upon TGA in air (at about 450 °C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20Ni0.80O instead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4)."

[3] "This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and surrounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c)."

[4] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by −0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Structural effects: Niobium doping does not significantly alter the lattice parameter of the NiO structure, suggesting limited bulk doping. Instead, niobium forms an amorphous phase that covers and surrounds NiO nanocrystals.

2. Oxidation state and interactions: XPS studies indicate that niobium is present in the +5 oxidation state, but with a binding energy shifted from that of pure Nb2O5. This suggests a close interaction between Nb and Ni atoms, likely in the form of a mixed oxide.

3. Catalyst synthesis: The presence of niobium affects the catalyst preparation process, influencing the decomposition of citrate precursors and preventing the formation of metallic nickel during calcination.

4. Surface area and morphology: Niobium doping leads to increased surface areas and smaller NiO crystallite sizes, potentially due to the formation of a dispersed amorphous Nb-rich phase.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. The complex nature of the catalyst structure, which includes both crystalline NiO and amorphous Nb-rich phases.

2. The difficulty in precisely determining the local structure and composition of the Nb-rich phase.

3. The potential for dynamic changes in the catalyst structure under reaction conditions.

4. The need to account for both geometric (site blocking) and electronic effects of niobium on the catalytic properties of NiO.

These complexities make it challenging to develop accurate theoretical models that can predict the behavior of these catalysts, necessitating a combination of advanced characterization techniques and in-situ studies to fully understand the role of niobium in these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 结构效应：铌掺杂并不显著改变NiO的晶格参数，这表明体相掺杂有限。相反，铌形成了一个覆盖和包围NiO纳米晶的无定形相。

2. 氧化态和相互作用：XPS研究表明铌以+5氧化态存在，但其结合能与纯Nb2O5相比发生了偏移。这表明Nb和Ni原子之间存在密切的相互作用，很可能以混合氧化物的形式存在。

3. 催化剂合成：铌的存在影响了催化剂的制备过程，影响柠檬酸盐前驱体的分解，并在焙烧过程中防止金属镍的形成。

4. 比表面积和形貌：铌掺杂导致比表面积增加和NiO晶粒尺寸减小，这可能是由于形成了分散的无定形富铌相。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 催化剂结构的复杂性，包括结晶NiO和无定形富铌相。

2. 精确确定富铌相的局部结构和组成的难度。

3. 在反应条件下催化剂结构可能发生动态变化。

4. 需要同时考虑铌对NiO催化性能的几何效应（位点阻断）和电子效应。

这些复杂性使得开发能够准确预测这些催化剂行为的理论模型变得具有挑战性，需要结合先进的表征技术和原位研究，以全面理解铌在这些催化体系中的作用。
