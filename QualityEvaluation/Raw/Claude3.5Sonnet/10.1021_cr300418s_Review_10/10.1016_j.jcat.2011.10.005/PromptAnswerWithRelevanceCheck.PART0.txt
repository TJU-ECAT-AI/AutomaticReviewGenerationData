[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[2] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[4] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[5] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Redox properties: Niobium oxides alter the redox properties of NiO nanooxides, which affects their activity in low-temperature ethane ODH.

2. Crystallite size limitation: The presence of niobium-rich phases helps limit the size of NiO crystallites, potentially increasing the catalyst's surface area.

3. Reducibility inhibition: Niobium oxides inhibit the reducibility of NiO, which can affect the catalyst's performance.

4. Selectivity enhancement: At higher Nb content (>5 at.%), the composites become less active but more selective for ethane ODH. This is likely due to the Nb-rich phase covering some of the unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species on NiO.

5. Formation of mixed oxide layers: At Nb contents above 3 at.%, an amorphous thin layer (1-2 nm) of niobium-rich mixed oxide forms, with a structure similar to NiNb2O6.

6. Catalyst deactivation: At high Nb loadings, the close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, along with possible restructuring under ODH conditions, can lead to significant catalyst deactivation.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. Complex interactions: The interplay between NiO and niobium oxides creates complex nanocomposite structures that are difficult to predict theoretically.

2. Dynamic behavior: The potential restructuring of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions adds another layer of complexity to the system.

3. Multiple effects: Niobium oxides simultaneously affect crystallite size, reducibility, and active site coverage, making it challenging to isolate individual effects.

4. Concentration-dependent behavior: The impact of niobium oxides varies with their concentration, requiring a nuanced understanding of the system across different compositions.

These factors make it difficult to develop comprehensive theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of these complex catalytic systems, necessitating extensive experimental validation and refinement of theoretical approaches.

铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的影响表现在以下几个方面：

1. 氧化还原性质：铌氧化物改变了NiO纳米氧化物的氧化还原性质，这影响了它们在低温乙烷ODH反应中的活性。

2. 晶粒尺寸限制：富铌相的存在有助于限制NiO晶粒的尺寸，可能增加催化剂的比表面积。

3. 抑制还原性：铌氧化物抑制NiO的还原性，这可能影响催化剂的性能。

4. 提高选择性：在较高的Nb含量（>5原子%）下，复合物的活性降低但对乙烷ODH的选择性提高。这可能是由于富铌相覆盖了NiO上一些非选择性的、非化学计量的活性氧物种。

5. 形成混合氧化物层：当Nb含量超过3原子%时，会形成一层结构类似于NiNb2O6的非晶态富铌混合氧化物薄层（1-2 nm）。

6. 催化剂失活：在高Nb负载量下，NiO与富铌混合氧化物层之间的紧密相互作用，以及在ODH条件下可能发生的重构，可能导致显著的催化剂失活。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 复杂相互作用：NiO和铌氧化物之间的相互作用形成复杂的纳米复合结构，这在理论上难以预测。

2. 动态行为：纳米复合物在ODH条件下可能发生重构，这为系统增加了另一层复杂性。

3. 多重效应：铌氧化物同时影响晶粒尺寸、还原性和活性位点覆盖，使得难以分离单个效应。

4. 浓度依赖行为：铌氧化物的影响随其浓度而变化，需要对不同组成的系统有深入的理解。

这些因素使得开发能准确预测这些复杂催化系统行为的综合理论模型变得困难，需要进行广泛的实验验证和理论方法的改进。

[1] "Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the diffractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented."

[2] "This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component upon TGA in air (at about 450 C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20Ni0.80O instead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4)."

[3] "It also suggests that the presence of Nb in the Nicitrate gel hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate. This can possibly be due to a kind of geometric effect: the Nb atoms located near the nickel atoms would increase the distance between the citrate component and the nickel atoms and thus act as a kind of barrier."

[4] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegavity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

[5] "This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6."

[6] "These results could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and surrounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c)."

铌氧化物的多样性显著影响了它们作为掺杂剂在NiO催化剂中用于乙烷氧化脱氢的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 铌阻止了在煅烧过程中金属Ni的形成，这可能是由于合成混合物中金属/柠檬酸比例较高所致。

2. 铌的存在阻碍了Ni被柠檬酸还原，可能是通过一种几何效应，即铌原子增加了柠檬酸与镍原子之间的距离。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Structural effects: Niobium doping does not significantly alter the lattice parameter of the NiO structure, suggesting limited bulk doping. Instead, niobium forms an amorphous phase that covers and surrounds NiO nanocrystals.

2. Oxidation state and interactions: XPS studies indicate that niobium is present in the +5 oxidation state, but with a binding energy shifted from that of pure Nb2O5. This suggests a close interaction between Nb and Ni atoms, likely in the form of a mixed oxide.

3. Catalyst synthesis: The presence of niobium affects the catalyst preparation process, influencing the decomposition of citrate precursors and preventing the formation of metallic nickel during calcination.

4. Surface area and morphology: Niobium doping leads to increased surface areas and smaller NiO crystallite sizes, potentially due to the formation of a dispersed amorphous Nb-rich phase.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. The complex nature of the catalyst structure, which includes both crystalline NiO and amorphous Nb-rich phases.

2. The difficulty in precisely determining the local structure and composition of the Nb-rich phase.

3. The potential for dynamic changes in the catalyst structure under reaction conditions.

4. The need to account for both geometric (site blocking) and electronic effects of niobium on the catalytic properties of NiO.

These complexities make it challenging to develop accurate theoretical models that can predict the behavior of these catalysts, necessitating a combination of advanced characterization techniques and in-situ studies to fully understand the role of niobium in these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 结构效应：铌掺杂并不显著改变NiO的晶格参数，这表明体相掺杂有限。相反，铌形成了一个覆盖和包围NiO纳米晶的无定形相。

2. 氧化态和相互作用：XPS研究表明铌以+5氧化态存在，但其结合能与纯Nb2O5相比发生了偏移。这表明Nb和Ni原子之间存在密切的相互作用，很可能以混合氧化物的形式存在。

3. 催化剂合成：铌的存在影响了催化剂的制备过程，影响柠檬酸盐前驱体的分解，并在焙烧过程中防止金属镍的形成。

4. 比表面积和形貌：铌掺杂导致比表面积增加和NiO晶粒尺寸减小，这可能是由于形成了分散的无定形富铌相。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 催化剂结构的复杂性，包括结晶NiO和无定形富铌相。

2. 精确确定富铌相的局部结构和组成的难度。

3. 在反应条件下催化剂结构可能发生动态变化。

4. 需要同时考虑铌对NiO催化性能的几何效应（位点阻断）和电子效应。

这些复杂性使得开发能够准确预测这些催化剂行为的理论模型变得具有挑战性，需要结合先进的表征技术和原位研究，以全面理解铌在这些催化体系中的作用。

[1] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[2] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[3] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[4] "Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the diffractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented. This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium has been found to be the most effective dopant among various elements for improving NiO catalysts.

2. Niobium affects the oxygen species in the catalyst. It reduces active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective oxygen species in the bulk and increases selective oxygen species on the surface.

3. The presence of niobium creates an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) that covers part of the NiO crystallite surface, reducing the number of active but non-selective sites.

4. Niobium prevents the formation of metallic Ni during the catalyst preparation process, which is likely due to the change in the metal to citric acid ratio in the synthesis mixture.

5. XPS studies show a close interaction between Nb and Ni atoms in the catalyst structure, indicating the formation of a mixed oxide phase.

The main challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations lies in the complexity of the catalyst system. While theoretical models often assume uniform doping of Nb into the NiO structure, experimental evidence suggests that the reality is more complex, involving the formation of separate Nb-rich phases and surface coverage effects. This discrepancy makes it difficult to directly correlate theoretical predictions based on simple doping models with the observed catalytic behavior.

Additionally, the limited structural doping of Nb into NiO (only a few percent) and the presence of amorphous phases complicate the characterization of these catalysts, making it challenging to precisely determine the local structure and distribution of Nb within the catalyst. This uncertainty in the catalyst's exact composition and structure further complicates the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

铌氧化物的多样性质在几个方面显著影响了它们作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为：

1. 在各种元素中，铌被发现是改善NiO催化剂最有效的掺杂剂。

2. 铌影响催化剂中的氧物种。它通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧解离的活性位点，这增强了非选择性氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了表面上选择性氧物种的数量。

3. 铌的存在创造了一个非晶态的富铌氧化物相（Nb2O5，NiNb2O6），覆盖了部分NiO晶粒表面，减少了活性但非选择性位点的数量。

4. 在催化剂制备过程中，铌防止了金属Ni的形成，这可能是由于合成混合物中金属与柠檬酸比例的变化。

5. XPS研究显示催化剂结构中Nb和Ni原子之间存在密切相互作用，表明形成了混合氧化物相。

在协调理论预测与实验观察时面临的主要挑战在于催化剂系统的复杂性。理论模型通常假设Nb均匀掺杂到NiO结构中，但实验证据表明实际情况更为复杂，涉及单独富铌相的形成和表面覆盖效应。这种差异使得难以直接将基于简单掺杂模型的理论预测与观察到的催化行为相关联。

此外，Nb在NiO中有限的结构掺杂（只有几个百分点）和非晶相的存在使这些催化剂的表征变得复杂，难以精确确定催化剂中Nb的局部结构和分布。这种对催化剂确切组成和结构的不确定性进一步复杂化了理论预测和实验结果之间的比较。

2. The presence of amorphous phases alongside crystalline structures, complicating structural analysis.

3. The interplay between geometric and electronic effects of Nb doping on the NiO catalyst, which may not be easily separable or predictable.

4. The potential for dynamic changes in the catalyst structure under reaction conditions, which may not be captured by ex-situ characterization techniques.
