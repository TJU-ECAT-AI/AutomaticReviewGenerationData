[1] "Besides, Table 2 shows that the Ni phase is absent from the diffractograms of all these Nb-containing samples. Formation of metallic Ni upon calcination at 450 C of the NbNicitrate gel is thus prevented."

[2] "This can be due to the higher M/citric acid ratio (M = Nb + Ni), when increasing the amount of NbCl5 in the synthetic mixture. It is consistent with the higher amount of residue retained after complete decomposition of the citrate component upon TGA in air (at about 450 C): 30 wt.% for Nb0.20Ni0.80O instead of 21 wt.% for NiO_SG (Table 4)."

[3] "It also suggests that the presence of Nb in the Nicitrate gel hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate. This can possibly be due to a kind of geometric effect: the Nb atoms located near the nickel atoms would increase the distance between the citrate component and the nickel atoms and thus act as a kind of barrier."

[4] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegavity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

[5] "This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6."

[6] "These results could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species, as proposed by Millet et al. [36]. This is supported by EFTEM micrographs from areas containing numerous NiO crystallites (Fig. 5a and b): NiO nanocrystals indeed appear covered and surrounded by an amorphous niobium-rich phase (Fig. 5c)."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium prevents the formation of metallic Ni during calcination, likely due to the higher metal/citric acid ratio in the synthetic mixture.

2. The presence of Nb hinders the reduction of Ni by citrate, possibly through a geometric effect where Nb atoms increase the distance between citrate and Ni atoms.

3. XPS studies indicate a close interaction between Nb and Ni, suggesting the formation of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6.

4. Nb forms a thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which affects the accessibility of active oxygen species.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from:

1. The complex interactions between Nb and Ni atoms in the catalyst structure.

2. The formation of amorphous phases that are difficult to characterize precisely.

3. The presence of multiple Nb-containing species (e.g., NiNb2O6, Nb2O5) with different properties and effects on catalytic performance.

4. The difficulty in isolating and quantifying the specific contributions of different Nb species to the overall catalytic behavior.

These complexities make it challenging to develop accurate theoretical models that fully account for all the observed experimental phenomena in these catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性显著影响了它们作为掺杂剂在NiO催化剂中用于乙烷氧化脱氢的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 铌阻止了在煅烧过程中金属Ni的形成，这可能是由于合成混合物中金属/柠檬酸比例较高所致。

2. 铌的存在阻碍了Ni被柠檬酸还原，可能是通过一种几何效应，即铌原子增加了柠檬酸与镍原子之间的距离。

3. XPS研究表明铌和镍之间存在密切的相互作用，这暗示了一种非晶态混合NiNb氧化物相的形成，如NiNb2O6。

4. 铌在NiO晶体表面形成一层薄膜，影响了活性氧物种的可及性。

在调和理论预测与实验观察时面临的挑战包括：

1. 催化剂结构中铌和镍原子之间复杂的相互作用。

2. 难以精确表征的非晶相的形成。

3. 多种具有不同性质和对催化性能影响的含铌物种（如NiNb2O6、Nb2O5）的存在。

4. 难以分离和量化不同铌物种对整体催化行为的具体贡献。

这些复杂性使得开发能够完全解释这些催化系统中所有观察到的实验现象的准确理论模型变得具有挑战性。
