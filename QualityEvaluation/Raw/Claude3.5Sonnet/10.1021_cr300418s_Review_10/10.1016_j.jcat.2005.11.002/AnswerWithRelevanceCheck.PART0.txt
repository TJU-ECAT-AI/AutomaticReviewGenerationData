          [1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

          [2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

          [3] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

          [4] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

          [5] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

          1. Lattice incorporation: Niobium can substitute nickel atoms or fill cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice, reducing the material's nonstoichiometry.

          2. Electronic effects: As an n-type semiconductor, niobium acts as an electron donor when incorporated into NiO, reducing the concentration of positive holes and decreasing electrical conductivity.

          3. Oxygen species modification: Niobium doping leads to a reduction in electrophilic oxygen species (O-) on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

          4. Optimal doping ratio: There is an optimal range of Nb/Ni atomic ratios (0.11-0.18) that leads to the best catalytic performance.

          5. Selectivity enhancement: The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

          Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

          1. Accurately modeling the distribution and interaction of niobium within the NiO lattice, considering both substitution and vacancy filling mechanisms.

          2. Predicting the optimal Nb/Ni ratio for catalytic performance, which depends on multiple factors.

          3. Understanding the precise mechanism by which niobium influences oxygen species and their reactivity on the catalyst surface.

          4. Accounting for potential phase segregation or formation of mixed oxide phases at higher niobium concentrations.

          5. Correlating bulk properties with surface characteristics and catalytic behavior, as active sites may differ from overall composition.

          6. Modeling the complex interplay between n-type (Nb2O5) and p-type (NiO) semiconductors in the mixed oxide system.

          7. Quantifying the effect of niobium doping on the nature and concentration of surface oxygen species.

          These challenges highlight the complexity of studying NiO-Nb catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and the need for combining advanced characterization techniques with comprehensive theoretical models to fully understand and optimize their performance.

          铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为掺杂剂在用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO催化剂中的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

          1. 晶格掺入：铌可以替代NiO晶格中的镍原子或填充阳离子空位，降低材料的非化学计量比。

          2. 电子效应：作为n型半导体，铌在掺入NiO时充当电子施主，减少正电荷空穴的浓度并降低电导率。

          3. 氧物种修饰：铌掺杂导致催化剂表面亲电氧物种（O-）的减少，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化成CO2。

          4. 最佳掺杂比例：存在一个最佳的Nb/Ni原子比范围（0.11-0.18），可以导致最佳的催化性能。

          5. 选择性提高：铌掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。

          在研究这些复杂催化体系时，理论预测与实验观察之间的调和面临以下挑战：

          1. 准确模拟铌在NiO晶格中的分布和相互作用，考虑替代和空位填充两种机制。

          2. 预测最佳的Nb/Ni比例以获得最佳催化性能，这取决于多个因素。

          3. 理解铌影响催化剂表面氧物种及其反应性的确切机制。

          4. 考虑在高铌浓度下可能发生的相分离或混合氧化物相的形成。

          5. 将催化剂的体相性质与其表面特性和催化行为相关联，因为活性位点可能与整体组成不同。

          6. 模拟混合氧化物系统中n型（Nb2O5）和p型（NiO）半导体之间的复杂相互作用。

          7. 量化铌掺杂对表面氧物种的性质和浓度的影响。

          这些挑战凸显了研究用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO-Nb催化剂的复杂性，以及需要结合先进的表征技术和全面的理论模型来充分理解和优化其性能。
