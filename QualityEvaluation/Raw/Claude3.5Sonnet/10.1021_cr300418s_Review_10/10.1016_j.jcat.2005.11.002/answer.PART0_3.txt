[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[2] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

[3] "Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence [25] for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Electron donation: Niobium acts as an electron donor when incorporated into the NiO lattice. This reduces the positive hole concentration in NiO, which is a p-type semiconductor, leading to decreased electrical conductivity.

2. Lattice incorporation: Niobium ions can either substitute nickel atoms or fill cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice. This incorporation reduces the nonstoichiometry of the material.

3. Oxygen species modification: The incorporation of niobium leads to a reduction in electrophilic oxygen species (O-) on the catalyst surface. These species are typically responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2 on pure NiO.

4. Semiconductor behavior: Niobium oxide itself is an n-type semiconductor, which contrasts with the p-type nature of NiO. This difference in semiconductor behavior contributes to the overall electronic properties of the mixed oxide catalyst.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accurately modeling the interaction between n-type and p-type semiconductors in the mixed oxide system.

2. Predicting the exact distribution and incorporation mechanism of niobium ions in the NiO lattice.

3. Understanding the precise relationship between lattice incorporation, nonstoichiometry, and catalytic performance.

4. Quantifying the effect of niobium doping on the nature and concentration of surface oxygen species.

5. Accounting for potential synergistic effects between nickel and niobium in the catalytic process.

These challenges arise from the complexity of the mixed oxide system and the multiple ways in which niobium influences the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of the NiO-based catalyst.

铌氧化物的多样性质对其作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为有显著影响，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 电子捐赠：铌在掺入NiO晶格时充当电子供体。这降低了NiO（一种p型半导体）中的正电荷空穴浓度，导致电导率降低。

2. 晶格掺入：铌离子可以替代镍原子或填充NiO晶格中的阳离子空位。这种掺入降低了材料的非化学计量性。

3. 氧物种修饰：铌的掺入导致催化剂表面亲电氧物种（O-）的减少。这些物种通常负责纯NiO上乙烷到CO2的完全氧化。

4. 半导体行为：铌氧化物本身是n型半导体，与NiO的p型性质形成对比。这种半导体行为的差异影响了混合氧化物催化剂的整体电子性质。

在研究这些复杂催化系统时，理论预测与实验观察的协调面临以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟混合氧化物系统中n型和p型半导体之间的相互作用。

2. 预测铌离子在NiO晶格中的确切分布和掺入机制。

3. 理解晶格掺入、非化学计量性和催化性能之间的精确关系。

4. 量化铌掺杂对表面氧物种的性质和浓度的影响。

5. 解释镍和铌在催化过程中可能存在的协同效应。

这些挑战源于混合氧化物系统的复杂性，以及铌影响NiO基催化剂的结构、电子和催化性能的多种方式。
