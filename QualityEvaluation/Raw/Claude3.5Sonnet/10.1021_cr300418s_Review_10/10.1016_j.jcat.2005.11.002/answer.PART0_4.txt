[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[2] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

[3] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Niobium incorporation reduces the nonstoichiometry of NiO by substituting nickel atoms and/or filling cationic vacancies. This leads to a decrease in electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

2. As an n-type semiconductor, niobium oxide acts as an electron donor when incorporated into NiO. This reduces the concentration of positive holes in NiO, thereby decreasing its conductivity.

3. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations may arise due to:

1. The complex interplay between the various oxidation states of niobium and their effects on the catalytic properties of NiO.

2. Difficulty in precisely controlling and characterizing the distribution and incorporation of niobium within the NiO lattice.

3. Potential formation of new phases or structures at the interface between NiO and niobium oxide, which may not be easily predicted by theory.

4. The need to account for surface phenomena and defect structures that may differ from bulk properties in these complex catalytic systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质对其作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为有显著影响，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 铌的掺入通过替代镍原子和/或填充阳离子空位来减少NiO的非化学计量性。这导致了负责乙烷完全氧化成CO2的亲电氧物种的减少。

2. 作为n型半导体，当掺入NiO时，铌氧化物充当电子供体。这减少了NiO中正空穴的浓度，从而降低了其导电性。

3. 铌掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除很可能是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。

在协调理论预测和实验观察时可能会遇到以下挑战：

1. 铌的各种氧化态之间复杂的相互作用及其对NiO催化性能的影响。

2. 精确控制和表征铌在NiO晶格中的分布和掺入情况的难度。

3. 在NiO和铌氧化物界面可能形成的新相或结构，这些可能不容易通过理论预测。

4. 需要考虑表面现象和缺陷结构，这些在这些复杂的催化系统中可能与体相性质不同。
