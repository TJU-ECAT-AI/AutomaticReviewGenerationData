[1] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

[2] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[3] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Optimum catalytic performance is achieved at a specific range of Nb/Ni atomic ratios (0.11-0.18), indicating that the concentration of niobium dopant is crucial for catalyst efficiency.

2. Niobium incorporation into the NiO lattice reduces the material's nonstoichiometry by either substituting nickel atoms or filling cationic vacancies. This leads to a decrease in electrophilic oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

3. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the concentration of positive holes in NiO. This electronic effect further contributes to the elimination of incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species.

4. The presence of niobium enhances selective conversion to ethylene by suppressing total oxidation pathways.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accurately modeling the distribution and interaction of niobium within the NiO lattice, as it can both substitute nickel atoms and fill vacancies.

2. Predicting the optimal Nb/Ni ratio for catalytic performance, which may depend on multiple factors such as electronic effects, surface area, and oxygen species distribution.

3. Understanding the precise mechanism by which niobium influences oxygen species and their reactivity on the catalyst surface.

4. Accounting for potential phase segregation or formation of mixed oxide phases at higher niobium concentrations, which can affect catalyst performance.

5. Correlating the bulk properties of the catalyst with its surface characteristics and catalytic behavior, as the active sites may differ from the overall composition.

These challenges highlight the complexity of studying NiO-Nb catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and the need for combining theoretical and experimental approaches to fully understand and optimize their performance.

铌氧化物的多样性质在作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂用于乙烷氧化脱氢反应时，以多种方式显著影响其行为：

1. 在特定的Nb/Ni原子比范围（0.11-0.18）内达到最佳催化性能，表明铌掺杂剂的浓度对催化剂效率至关重要。

2. 铌掺入NiO晶格通过替代镍原子或填充阳离子空位来降低材料的非化学计量性。这导致负责乙烷完全氧化为CO2的亲电氧物种减少。

3. 铌作为电子给体，降低了NiO中正电荷空穴的浓度。这种电子效应进一步促进了不完全还原的亲电氧物种的消除。

4. 铌的存在通过抑制完全氧化途径来增强选择性转化为乙烯。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，协调理论预测与实验观察结果可能面临以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟铌在NiO晶格中的分布和相互作用，因为它既可以替代镍原子，也可以填充空位。

2. 预测最佳的Nb/Ni比例以获得最佳催化性能，这可能取决于多个因素，如电子效应、表面积和氧物种分布。

3. 理解铌影响催化剂表面氧物种及其反应性的确切机制。

4. 考虑在高铌浓度下可能发生的相分离或混合氧化物相的形成，这可能影响催化剂性能。

5. 将催化剂的体相性质与其表面特性和催化行为相关联，因为活性位点可能与整体组成不同。

这些挑战凸显了研究用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO-Nb催化剂的复杂性，以及需要结合理论和实验方法来充分理解和优化其性能。
