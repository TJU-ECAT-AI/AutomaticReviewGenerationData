[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[2] "Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence [25] for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."

[3] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Ionic radius: Niobium's favorable ionic radius allows it to substitute for nickel atoms in the NiO lattice or fill cationic vacancies, forming a NiNb solid solution.

2. Higher valence: As a higher-valence ion, niobium acts as an electron donor when incorporated into the p-type NiO lattice, reducing the concentration of positive holes.

3. Reduction of nonstoichiometry: The incorporation of niobium leads to a reduction in the nonstoichiometry of the NiO material, as evidenced by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements.

4. Modification of oxygen species: Niobium doping reduces the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O-) on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

5. Enhancement of selectivity: By reducing unselective oxygen species, niobium doping leads to enhanced selectivity towards the desired ethane ODH reaction.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Complexity of the solid solution: The formation of a NiNb solid solution adds complexity to the system, making it difficult to predict exact structural and electronic properties.

2. Multiple effects of doping: Niobium doping affects multiple properties simultaneously (e.g., nonstoichiometry, electrical conductivity, oxygen species), making it challenging to isolate individual effects.

3. Surface vs. bulk properties: Differences between surface and bulk properties of the catalyst may complicate the interpretation of experimental results and their correlation with theoretical predictions.

4. Reaction mechanism complexity: The complex nature of the ethane ODH reaction mechanism may make it difficult to directly link catalyst properties to observed catalytic performance.

5. Limitations of characterization techniques: Some characterization techniques may have limitations in providing detailed information about the local structure and electronic properties of the doped catalysts, making it challenging to fully validate theoretical predictions.

铌氧化物的多样性质显著影响了它们作为掺杂剂在用于乙烷氧化脱氢的NiO催化剂中的行为，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 离子半径：铌的离子半径适宜，使其能够替代NiO晶格中的镍原子或填充阳离子空位，形成NiNb固溶体。

2. 更高的价态：作为高价离子，铌在掺入p型NiO晶格时充当电子施主，减少了正电洞的浓度。

3. 降低非化学计量比：铌的引入导致NiO材料非化学计量比的降低，这一点通过TPD-O2和电导率测量得到证实。

4. 改变氧物种：铌掺杂减少了催化剂表面亲电氧物种（O-）的丰度，这些物种负责乙烷完全氧化成CO2。

5. 提高选择性：通过减少非选择性氧物种，铌掺杂提高了目标乙烷ODH反应的选择性。

在研究这些复杂催化体系时，理论预测与实验观察之间的调和面临以下挑战：

1. 固溶体的复杂性：NiNb固溶体的形成增加了体系的复杂性，使得精确预测结构和电子性质变得困难。

2. 掺杂的多重效应：铌掺杂同时影响多个性质（如非化学计量比、电导率、氧物种），难以分离单个效应。

3. 表面vs体相性质：催化剂的表面和体相性质的差异可能使实验结果的解释及其与理论预测的关联变得复杂。

4. 反应机理复杂性：乙烷ODH反应机理的复杂性可能使催化剂性质与观察到的催化性能之间难以直接联系。

5. 表征技术的局限性：某些表征技术在提供掺杂催化剂局部结构和电子性质的详细信息方面可能存在局限性，使得全面验证理论预测变得具有挑战性。
