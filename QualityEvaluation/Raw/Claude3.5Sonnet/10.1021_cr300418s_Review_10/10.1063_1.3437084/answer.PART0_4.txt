This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about niobium oxides, NiO catalysts, or ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The literature appears to be about a Pd-perovskite automotive catalyst studied using x-ray absorption fine structure, which is unrelated to the question asked.

根据所给的文献无法回答这个问题。该文档不包含任何关于铌氧化物、NiO催化剂或乙烷氧化脱氢的信息。文献似乎是关于使用X射线吸收精细结构研究的钯-钙钛矿汽车催化剂，这与所问的问题无关。
