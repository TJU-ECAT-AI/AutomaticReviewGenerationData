This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about niobium oxides, NiO catalysts, or ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The literature appears to be about Pd-perovskite automotive catalysts studied by x-ray absorption fine structure, which is unrelated to the question asked.

基于所给的文献无法回答这个问题。该文档不包含任何关于铌氧化物、NiO催化剂或乙烷氧化脱氢的信息。这篇文献似乎是关于通过X射线吸收精细结构研究钯-钙钛矿汽车催化剂的，与所问的问题无关。
