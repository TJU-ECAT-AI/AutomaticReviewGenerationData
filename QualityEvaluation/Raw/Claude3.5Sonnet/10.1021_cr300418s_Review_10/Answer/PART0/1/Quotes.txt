[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[5] "No indication of formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly lower than 1% of Nb."

[6] "The efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

[7] "It has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric structure"

[8] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:"

[9] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."

[10] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[11] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."

[12] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."

[2] "In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."

[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."

[4] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."

[5] "These consist in NiO nanocrystallites (713 nm) associated, at Nb contents >3 at.%., with an amorphous thin layer (12 nm) of a niobium-rich mixed oxide with a structure similar to that of NiNb2O6."

[6] "The efficiency of nickel oxides catalysts was initially improved by using them unsupported, instead of supporting them onto inorganic materials [30,31]. Later, another strategy was to dope NiO with various elements such as Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb, Ta [32], and very recently W [33]. Among these elements, niobium turned out to be the best [34]."

[7] "According to Lemonidou et al., niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies. This would enhance the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increase the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface [35]."

[8] "However, it was recently suggested that the occurrence of structural doping was limited to a few percent of Nb and that the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst (lower intrinsic activity but higher selectivity) was due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase (Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites [36]."

[9] "A brief XPS study of Nb 3d core levels in Nb0.15Ni0.85O shows a binding energy for Nb 3d5/2 of 207.0 eV. It is shifted by 0.4 eV, as compared with NbV in Nb2O5 (207.4 eV [43]), and by +0.2 eV, as compared with NbV in NaNbO3 (206.8 eV [44]). This is consistent with a close interaction between Nb and Ni, which electronegativity is lower than that of O and higher than that of Na on the Pauling scale."

[10] "This further supports the presence of an amorphous mixed NiNb oxide phase, such as NiNb2O6."

[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity."

[2] "Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C."

[4] "It seems that the introduction of promoting metals causes additional segregation of the nickel phase, with the largest effect induced by niobium, with NiO crystals of 26.5 nm."

[1] "A more dramatic example of this effect is provided by Nb-doped NiO(011). The Nb dopant, which has five valence electrons, replaces a divalent Ni atom. Therefore, Nb is a very strong base."

[2] "The adsorption energy of O2 on the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. This energy is so low that no reaction involving the oxygen atoms in the NbO2 group will result in gas-phase products (the Sabatier principle)."

[3] "Formally, the adsorption of O2 on Nb brings to the NbO2 four electrons (O is divalent) so that (formally) the NbO2 group has only one available valence electron. Since this monovalent NbO2 group replaces a divalent Ni atom, it ought to act as a low-valence dopant and turn the surface into a Lewis acid."

[4] "The DFT calculations show that this prediction is correct. In Figure 3 we show the NiO(011) surface doped with NbO2. We marked two of the oxygen atoms as A and B. Making an oxygen vacancy by removing the atom A requires 2.31 eV, and making a vacancy by removing B costs 2.67 eV. This is substantially lower than the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy on the undoped surface, which is 3.28 eV."

[5] "This surface has another property typical of an oxide doped with a LVD: the oxygen atoms near the NbO2 group help the dissociative adsorption of ethane. Among many possible structures for the dissociation fragments, several involve the binding of H or CH3CH2 to the oxygen atoms in the surface of NiO, which are activated by the presence of the NbO2 dopant. The energy for this dissociative adsorption reaction, for various final fragment configurations, varies between 0.06 and 1.06 eV. This is lower than the dissociation energy on NiO. Doping with NbO2 favors the breaking of the CH bond, which is typical of an oxide doped with a LVD."

[1] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."

[2] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "The reaction of the foreign species (Nb5+) with these NiO-defects leading to the formation of two distinct structural features. On the areas of low-density population of cationic vacancies, a small amount of Nb is incorporated in the NiO host lattice, causing distortion of the crystallographic planes and rupture of the larger crystallites that consequently leads to significantly lower crystal size (in the nanorange) and contributes to the higher surface area of the NiNbO catalysts."

[4] "Doping NiO with niobium results in significant changes in the crystalline morphology."

[5] "Based on the above, the NiO-like phase detected in the diffractograms of the NiNbO mixed oxides is identified as a NiNb solid solution. By combining the HRTEM with the XRD and the EDS results, it could be inferred that the structural feature detected in the Ni0.9Nb0.1 sample (denoted as I) indeed corresponds to this NiNb solid solution, formed via the substitution of the host cations (Ni2+) and/or filling of cationic vacancies of the non-stoichiometric NiO lattice by the Nb5+ cations."

[6] "The reaction of the niobium cations with the structural defects in the NiO lattice disorders the crystal structure and induces a rupture of the larger platelets into smaller ones, thus causing the reduction of crystallite size observed in the Nb-doped catalytic sample."

[7] "The elimination and/or reduction of the vacant sites on NiO via their reaction with the foreign cations is responsible for the high selectivity of the catalysts to ethylene during ethane ODH."

[8] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[1] "We have recently reported [1315] the development of highly active and selective nickel-based catalysts for the efficient dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in an oxidizing environment."

[2] "NiNbO exhibited the best catalytic performance with a 46% ethene yield at 400 C, while NiLiO demonstrated the worst results with a respective yield of 8.42%."

[3] "Our previous investigations [14] on the NiNbO system revealed that surface-exposed nickel sites constitute the active centers for the activation of the paraffinic substrate."

[4] "When a foreign metal is introduced in the NiO structure and given that the ionic radius is such that the foreign cation can insert the oxide host lattice, a solid solution is formed."

[5] "The higher the valence of the dopant, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[6] "Based on the results of the present work, it can be inferred that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[7] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[1] "The diversity and properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

          [4] "It was reported that in the catalytic activity of a Nb2O5 mixed catalyst is likely to be due to the Nb5+ lattice in low coordination numbers."
          
          [5] "For the case of niobium oxides, the incorporation of Nb into the pyrochlore structure was found to enhance the catalytic activity compared to the parent pyrochlore."
          
          [6] "The activity in the catalytic oxidation of ethane to ethylene over Nb-doped pyrochlore catalysts was studied."

[1] "Niobium is a flexible atom when it combines with oxygen. It makes three stable oxides, Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO, as well as compounds with the stoichiometry Nb3n+1O8n2 with 5  n  8."

[2] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."

[3] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2. This changes the formal electron counting."

[4] "Nb has a high affinity for oxygen and a propensity to make compounds in which it is pentavalent. Because of this, we investigated whether in contact with a gas-phase oxygen the dopant may come out of the Ni lattice site and form an oxide cluster on top of the surface."

[5] "This detailed examination of ethane ODH by doped NiO illustrates the difficulties encountered by both theory and experiments when studying catalysis by doped oxides. It is impossible at this time to construct realistic models of the catalytic surface, and we are limited, in both computations and experiments, to making educated guesses."

[1] "Nb-doped NiO (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), which demonstrates a very high activity and selectivity in ethylene production via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[5] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[6] "Introducing niobium induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[7] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2- species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

[8] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

          [2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

          [3] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

          [4] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

          [5] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."

[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[9] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation.

[5] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[6] "Introducing niobium induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[7] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2- species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

[8] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice by either substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective nonstoichiometric NiO surface led to a reduction of the materials nonstoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements, and, consequently, of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant on NiO and are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

          [2] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.110.18."

          [3] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. In agreement with this finding, the O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."

          [4] "Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

          [5] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."
