          [1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase"

[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."

[5] "No indication of formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly lower than 1% of Nb."

[6] "The efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase."

[7] "It has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric structure"

[8] "NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium:"

[9] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."

[10] "Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties."

[11] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease."

[12] "We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selectivity to ethylene."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Even small amounts of Nb drastically increase conversion compared to pure NiO, indicating a strong influence on catalytic activity.

2. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb content, related to a decrease in active phase particle size induced by amorphous Nb2O5.

3. Above 15% Nb, the amorphous Nb2O5 phase reacts with NiO to form an inactive NiNb2O6 phase, limiting the beneficial effects.

4. At low concentrations (up to 3-7%), niobium spreads on the NiO surface, reducing the number of accessible O- species, leading to more isolated and selective O- sites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. Niobium affects the electronic properties of the catalyst, as NiO is a p-type semiconductor with positive holes as the main charge carriers, correlated to the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple.

6. The presence of Nb influences the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations include:

1. Understanding the complex interactions between NiO and Nb2O5 at different concentrations.

2. Explaining the mechanisms by which small amounts of Nb drastically improve catalytic performance.

3. Determining the exact nature and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface.

4. Accounting for the formation of the inactive NiNb2O6 phase at higher Nb concentrations.

5. Clarifying the role of amorphous Nb2O5 in modifying the NiO particle size and surface properties.

6. Predicting and controlling the formation of different phases (amorphous Nb2O5, NiNb2O6) and their effects on catalyst activity and stability.

7. Elucidating the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and developing strategies to mitigate them.

8. Accounting for the dynamic nature of the catalyst system under reaction conditions, which may differ from theoretical predictions based on static models.

These challenges arise from the complexity of the NiNbO catalytic system, where multiple factors such as composition, structure, and surface properties interact to determine overall catalytic performance.

          铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 即使少量的Nb也能显著提高转化率，相比纯NiO而言，表明其对催化活性有强烈影响。

2. 在15%的Nb含量时观察到最佳活性，这与非晶态Nb2O5引起的活性相粒径减小有关。

3. 当Nb含量超过15%时，非晶态Nb2O5相与NiO反应形成无活性的NiNb2O6相，限制了其有益效果。

4. 在低浓度（高达3-7%）时，铌在NiO表面扩散，减少了可接触的O-物种数量，导致更加孤立和选择性的O-位点，有利于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。

5. 铌掺杂影响催化剂的电子性质，因为NiO是一种p型半导体，其主要载流子为正孔，与Ni3+/Ni2+氧化还原对相关。

6. Nb的存在影响NiO的氧过量比，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

在理论预测与实验观察之间存在以下挑战：

1. 理解NiO和Nb2O5在不同浓度下的复杂相互作用。

2. 解释少量Nb如何显著改善催化性能的机制。

3. 确定催化剂表面活性位点的确切性质和分布。

4. 解释在较高Nb浓度下形成无活性NiNb2O6相的原因。

5. 阐明非晶态Nb2O5在改变NiO粒径和表面性质中的作用。

6. 预测和控制不同相（无定形Nb2O5、NiNb2O6）的形成及其对催化剂活性和稳定性的影响。

7. 阐明催化剂失活机理并开发缓解策略。

8. 考虑反应条件下催化剂系统的动态特性，这可能与基于静态模型的理论预测不同。

这些挑战源于NiNbO催化体系的复杂性，其中成分、结构和表面性质等多个因素相互作用，共同决定了整体催化性能。
