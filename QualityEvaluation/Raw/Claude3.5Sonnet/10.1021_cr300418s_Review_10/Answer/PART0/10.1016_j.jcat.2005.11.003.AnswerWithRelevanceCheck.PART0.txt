          [1] "Nb-doped NiO (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), which demonstrates a very high activity and selectivity in ethylene production via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[3] "Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[5] "Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb, since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material."

[6] "Introducing niobium induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO."

[7] "Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2- species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric O- species remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium."

[8] "The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned, based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in several ways:

1. Formation of NiNb solid solution: Small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material by forming a NiNb solid solution.

2. Modification of oxygen species: Niobium doping eliminates nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species responsible for total oxidation of ethane to CO2. Instead, it promotes the formation of strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species (O2-) that are selective for converting ethane to ethylene.

3. Alteration of catalyst surface properties: Niobium fills cationic vacancies in NiO, reducing active sites available for oxygen dissociation. This makes oxygen diffusion the fast step of the process rather than dissociation.

4. Creation of different active site types: Doping results in two types of active sites - type I sites with strongly bonded lattice O2- species responsible for ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation, and type II sites with limited nonstoichiometric O- species active for direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

5. Decrease in activation energy for oxygen exchange: Niobium doping significantly decreases the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, but also increases the activation energy for oxygen exchange, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared to pure NiO.

Challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations for these complex catalytic systems may include:

1. Accurately modeling the complex interactions between niobium dopants and the NiO lattice, including effects on oxygen mobility and reactivity.

2. Predicting the exact distribution and nature of oxygen species and active sites on the catalyst surface.

3. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which niobium alters the catalytic properties of NiO at an atomic level.

4. Accounting for potential synergistic effects between different types of active sites and oxygen species.

5. Incorporating the effects of niobium on catalyst reducibility and reoxidation kinetics into theoretical models.

6. Reconciling atomic-scale predictions with observed macroscopic catalytic behavior and kinetics.

7. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, which may not be captured by static models.

These factors make it challenging to develop comprehensive theoretical models that can fully predict the experimental behavior of Nb-doped NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, necessitating a combination of advanced characterization techniques and careful kinetic studies to elucidate the catalytic behavior of these complex systems.

          铌氧化物的多样性质作为NiO催化剂中的掺杂剂对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 形成NiNb固溶体：少量的铌能有效地将NiO从完全氧化催化剂转变为有效的ODH催化材料，这是通过形成NiNb固溶体实现的。

2. 改变氧物种：铌掺杂消除了负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2的非化学计量的亲电活性氧物种。相反，它促进了强结合、不易移动的亲核氧物种（O2-）的形成，这些物种对将乙烷选择性转化为乙烯有利。

3. 改变催化剂表面性质：铌填充了NiO中的阳离子空位，减少了可用于氧解离的活性位点。这使得氧扩散成为过程的快速步骤，而不是解离。

4. 创造不同类型的活性位点：掺杂产生两种类型的活性位点 - I型位点具有强键合的晶格O2-物种，负责乙烷ODH和乙烯过度氧化；II型位点具有有限的非化学计量O-物种，活跃于乙烷直接氧化为CO2。

5. 降低氧交换的活化能：铌掺杂显著降低了标记氧的活化能和交换速率，但也增加了氧交换的活化能，反映出与纯NiO相比，Nb/NiO上的氧物种结合更强。

在这些复杂的催化系统中，调和理论预测与实验观察之间的差异可能面临以下挑战：

1. 准确模拟铌掺杂剂与NiO晶格之间的复杂相互作用，包括对氧移动性和反应性的影响。

2. 预测催化剂表面氧物种和活性位点的确切分布和性质。

3. 理解铌在原子水平上改变NiO催化性质的精确机制。

4. 考虑不同类型活性位点和氧物种之间可能存在的协同效应。

5. 将铌对催化剂可还原性和再氧化动力学的影响纳入理论模型。

6. 协调原子尺度预测与观察到的宏观催化行为和动力学。

7. 催化剂表面在反应条件下的动态特性，这可能无法被静态模型捕捉。

这些因素使得开发全面的理论模型来完全预测Nb掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的实验行为变得具有挑战性，需要结合先进的表征技术和仔细的动力学研究来阐明这些复杂系统的催化行为。
