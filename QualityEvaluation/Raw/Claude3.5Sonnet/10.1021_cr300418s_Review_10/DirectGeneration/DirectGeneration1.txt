Niobium oxides have emerged as promising dopants for enhancing the catalytic performance of nickel oxide (NiO) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane. The incorporation of niobium species into NiO catalysts has been shown to significantly improve selectivity towards ethylene and increase catalyst stability. Theoretical predictions suggest that niobium oxides modify the electronic structure of NiO, creating oxygen vacancies and altering the surface reactivity. These modifications are believed to facilitate the selective activation of C-H bonds while suppressing complete oxidation pathways. However, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations remains challenging. Factors such as the precise structural configuration of niobium species, their distribution within the NiO matrix, and the complex interplay between dopant concentration and catalytic performance require further investigation. Additionally, the dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions and the potential formation of new active sites during the ODH process complicate the correlation between theoretical models and real-world catalyst behavior. Despite these challenges, continued research in this area holds promise for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for ethane ODH, potentially revolutionizing the production of important chemical feedstocks.
