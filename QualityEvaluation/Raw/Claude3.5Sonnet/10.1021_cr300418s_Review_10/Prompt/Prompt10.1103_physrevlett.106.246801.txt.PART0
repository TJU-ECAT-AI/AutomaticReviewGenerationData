Scanning-tunneling microscopy and density-functional theory have been employed to identify the
spatial correlation between an oxygen vacancy and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a defective CeO2111
film. The two Ce3 ions can occupy different cationic shells around the vacancy. The resulting variation in
the chemical environment leads to a splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels, which is detected with STM
spectroscopy. The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in
empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the
Ce3 remain dark. Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is
not adjacent to the O vacancy.

Ceria is a widely used oxide support for several oxida-
tion reactions, such as the water-gas shift and NOx reduc-
tion [13]. The outstanding performance of ceria in
promoting oxidation processes relies to a large extent on
its facile reducibility and the associated ability to release
lattice oxygen [4]. The vacancies are easily healed again in
an O-rich ambience, which makes the oxide perfectly
suited to balance the oxygen supply during a catalytic
reaction. On removing an O atom, two electrons are left
behind in the lattice that form two reduced Ce3 species
[4]. The electrons occupy split-off states of the initially
empty Ce 4f band, lying inside the O2p  Ce5d band gap
of ceria and being highly localized in space.
The reduction of ceria can be followed with photoelec-
tron spectroscopy, by using the presence of filled Ce 4f
states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels as a
measure [5,6]. This approach provides only spatially aver-
aged information, and the localization of the O vacancies
and associated Ce3 ion pairs is not revealed. In contrast,
scanning-tunneling (STM) and atomic force microscopy
have been successfully employed to identify single O
vacancies in surface or subsurface ceria layers [7,8].
However, no information on the electronic properties of
the defects was acquired in this case, and the question of
electron localization remained unsolved. Early density-
functional theory (DFT) calculations assumed a stabiliza-
tion of the extra electrons in Ce ions next to the defect
[7,9,10], while recent studies suggested the occupancy of
more distant cationic sites [1113]. In ceria nanoclusters,
the Ce3 ions were found to form preferentially at low-
coordinated edge sites, even if the O vacancy is far away
[14]. Those differences demonstrate the sensitivity of
electron-localization phenomena on the computational
approach.
In this work, we use a combined STM and DFTapproach
to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O
defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111)
surface. We demonstrate that electrons left behind upon
vacancy formation occupy Ce sites that are not in a next-
neighbor position to the defect. This possibility to explore
electron-localization effects opens a direct route to monitor
oxidation and reduction processes in the catalytically rele-
vant ceria system [15].
The experiments have been performed in an ultrahigh
vacuum STM operated at 10 K. The oxide film is prepared
by depositing Ce onto a sputtered and annealed Ru(0001)
surface in 5  106 mbar O2, whereby half of the material
is dosed at 100 K and half at 450 K [16]. After annealing to
1000 K in O2, the film displays a sharp (p2  p2) LEED
pattern that is characteristic for the CeO2 (111) surface.
The mean film thickness is adjusted to five O-Ce-O tri-
layers. Highly resolved STM measurements are mainly
obtained at positive sample bias (unoccupied states), in-
dicating that the Ce4 ions are responsible for the contrast
(Fig. 1). At negative bias, the filled O 2p orbitals govern
the contrast; however, atomic resolution is more difficult to
obtain. In both cases, the observed atom periodicity of
4.0 A
 is in line with the CeO2 lattice constant of 3.88 A
 .
Ceria films are prepared in an excess of O2 and exhibit
only a small defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are
thus generated by injecting 50 eVelectrons (1 mC dose) at
100 K. Because of the highly nonthermal formation pro-
cess, the defects are not expected to be in an equilibrium
distribution; however, most of them are located in the oxide
surface given the low excitation energies. At positive bias,
they appear as paired and tripled protrusions of 0:4 
A
height, which mark the Ce4 ions around the vacancy as
shown below [Figs. 1(d) and 1(e)]. At negative polarity,

they transform into atom-sized holes, confirming their
identity as a surface O vacancy [Fig. 1(c), arrow] [7,8].
Also, subsurface vacancies that appear as three protruding
maxima at negative bias are occasionally observed but
have been disregarded in this study [Fig. 1(c), dashed
triangle].
The electronic properties of surface defects are analyzed
with STM conductance spectroscopy performed with the
lock-in technique (10 mV=1073 Hz). The stoichiometric
film exhibits a band gap ranging from 2:5 (valence band)
to 3:5 V (conduction band) [Fig. 2(a)]. The gap size of
6.0 eV is close to the bulk value obtained from electron-
energy loss and optical spectroscopy [5]. An extra dI=dV
peak at 2.3 eV is detected inside the gap and assigned to the
unoccupied Ce 4f band for the following reasons. Its
energy position fits well to the f band center derived
from electron-energy loss and inverse photoelectron spec-
troscopy [5,17]. The peak is visible only at small tip-
sample distances, adjusted with a bias set point close to
the conduction band onset, as expected for a highly con-
tracted electronic state. And a negative-differential resist-
ance behavior is revealed for higher set-point currents
(I > 50 pA), as reflected in the negative dI=dV signal
beyond the peak [Fig. 2(a), spec 1*]. The negative-
differential resistance effect originates from the loss of
conductivity when the f-related transport channel closes
in the spectral run. It is symptomatic for electron transport
through spatially and energetically confined states [18,19]
and therefore in line with our assignment of the gap states
to the empty 4f band.
On defective ceria, also filled f states should appear at
the position of the Ce3 ions [4,20]. Their detection is
challenging due to the small tip overlap with the localized
states in the gap. Sufficient spectral sensitivity is achieved
only if the tip is stabilized inside the empty f band and then
ramped to negative bias [Fig. 2(b), left]. Whereas no filled
states are observed on defect-free oxide patches (spec 4),
new dI=dV peaks appear at around 1:5 V in the vicinity
of surface vacancies. The signal intensity strongly depends
on a precise positioning of the tip above the defect and
quickly drops to zero if the tip is displaced by more than
5 A
 . Also, the spectral shape changes when going from one
defect to another (specs 13). Whereas defects appearing
as a triple protrusion always display a single peak at around
1:2 V (spec 2), a splitting with maxima at 1:5 and
1:1 V is revealed for certain paired protrusions (spec
1). However, the latter also appear with only one peak in
the conductance spectra. We note that similar gap states are
detected for other defect types, such as voids in the Ce
lattice (spec 3) and step edges. Common to all defects is an
empty-state spectrum that is similar to the one of the
stoichiometric film [Fig. 2(b), right].
The high spatial confinement and energy position of the
gap states suggest a relation to the filled 4f levels localized
at the Ce3 ions, as similar states were detected with
electron-energy loss and photoelectron spectroscopy be-
fore [5,15]. However, a conclusive interpretation requires
DFT calculations and have been performed at the PBE 
U level (U  4:5 eV), by using the VASP code with a
400 eV cutoff for the plane-wave basis set [21]. Atomic
cores are described by the projected augmented wave
method. The O vacancy is positioned in the top layer of
the (3  3) supercell representing the CeO2 (111), while all
cationic sites of the slab are considered as potential posi-
tions for the Ce3 ions. The electronic structure is deduced
from a (2  2  1) k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone.

While the dI=dV maximum at 2.3 V reflects the empty Ce 4f

We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-
formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I). The Ce3
positions are hereby labeled in an nm scheme, with m being
the cationic layer counted from the surface and n denoting
the shell of cations surrounding the vacancy. For example,
21 describes a position in the surface Ce layer that is second
neighbor to a defect. The properties of the Ce3 ions are
now governed by the number of O ligands, i.e., the coor-
dination number (CN). A Ce3 in the surface trilayer has
seven and six O2 neighbors if it sits in a second- (21 site)
and first-neighbor position (11 site) to the defect, respec-
tively, but eight in a bulk environment. There are two
configurations in Table I with equal CN for the two Ce3
ions, namely, the 21  21 and 11  11 arrangements. In
both cases, the two ions have filled f orbitals with the same
energy as they experience the same chemical environment.
For Ce3 ions with different CNs, we find a splitting of the
f orbitals due to the different distances from the vacancy.
The splitting is of the order of 0.1 eV if the CN differs by
one (as in 11  21 and 11  31 pairs) but increases to 0.5 V
for a CN mismatch of two (Fig. 3). The latter case occurs in
the 11  42 pair that consists of a sixfold and an eightfold
coordinated Ce3 ion in the surface and subsurface layer,
respectively. From those results, it becomes clear why the
experimental spectra show either a double- or a single-peak
structure. The two Ce3 ions in spec 1 of Fig. 2(b) are
apparently located in rather different environments, while
the pair in spec 2 has a comparable CN. The localization of
the Ce3 ions with respect to the defect is not deduced
from the splitting that is sensitive only to differences in the
local environment.
This information is, however, contained in empty-state
STM topographies, which also reflect the local electronic
structure of the ceria surface. We have therefore simulated

ing on the number of Ce4 ions around the defect. The origin of
the contrast is the larger expansion of the Ce4 4f orbitals in
presence of the vacancy (b).

STM images for bias voltages, where electron tunneling
into the empty Ce 4f band is enabled (Fig. 4). The Ce3
(large blue dots) are not visible in this case, because their
empty 4f states shift to higher energies due to the better
screening of the Ce core potential in the electron-rich ions
(Fig. 3). The Ce4 ions, on the other hand, appear bright
especially if they are adjacent to an O defect (large green
dots). The reason for the enhanced contrast of the latter has
been clarified with cluster calculations for the 21  21 ion
pair, performed with PBE0 hybrid functionals and an
electrostatic embedding method [22]. Because of the miss-
ing repulsive potential at the O vacancy site, the 4f orbitals
largely extend towards the empty space and partially
delocalize over the Ce4 ions surrounding the defect
[Fig. 4(b)]. Tunneling into those expanded states gives
rise to the bright appearance of the Ce4 ions next to the
vacancy. This interpretation allows us to draw conclusions
on the position of the excess electrons with respect to the O
defect. If the vacancy is surrounded only by Ce4 ions and
the Ce3 occupy more distant coordination shells, a sym-
metric triple protrusion becomes visible in empty-state
images [Fig. 4(a)]. This triple signature is indeed observed
in the STM, although its abundance is relatively small
[Fig. 1(e)]. The most frequently seen defect type is the
paired protrusion, which is readily assigned to two Ce4
localized next to an O vacancy [Figs. 1(d) and 4(c)]. The
third faint species marks a Ce3 in a next-neighbor posi-
tion to the defect, while the second Ce3 cannot be iden-
tified in the image. The last possible configuration reveals a
single maximum and reflects an O vacancy surrounded by
one protruding Ce4 and two faint Ce3 ions [Fig. 4(d)].
However, this configuration has not been detected in the
experiment.
In conclusion, STM imaging and spectroscopy in com-
bination with DFT calculations provide an unique insight
into the localization of the two excess electrons that remain
in the CeO2 (111) surface upon O vacancy formation.
Although the precise position of the two Ce3 ions is not
revealed, we have demonstrated that they always sit in
different coordination spheres around the defect, in agree-
ment with earlier theoretical results [11]. The driving force
for adopting such open configurations is the better ability
of the system to relax lattice strain induced by the more
spacious Ce3 ion compared to its Ce4 counterpart. Our
results bring the long-standing puzzle on electron localiza-
tion in defective CeO2 surfaces closer to a final answer.
