Abstract
In this study, we report the development of efficient Al2O3-supported Ni and promoted NiMe (Me = Mo, V, Nb, Ta, Co) catalysts for the
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The effect of nickel loading and the impact of the promoters on the performance of the materials are
discussed in the light of a detailed physico-chemical characterization of the catalysts by N2 adsorption, XRD, XPS, TGA-H2, and UV-DRS.
Nickel was found to interact strongly with alumina, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, whereas
NiO crystallites formed on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages. XPS revealed a chemical modification of the NiO
particles accommodated on the alumina support. In terms of catalytic performance, increasing the Ni loading was beneficial and boosted
ethane conversion, which surpassed 40% at 450 C for the highest nickel loading catalyst, whereas ethene selectivity was retained at high
levels for all Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modified both structural and catalytic properties in
ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward
ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is a major building block of the petrochemical
industry and is used in the production of diverse products
ranging from solvents to plastics. Currently, ethylene is pro-
duced by steam cracking of various hydrocarbon feedstocks
(ethane, LPG, naphtha, gas oils), a process that operates un-
der severe conditions. In fact, the conversion of ethane to
ethylene via steam cracking is the most energy-consuming
step of the petrochemical industry, with energy requirements

estimated around 26 GJ/ton ethylene produced. With the
ethylene market growing at 23% per year [1] and fuel costs
constantly rising, research efforts have been focused on the
development of less energy-intensive processes for the pro-
duction of ethylene.
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is an at-
tractive alternative route for the production of ethylene. Its
major advantage, compared with the conventional method,
is its high energy efficiency, since the process operates at
low temperatures and involves an exothermic reaction, thus
has considerably lower energy requirements. However, for a
viable industrial application of this process, a highly active
and selective catalytic system, able to efficiently transform
ethane to ethylene and not to total oxidation products, COx,
is necessary. Several catalytic systems have been proposed

in the last decades as efficient for the ethane ODH reac-
tion [29]. One of the best-performing catalysts has been
reported since 1978 by Thorsteinson et al. [8] and consists of
a mixture of MoVNb oxides operating at low temperature
(< 400 C) with relatively high efficiency. Ever since the
pioneering work of Thorsteinson, a great variety of mixed
metal oxides have been tested, with a great increase in re-
cent years in the number of tested materials, by applica-
tion of combinatorial methods [9]. Recently, Lopez Nieto
and co-workers have developed a very promising catalytic
formulation based on mixed MoVTeNb oxides, exhibit-
ing about 75% ethylene yields at low reaction temperature
(350400 C). The enhanced catalytic activity of the pro-
posed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a mul-
tifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic
phase [10].
Nickel catalysts constitute an important class of catalytic
materials and are widely applied in many important reac-
tions, such as hydrogenation [11], natural gas reforming for
syngas production [12], dealkylation [13], etc. The good
performance of nickel-containing materials in oxidative de-
hydrogenation was first reported by Schuurman et al. [14].
Alumina-supported nickel catalysts were tested in the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of ethane and exhibited very promising
results [15,16], and multicomponent nickel-based materi-
als for ethane ODH have recently been patented by Symyx
Technologies [17,18]. The promotion of nickel with several
metals has a great effect on the ability of the catalysts to both
activate the ethane feed and selectively convert it to ethene.
However, reports in literature dealing with the nature of the
active sites in such materials in correlation with their perfor-
mance in oxidative dehydrogenation are scarce.
In this study, we report the development of efficient
Al2O3-supported Ni and promoted NiMe (Me = Mo, V,
Nb, Ta, Co) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane. The effect of nickel loading and the impact of the
promoters on the performance of the materials are discussed
in the light of a detailed characterization of the physico-
chemical properties of the catalysts by N2 adsorption, XRD,
XPS, TGA-H2, and UV-DRS. These complementary meth-
ods provided valuable insight into the nature of the surface
species on the supported catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by conventional wet impregna-
tion of the γ -Al2O3 support (Engelhard) with aqueous solu-
tions of nickel nitrate, Ni(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Fisher), except in
the case of the NiTa catalyst, where an ethanol solution of
nickel acetate, Ni(C2H3O2)2 · 6H2O (Fisher), was used. The
promoted Al2O3-supported NiMe catalysts were prepared
by simultaneous impregnation, with the use of NH4VO3
(J.T. Baker), Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Merck), (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·
4H2O (Fisher), ammonium niobium oxalate (Aldrich), and
(CH3CH2O)5Ta (Aldrich) as precursor compounds for V,
Co, Mo, Nb, and Ta, respectively. The Me/Ni atomic ratio
was kept constant and equal to 0.176 in all samples. Mild
heating of the aqueous solutions ensured full dissolution of
the precursor salts. Before impregnation, the support was
crushed and sieved to a particle size of 106180 m. After
impregnation, the solvent was removed by evaporation under
reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was dried overnight
at 120 C and calcined in synthetic air at 450 C for 5 h. The
unpromoted catalysts are referred to as xNiAl, where x in-
dicates the weight percentage of Ni related to the weight of
the catalyst, and the promoted samples are referred to as Ni
Me, where Me indicates the promoting metal (V, Co, Mo,
Nb, and Ta). The total metal weight loading of the catalysts
did not exceed 30 wt% in any sample.
Nickel aluminate (NiAl2O4), used as a reference com-
pound, was prepared as described in the literature [19] by co-
precipitation of a stoichiometric mixture of aluminum and
nickel nitrate with 1 M NH4OH solution to a final pH of 8.
After filtering, washing, and drying, the precipitate was cal-
cined in synthetic air at 900 C for 11 h.
The NiO(II) reference compound was provided by Acros
Organics and used without further treatment.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Surface areas of the samples were determined by N2 ad-
sorption at 77 K, with the multipoint BET analysis method,
with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome flow apparatus. Before
the measurements, the samples were dehydrated in vacuum
at 250 C overnight.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a
Siemens D500 diffractometer employing Cu-Kα radiation.
The reduction characteristics of the catalysts were stud-
ied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-H2) on a Stanton-
Redcroft STA750 thermobalance. Typically, 2030 mg of
the sample was loaded into an alumina crucible, and the
temperature was raised from room temperature to 1100 C
at a heating rate of 20 C/min, in a 10% H2/He flow
(20 cm3/min). The system was maintained isothermally at
1100 C for 15 min.
Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra (UV-DRS) were re-
corded in the 50,00011,000 cm1 range on a JASCO V-550
UV/vis spectrophotometer.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed with a Kratos AXIS HSi instrument e-
quipped with a charge neutralizer and a Mg-Kα X-ray
source. Spectra were recorded at normal emission, with
an analyzer pass energy of 20 eV and X-ray power of
225 W. Before spectral acquisition samples were outgassed
overnight in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer.
Each spectral region was signal-averaged for 20 scans to
obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Peak fitting involved a
Shirley background subtraction and subsequent deconvolu-
tion with the use of mixed GaussianLorentzian functions.

Fitting was performed with CASAXPS, Version 2.0.35, us-
ing the minimum number of peaks required to minimize the
R-factor. Binding energies were referenced to C 1s of ad-
ventitious carbon at 285 eV.
2.3. Reactivity studies
The catalytic performance of the samples was measured
in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. The catalyst particles were di-
luted with an equal amount of quartz particles of the same
size to achieve isothermal operation. The temperature in the
middle of the catalytic bed was measured with a coaxial ther-
mocouple. The samples were activated in flowing oxygen at
450 C for 30 min. The composition of the reaction mixture
used was C2H6/O2/He = 7:7:63.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was investi-
gated in the temperature range from 300 to 500 C. For the
determination of the activity of the catalysts as a function
of temperature, the weight of the sample was 0.7 g and the
total flow was 77 cm3/min. To obtain different ethane con-
version levels at constant reaction temperature (400 C), the
W/F ratio was varied from 0.02 to 1.33 g s/cm3. Com-
plementary experiments investigating the reactivity of the
catalysts toward the main product of interest, ethene, were
also conducted. For the ethene oxidation experiments, the
reaction conditions were kept identical to the ethane ODH
experiments (T = 300500 C, 0.7 g catalyst, total flow
77 cm3/min, reaction mixture composition C2H4/O2/He =
7:7:63).
The reaction products were analyzed on-line with a
PerkinElmer gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector (TCD). Two columns in a series-by-
pass configuration were used in the analysis: a Porapak Q
and a MS 5A. The main reaction products were C2H4, CO2,
CO, and H2O. Negligible amounts of oxygenates were ob-
served at the reactor exit. The ethane/ethene conversion and
the selectivity to the reaction products were calculated on a
carbon basis. Closure of the carbon mass balance was better
than 1%.
The contribution of gas-phase initiated reactions was
tested with experiments using an empty-volume reactor. The
conversion of ethane/ethene at these experiments was lower

than 1%, confirming that gas-phase reactions are negligible
at the experimental conditions used for the activity tests.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The composition and physico-chemical characteristics of
the prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. For the unpro-
moted catalysts, deposition of Ni on Al2O3 caused a grad-
ual decrease in the specific surface area expressed per gram
of catalyst, which drops from 184 m2/g for pure calcined
γ -Al2O3 to 137 m2/g for the highest loading 24NiAl cata-
lyst. However, the values of the surface area expressed per
gram of support remain virtually unchanged, indicating that
this apparent decrease is only a result of the fact that the
deposited nickel does not contribute to the surface area. Pro-
motion of the catalysts also did not cause significant varia-
tions in the surface area, except in the case of the NiNb and
NiTa catalysts, where an increase was recorded. This latter
observation was in line with expectations, since the Nb and
Ta precursors have an organic nature and their decomposi-
tion during calcination should yield a more porous structure
than for the inorganic nitrate precursor salts.
Investigation of the crystalline phases present in the cat-
alysts was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The resulting diffractograms appear in Fig. 1. All samples
exhibited diffraction lines characteristic of the γ -Al2O3 sup-
port. For the 8NiAl catalyst, no Ni-containing phases were
detected, indicating a well-dispersed, amorphous nickel
structure on the surface of the support [20]. As the load-
ing increases to 15 wt% Ni, diffraction lines at 2θ 43.3,
162

63, 75.5, and 79.5originating from bulk NiO begin to
appear, becoming sharper and more intense in the 24NiAl
sample, indicating larger nickel oxide particles with high
crystallinity. Indeed, with the use of Scherrers formula, av-
erage NiO particle sizes of 8 and 15 nm were found for the
15NiAl and 24NiAl catalysts, respectively. Bulk NiAl2O4
was not detected by XRD, as shown by the diffractogram of
the pure phase that is included for comparison in Fig. 1.
The monolayer dispersion capacity of NiO on Al2O3 has
been reported to range from 13 to 20 wt% Ni loading, as
determined by ion scattering spectroscopy [21], XRD [22],
and XPS [23]. The appearance of crystalline NiO in the
15NiAl sample indicates saturation of the alumina surface
by two-dimensional Ni species and the genesis of multi-
layer/crystalline nickel phases.
The diffraction patterns of the promoted NiMe catalysts
are also illustrated in Fig. 1. Again, only diffraction lines
corresponding to crystalline NiO and Al2O3 were detected
on the catalysts, except in the case of NiCo, where a small
fraction of CoAl2O4 spinel phase was identified. Although
NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 spinels give similar diffraction pat-
terns, the lines at 2θ 59and 65in the diffractogram of the
NiCo catalyst can be clearly assigned to cobalt aluminate,
compared with the corresponding shifted lines of NiAl2O4
at 60and 66, respectively. However, the amount and size
of the NiO crystallites (see Table 1) formed vary for the dif-
ferent promoters, even though the weight percentage of Ni
loading remains essentially constant (with the exception of
NiTa catalyst). It seems that the introduction of promot-
ing metals causes additional segregation of the nickel phase,
with the largest effect induced by niobium, with NiO crystals
of 26.5 nm.
Thermogravimetric analysis in the presence of a reduc-
tive atmosphere (TGA-H2) was used to assess the reduction
behavior of the prepared catalysts. The differential weight
loss versus temperature allows the extraction of the reduc-
tion curves presented in Figs. 2A and 2B. The reduction
profiles of the unsupported NiO and NiAl2O4 are also shown
(Fig. 2A). Pure NiO exhibits a sharp reduction peak at
370 C, whereas NiAl2O4 is much harder to reduce, exhibit-
ing a broader peak with a maximum at 870 C. For all un-
promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, a single broad reduction peak
in the 490560 C range was recorded, with the T max of
reduction shifting to lower temperature with increasing Ni
loading. These results confirm the strong metalsupport in-
teraction between nickel and alumina. The high temperature
peak of the lowest loading 8NiAl catalyst could be attributed
to surface nickel aluminate-like spinel species formed on the
surface of the catalyst. The decrease in the reduction tem-
perature maximum and the broad peaks recorded for the
15NiAl and 24NiAl catalysts are a result of contributions
from strongly interacting surface nickel aluminate species
and NiO crystallites (detected by XRD) accommodated on
top of the nickel/alumina interface.
Many authors have postulated the existence of a surface
spinel on the interface of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Lo Jacono et

al. [24] proposed that this surface spinel accommodates
nickel ions in octahedral and tetrahedral sites. According to
Wu and Hercules [21], tetrahedrally coordinated nickel ions
are hard to reduce, whereas octahedral nickel ions are read-
ily reduced species, with the Nitetr/Nioct ratio decreasing
with increasing loading. This rearrangement of nickel ions
in octahedral sites with increasing loading could explain the
shift in the temperature of reduction observed over the un-
promoted catalysts.
The introduction of the promoters induces significant
changes in the reduction characteristics of the materials
(Fig. 2B). Incorporation of the early transition metals V and
Mo stimulates similar changes and shifts the temperature
maximum at 445 C, while the reduction profiles become
narrower than in the case of the 24NiAl catalyst. The NiCo
catalyst is reduced at an even lower temperature range; how-

ever, the peak is rather broad, with a maximum at 370 C and
shoulders at 300 and 490 C. Cobalt, which is itself very re-
ducible, seems also to significantly promote reduction of Ni
species at lower temperature. The TPR profile of the NiNb
catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima
at 335 and 510 C. Experiments performed with the Nb2O5
