Abstract. Co-free LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst with the self-regenerative function of Pd was 
developed.  This technology was named the intelligent catalyst.  Suppression capacity for Pd 
particle growth and catalytic activity of the Co-free perovskite LaFePdO3 were compared with those 
of LaFeCoPdO3. It was confirmed that Pd particles on LaFePdO3 maintained a nano-particle size by 
the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C, and 
LaFePdO3 demonstrated an excellent light-off performance.  Further, the design configuration for 
LaFePdO3 in the washcoat was investigated to maximize the self-regenerative function under 
practical conditions.   
1. Introduction 
Regulations for automobile emissions are being strengthened on a worldwide scale for global and 
regional environmental protection.  From now on, the main area for improvements in catalytic 
activity at cold starting, especially for HC, will be in catalyst technologies.  In order to reduce cold 
emissions, the addition of excessive amounts of precious metals to the catalyst has proved effective.  
Thus todays conventional catalysts use larger amounts of precious metals.  In order to prevent this 
excess use of precious metals, we have been developing a LaFeCoPdO3 perovskite catalyst so as to 
maximize a function whereby catalysts can regenerate themselves during the lifetime of a vehicle 
without any auxiliary treatment.  This technology was named the intelligent catalyst [1, 2].  The 
intelligent catalyst has been successfully adapted for commercialization, meeting the Japan SU-LEV, 
as well as U-LEV standard while using much less precious metals than conventional catalysts 
without a self-regenerative function.  In the present paper, the catalytic activity and the capacity for 
Pd particle growth suppression in a new cobalt-free intelligent catalyst were investigated under 
practical conditions for automotive applications.  The practical catalyst design for LaFePdO3 
perovskite was also discussed.   
2.  Experimental 
2.1. Preparation of Catalyst  
A Pd-containing perovskite powder catalyst was prepared by the alkoxide method [1-4].  Metal 
ethoxyethylates, M3+ (OC2H4OC2H5)3, of La, Fe were dissolved in toluene, a precipitate containing 
Pd was obtained by using a diluted palladium nitrate aqueous solution during hydrolysis, and after 
drying, the precursor was calcined at 700 C for 4 h in air to obtain a perovskite powder catalyst

containing Pd homogeneously.  A perovskite catalyst containing Co was also prepared for 
comparison by the same method, and a Pd/Al2O3 powder catalyst was prepared as a reference.   
Each perovskite powder catalyst was coated onto two kinds of cordierite monolithic honeycombs.  
The specification of sample pieces for fundamental research was 80 mm dia. x 95 mm in length 
(internal volume of 477 cm3).  The amount of Pd was adjusted at 3.24 mg · cm-3 (Table 1).  The 
main characteristics of practical-scale catalysts for practical 
applications 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
2, 
and 
the 
configurations for their washcoats are illustrated in Figs. 1 a 
and b.  The amount of precious metals in the intelligent 
catalyst was set at two thirds the amount of precious metals 
found in conventional catalysts.    
2.2. Engine Aging Treatment   
The sample pieces were aged at 900 C (catalyst inlet 
temperature) for 100 h in exhaust gas from a real engine.  
During exposure, two exhaust gas conditions were alternated: 
an atmosphere with large redox fluctuations (A/F =  4% at 
0.6 Hz) around the stoichiometric point was applied for 870 s, 
then an oxidizing atmosphere for 30 s [2].  The 
practical-scale catalysts were attached to an engine and 
exposed to high-temperature exhaust gas [4].  The catalysts 
were aged in a 30-second-cycle at temperatures reaching up 
to 1050 C (Fig. 2).  This cycle was repeated for 40 h.   
 
2.3. Characterization 
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) of the sample pieces was measured at bending-magnet beam 
line BL01B1 of the 8-GeV synchrotron radiation source in SPring-8 [2, 3].  Pd particles of the 
sample pieces, after aging at 900 C for 100 h and cooling down in a reductive atmosphere, were 
observed by high resolution TEM.  The catalytic activity of the sample pieces after aging at 900 C 
for 100 h in the actual engine exhaust was investigated.  The switching light-off test is a method of 
measuring the activation response from cold ambient.  Hot gas at 470 C was rapidly introduced 
into the monolithic catalysts which had been retained at 25 C by switching the gas flow from the 
bypass to the catalytic converter [3].  The space velocity (the flow rate) at the catalyst inlet was 
maintained at 100,000 h-1 and the air-to-fuel ratio was set at the stoichiometic point.  In the emission 
test for practical-scale catalysts after aging at 1,050C for 40 h, the catalytic activity during cold start 
was evaluated in accordance with the driving cycle used to establish Japanese emissions regulations 
by the driving mode simulation dynamometer [5].   
3.  Results and Discussion   
3.1.  XAFS Analysis for LaFePdO3  
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Pd K-edge for LaFePdO3 and 
LaFeCoPdO3 catalysts after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C for 100 h and cooling down in a 
reductive atmosphere, are shown in Fig. 3.  Due to the cooling down in a reductive atmosphere, Pd 
segregated out from the perovskite lattice to form metal particles.  The edge position both of

LaFePdO3 and LaFeCoPdO3 were identical to that of the Pd-foil, 
suggesting that Pd is in a metallic state.   
The radial structure functions around Pd were calculated by 
Fourier Transform of extended X-ray absorption fine structure 
(EXAFS) oscillations (Fig. 4).  The peak of Pd-Pd shell was a 
position equal to that of the Pd foil, but the peak height was low.  
From the broad peak of LaFeCoPdO3, it was considered that Pd 
particles were alloyed with Co.  The local structure parameters 
were evaluated by nonlinear least squares fitting as shown in 
Table 3.  The Pd of the aged LaFePdO3 was in the 8.3-fold 
coordination with Pd.  The average of coordination number 
decreases as surface-to-bulk ratio increases, because the 
coordination number of surface atom is smaller than that in the 
bulk [6].  The average coordination number for a cube, which 
consists of fcc unit cells with lattice constant a, is derived in 
consideration of the surface-to-bulk ratio only:

where the edge length of the cube is L = na.  From N (n) = 8.3, 
the average particle size L of Pd particle is roughly estimated to 
be about 1.1 nm.  The results of XAFS analysis indicates that the Pd particle of Co-free LaFePdO3 
catalyst maintained an extremely small size after aging in engine exhaust gas at 900 C for 100 h.   
 
The parameter marked with * was fixed. 
3.2.  Observation of Pd particles

particles,

atmosphere.  Although the particles 
of Pd on Al2O3 enlarged up to 120 nm, 
Pd metallic particles on LaFePdO3 
maintained the small particle size of 1 
nm or less in diameter.  It shows a 
very good agreement with the result 
from the XAFS analysis.  It is 
confirmed that LaFePdO3 has a far 
better ability for the suppression of Pd 
particle growth, than that of LaFeCoPdO3.   
3.3.  Activity of Sample Pieces   
The switching light-off performances of the sample pieces are 
shown in Fig. 6.  LaFePdO3 showed the fastest light-off 
performance of all samples.  The light-off performance was in the 
order LaFePdO3 > LaFeCoPdO3 > Pd / Al2O3.

precious metals and support materials was sought [5, 7-10].  To 
maximize the self-regenerative function under practical conditions, all 
the technologies of advanced catalyst were utilized into LaFePdO3.  
The behavior of HC emissions during the starting-up a Japanese 11 
driving mode was shown in Fig. 7.  Even though the precious metal 
loading of the intelligent catalyst is lower than that of the conventional 
one, the intelligent catalyst reduced the amount of cold HC 
emissions by 23% compared to the conventional catalyst even after 
aging at 1,050C for 40 h.  We confirmed that the improved 
intelligent catalyst could function well under actual conditions, and note that the intelligent catalyst 
gave an excellent light-off performance.  LaFePdO3 demonstrated excellent light off performance 
because segregated Pd particles of LaFePdO3 were minutely dispersed even after aging in engine 
exhaust.   
Summary 
A Co-free Pd-perovskite, LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3, catalyst was found to demonstrate excellent light off 
performance and suppression of the particle growth of Pd even after aging in engine exhaust gas at 
900 C for 100 h.  It is confirmed that Pd particles on LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 maintained the small size of 
1 nm or less in diameter by the results of XAFS analysis and TEM observation.  This practical 
intelligent catalyst, designed to maximize its self-regenerative function, maintained excellent 
catalytic activity even after accelerated aging reaching up to 1050 C.  The intelligent catalyst was 
successfully adapted for practical use, meeting the Japan SU-LEV, as well as U-LEV standards while 
using much less precious metals than conventional catalysts prepared without a self-regenerative 
function.
