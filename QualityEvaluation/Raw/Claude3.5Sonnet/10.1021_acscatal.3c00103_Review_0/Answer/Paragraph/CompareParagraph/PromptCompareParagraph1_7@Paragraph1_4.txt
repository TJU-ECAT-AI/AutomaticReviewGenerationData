The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production has been driven by the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. PDH techniques address these challenges by offering a direct and efficient route to produce propylene from propane, capitalizing on the growing availability of propane from shale gas reserves [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508]. This approach provides a more targeted and flexible production method compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes, which produce propylene as a by-product with low yields [10.1002/cctc.202001640].

The development of PDH processes has focused on both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation techniques. Non-oxidative PDH has been successfully commercialized and is currently the only industrially operated process [10.1039/D1GC03700E]. However, the catalysts used in these processes, typically based on platinum or chromium oxides, face significant challenges related to rapid deactivation due to coke formation, high costs, and environmental concerns [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3].

To address these issues, researchers have been developing innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at enhancing stability, improving recyclability, and overcoming deactivation challenges. Some of the key approaches include:

1. Development of alternative catalysts: Researchers are exploring new catalyst formulations, such as ZnO-based catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites, which offer improved selectivity, stability, and environmental compatibility compared to traditional Pt and Cr-based catalysts [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].

2. Single atom/site catalysts: This concept has been applied to Pt catalysts, achieving both good activity and impressive stability by exploiting the size-dependent nature of side reactions [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331].

3. Confined metal clusters: Subnanometer PtSn clusters confined in zeolites allow for precise control over size and location of catalytic sites, leading to improved stability and coke resistance [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331].

4. Bimetallic systems: Combining platinum with other metals like Cu or Sn has shown to increase selectivity towards propylene and reduce coke formation [10.1039/C5SC01227A].

5. Support engineering: The use of high-silica HZSM-5 supports has demonstrated enhanced dispersion of active species and improved catalytic activity [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].

6. Promoter addition: Introduction of promoters such as Sn, Ga, and other elements has been shown to increase robustness against coking and improve overall catalyst performance [10.1039/C5SC01227A].

7. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This approach aims to overcome thermodynamic limitations and decrease carbon deposition, although it faces challenges related to over-oxidation of propene [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004].

8. CO2-assisted PDH: The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant offers environmental advantages, although current catalysts show lower propene yields compared to traditional PDH methods [10.1039/D1GC03700E].

These strategies collectively aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes. By addressing issues such as coke formation, sintering, and poor regeneration ability, researchers are working towards developing catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity over extended periods, reducing the need for frequent regeneration cycles [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalyst design reflect a shift towards more sustainable and efficient propylene production methods. The focus on developing catalysts with improved stability, selectivity, and recyclability addresses the key challenges faced by the petrochemical industry in meeting the growing demand for propylene.

Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilizing cutting-edge analytical methods to gain deeper insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions, potentially leading to more rational catalyst design approaches.

2. Hybrid processes: Exploring combinations of different PDH techniques, such as integrating membrane reactors with oxidative dehydrogenation, to leverage the advantages of multiple approaches.

3. Machine learning and computational modeling: Employing these tools to predict catalyst performance and guide the development of novel catalyst formulations.

4. Scale-up and process intensification: Developing strategies to efficiently translate promising lab-scale catalysts to industrial-scale production while optimizing process conditions for maximum efficiency and sustainability.

5. Circular economy integration: Investigating ways to incorporate PDH processes into broader circular economy frameworks, potentially utilizing waste streams as feedstocks or developing closed-loop regeneration processes for spent catalysts.

These future directions could lead to breakthrough technologies that not only meet the increasing demand for propylene but also align with global sustainability goals and changing energy landscapes.

This approach provides a more targeted and selective production method compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes, which produce propylene as a by-product [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].

The development of PDH technology has been accompanied by significant efforts to overcome catalyst deactivation challenges through innovative design strategies. These strategies aim to enhance stability and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. Some key approaches include:

1. Alternative catalyst development: Researchers are exploring new catalysts to replace the traditional Pt- and Cr-based systems, which suffer from high costs, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. For example, ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites have shown promising results, offering high selectivity, stability, and reusability [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].

2. Single atom/site catalysts: This concept has been applied to Pt catalysts, achieving both good activity and impressive stability. By exploiting the size-dependent nature of side reactions, these catalysts maintain high activity for propane dehydrogenation while minimizing coke-forming side reactions [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331].

3. Confined metal clusters: Subnanometer PtSn clusters confined in zeolites allow for precise control over size and location of catalytic sites, leading to improved stability and coke resistance [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331].

4. Promoter introduction: The addition of promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn and Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides has been shown to increase robustness against coking [10.1039/C5SC01227A].

5. Support modification: Researchers are exploring different support materials and modifying existing ones to enhance catalyst stability and activity. For instance, the use of high-silica HZSM-5 as a support for ZnO catalysts has shown improved dispersion of active species and reduced deactivation [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].

6. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This approach aims to overcome thermodynamic limitations and decrease carbon deposition. However, it faces challenges with overoxidation and unwanted by-product formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004].

7. CO2-assisted PDH: The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant offers environmental advantages and has shown promise in enhancing propene formation rates [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018].

These innovative strategies have led to significant improvements in catalyst performance, stability, and recyclability. For example, the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst has demonstrated high propane conversion (43%) and excellent propylene selectivity (93%) even after 10 hours of reaction, with good reuse performance over multiple cycles [10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of PDH technology represents a paradigm shift in propylene production, driven by the need for more efficient and sustainable processes in the face of changing global energy landscapes. The innovative catalyst design strategies discussed above not only address the immediate challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability but also pave the way for future advancements in the field.

Looking forward, we can anticipate several key areas of development:

1. Advanced materials science: The continued exploration of novel materials, including metal-organic frameworks, 2D materials, and nanostructured composites, could lead to breakthrough catalysts with unprecedented performance and stability.

2. In-situ regeneration techniques: Development of more efficient and less energy-intensive regeneration methods could significantly improve the overall economics and sustainability of PDH processes.

3. Process intensification: Integration of PDH with other processes, such as membrane separation or chemical looping, could lead to more compact and efficient production systems.

4. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: These tools could accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization, potentially uncovering new catalyst compositions and structures that human researchers might overlook.

5. Green hydrogen production: As the hydrogen economy grows, PDH processes could be integrated with hydrogen capture and utilization systems, creating synergies between propylene production and clean energy initiatives.

6. Circular economy approaches: Development of catalysts capable of efficiently converting plastic waste back into propylene could create a closed-loop system for polymer production and recycling.

These future directions highlight the potential for PDH technology to not only meet the growing demand for propylene but also to contribute to broader sustainability goals in the chemical industry. As research continues to advance, we can expect PDH to play an increasingly important role in the evolving landscape of petrochemical production.
