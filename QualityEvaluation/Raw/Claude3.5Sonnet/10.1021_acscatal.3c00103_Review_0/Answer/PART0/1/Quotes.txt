[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."

[5] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application."

[6] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[7] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."

[8] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."

[9] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2. Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."

[10] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical"

[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration"

[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."

[4] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."

[5] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."

[6] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

[7] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

[1] "Market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2 → H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2 → CnH2n + H2O."

[5] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

[6] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors."

[7] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation."

[8] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[9] "VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield. Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s)."

[10] "NiOx is a non-stoichiometric oxide, and the Ni-center has various oxidation states. The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes."

[11] "Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the C–H activation step."

[12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."

[13] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."

[14] "CeO2/2CeF3 displays the best performance with very high propene selectivity, even without Li doping."

[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[6] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[7] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."

[8] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."

[2] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[3] "The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."

[4] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[5] "This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size."

[6] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[7] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[8] "In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

[2] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

[5] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed"

[6] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis"

[7] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

[8] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."

[7] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[8] "A VOx catalyst covered with hydroxyl groups possesses a lower PDH activity and a lower coke deposition rate compared with those without hydroxyl groups."

[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[1] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[3] "The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. The propane dehydrogenation is not a size-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent. This difference opened the opportunity which can achieve good activity and reduce cokes by diminishing side reactions from the rational adjustment of catalyst size."

[4] "Recently, Corma's group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.5−0.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

[5] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."

[6] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."

[7] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation. Consequently, the cokes are largely diminished as evidenced by the lifetime of the catalyst."

[8] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Here we report that the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be used to support ZnO catalysts for the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

[7] "The cycling testing results of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in PDH are presented in Fig. 9a. After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH"

[6] "Promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."

[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[5] "Several advanced catalyst design strategies, such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, have been introduced."

[6] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[5] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes."

[6] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

[1] "The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas."

[2] "Currently, albeit with the favorable thermodynamic condition achieved in the oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) approach, a poor propane utilization ratio and low propylene yield are usually detected on account of the complex reaction atmosphere."

[3] "In contrast, the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique with simple reaction components has already been put into industrial production."

[4] "Some catalysts with high catalytic activity often suffer from rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability on account of coke accumulation and/or sintering of active compounds under the high temperature required in the reaction and regeneration processes."

[5] "To alleviate the catalytic deactivation and increase the potential for practical applications, plentiful researchers have been dedicated to transforming this situation and have already thought out certain optimized strategies."

[6] "Various design strategies are usually entangled and may have different effects on the catalytic performance depending on different catalytic systems. We endeavor to deconvolute the complicated catalytic systems that may interlace more than one synthetic strategy to understand how these strategies function. This section focusing on catalyst design will be divided into three parts: promoter introduction, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification."

[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[14] "CeO2/2CeF3 displays the best performance with very high propene selectivity, even without Li doping."

[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[6] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[7] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."

[8] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."

[2] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[3] "The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."

[4] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[5] "This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size."

[6] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[7] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[8] "In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

[2] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

[5] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed"

[6] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis"

[7] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

[8] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."

[7] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[8] "A VOx catalyst covered with hydroxyl groups possesses a lower PDH activity and a lower coke deposition rate compared with those without hydroxyl groups."

[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[1] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[3] "The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. The propane dehydrogenation is not a size-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent. This difference opened the opportunity which can achieve good activity and reduce cokes by diminishing side reactions from the rational adjustment of catalyst size."

[4] "Recently, Corma's group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.5−0.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

[5] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."

[6] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."

[7] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation. Consequently, the cokes are largely diminished as evidenced by the lifetime of the catalyst."

[8] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Here we report that the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be used to support ZnO catalysts for the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

[7] "The cycling testing results of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in PDH are presented in Fig. 9a. After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH"

[6] "Promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."

[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[5] "Several advanced catalyst design strategies, such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, have been introduced."

[6] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[5] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes."

[6] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

[1] "The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas."

[2] "Currently, albeit with the favorable thermodynamic condition achieved in the oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) approach, a poor propane utilization ratio and low propylene yield are usually detected on account of the complex reaction atmosphere."

[3] "In contrast, the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique with simple reaction components has already been put into industrial production."

[4] "Some catalysts with high catalytic activity often suffer from rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability on account of coke accumulation and/or sintering of active compounds under the high temperature required in the reaction and regeneration processes."

[5] "To alleviate the catalytic deactivation and increase the potential for practical applications, plentiful researchers have been dedicated to transforming this situation and have already thought out certain optimized strategies."

[6] "Various design strategies are usually entangled and may have different effects on the catalytic performance depending on different catalytic systems. We endeavor to deconvolute the complicated catalytic systems that may interlace more than one synthetic strategy to understand how these strategies function. This section focusing on catalyst design will be divided into three parts: promoter introduction, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification."
