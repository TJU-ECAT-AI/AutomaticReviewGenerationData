          [1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[6] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[7] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."

[8] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct route to produce propylene from propane, offering a more efficient and targeted approach compared to traditional steam cracking and catalytic cracking methods, which produce propylene as a by-product with low yields.

2. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, helping to meet the growing demand that traditional methods cannot satisfy.

3. PDH can utilize abundant propane resources, particularly from shale gas, as feedstock for propylene production.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Development of non-precious metal catalysts: Researchers are exploring alternatives to costly and scarce catalysts, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst mentioned in the literature.

2. Utilization of microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM): This novel approach allows for PDH reactions to occur at lower temperatures (e.g., 450°C instead of 550-700°C), potentially reducing coking, side reactions, and improving catalyst longevity.

3. Incorporation of promoters: Adding elements like Sn to catalysts has shown to improve selectivity and stability. The CoSn/NC catalyst demonstrated high propylene selectivity (75%) and showed no significant change after 180 minutes of operation.

4. Optimization of catalyst structure: The use of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) as a support material in the CoSn/NC catalyst may contribute to improved performance and stability.

5. Lowering activation energy: The microwave catalytic reaction mode significantly reduced the apparent activation energy of the CoSn/NC catalyst from 59.58 kJ/mol to 20.98 kJ/mol, indicating improved efficiency.

These strategies collectively aim to address the main challenges in PDH processes, including catalyst deactivation due to coking and sintering, high energy requirements, and the need for improved selectivity and stability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求不断增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种直接从丙烷生产丙烯的路径，与传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解方法相比，提供了更高效和有针对性的方法，后者将丙烯作为副产品生产，产率较低。

2. PDH允许定向生产丙烯，有助于满足传统方法无法满足的不断增长的需求。

3. PDH可以利用丰富的丙烷资源，特别是来自页岩气的丙烷，作为丙烯生产的原料。

正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，以克服PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，包括：

1. 开发非贵金属催化剂：研究人员正在探索替代昂贵和稀缺催化剂的方案，如文献中提到的CoSn/NC催化剂。

2. 利用微波催化反应模式（MCRM）：这种新方法允许PDH反应在较低温度下进行（如450°C而不是550-700°C），可能减少结焦、副反应，并提高催化剂寿命。

3. 添加助剂：向催化剂中添加如Sn等元素已被证明可以提高选择性和稳定性。CoSn/NC催化剂展示了高丙烯选择性（75%）和在180分钟运行后没有显著变化。

4. 优化催化剂结构：在CoSn/NC催化剂中使用氮掺杂碳（NC）作为载体材料可能有助于提高性能和稳定性。

5. 降低活化能：微波催化反应模式显著降低了CoSn/NC催化剂的表观活化能，从59.58 kJ/mol降至20.98 kJ/mol，表明效率得到提高。

这些策略集体旨在解决PDH过程中的主要挑战，包括由于结焦和烧结导致的催化剂失活、高能耗要求，以及在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中提高选择性和稳定性的需求。
