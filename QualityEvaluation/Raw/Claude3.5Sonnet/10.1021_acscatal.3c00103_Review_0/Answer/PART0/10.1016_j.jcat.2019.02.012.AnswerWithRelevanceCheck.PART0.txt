          [1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."

[2] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[3] "The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."

[4] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[5] "This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size."

[6] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[7] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[8] "In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method with high propene selectivity. To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Development of alternative catalysts: Researchers are exploring ZrO2-based catalysts as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives to traditional CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. These new catalysts show promising activity and selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane.

2. Tuning catalyst properties: A new strategy focuses on regulating the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts by controlling their phase composition (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size. This approach allows for fine-tuning of catalyst performance.

3. Creating active sites: Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are believed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. These can be created by doping zirconia with metal oxides, high-temperature reductive treatment, or loading small amounts of metal nanoparticles like Ru and Rh.

4. Optimizing crystal structure: Studies have shown that monoclinic ZrO2 exhibits higher activity and propene selectivity compared to tetragonal ZrO2. This is attributed to a higher ratio of Zrcus sites to coke-forming sites in the monoclinic structure.

5. Controlling crystallite size: Smaller crystallite sizes have been found to increase propene formation rates for both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in PDH processes, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供具有高丙烯选择性的定向生产方法来解决工业丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。为了克服失活问题并提高催化剂性能，正在开发几种创新策略：

1. 开发替代催化剂：研究人员正在探索基于ZrO2的催化剂，作为传统CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂的环保和成本效益高的替代品。这些新型催化剂在丙烷和丁烷的非氧化脱氢反应中表现出有前途的活性和选择性。

2. 调整催化剂性能：一种新策略专注于通过控制ZrO2催化剂的相组成（单斜相vs四方相）和晶粒尺寸来调节其活性和选择性。这种方法允许对催化剂性能进行精细调整。

3. 创建活性位点：配位不饱和的锆阳离子（Zrcus）被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。这些可以通过用金属氧化物掺杂氧化锆、高温还原处理或负载少量金属纳米粒子（如Ru和Rh）来形成。

4. 优化晶体结构：研究表明，单斜相ZrO2比四方相ZrO2表现出更高的活性和丙烯选择性。这归因于单斜结构中Zrcus位点与形成积炭位点的比率更高。

5. 控制晶粒尺寸：研究发现，对于单斜和四方ZrO2，较小的晶粒尺寸可以提高丙烯生成速率。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，改善可回收性，克服PDH过程中的失活问题，最终实现更高效和可持续的丙烯生产。
