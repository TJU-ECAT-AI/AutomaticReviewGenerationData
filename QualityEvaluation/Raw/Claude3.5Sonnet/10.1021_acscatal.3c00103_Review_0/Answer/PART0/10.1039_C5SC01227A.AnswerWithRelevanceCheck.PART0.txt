          [1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative process to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods, offering potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is becoming more attractive as propane supplies increase due to shale gas production.

3. PDH can be more selective for propylene production compared to traditional cracking methods.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Using promoters: Adding late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, or rare-earth metal oxides to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying: Combining platinum with other metals like Cu or Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene and reduce coke formation.

3. Optimizing catalyst supports: Exploring different support materials to enhance catalyst stability and activity.

4. Developing new catalyst formulations: Investigating novel catalyst compositions that balance activity, selectivity, and stability.

5. Process modifications: Implementing regeneration cycles or using oxidative dehydrogenation to mitigate coking and extend catalyst lifetime.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, particularly coking and deactivation, while maintaining or improving activity and selectivity for propylene production. Ongoing research in this field continues to explore new materials and methods to enhance catalyst performance and process efficiency.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法提供了一种替代工艺，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，具有潜在的盈利能力。

2. PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，随着页岩气生产导致丙烷供应增加，这种方法变得更具吸引力。

3. 与传统的裂解方法相比，PDH在丙烯生产上可以更具选择性。

为了克服失活问题并提高催化剂性能，正在开发几种创新策略：

1. 使用助剂：添加后过渡金属、主族金属（如Sn、Ga）、碱金属氧化物或稀土金属氧化物，以增加对结焦的抵抗力。

2. 合金化：将铂与其他金属如Cu或Sn结合，以提高对丙烯的选择性并减少积碳形成。

3. 优化催化剂载体：探索不同的载体材料以提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。

4. 开发新的催化剂配方：研究平衡活性、选择性和稳定性的新型催化剂组成。

5. 工艺改进：实施再生循环或使用氧化脱氢来减少结焦并延长催化剂寿命。

这些策略旨在解决PDH催化剂的主要挑战，特别是结焦和失活问题，同时保持或提高丙烯生产的活性和选择性。该领域的持续研究继续探索新材料和方法，以提高催化剂性能和工艺效率。
