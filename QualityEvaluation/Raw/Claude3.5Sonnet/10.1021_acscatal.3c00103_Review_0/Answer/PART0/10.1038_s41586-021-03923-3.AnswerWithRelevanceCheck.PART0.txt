          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the direct production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical.

To overcome the limitations of current commercial PDH technologies, which use either Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts that suffer from toxicity issues or require environmentally harmful chlorine for regeneration, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves the creation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

This new method involves forming supported ZnOx species in situ through a reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. Researchers have identified the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming active ZnOx species, which contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

The developed ZnO-based catalyst, specifically ZnOsilicalite-1, has shown promising results in terms of stability and performance. When tested under industrially relevant conditions for about 400 hours on propane stream, it demonstrated about three times higher propene productivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst analogue, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

These advancements in catalyst design for PDH processes contribute to addressing the challenges of increasing propylene demand by offering more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional production methods. While the literature does not explicitly discuss recyclability in oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, the environmentally compatible nature of the ZnO-based catalyst and its improved performance suggest potential advantages in terms of long-term use and reduced environmental impact.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种重要的替代油基裂解工艺的方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。这种方法允许直接生产丙烯，这是一种工业上重要的平台化学品。

为了克服当前商业PDH技术的局限性（这些技术使用含铬或含铂催化剂，存在毒性问题或需要环境有害的氯气进行再生），正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略涉及基于商业ZnO创建环境兼容的负载型催化剂。

这种新方法涉及通过在550°C以上还原处理过程中，ZnO产生的Zn原子与载体OH基团反应，原位形成负载的ZnOx物种。研究人员确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的关键作用，这有助于催化剂的有效性。

开发的基于ZnO的催化剂，特别是ZnOsilicalite-1，在稳定性和性能方面显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。在工业相关条件下测试约400小时的丙烷流中，与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂类似物相比，它显示出约三倍的丙烯生产力，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。

这些PDH过程中催化剂设计的进展，通过提供更高效、更稳定和更环保的替代方案，有助于解决丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。虽然文献没有明确讨论氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性，但基于ZnO的催化剂的环境兼容性和其改进的性能表明在长期使用和减少环境影响方面具有潜在优势。
