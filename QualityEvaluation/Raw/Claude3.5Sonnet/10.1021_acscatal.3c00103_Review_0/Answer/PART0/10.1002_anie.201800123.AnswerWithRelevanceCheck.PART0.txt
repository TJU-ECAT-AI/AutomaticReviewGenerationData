          [1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."

[7] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[8] "A VOx catalyst covered with hydroxyl groups possesses a lower PDH activity and a lower coke deposition rate compared with those without hydroxyl groups."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative, on-purpose production method for propylene, utilizing the abundant and low-cost propane from shale gas production.

2. It offers a more targeted approach compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. PDH allows for direct, targeted production of propylene from propane, which is more efficient than traditional methods.

4. The increased availability and low cost of propane from shale gas production has made PDH more commercially attractive.

5. PDH can be used as a standalone process for propylene production, offering more flexibility in meeting market demands.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes:

1. Supported vanadium catalysts are being explored as alternatives to expensive Pt-based and toxic CrOx-based catalysts, offering good activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

2. Research is focusing on understanding and manipulating the surface structure of catalysts, particularly the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups.

3. Studies have shown that hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts can improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

4. Advanced characterization techniques like in situ DRIFTS and computational methods such as DFT calculations are being employed to gain deeper insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

5. Balancing activity and stability: While catalysts with hydroxyl groups have lower initial activity, they also have lower coke deposition rates, leading to better long-term stability and potentially improved recyclability.

6. Tuning catalyst oxidation states: By controlling the pre-treatment and reaction conditions, researchers can influence the oxidation state of vanadium species on the catalyst surface, which affects both activity and stability.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing the key challenges in industrial propylene production.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为丙烯生产提供了一种替代性的、定向生产方法，利用了页岩气生产中丰富且低成本的丙烷。

2. 与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法相比，它提供了一种更有针对性的方法。

3. PDH允许直接从丙烷定向生产丙烯，这比传统方法更有效率。

4. 页岩气生产带来的丙烷供应增加和价格降低，使PDH在商业上更具吸引力。

5. PDH可以作为独立的丙烯生产过程，在满足市场需求方面提供更大的灵活性。

正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题、提高稳定性并改善PDH过程中的可回收性：

1. 正在探索支持的钒催化剂作为昂贵的铂基和有毒的铬基催化剂的替代品，提供良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

2. 研究重点是理解和操纵催化剂的表面结构，特别是表面结合羟基的作用。

3. 研究表明，VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的羟基可以通过抑制积碳沉积来提高稳定性，而积碳沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。

4. 正在采用先进的表征技术（如原位漫反射红外光谱）和计算方法（如密度泛函理论计算）来深入了解催化剂在反应条件下的行为。

5. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然带有羟基的催化剂初始活性较低，但它们的积碳速率也较低，从而导致更好的长期稳定性和潜在的改善可再生性。

6. 调节催化剂氧化态：通过控制预处理和反应条件，研究人员可以影响催化剂表面钒物种的氧化态，这影响了活性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在为氧化和非氧化PDH过程开发更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，解决工业丙烯生产中的关键挑战。
