          [1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[3] "The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. The propane dehydrogenation is not a size-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent. This difference opened the opportunity which can achieve good activity and reduce cokes by diminishing side reactions from the rational adjustment of catalyst size."

[4] "Recently, Corma's group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.5−0.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

[5] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."

[6] "The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."

[7] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation. Consequently, the cokes are largely diminished as evidenced by the lifetime of the catalyst."

[8] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a more efficient and selective on-purpose production method compared to traditional cracking processes, which are energy-intensive and have low selectivity.

2. It allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, utilizing abundant light alkanes from shale gas discoveries.

3. PDH has already been exploited in industry, demonstrating its viability for large-scale propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: These achieve good activity and impressive stability by exploiting the size-dependent nature of side reactions. Single Pt atoms or sites maintain high activity for propane dehydrogenation while minimizing coke-forming side reactions.

2. Confined metal clusters: Subnanometer PtSn clusters confined in zeolites, such as those developed by Corma's group, allow for precise control over size and location of catalytic sites, leading to improved stability and coke resistance.

3. Bimetallic systems: Single Pt atoms surrounded by inert metals like Cu significantly reduce the barrier for propene desorption, making product desorption more favorable than deep dehydrogenation, thus diminishing coke formation.

4. Support engineering: Unique interactions between the catalyst and support, as seen in confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, can lead to excellent resistance to coke formation.

5. Promoter addition: Elements like Sn are used to modify the catalytic properties of Pt, potentially increasing both activity and stability.

These strategies primarily aim to address the challenge of coke formation, which severely undermines catalytic performance and stability in PDH processes. By developing catalysts that are more resistant to coking or can better manage coke formation, researchers are working to improve the overall efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH catalysts for industrial applications.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. 与传统的能源密集型且选择性低的裂解工艺相比，PDH提供了一种更高效和选择性的定向生产方法。

2. 它允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，利用页岩气发现带来的丰富轻烷烃资源。

3. PDH已经在工业中得到应用，证明了其大规模生产丙烯的可行性。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 单原子/位点催化剂：这些催化剂通过利用副反应的尺寸依赖性来实现良好的活性和显著的稳定性。单个铂原子或位点保持丙烷脱氢的高活性，同时最大限度地减少形成焦炭的副反应。

2. 受限金属簇：限制在沸石中的亚纳米PtSn簇，如Corma小组开发的那些，允许精确控制催化位点的大小和位置，从而提高稳定性和抗焦性。

3. 双金属系统：被惰性金属（如铜）包围的单个铂原子显著降低了丙烯脱附的能垒，使产物脱附比深度脱氢更有利，从而减少焦炭形成。

4. 载体工程：催化剂和载体之间的独特相互作用，如在沸石中受限的亚纳米铂簇所表现的那样，可以导致优异的抗焦炭形成能力。

5. 助剂添加：使用锡等元素来改变铂的催化性能，潜在地提高活性和稳定性。

这些策略主要旨在解决焦炭形成的挑战，焦炭形成严重影响PDH过程中的催化性能和稳定性。通过开发更能抵抗焦炭或更好地管理焦炭形成的催化剂，研究人员正在努力提高PDH催化剂在工业应用中的整体效率、稳定性和可回收性。
