          [1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."

[5] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application."

[6] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[7] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."

[8] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."

[9] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2. Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."

[10] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct, on-purpose route to produce propylene, helping to fill the supply gap that cannot be met by existing steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.

2. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes have been developed, using various oxidants like O2, CO2, and N2O, expanding the options for propylene production.

3. Direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is currently the only commercially operated PDH process, using chromium oxide or platinum-tin oxide catalysts. However, these catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coking and require frequent regeneration.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen (ODH-O2) avoids coke formation but can lead to overoxidation, limiting propylene yield.

5. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-CO2) offers environmental benefits but currently suffers from low propene yields compared to DDH and ODH-O2.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability include:

1. Focusing on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking in DDH catalysts.

2. Exploring new support materials and promoters to improve catalyst stability and reduce precious metal usage.

3. Developing boron-based catalysts for ODH-O2, which show significant promise for commercial application.

4. Improving selectivity to propene in DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts.

5. Addressing the low intrinsic activity of ODH-CO2 catalysts with respect to CO2 activation.

6. Investigating supported nanoparticle catalysts and intermetallic compounds as alternatives to conventional oxide catalysts.

7. Developing catalysts with balanced acid-base properties to promote propane activation and propene desorption while minimizing side reactions.

These strategies aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the growing demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of current technologies.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种直接、定向的丙烯生产路线，有助于填补现有蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足的供应缺口。

2. 开发了氧化和非氧化PDH工艺，使用O2、CO2和N2O等各种氧化剂，扩大了丙烯生产的选择范围。

3. 直接脱氢（DDH）目前是唯一商业运营的PDH工艺，使用氧化铬或铂-氧化锡催化剂。然而，这些催化剂面临着由于结焦造成的快速失活，需要频繁再生。

4. 氧气氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）避免了结焦形成，但可能导致过度氧化，限制了丙烯产率。

5. 二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）提供了环境效益，但目前丙烯产率比DDH和ODH-O2低一个数量级。

为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 专注于减少导致DDH催化剂结焦的深度脱氢反应。

2. 探索新的载体材料和助剂，以提高催化剂稳定性并减少贵金属使用量。

3. 开发用于ODH-O2的硼基催化剂，这些催化剂在商业应用方面显示出重大前景。

4. 提高DDH和ODH-O2催化剂对丙烯的选择性。

5. 解决ODH-CO2催化剂在CO2活化方面的低内在活性问题。

6. 研究负载纳米粒子催化剂和金属间化合物作为传统氧化物催化剂的替代品。

7. 开发具有平衡酸碱性质的催化剂，以促进丙烷活化和丙烯脱附，同时最小化副反应。

这些策略旨在为PDH工艺创造更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，满足不断增长的丙烯需求，同时克服当前技术的局限性。
