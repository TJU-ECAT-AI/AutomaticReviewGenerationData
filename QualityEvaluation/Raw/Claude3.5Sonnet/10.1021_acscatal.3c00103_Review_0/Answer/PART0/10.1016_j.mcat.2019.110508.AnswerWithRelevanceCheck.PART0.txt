          [1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Here we report that the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be used to support ZnO catalysts for the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

[7] "The cycling testing results of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in PDH are presented in Fig. 9a. After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct and efficient method to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant due to shale gas exploitation. This approach offers an alternative to traditional production methods that may be limited or less efficient.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One promising approach is the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. These catalysts offer several advantages:

1. Improved selectivity and stability: The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst shows high propane conversion (43%) and excellent propylene selectivity (93%) even after 10 hours of reaction.

2. Low cost and environmental friendliness: Unlike traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable.

3. Enhanced dispersion of active species: The high-silica HZSM-5 support, with its high specific surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined structure, helps disperse Zn species effectively throughout the support, directly related to improved catalytic activity.

4. Reduced deactivation: The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 significantly improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions.

5. Improved reusability: Cycling tests show that the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst maintains high propylene selectivity (around 90%) even after multiple cycles, with only a slight decrease in initial propane conversion, indicating good reuse performance.

These innovative catalyst design strategies aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the limitations of traditional catalysts and potentially enabling more widespread industrial applications of PDH for propylene production.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种从丙烷直接高效生产丙烯的方法来解决工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战，而丙烷由于页岩气的开发而变得丰富。这种方法为可能受限或效率较低的传统生产方法提供了一种替代选择。

为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。一种有前景的方法是使用负载在高硅HZSM-5分子筛上的ZnO催化剂。这些催化剂提供了几个优势：

1. 提高选择性和稳定性：10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂即使在反应10小时后仍然表现出高丙烷转化率（43%）和优异的丙烯选择性（93%）。

2. 低成本和环境友好：与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂不同，后者昂贵且有毒，ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂成本低、无毒且可重复使用。

3. 增强活性物种的分散性：高硅HZSM-5载体具有高比表面积、大孔体积和明确的结构，有助于Zn物种在整个载体中有效分散，这与改善的催化活性直接相关。

4. 降低失活：高硅HZSM-5的良好调节酸度通过促进丙烯脱附和最小化副反应，显著提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。

5. 提高可重复使用性：循环测试表明，10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂即使在多次循环后仍保持高丙烯选择性（约90%），初始丙烷转化率仅略有下降，表明具有良好的重复使用性能。

这些创新的催化剂设计策略旨在为PDH过程创造更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，解决传统催化剂的局限性，并有可能使PDH在丙烯生产中得到更广泛的工业应用。
