Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative to traditional oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the direct production of propene from propane, which is an industrially important platform chemical.

To overcome the limitations of traditional PDH catalysts, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. Conventional PDH technologies use Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts, which have environmental and ecological drawbacks due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds and the need for harmful chlorine in catalyst regeneration.

A new approach involves the development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This method creates supported ZnOx species through an in situ reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C.

The newly developed ZnO-based catalyst has shown promising results in terms of stability and productivity. When tested under industrially relevant conditions for about 400 hours on propane stream, the ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst demonstrated about three times higher propene productivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogue, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

This innovative catalyst design strategy addresses the issues of deactivation, enhances stability, and improves overall performance in the PDH process, potentially offering a more sustainable and efficient method for propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)通过提供一种替代传统石油裂解工艺的方法来应对工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。这种方法允许直接从丙烷生产丙烯，这是一种工业上重要的平台化学品。

为了克服传统PDH催化剂的局限性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。传统的PDH技术使用含铬或含铂的催化剂，由于Cr(VI)化合物的毒性和催化剂再生需要使用有害氯，这些催化剂存在环境和生态方面的缺点。

一种新方法涉及开发基于商业ZnO的环境兼容支持催化剂。这种方法通过550°C以上还原处理过程中ZnO生成的Zn原子与支持OH基团之间的原位反应创建支持的ZnOx物种。

新开发的基于ZnO的催化剂在稳定性和生产力方面显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。在工业相关条件下对丙烷进行约400小时的测试中，ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂与商业KCrOx/Al2O3类似物相比，表现出约三倍的丙烯生产力，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。

这种创新的催化剂设计策略解决了PDH过程中的失活问题，提高了稳定性，并改善了整体性能，有可能为丙烯生产提供一种更可持续和高效的方法。
