Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical.

To overcome the limitations of traditional PDH catalysts, which include toxicity issues with Cr-containing catalysts and the need for environmentally harmful chlorine in Pt-containing catalysts, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves the creation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

This new method involves the in situ formation of supported ZnOx species through a reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. This approach addresses deactivation issues and enhances stability by creating a more environmentally friendly catalyst.

The developed ZnO-based catalyst, specifically ZnOsilicalite-1, has shown promising results in terms of improving recyclability and overall performance. When tested under industrially relevant conditions for about 400 hours on propane stream, the new catalyst demonstrated about three times higher propene productivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 analogue, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

These advancements in catalyst design for PDH processes contribute to addressing the challenges of increasing propylene demand by offering more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional production methods.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种重要的替代石油基裂解工艺的方法，解决了工业对丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。这种方法允许生产丙烯，这是一种工业上重要的平台化学品。

为了克服传统PDH催化剂的局限性，包括含铬催化剂的毒性问题和含铂催化剂需要使用环境有害氯气的问题，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略涉及基于商业氧化锌（ZnO）创建环境兼容的负载型催化剂。

这种新方法涉及通过ZnO在550°C以上还原处理过程中产生的锌原子与支持物羟基（OH）基团反应，原位形成负载型ZnOx物种。这种方法通过创建更环保的催化剂来解决失活问题并增强稳定性。

开发的基于ZnO的催化剂，特别是ZnO硅沸石-1，在提高可回收性和整体性能方面显示出了有希望的结果。在工业相关条件下对丙烷进行约400小时的测试中，新催化剂与商业KCrOx/Al2O3类似物相比，表现出约三倍高的丙烯生产率，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。

这些PDH过程中催化剂设计的进展，通过提供更高效、更稳定和更环保的替代方案，有助于解决传统生产方法面临的丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。
