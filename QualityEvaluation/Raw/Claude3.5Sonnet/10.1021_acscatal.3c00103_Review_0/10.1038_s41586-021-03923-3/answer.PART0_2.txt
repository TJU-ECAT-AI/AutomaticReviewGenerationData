Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical, without relying on traditional oil-based methods.

To overcome the limitations of current commercial PDH technologies, which use either Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These new approaches aim to address issues such as toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds and the need for ecologically harmful chlorine in catalyst regeneration.

One such innovative strategy involves the development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This method uses a physical mixture or layered arrangement of ZnO and a support material (zeolite or common metal oxide). The active ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C.

The researchers identified the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming active ZnOx species, which contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness. This new ZnO-based catalyst design shows promise in enhancing stability and improving performance, as it demonstrates about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity compared to traditional catalysts.

While the literature does not explicitly address deactivation issues or recyclability, the development of this environmentally compatible catalyst suggests potential improvements in these areas, as it eliminates the need for toxic compounds and harmful regeneration processes associated with conventional PDH catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种重要的替代油基裂解工艺的方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。这种方法允许生产丙烯（一种工业上重要的平台化学品），而不依赖传统的基于石油的方法。

为克服当前商业PDH技术（使用含铬或含铂催化剂）的局限性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些新方法旨在解决Cr(VI)化合物的毒性和催化剂再生过程中需要使用对生态有害的氯等问题。

一种创新策略涉及开发基于商业ZnO的环境友好型负载催化剂。该方法使用ZnO和支撑材料（分子筛或常见金属氧化物）的物理混合物或分层排列。活性ZnOx物种通过支撑材料的OH基团与在550°C以上还原处理过程中从ZnO生成的Zn原子之间的反应原位形成。

研究人员确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的关键作用，这有助于催化剂的有效性。这种新的基于ZnO的催化剂设计在提高稳定性和改善性能方面显示出前景，因为与传统催化剂相比，它表现出约三倍的丙烯生产力，同时保持相似的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献没有明确提及失活问题或可回收性，但这种环境友好型催化剂的开发表明在这些领域可能有所改进，因为它消除了与传统PDH催化剂相关的有毒化合物和有害再生过程的需求。
