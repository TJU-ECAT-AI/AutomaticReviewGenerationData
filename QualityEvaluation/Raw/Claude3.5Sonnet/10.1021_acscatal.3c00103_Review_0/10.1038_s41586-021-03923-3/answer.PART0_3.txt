Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the production of propene, an industrially important platform chemical.

To overcome the limitations of traditional catalysts, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These new approaches aim to address the issues of toxicity and environmental harm associated with conventional Cr-containing and Pt-containing catalysts.

One such innovative strategy involves the development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This new method utilizes a physical mixture or layered arrangement of ZnO with a support material, such as zeolite or common metal oxide. The active ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C.

This new ZnO-based catalyst design strategy has shown promising results in terms of enhancing stability and improving productivity. When compared to an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst under industrially relevant conditions, the developed ZnO-silicalite-1 catalyst demonstrated about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity over an extended period of about 400 hours on propane stream.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss recyclability, the use of environmentally compatible materials and the improved stability of the catalyst suggest potential benefits in this area as well. However, further research would be needed to confirm the recyclability aspects of this new catalyst design.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种重要的替代油基裂解工艺的方法来应对工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。这种方法允许生产丙烯，这是一种具有重要工业价值的平台化学品。

为了克服传统催化剂的局限性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些新方法旨在解决与传统含铬和含铂催化剂相关的毒性和环境危害问题。

其中一种创新策略涉及开发基于商业氧化锌（ZnO）的环境友好型负载催化剂。这种新方法利用ZnO与支持材料（如分子筛或常见金属氧化物）的物理混合物或层状排列。活性ZnOx物种通过支持OH基团与在550°C以上还原处理过程中从ZnO产生的Zn原子之间的反应原位形成。

这种新的基于ZnO的催化剂设计策略在提高稳定性和改善生产力方面显示出了promising的结果。在工业相关条件下与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂的类似物相比，开发的ZnO-silicalite-1催化剂在丙烷流中持续约400小时的过程中，表现出约三倍的丙烯生产力，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论可回收性，但使用环境友好材料和催化剂稳定性的提高表明在这方面可能存在潜在的益处。然而，还需要进一步的研究来确认这种新催化剂设计的可回收性方面。
