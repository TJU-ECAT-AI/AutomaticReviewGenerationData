Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing an alternative to traditional oil-based cracking processes. This method allows for the direct production of propene from propane, which is an important platform chemical in industry.

To overcome the limitations of current commercial PDH technologies, which use toxic Cr-containing catalysts or require environmentally harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration with Pt-containing catalysts, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves the creation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

This new method involves forming supported ZnOx species in situ through a reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. This approach addresses deactivation issues and enhances stability by creating active ZnOx species on the catalyst surface.

The developed ZnO-based catalyst, specifically ZnOsilicalite-1, has shown promising results in terms of stability and performance. When tested under industrially relevant conditions for about 400 hours on propane stream, it demonstrated about three times higher propene productivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst analogue, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss recyclability, the environmentally compatible nature of the ZnO-based catalyst and its improved performance suggest potential advantages in terms of long-term use and reduced environmental impact. However, more research would be needed to fully assess its recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）通过提供一种替代传统石油基裂解工艺的方法来解决工业对丙烯需求增加的挑战。这种方法允许直接从丙烷生产丙烯，这是工业中一种重要的平台化学品。

为了克服当前商业PDH技术的局限性（这些技术使用有毒的含铬催化剂或需要环境有害的氯来再生含铂催化剂），正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略涉及基于商业ZnO创建环境兼容的负载型催化剂。

这种新方法涉及通过在550°C以上还原处理过程中，ZnO产生的Zn原子与载体OH基团反应，原位形成负载的ZnOx物种。这种方法通过在催化剂表面创建活性ZnOx物种来解决失活问题并增强稳定性。

开发的基于ZnO的催化剂，特别是ZnOsilicalite-1，在稳定性和性能方面显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。在工业相关条件下测试约400小时的丙烷流中，与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂类似物相比，它显示出约三倍的丙烯生产力，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论可回收性，但基于ZnO的催化剂的环境兼容性和其改进的性能表明在长期使用和减少环境影响方面具有潜在优势。然而，需要进行更多研究以全面评估其在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性。
