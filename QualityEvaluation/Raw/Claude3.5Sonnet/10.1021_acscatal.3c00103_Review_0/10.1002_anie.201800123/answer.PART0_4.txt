Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method that capitalizes on the growing availability and low price of propane from shale gas. This approach provides a more commercially attractive option for on-purpose propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of oil byproducts.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves the use of supported vanadium catalysts as an alternative to expensive platinum-based or toxic chromium-based catalysts. These vanadium catalysts offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

A key innovation in catalyst design focuses on the role of surface hydroxyl groups on supported VOx catalysts. Research has shown that the presence of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface leads to better stability by suppressing coke deposition, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation. Although catalysts with hydroxyl groups exhibit lower PDH activity, they demonstrate a lower coke deposition rate compared to those without hydroxyl groups.

This trade-off between activity and stability presents an opportunity for further optimization. By carefully controlling the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, researchers can potentially tune the catalyst's performance to balance activity and longevity. This approach represents a promising direction for developing more efficient and durable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and economic viability of propylene production through PDH techniques.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过利用页岩气带来的丙烷供应增加和价格降低，为丙烯生产提供了一种替代方法，从而解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。与传统的石油副产品蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，这种方法为定向丙烯生产提供了一个更具商业吸引力的选择。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略涉及使用负载型钒催化剂作为昂贵的铂基或有毒的铬基催化剂的替代品。这些钒催化剂具有相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能。

催化剂设计的一个关键创新集中在负载型VOx催化剂表面羟基的作用上。研究表明，催化剂表面存在羟基可以通过抑制积碳沉积来提高稳定性，而积碳沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。虽然带有羟基的催化剂表现出较低的PDH活性，但与不含羟基的催化剂相比，它们的积碳沉积率较低。

这种活性和稳定性之间的权衡为进一步优化提供了机会。通过仔细控制表面羟基的覆盖率，研究人员可以潜在地调节催化剂的性能，以平衡活性和寿命。这种方法代表了为氧化和非氧化PDH过程开发更高效和更耐用催化剂的一个有前途的方向，最终提高通过PDH技术进行丙烯生产的整体效率和经济可行性。
