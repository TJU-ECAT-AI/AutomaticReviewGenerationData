[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Herein, a VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[7] "Clearly, the catalyst with lower initial activity deactivates more slowly."

[8] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative method for on-purpose propylene production, taking advantage of the low price of propane from shale gas production.

2. It offers a more targeted approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Development of supported vanadium catalysts as an alternative to expensive Pt-based and toxic CrOx-based catalysts. These vanadium catalysts offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

2. Use of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface to improve stability by suppressing coke deposition. While this slightly reduces initial activity, it significantly slows down catalyst deactivation.

3. Optimization of catalyst composition, such as using VOx/γ-Al2O3 with specific V loading (e.g., 6wt%) to achieve a balance between activity and stability.

4. Tailoring the oxidation state of the active species, with V4+ species showing good resistance to coke formation, albeit with lower PDH activity.

These strategies aim to create catalysts that maintain activity over longer periods, resist deactivation, and can be more easily regenerated, thus improving the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为定向丙烯生产提供了一种替代方法，利用了页岩气生产带来的丙烷低价格优势。

2. 与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统方法相比，它提供了一种更有针对性的丙烯生产方法。

为克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高PDH过程中的可回收性而开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 开发负载型钒催化剂作为昂贵的铂基和有毒的铬氧化物基催化剂的替代品。这些钒催化剂具有相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和优异的再生性能。

2. 在催化剂表面使用羟基来提高稳定性，抑制积碳沉积。虽然这略微降低了初始活性，但显著减缓了催化剂失活。

3. 优化催化剂组成，例如使用特定V负载量（如6wt%）的VOx/γ-Al2O3，以在活性和稳定性之间达到平衡。

4. 调整活性物种的氧化态，V4+物种表现出良好的抗积碳性能，尽管PDH活性较低。

这些策略旨在创造能够长期保持活性、抵抗失活并且更容易再生的催化剂，从而提高PDH过程的整体效率和经济性。
