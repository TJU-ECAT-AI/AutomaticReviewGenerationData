[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[7] "A VOx catalyst covered with hydroxyl groups possesses a lower PDH activity and a lower coke deposition rate compared with those without hydroxyl groups."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for direct, targeted production of propylene from propane, which is more efficient than traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Economic viability: The increased availability and low cost of propane from shale gas production has made PDH more commercially attractive.

3. Flexibility: PDH can be used as a standalone process for propylene production, offering more flexibility in meeting market demands.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts: Supported vanadium catalysts are being explored as alternatives to expensive platinum-based or toxic chromium-based catalysts, offering good activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

2. Surface hydroxyl modification: Researchers have found that introducing hydroxyl groups on the surface of supported vanadium catalysts can improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, although at the cost of some initial activity.

3. Balancing activity and stability: The study shows that while catalysts with hydroxyl groups have lower initial activity, they also have lower coke deposition rates, leading to better long-term stability and potentially improved recyclability.

4. Tuning catalyst oxidation states: By controlling the pre-treatment and reaction conditions, researchers can influence the oxidation state of vanadium species on the catalyst surface, which affects both activity and stability.

These strategies aim to develop catalysts that maintain high activity while resisting deactivation, thus improving the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许直接从丙烷定向生产丙烯，这比蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等将丙烯作为副产品的传统方法更有效率。

2. 经济可行性：页岩气生产带来的丙烷供应增加和价格降低，使PDH在商业上更具吸引力。

3. 灵活性：PDH可以作为独立的丙烯生产过程，在满足市场需求方面提供更大的灵活性。

为克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善PDH过程中的可再生性而开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 钒基催化剂：正在探索支持的钒催化剂作为昂贵的铂基或有毒的铬基催化剂的替代品，提供良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

2. 表面羟基修饰：研究人员发现，在支持的钒催化剂表面引入羟基可以通过抑制积碳来提高稳定性，尽管会牺牲一些初始活性。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：研究表明，虽然带有羟基的催化剂初始活性较低，但它们的积碳速率也较低，从而导致更好的长期稳定性和潜在的improved可再生性。

4. 调节催化剂氧化态：通过控制预处理和反应条件，研究人员可以影响催化剂表面钒物种的氧化态，这影响了活性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在开发既保持高活性又能抵抗失活的催化剂，从而提高PDH过程在工业丙烯生产中的整体效率和经济性。
