[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Herein, a VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and the V loading is 6wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading (12wt%) on γ-Al2O3."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

[7] "Clearly, the catalyst with lower initial activity deactivates more slowly."

[8] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative method for on-purpose propylene production, taking advantage of the low price of propane from shale gas production.

2. It offers a more targeted approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Development of supported vanadium catalysts as an alternative to expensive Pt-based and toxic CrOx-based catalysts. These vanadium catalysts offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

2. Use of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface to improve stability by suppressing coke deposition. While this slightly reduces initial activity, it significantly slows down catalyst deactivation.

3. Optimization of catalyst composition, such as using VOx/γ-Al2O3 with specific V loading (e.g., 6wt%) to achieve a balance between activity and stability.

4. Tailoring the oxidation state of the active species, with V4+ species showing good resistance to coke formation, albeit with lower PDH activity.

These strategies aim to create catalysts that maintain activity over longer periods, resist deactivation, and can be more easily regenerated, thus improving the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for direct, targeted production of propylene from propane, which is more efficient than traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Economic viability: The increased availability and low cost of propane from shale gas production has made PDH more commercially attractive.

3. Flexibility: PDH can be used as a standalone process for propylene production, offering more flexibility in meeting market demands.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts: Supported vanadium catalysts are being explored as alternatives to expensive platinum-based or toxic chromium-based catalysts, offering good activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

2. Surface hydroxyl modification: Researchers have found that introducing hydroxyl groups on the surface of supported vanadium catalysts can improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, although at the cost of some initial activity.

3. Balancing activity and stability: The study shows that while catalysts with hydroxyl groups have lower initial activity, they also have lower coke deposition rates, leading to better long-term stability and potentially improved recyclability.

4. Tuning catalyst oxidation states: By controlling the pre-treatment and reaction conditions, researchers can influence the oxidation state of vanadium species on the catalyst surface, which affects both activity and stability.

These strategies aim to develop catalysts that maintain high activity while resisting deactivation, thus improving the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process for industrial propylene production.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method that capitalizes on the growing availability and low price of propane from shale gas. This approach provides a more commercially attractive option for on-purpose propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of oil byproducts.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves the use of supported vanadium catalysts as an alternative to expensive platinum-based or toxic chromium-based catalysts. These vanadium catalysts offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

A key innovation in catalyst design focuses on the role of surface hydroxyl groups on supported VOx catalysts. Research has shown that the presence of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface leads to better stability by suppressing coke deposition, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation. Although catalysts with hydroxyl groups exhibit lower PDH activity, they demonstrate a lower coke deposition rate compared to those without hydroxyl groups.

This trade-off between activity and stability presents an opportunity for further optimization. By carefully controlling the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, researchers can potentially tune the catalyst's performance to balance activity and longevity. This approach represents a promising direction for developing more efficient and durable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and economic viability of propylene production through PDH techniques.
