[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "This paper describes the surface structure and the important role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts under reaction conditions employing in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations."

[7] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative, on-purpose production method for propylene, utilizing the abundant and low-cost propane from shale gas production.

2. It offers a more targeted approach compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which produce propylene as a byproduct.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Supported vanadium catalysts are being explored as alternatives to expensive Pt-based and toxic CrOx-based catalysts, offering good activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

2. Research is focusing on understanding and manipulating the surface structure of catalysts, particularly the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups.

3. Studies have shown that hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts can improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

4. Advanced characterization techniques like in situ DRIFTS and computational methods such as DFT calculations are being employed to gain deeper insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

These strategies aim to develop catalysts with improved stability, longer lifetimes, and better resistance to deactivation, addressing key challenges in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种替代性的、定向生产丙烯的方法，利用了页岩气生产中丰富且低成本的丙烷。

2. 与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法相比，它提供了一种更有针对性的方法。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 正在探索支持的钒催化剂作为昂贵的铂基和有毒的铬氧化物基催化剂的替代品，提供良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

2. 研究正在集中于理解和操纵催化剂的表面结构，特别是表面结合羟基的作用。

3. 研究表明，VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的羟基可以通过抑制积碳沉积来提高稳定性，而积碳沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。

4. 正在采用先进的表征技术（如原位漫反射红外光谱）和计算方法（如密度泛函理论计算）来深入了解催化剂在反应条件下的行为。

这些策略旨在开发具有改进的稳定性、更长寿命和更好的抗失活能力的催化剂，解决氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的关键挑战。
