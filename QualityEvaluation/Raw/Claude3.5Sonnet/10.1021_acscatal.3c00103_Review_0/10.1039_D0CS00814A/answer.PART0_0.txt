[3] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."

[4] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[5] "Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly developed."

[6] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct route for propylene production from propane, which is becoming more abundant and cheaper due to shale gas extraction.

2. It offers an alternative to traditional propylene production methods that may be constrained by feedstock availability or economics.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Development of low or non-chromium content metal oxide catalysts to replace toxic CrOx-based catalysts.

2. Creation of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts using special preparation methods, supports, and promoters to address coking, sintering, and cost issues.

3. New approaches to regulate strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) to improve catalyst stability.

4. Exploration of alternative materials like transition-metal nitrides and carbides as economic alternatives to noble metal catalysts.

To improve recyclability and overall process efficiency:

1. Development of chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) using redox catalysts, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen and potentially offer a more moderate dehydrogenation approach.

2. Investigation of coupling PDH with exothermic reactions to improve energy efficiency.

3. Research into ambient or near-ambient temperature catalytic processes like photocatalysis and electrocatalysis to reduce energy consumption.

These strategies aim to address the key challenges in PDH technology by improving catalyst performance, reducing costs, and enhancing process efficiency while meeting the growing demand for propylene production.
