[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."

[2] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."

[3] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[4] "To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been industrialised and most widely applied, wherein Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively."

[5] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct method for propylene production. PDH has gained significant attention in recent years as an alternative to traditional production methods.

PDH processes leverage thermodynamics to achieve higher propane conversions by using high temperatures and/or low partial pressures. This allows for greater propylene yields compared to conventional methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, researchers are developing alternative catalysts with low or no chromium content. For Pt-based catalysts, which are prone to coking and sintering, efforts are focused on creating low Pt-content formulations with improved stability through specialized preparation methods and the use of supports and promoters. 

Industrially, the Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized using Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts respectively. These represent the current state-of-the-art in PDH technology.

Innovative strategies being explored include chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH), which uses redox catalysts to selectively oxidize hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This approach offers a potential middle ground between oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

Overall, PDH techniques are evolving to address catalyst deactivation, enhance stability and recyclability through novel catalyst designs and process innovations. The goal is to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for meeting the growing demand for propylene.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供直接生产丙烯的方法来应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战。近年来，PDH作为传统生产方法的替代方案，已经受到了广泛关注。

PDH过程利用热力学原理，通过使用高温和/或低分压来实现更高的丙烷转化率。与传统方法相比，这允许获得更高的丙烯产率。

为了克服催化剂失活问题并提高稳定性，研究人员正在开发低铬或无铬的替代催化剂。对于容易结焦和烧结的铂基催化剂，研究重点是通过专门的制备方法以及使用载体和助剂来创造低铂含量的配方，以提高稳定性。

在工业上，Oleflex和Catofin工艺已经商业化，分别使用铂基和铬氧化物基催化剂。这些代表了PDH技术的当前最先进水平。

正在探索的创新策略包括化学循环氧化脱氢（CL-ODH），它使用氧化还原催化剂来选择性地氧化脱氢过程中产生的氢气。这种方法为氧化和非氧化PDH过程之间提供了一个潜在的中间地带。

总的来说，PDH技术正在不断发展，通过新型催化剂设计和工艺创新来解决催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和可回收性。目标是开发更高效、更可持续的方法来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。
