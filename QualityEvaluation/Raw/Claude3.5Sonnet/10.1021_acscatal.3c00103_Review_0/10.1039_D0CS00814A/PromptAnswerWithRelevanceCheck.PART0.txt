Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct method for propylene production. PDH has gained significant attention in recent years as an alternative to traditional production methods.

PDH processes leverage thermodynamics to achieve higher propane conversions by using high temperatures and/or low partial pressures. This allows for greater propylene yields compared to conventional methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, researchers are developing alternative catalysts with low or no chromium content. For Pt-based catalysts, which are prone to coking and sintering, efforts are focused on creating low Pt-content formulations with improved stability through specialized preparation methods and the use of supports and promoters. 

Industrially, the Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized using Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts respectively. These represent the current state-of-the-art in PDH technology.

Innovative strategies being explored include chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH), which uses redox catalysts to selectively oxidize hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This approach offers a potential middle ground between oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

Overall, PDH techniques are evolving to address catalyst deactivation, enhance stability and recyclability through novel catalyst designs and process innovations. The goal is to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for meeting the growing demand for propylene.
