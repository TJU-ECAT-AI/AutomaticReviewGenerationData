Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering direct propylene production from propane, which has become more abundant and cheaper due to shale gas extraction. This allows PDH to serve as an alternative to traditional production methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Alloying/dealloying: This involves combining Pt with other metals to improve selectivity and stability, or selectively removing certain elements to optimize performance.

2. Single atom catalysis: Dispersing individual Pt atoms on supports or in alloys to maximize atom efficiency and selectivity.

3. Subsurface catalysis: Modifying the layers beneath the catalyst surface to influence reactivity and selectivity.

4. Defect engineering: Introducing controlled defects in metal oxide catalysts to create active sites for PDH.

5. Metal-hydride chemistry: Utilizing metal hydride species as active sites for dehydrogenation.

6. Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI): Developing methods to tune the interaction between metal nanoparticles and oxide supports to improve stability.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability. Additionally, researchers are exploring alternative materials like transition-metal nitrides and carbides as economic alternatives to noble metal catalysts.

For oxidative PDH, efforts are focused on developing catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures to improve propylene selectivity and reduce overoxidation. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation is also being investigated as a potential moderate dehydrogenation technology.

To further improve recyclability, researchers are working on understanding the deactivation mechanisms and developing more effective regeneration methods. This includes strategies to prevent sintering, coke formation, and structural changes during reaction-regeneration cycles.

Overall, the field is actively pursuing multiple approaches to overcome the limitations of current PDH catalysts and processes, with the goal of developing more efficient and sustainable propylene production technologies.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过直接从丙烷生产丙烯来解决工业对丙烯需求增加的挑战，由于页岩气开采，丙烷变得更加丰富和便宜。这使PDH成为传统生产方法的替代选择。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 合金化/去合金化：将Pt与其他金属结合以提高选择性和稳定性，或有选择地去除某些元素以优化性能。

2. 单原子催化：将单个Pt原子分散在载体上或合金中，以最大化原子效率和选择性。

3. 亚表面催化：修改催化剂表面下的层以影响反应活性和选择性。

4. 缺陷工程：在金属氧化物催化剂中引入受控缺陷，为PDH创造活性位点。

5. 金属氢化物化学：利用金属氢化物物种作为脱氢的活性位点。

6. 强金属-载体相互作用(SMSI)：开发调节金属纳米粒子和氧化物载体之间相互作用的方法，以提高稳定性。

这些策略旨在创造具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。此外，研究人员正在探索过渡金属氮化物和碳化物等替代材料，作为贵金属催化剂的经济替代品。

对于氧化PDH，研究重点是开发能在较低温度下运行的催化剂，以提高丙烯选择性并减少过度氧化。化学循环氧化脱氢也正在被研究作为潜在的温和脱氢技术。

为了进一步提高可回收性，研究人员正在努力理解失活机制并开发更有效的再生方法。这包括防止烧结、焦炭形成和反应-再生循环过程中的结构变化的策略。

总的来说，该领域正在积极采取多种方法来克服当前PDH催化剂和过程的局限性，目标是开发更高效和可持续的丙烯生产技术。
