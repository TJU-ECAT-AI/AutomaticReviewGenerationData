[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen"

[4] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously. As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."

[5] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts. The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance. Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."

[6] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct and selective method to produce propylene from propane. Unlike traditional production methods that yield mixed products, PDH is a proprietary process that produces only propylene, making it one of the most promising propylene production methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Catalyst composition optimization: Researchers are working on creating more stable and selective catalysts by alloying platinum with other metals or using alternative metal oxides to reduce coking and improve regeneration capabilities.

2. Surface engineering: Efforts are being made to control the coordination environment of active sites, as saturated metal atoms tend to be more selective for propane dehydrogenation while unsaturated sites can lead to unwanted side reactions.

3. Support modification: The development of novel support materials and modification techniques aims to improve catalyst dispersion, thermal stability, and resistance to sintering.

4. Promoter addition: The use of promoters helps to modify the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts, enhancing their stability and selectivity.

5. Single-atom catalysis: This approach aims to maximize metal utilization and selectivity by dispersing individual metal atoms on supports.

To improve recyclability, researchers are exploring chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts. This technology allows for selective oxidation of hydrogen produced during the reaction, potentially offering a more moderate and sustainable dehydrogenation process.

In oxidative PDH processes, the focus is on developing catalysts that can activate propane at lower temperatures while minimizing over-oxidation to COx. This involves carefully tuning the redox properties of catalysts and exploring novel materials like boron nitride.

Overall, these strategies aim to address the main challenges in PDH processes: catalyst deactivation, selectivity, and energy efficiency, with the ultimate goal of creating more sustainable and economically viable propylene production methods.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种直接且选择性的方法从丙烷生产丙烯来满足不断增长的工业丙烯需求。与传统生产方法产生混合产品不同，PDH是一种专有工艺，只生产丙烯，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH工艺的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 催化剂组成优化：研究人员正在努力创造更稳定和选择性的催化剂，通过将铂与其他金属合金化或使用替代金属氧化物来减少结焦并改善再生能力。

2. 表面工程：正在努力控制活性位点的配位环境，因为饱和金属原子往往对丙烷脱氢更具选择性，而不饱和位点可能导致不必要的副反应。

3. 载体改性：开发新型载体材料和改性技术旨在改善催化剂分散性、热稳定性和抗烧结性。

4. 助剂添加：使用助剂有助于修饰催化剂的电子和几何性质，提高其稳定性和选择性。

5. 单原子催化：这种方法旨在通过在载体上分散单个金属原子来最大化金属利用率和选择性。

为了提高可循环性，研究人员正在探索基于氧化还原催化剂的化学循环氧化脱氢（CL-ODH）。这项技术允许选择性氧化反应过程中产生的氢气，可能提供更温和和可持续的脱氢过程。

在氧化PDH过程中，重点是开发能够在较低温度下活化丙烷同时最小化过度氧化为COx的催化剂。这涉及仔细调节催化剂的氧化还原性质并探索新型材料，如氮化硼。

总的来说，这些策略旨在解决PDH过程中的主要挑战：催化剂失活、选择性和能源效率，最终目标是创造更可持续和经济可行的丙烯生产方法。
