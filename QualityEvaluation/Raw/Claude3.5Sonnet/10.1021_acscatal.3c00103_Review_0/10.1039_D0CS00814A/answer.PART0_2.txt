[1] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[2] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[3] "The exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[4] "Alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, have been introduced."

[5] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a direct and selective method to produce propylene. PDH is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods as it produces only propylene, not a hybrid product.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Development of alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content to address environmental concerns associated with chromium-based catalysts.

2. Creation of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts through special preparation methods, support modifications, and promoter effects to address issues of coking, sintering, and high cost associated with platinum catalysts.

3. Exploration of new strategies to improve the stability of both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

4. Implementation of advanced techniques such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) mediation for both metal and metal oxide-based catalysts.

5. Development of chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the reaction, offering a moderate dehydrogenation technology.

These strategies aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the key challenges in propylene production and moving towards more sustainable and economical industrial practices.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供直接和选择性的方法来生产丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。PDH被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一，因为它只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的循环使用性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 开发低铬或无铬的替代金属氧化物催化剂，以解决与铬基催化剂相关的环境问题。

2. 通过特殊的制备方法、载体改性和助剂效应，创造低铂含量和稳定的铂基催化剂，以解决与铂催化剂相关的结焦、烧结和高成本问题。

3. 探索新策略以提高铂基和铬氧基催化剂的稳定性。

4. 实施先进技术，如合金化/去合金化、单原子催化、亚表面催化、缺陷工程、金属氢化物化学以及对金属和金属氧化物基催化剂的强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）调控。

5. 开发基于氧化还原催化剂的化学链氧化脱氢（CL-ODH）技术，该技术能够选择性地氧化反应过程中产生的氢气，提供一种适中的脱氢技术。

这些策略旨在为PDH过程创造更高效、更稳定和可循环使用的催化剂，解决丙烯生产中的关键挑战，并朝着更可持续和经济的工业实践迈进。
