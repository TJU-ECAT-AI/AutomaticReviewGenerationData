          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."

[2] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[5] "Several advanced catalyst design strategies, such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, have been introduced."

[6] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a direct and selective method to produce propylene from propane. PDH has gained significant attention in recent years due to:

1. The abundance of cheap propane feedstock from shale gas extraction.
2. Its ability to produce only propylene, not mixed products.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Development of alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content.
2. Creation of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts through special preparation methods, support modifications, and promoter effects.
3. Advanced techniques such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) mediation.
4. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved during the reaction.

These strategies aim to address issues such as coking, sintering, and high costs associated with current catalysts while improving overall process efficiency and sustainability.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷直接生产丙烯的选择性方法来应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战和传统生产方法的局限性。近年来，PDH受到广泛关注，主要原因包括：

1. 页岩气开采技术的发展使得丰富且廉价的丙烷原料可大规模获得。
2. 它能够专门生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的循环使用性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 开发低铬或无铬的替代金属氧化物催化剂。
2. 通过特殊的制备方法、载体改性和助剂效应，创造低铂含量和稳定的铂基催化剂。
3. 先进技术，如合金化/去合金化、单原子催化、亚表面催化、缺陷工程、金属氢化物化学以及对金属和金属氧化物基催化剂的强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）调控。
4. 基于氧化还原催化剂的化学链氧化脱氢（CL-ODH）技术，该技术能够选择性地氧化反应过程中产生的氢气。

这些策略旨在解决当前催化剂存在的结焦、烧结和高成本等问题，同时提高整体过程效率和可持续性。
