[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method that is more flexible and can utilize abundant propane feedstocks from shale gas. This technique helps overcome the limitations of traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are less selective for propylene.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Doping Pt-based catalysts with promoters: Late transition metals and main-group metals like Ga and Sn are added to improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation.

2. Modifying catalyst carriers: This approach aims to enhance the support's interaction with the active metal, potentially improving stability and activity.

3. Developing bimetallic catalysts: Alloying Pt with other metals can help balance activity and selectivity while reducing deactivation.

4. Exploring single-atom catalysts: These catalysts offer unique properties and potentially higher stability due to strong metal-support interactions.

5. Investigating oxidative PDH: This process follows the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, which can help regenerate the catalyst in situ and potentially improve stability.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, namely unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability caused by coke formation and sintering at high temperatures. By fine-tuning the electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts, researchers hope to develop more efficient and stable PDH processes that can meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)通过提供一种更灵活的定向生产方法来满足日益增长的工业丙烯需求，该方法可以利用丰富的页岩气丙烷原料。这种技术有助于克服传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)对丙烯选择性较低的局限性。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 在铂基催化剂中掺杂助剂：添加后过渡金属和主族金属(如镓和锡)以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。

2. 改性催化剂载体：这种方法旨在增强载体与活性金属之间的相互作用，从而可能提高稳定性和活性。

3. 开发双金属催化剂：将铂与其他金属合金化可以帮助平衡活性和选择性，同时减少失活。

4. 探索单原子催化剂：这些催化剂具有独特的性质，由于强金属-载体相互作用，可能具有更高的稳定性。

5. 研究氧化脱氢：这个过程遵循Mars-van Krevelen (MVK)机理，可以帮助原位再生催化剂，可能提高稳定性。

这些策略旨在解决PDH催化剂的主要挑战，即不理想的丙烯选择性、快速失活以及由于高温下积碳和烧结导致的稳定性差等问题。通过微调催化剂的电子和几何性质，研究人员希望开发出更高效、更稳定的PDH工艺，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求。
