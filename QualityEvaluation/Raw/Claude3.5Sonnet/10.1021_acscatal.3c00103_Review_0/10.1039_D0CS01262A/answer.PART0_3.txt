[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing an on-purpose production method, as an alternative to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking. PDH is particularly promising in the context of shale gas revolution and growing global propylene demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Doping Pt-based catalysts with additional promoters, including late transition metals and main-group metals like Ga and Sn.

2. Modifying catalyst carriers to improve performance.

3. Controlling the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles to optimize catalytic properties.

4. Alloying Pt with other transition metals or main-group metals to enhance selectivity and stability.

5. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports to improve overall catalyst performance.

These strategies aim to address the key challenges of Pt-based catalysts, such as unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability caused by coke formation and sintering at high reaction temperatures. By modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of the catalysts, researchers hope to increase propylene selectivity while maintaining high catalytic activity, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)通过提供一种定向生产方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战，作为蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统工艺的替代方案。在页岩气革命和全球丙烯需求增长的背景下，PDH特别具有前景。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH工艺的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 用额外的助剂掺杂铂基催化剂，包括后过渡金属和主族金属如镓和锡。

2. 改性催化剂载体以提高性能。

3. 控制铂纳米粒子的尺寸和形状以优化催化性能。

4. 将铂与其他过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以提高选择性和稳定性。

5. 选择适当的催化剂支撑体以提高整体催化剂性能。

这些策略旨在解决铂基催化剂的关键挑战，如不理想的丙烯选择性、快速失活以及由于高反应温度下的积碳和烧结导致的催化剂稳定性差等问题。通过改变催化剂的几何和电子结构，研究人员希望在保持高催化活性的同时提高丙烯选择性，从而提高PDH工艺的整体效率和可持续性。
