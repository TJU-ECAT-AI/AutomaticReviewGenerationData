[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method that is more flexible and efficient than traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the increased availability of propane from shale gas resources.

To overcome issues with catalyst deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Modifying Pt-based catalysts: Researchers are working on controlling the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles to optimize their performance.

2. Alloying: Combining Pt with transition metals or main-group metals to create bimetallic catalysts that offer improved selectivity and stability.

3. Support selection: Choosing appropriate catalyst supports that can enhance the performance and longevity of the active metal components.

4. Oxidative PDH: Developing catalysts that follow the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, utilizing lattice oxygen to create a redox cycle that can help maintain catalyst activity and reduce coking.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, such as unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation due to coke formation, and poor stability at high temperatures. By fine-tuning the geometric and electronic structures of catalysts, researchers hope to create more efficient and durable catalytic systems for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种更灵活和高效的定向生产方法来应对工业丙烯需求增加的挑战，这种方法比传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解更有优势。PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这在页岩气资源增加丙烷供应的情况下特别有利。

为了克服催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 改进铂基催化剂：研究人员正在努力控制铂纳米颗粒的大小和形状，以优化其性能。

2. 合金化：将铂与过渡金属或主族金属结合，创造出具有improved选择性和稳定性的双金属催化剂。

3. 载体选择：选择适当的催化剂载体，可以提高活性金属组分的性能和寿命。

4. 氧化PDH：开发遵循Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制的催化剂，利用晶格氧创建一个氧化还原循环，有助于维持催化剂活性并减少结焦。

这些策略旨在解决PDH催化剂的主要挑战，如不理想的丙烯选择性、由于积碳导致的快速失活以及在高温下的稳定性差。通过微调催化剂的几何和电子结构，研究人员希望为氧化和非氧化PDH过程创造更高效和耐用的催化系统。
