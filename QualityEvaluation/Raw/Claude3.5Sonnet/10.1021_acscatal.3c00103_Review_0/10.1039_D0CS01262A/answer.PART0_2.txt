[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose propylene production method. This approach is particularly promising in light of the shale gas revolution and growing global propylene demand, which is expected to reach 130 million metric tons by 2023.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These include:

1. Improving Pt-based catalysts: While Pt-based catalysts are commonly used due to their high catalytic activity, they suffer from poor propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and instability. Researchers are working to enhance their performance through various methods.

2. Doping with promoters: Additional promoters such as late transition metals and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) are being added to Pt-based catalysts to improve their performance.

3. Modifying carriers: The support materials for the catalysts are being modified to enhance overall catalyst performance.

4. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation: This approach follows the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. In this process, reactive oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface generate oxidation products and form oxygen vacancies, which can help mitigate some of the challenges associated with non-oxidative PDH.

These strategies aim to address the key issues of catalyst deactivation, stability, and recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. By focusing on these areas, researchers hope to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for propylene production to meet the growing industrial demand.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种定向丙烯生产方法来应对工业需求增长的挑战。考虑到页岩气革命和全球丙烯需求的增长（预计到2023年将达到1.3亿公吨），这种方法特别有前景。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些包括：

1. 改进基于铂的催化剂：虽然基于铂的催化剂因其高催化活性而被广泛使用，但它们存在丙烯选择性差、快速失活和不稳定的问题。研究人员正在通过各种方法努力提高它们的性能。

2. 掺杂助剂：向基于铂的催化剂中添加额外的助剂，如后过渡金属和主族金属（包括镓和锡），以改善其性能。

3. 改性载体：正在对催化剂的支撑材料进行改性，以提高整体催化剂性能。

4. 探索氧化脱氢：这种方法遵循Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制，也称为晶格氧机制。在这个过程中，催化剂表面的活性氧原子产生氧化产物并形成氧空位，这可以帮助缓解非氧化PDH相关的一些挑战。

这些策略旨在解决氧化和非氧化PDH过程中催化剂失活、稳定性和可回收性的关键问题。通过关注这些领域，研究人员希望开发出更高效、更可持续的丙烯生产方法，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
