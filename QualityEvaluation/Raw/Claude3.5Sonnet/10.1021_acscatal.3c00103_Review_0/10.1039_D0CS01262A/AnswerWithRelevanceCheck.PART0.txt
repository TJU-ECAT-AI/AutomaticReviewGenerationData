          [1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method that is more flexible and efficient than traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the increased availability of propane from shale gas resources.

To overcome issues with catalyst deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Modifying Pt-based catalysts: Researchers are working on controlling the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles to optimize their performance.

2. Doping with promoters: Additional promoters such as late transition metals and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) are being added to Pt-based catalysts to improve their performance.

3. Modifying carriers: The support materials for the catalysts are being modified to enhance overall catalyst performance.

4. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation: This approach follows the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. In this process, reactive oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface generate oxidation products and form oxygen vacancies, which can help mitigate some of the challenges associated with non-oxidative PDH.

These strategies aim to address the key issues of catalyst deactivation, stability, and recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. By focusing on these areas, researchers hope to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for propylene production to meet the growing industrial demand.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种比传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解更灵活和高效的定向生产方法来应对工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这在页岩气资源增加丙烷供应的情况下特别有利。

为了克服催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 改进铂基催化剂：研究人员正在努力控制铂纳米颗粒的大小和形状，以优化其性能。

2. 掺杂助剂：向铂基催化剂中添加额外的助剂，如后过渡金属和主族金属（包括镓和锡），以改善其性能。

3. 改性载体：正在对催化剂的支撑材料进行改性，以提高整体催化剂性能。

4. 探索氧化脱氢：这种方法遵循Mars-van Krevelen（MVK）机制，也称为晶格氧机制。在这个过程中，催化剂表面的活性氧原子产生氧化产物并形成氧空位，这可以帮助缓解非氧化PDH相关的一些挑战。

这些策略旨在解决氧化和非氧化PDH过程中催化剂失活、稳定性和可回收性的关键问题。通过关注这些领域，研究人员希望开发出更高效、更可持续的丙烯生产方法，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
