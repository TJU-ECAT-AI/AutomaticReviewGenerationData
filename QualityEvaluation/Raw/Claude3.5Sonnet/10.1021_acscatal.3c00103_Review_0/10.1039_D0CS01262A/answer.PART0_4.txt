[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."

[4] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[5] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers an on-purpose propylene production method, providing a promising alternative to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking.

2. It allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the increased availability of propane from shale gas.

3. PDH can help meet the growing global demand for propylene, which is expected to reach 130 million metric tons by 2023.

However, PDH processes face challenges, particularly with catalyst performance. To overcome these issues and improve catalyst design, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Using Al2O3-supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts, which have been successfully commercialized.

2. Doping Pt-based catalysts with additional promoters, such as late transition metals and main-group metals like Ga and Sn.

3. Modifying catalyst carriers to enhance performance.

4. Focusing on improving propylene selectivity, reducing catalyst deactivation, and enhancing stability to address issues of coke formation and sintering at high temperatures.

These strategies aim to overcome the limitations of current PDH catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, which suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability. By addressing these challenges, researchers hope to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, ultimately improving the overall performance and economic viability of propylene production via PDH.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）通过以下几种方式解决了丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种定向丙烯生产方法，为蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统工艺提供了一种有前景的替代方案。

2. 它允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这在页岩气提供的丙烷可用性增加的情况下特别有利。

3. PDH可以满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿公吨。

然而，PDH过程面临着挑战，特别是催化剂性能方面。为了克服这些问题并改进催化剂设计，正在开发几种创新策略：

1. 使用已成功商业化的Al2O3负载的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。

2. 用额外的助剂（如后过渡金属和主族金属如Ga和Sn）掺杂Pt基催化剂。

3. 修饰催化剂载体以提高性能。

4. 专注于提高丙烯选择性，减少催化剂失活，增强稳定性，以解决高温下积碳和烧结的问题。

这些策略旨在克服当前PDH催化剂的局限性，特别是Pt基催化剂，它们存在丙烯选择性不理想、快速失活和稳定性差的问题。通过解决这些挑战，研究人员希望为氧化和非氧化PDH过程开发更高效、更稳定的催化剂，最终提高通过PDH生产丙烯的整体性能和经济可行性。
