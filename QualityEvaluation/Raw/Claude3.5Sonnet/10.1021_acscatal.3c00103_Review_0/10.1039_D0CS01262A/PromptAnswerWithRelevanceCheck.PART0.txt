[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[4] "Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method that is more flexible and can utilize abundant propane feedstocks from shale gas. This technique helps overcome the limitations of traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are less selective for propylene.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Doping Pt-based catalysts with promoters: Late transition metals and main-group metals like Ga and Sn are added to improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation.

2. Modifying catalyst carriers: This approach aims to enhance the support's interaction with the active metal, potentially improving stability and activity.

3. Developing bimetallic catalysts: Alloying Pt with other metals can help balance activity and selectivity while reducing deactivation.

4. Exploring single-atom catalysts: These catalysts offer unique properties and potentially higher stability due to strong metal-support interactions.

5. Investigating oxidative PDH: This process follows the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, which can help regenerate the catalyst in situ and potentially improve stability.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, namely unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability caused by coke formation and sintering at high temperatures. By fine-tuning the electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts, researchers hope to develop more efficient and stable PDH processes that can meet the growing demand for propylene.

[4] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism, also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method that is more flexible and efficient than traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the increased availability of propane from shale gas resources.

To overcome issues with catalyst deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Modifying Pt-based catalysts: Researchers are working on controlling the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles to optimize their performance.

2. Alloying: Combining Pt with transition metals or main-group metals to create bimetallic catalysts that offer improved selectivity and stability.

3. Support selection: Choosing appropriate catalyst supports that can enhance the performance and longevity of the active metal components.

4. Oxidative PDH: Developing catalysts that follow the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism, utilizing lattice oxygen to create a redox cycle that can help maintain catalyst activity and reduce coking.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, such as unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation due to coke formation, and poor stability at high temperatures. By fine-tuning the geometric and electronic structures of catalysts, researchers hope to create more efficient and durable catalytic systems for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.
