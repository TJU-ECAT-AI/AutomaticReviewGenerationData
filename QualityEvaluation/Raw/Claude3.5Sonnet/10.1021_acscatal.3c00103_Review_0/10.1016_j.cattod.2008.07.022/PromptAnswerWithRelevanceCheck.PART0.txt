<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, industrial demand for propylene, or catalyst design strategies for PDH processes. The document focuses on butane dehydrogenation using vanadium oxide catalysts supported on alumina. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or address the specific challenges and innovations mentioned in the question.

To properly answer this question would require information from other sources about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, industrial propylene production methods, and recent developments in PDH catalyst design that are not present in the provided literature.

给定的科学文献中不包含与丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术、丙烯的工业需求或PDH过程的催化剂设计策略直接相关的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用氧化钒催化剂负载在氧化铝上进行正丁烷脱氢的研究。它没有讨论丙烷脱氢或涉及问题中提到的具体挑战和创新。

要正确回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取有关丙烷脱氢催化剂、工业丙烯生产方法以及PDH催化剂设计最新进展的信息，而这些信息在所提供的文献中并不存在。

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, industrial demand for propylene, or catalyst design strategies for PDH processes. The document focuses on butane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide catalysts supported on alumina, which is a different but related process. While some general principles of catalyst design and deactivation discussed in the paper may be relevant to PDH, the text does not provide direct information to answer the specific question about PDH catalysts and industrial propylene production.
