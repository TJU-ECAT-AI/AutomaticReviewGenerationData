[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

[4] "The ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a direct and efficient method to produce propylene from the abundant propane in shale gas. This approach helps overcome limitations of traditional production methods.

To address deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One promising approach is the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. These catalysts offer several advantages:

1. Low cost and environmentally friendly: Unlike traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts are low-cost and toxicity-free.

2. Improved stability and reusability: The high-silica HZSM-5 support provides a well-defined structure with high surface area and large pore volume, allowing for better distribution of Zn species throughout the support. This improves catalytic activity and stability.

3. Enhanced selectivity and reduced side reactions: The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 promotes propylene desorption and minimizes side reactions, leading to improved propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability.

4. Reduced coke formation: The catalyst design helps minimize coke formation, which is a common issue in PDH processes that leads to catalyst deactivation.

These innovative catalyst designs aim to overcome the limitations of traditional catalysts by offering improved stability, selectivity, and reusability, making them promising candidates for industrial propylene production through PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种直接有效的方法从页岩气中丰富的丙烷生产丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战。这种方法有助于克服传统生产方法的局限性。

为了解决PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。一种有前景的方法是使用负载在高硅HZSM-5沸石上的ZnO催化剂。这些催化剂具有以下几个优势：

1. 低成本和环保：与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂不同，后者昂贵且有毒，ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂成本低廉且无毒。

2. 提高稳定性和可重复使用性：高硅HZSM-5载体提供了具有高比表面积和大孔体积的明确结构，使Zn物种能够更好地分布在整个载体上。这提高了催化活性和稳定性。

3. 提高选择性和减少副反应：高硅HZSM-5的酸度经过良好调节，促进了丙烯脱附并最大限度地减少了副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。

4. 减少积炭形成：催化剂设计有助于最大限度地减少积炭形成，这是PDH过程中导致催化剂失活的一个常见问题。

这些创新的催化剂设计旨在通过提供改进的稳定性、选择性和可重复使用性来克服传统催化剂的局限性，使其成为通过PDH过程进行工业丙烯生产的有前景的候选者。
