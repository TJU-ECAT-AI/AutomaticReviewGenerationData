[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Here we report that the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be used to support ZnO catalysts for the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct route for propylene production from propane, which is abundantly available due to shale gas exploitation. This method offers an alternative to traditional production methods.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves using ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Improved selectivity and stability: The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst (with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 250) shows much higher selectivity and stability compared to catalysts with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. It maintains high propane conversion (43%) and propylene selectivity (93%) even after 10 hours of reaction.

2. Cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness: Unlike traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable.

3. Enhanced catalytic activity: The high specific surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined structure of high-silica HZSM-5 allow for better distribution of Zn species throughout the support. This is directly related to improved catalytic activity.

4. Reduced deactivation: The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 significantly improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions.

5. Prevention of active site aggregation: Unlike low-silica HZSM-5, which tends to cause ZnO aggregation on the external surface, high-silica HZSM-5 prevents this issue, maintaining catalyst efficiency.

These innovative strategies in catalyst design address the major challenges in PDH processes, offering a promising solution for industrial propylene production that is more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly than traditional methods.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从丙烷直接生产丙烯的途径来解决丙烯工业需求增加的挑战，而丙烷由于页岩气的开采而大量可用。这种方法为传统生产方法提供了一种替代选择。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略涉及使用高硅HZSM-5沸石负载的ZnO催化剂。这种方法提供了几个优势：

1. 提高选择性和稳定性：10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂（SiO2/Al2O3比为250）与较低SiO2/Al2O3比的催化剂相比，显示出更高的选择性和稳定性。即使在反应10小时后，它仍保持高丙烷转化率（43%）和丙烯选择性（93%）。

2. 成本效益和环境友好性：与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂不同，后者昂贵且有毒，高硅HZSM-5负载的ZnO催化剂成本低、无毒且可重复使用。

3. 增强的催化活性：高硅HZSM-5的高比表面积、大孔体积和良好定义的结构允许Zn物种在整个载体中更好地分布。这与改善的催化活性直接相关。

4. 降低失活：高硅HZSM-5的良好调节的酸度通过促进丙烯脱附和最小化副反应，显著提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。

5. 防止活性位点聚集：与低硅HZSM-5不同，后者倾向于导致ZnO在外表面聚集，高硅HZSM-5防止了这个问题，保持了催化剂效率。

这些催化剂设计中的创新策略解决了PDH过程中的主要挑战，为工业丙烯生产提供了一种比传统方法更高效、更稳定、更环保的有前途的解决方案。
