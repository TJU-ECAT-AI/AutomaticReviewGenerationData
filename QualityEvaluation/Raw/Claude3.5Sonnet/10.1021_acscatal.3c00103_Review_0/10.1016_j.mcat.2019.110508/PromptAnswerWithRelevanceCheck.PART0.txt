[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Here we report that the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be used to support ZnO catalysts for the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct route for propylene production from propane, which is abundantly available due to shale gas exploitation. This method offers an alternative to traditional production methods.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy involves using ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Improved selectivity and stability: The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst (with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 250) shows much higher selectivity and stability compared to catalysts with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. It maintains high propane conversion (43%) and propylene selectivity (93%) even after 10 hours of reaction.

2. Cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness: Unlike traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable.

3. Enhanced catalytic activity: The high specific surface area, large pore volume, and well-defined structure of high-silica HZSM-5 allow for better distribution of Zn species throughout the support. This is directly related to improved catalytic activity.

4. Reduced deactivation: The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 significantly improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions.

5. Prevention of active site aggregation: Unlike low-silica HZSM-5, which tends to cause ZnO aggregation on the external surface, high-silica HZSM-5 prevents this issue, maintaining catalyst efficiency.

These innovative strategies in catalyst design address the major challenges in PDH processes, offering a promising solution for industrial propylene production that is more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly than traditional methods.
