[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Zn is generally regarded as an effective promoter of Pt based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation to help improve the catalytic activity and stability"

[4] "ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."

[5] "The facile and highly effective ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost and easy to be prepared, representing a promising propane dehydrogenation catalyst."

[6] "After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant due to the exploitation of shale gas. This method provides an alternative to traditional production methods.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One promising approach is the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. These catalysts offer several advantages over traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity and stability: ZnO supported on HZSM-5 with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio shows better selectivity toward propylene and improved stability compared to catalysts with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios.

2. Cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness: The ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst system is low-cost, easy to prepare, and environmentally friendly, addressing the issues of high cost associated with PtSn catalysts and toxicity concerns with CrOx catalysts.

3. Enhanced reusability: The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates good reuse performance, maintaining high propylene selectivity (around 90%) even after multiple cycles, with only a slight decrease in initial propane conversion.

4. Reduced coke formation: The high-silica HZSM-5 support helps minimize coke deposition during the reaction, contributing to improved long-term stability.

5. Optimized acidity: The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 promotes propylene desorption and minimizes side reactions, leading to improved propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability.

These innovative catalyst design strategies aim to overcome the limitations of traditional catalysts by addressing issues of deactivation, stability, and recyclability, making PDH a more viable and efficient process for propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供从丙烷直接生产丙烯的途径来解决丙烯工业需求增加的挑战，而丙烷由于页岩气的开发而变得丰富。这种方法为传统生产方法提供了替代选择。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善PDH过程的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。一种有前景的方法是使用负载在高硅HZSM-5分子筛上的ZnO催化剂。与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂相比，这些催化剂具有以下几个优势：

1. 提高选择性和稳定性：负载在高SiO2/Al2O3比HZSM-5上的ZnO比低SiO2/Al2O3比的催化剂表现出更好的丙烯选择性和改善的稳定性。

2. 成本效益和环境友好性：ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂系统成本低、易于制备且环境友好，解决了PtSn催化剂的高成本问题和CrOx催化剂的毒性问题。

3. 提高可重复使用性：10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂表现出良好的重复使用性能，即使在多次循环后仍保持高丙烯选择性（约90%），初始丙烷转化率仅略有下降。

4. 减少积碳形成：高硅HZSM-5载体有助于最大程度地减少反应过程中的积碳沉积，从而提高长期稳定性。

5. 优化酸度：高硅HZSM-5的良好调节酸度促进了丙烯的脱附并最大程度地减少了副反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。

这些创新的催化剂设计策略旨在通过解决失活、稳定性和可回收性问题来克服传统催化剂的局限性，使PDH成为更可行和高效的丙烯生产过程。
