[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

[4] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[5] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."

[6] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct method to convert propane, which is abundant in shale gas, into propylene. This approach offers an alternative to traditional production methods that may be limited in supply or efficiency.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These include:

1. Using ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. This approach offers several advantages:
   - Low cost and toxicity-free compared to traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts
   - Reusability, making it promising for industrial propylene production
   - High specific surface area and large pore volume of the support
   - Well-defined structure and sparse Al sites, leading to better distribution of Zn species
   - Improved propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability due to well-adjusted acidity

2. Optimizing the support material:
   - High-silica HZSM-5 promotes better distribution of Zn species throughout the support
   - Prevents aggregation of ZnO into bulk particles on the zeolite external surface
   - Enhances catalytic activity

3. Adjusting acidity of the catalyst:
   - Well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 promotes propylene desorption
   - Minimizes side reactions, improving overall efficiency and stability

These strategies aim to create catalysts that are more efficient, stable, and recyclable than traditional options, addressing the key challenges in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种将丙烷（在页岩气中丰富存在）直接转化为丙烯的方法，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加的挑战。这种方法为传统生产方法提供了一种替代选择，传统方法可能在供应或效率方面受到限制。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些包括：

1. 使用高硅HZSM-5沸石负载的ZnO催化剂。这种方法具有以下几个优点：
   - 与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂相比，成本低且无毒
   - 可重复使用，有望用于工业丙烯生产
   - 载体具有高比表面积和大孔体积
   - 结构明确，Al位点稀疏，导致Zn物种分布更好
   - 由于酸度调节得当，提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性

2. 优化载体材料：
   - 高硅HZSM-5促进Zn物种在整个载体中更好地分布
   - 防止ZnO在沸石外表面聚集成块状颗粒
