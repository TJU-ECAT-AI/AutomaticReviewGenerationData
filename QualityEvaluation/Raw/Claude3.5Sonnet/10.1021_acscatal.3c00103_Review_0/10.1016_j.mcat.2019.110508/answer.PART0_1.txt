[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration."

[3] "ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 as efficient catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene"

[4] "The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is of 250) catalyst is much more selective and stable in PDH compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, still presenting a high propane conversion of about 43% with a robust propylene selectivity of 93% after reaction for 10h."

[5] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

[6] "Comprehensive techniques including N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, DR UVvis, XPS, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD and TGA jointly evidence that the high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions."

[7] "The cycling testing results of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in PDH are presented in Fig. 9a. After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by providing a direct and efficient method to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant in shale gas. This approach offers an alternative to traditional production methods that may be limited or less efficient.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One such strategy is the use of ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. This catalyst system offers several advantages:

1. Improved selectivity and stability: The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst shows high propane conversion (43%) and excellent propylene selectivity (93%) even after 10 hours of reaction.

2. Low cost and environmental friendliness: Unlike traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, which are expensive and toxic, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts are low-cost and toxicity-free.

3. Enhanced dispersion of active species: The high-silica HZSM-5 support, with its good textural properties and well-defined structure, helps disperse Zn species effectively and reduces side reactions.

4. Improved reusability: Cycling tests show that the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst maintains high propylene selectivity (around 90%) even after multiple cycles, indicating good reuse performance.

5. Reduced coke formation: The well-adjusted acidity of the high-silica HZSM-5 support helps minimize coke deposition, which is a common cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH processes.

These innovative catalyst design strategies aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the limitations of traditional catalysts and potentially enabling more widespread industrial applications of PDH for propylene production.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种直接高效的方法从丙烷生产丙烯来应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战，而丙烷在页岩气中很丰富。这种方法为可能受限或效率较低的传统生产方法提供了一种替代方案。

为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略是使用负载在高硅HZSM-5分子筛上的氧化锌催化剂。这种催化剂系统提供了几个优势：

1. 提高选择性和稳定性：10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂即使在反应10小时后仍然表现出高丙烷转化率（43%）和优异的丙烯选择性（93%）。

2. 低成本和环境友好：与传统的PtSn和CrOx催化剂不同，后者昂贵且有毒，ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂成本低且无毒。

3. 增强活性物种的分散性：高硅HZSM-5载体具有良好的结构性质和明确的结构，有助于有效分散Zn物种并减少副反应。

4. 提高可重复使用性：循环测试表明，10%Zn/250HZSM-5催化剂即使在多次循环后仍保持高丙烯选择性（约90%），表明具有良好的重复使用性能。

5. 减少积碳形成：高硅HZSM-5载体经过调整的酸度有助于最小化积碳沉积，而积碳是PDH过程中催化剂失活的常见原因。

这些创新的催化剂设计策略旨在为PDH过程创造更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，解决传统催化剂的局限性，并有可能使PDH在丙烯生产中得到更广泛的工业应用。
