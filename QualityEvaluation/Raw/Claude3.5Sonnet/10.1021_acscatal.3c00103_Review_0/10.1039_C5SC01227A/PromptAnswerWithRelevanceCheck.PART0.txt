[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative process to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods, offering potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is becoming more attractive as propane supplies increase due to shale gas production.

3. PDH can be more selective for propylene production compared to traditional cracking methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Using promoters: Adding late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, or rare-earth metal oxides to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying: Combining platinum with other metals like Cu or Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene and reduce coke formation.

3. Optimizing catalyst supports: Exploring different support materials to enhance catalyst stability and activity.

4. Developing new catalyst formulations: Investigating novel catalyst compositions that balance activity, selectivity, and stability.

5. Process modifications: Implementing regeneration cycles or using oxidative dehydrogenation to mitigate coking and extend catalyst lifetime.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH catalysts, particularly coking and deactivation, while maintaining or improving activity and selectivity for propylene production. Ongoing research in this field continues to explore new materials and methods to enhance catalyst performance and process efficiency.
