[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH shows high potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Use of supported Pt or CrOx catalysts, which show high activity.

2. Addition of promoters to increase robustness against coking, including:
   - Late transition metals
   - Main-group metals like Sn and Ga
   - Alkali-metal oxides
   - Rare-earth metal oxides

3. Alloying Pt with late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, reduce deactivation due to coke formation, and enhance selectivity towards the desired propylene product. By addressing these challenges, researchers are working to develop more efficient and sustainable PDH processes for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供替代传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解生产方法来满足不断增长的工业丙烯需求。由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，PDH显示出高盈利潜力。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH工艺的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 使用负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂，这些催化剂显示出高活性。

2. 添加助剂以增加抗积碳能力，包括：
   - 晚过渡金属
   - 主族金属如Sn和Ga
   - 碱金属氧化物
   - 稀土金属氧化物

3. 将Pt与晚过渡金属或主族金属（如Cu和Sn）合金化，以提高对丙烯的选择性。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，减少由于积碳造成的失活，并提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。通过解决这些挑战，研究人员正在努力开发更高效、更可持续的PDH工艺，用于工业丙烯生产。
