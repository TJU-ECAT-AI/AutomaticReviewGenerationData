[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers an alternative process to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods, showing high potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. PDH utilizes supported Pt or CrOx catalysts, which show high activity for propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying Pt catalysts with late transition metals or main-group metals like Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene.

3. Developing catalysts that inhibit the adsorption of formed propylene, suppressing secondary cracking reactions and enhancing anti-coking ability.

4. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure to balance activity and selectivity, aiming for high propylene yield while minimizing deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

These strategies focus on addressing the main challenges in PDH processes, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coking, and aim to improve overall process efficiency and longevity.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法提供了一种替代工艺，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，显示出高盈利潜力。

2. PDH利用负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂，这些催化剂在丙烯生产方面表现出高活性。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 添加后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn、Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等助剂，以提高抗结焦能力。

2. 将Pt催化剂与后过渡金属或Cu和Sn等主族金属合金化，以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 开发能抑制生成的丙烯吸附的催化剂，抑制二次裂解反应并增强抗结焦能力。

4. 优化催化剂组成和结构，平衡活性和选择性，旨在获得高丙烯产率，同时最大限度地减少深度脱氢和焦炭形成。

这些策略主要针对PDH工艺中的主要挑战，特别是由于结焦导致的催化剂失活，并旨在提高整体工艺效率和寿命。
