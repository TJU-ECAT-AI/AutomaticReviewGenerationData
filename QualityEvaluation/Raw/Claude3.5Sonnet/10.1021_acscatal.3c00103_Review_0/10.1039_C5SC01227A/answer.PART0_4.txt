[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers an alternative process to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, showing high potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. PDH utilizes supported Pt or CrOx catalysts, which show high activity for propylene production.

3. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

- Adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase robustness against coking.

- Alloying Pt with late transition metals or main-group metals like Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, reduce deactivation due to coke formation, and enhance selectivity, addressing key challenges in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. By developing more efficient and stable catalysts, researchers are working towards improving the overall performance and recyclability of PDH catalysts for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战：

1. PDH为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解提供了一种替代工艺，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，显示出高盈利潜力。

2. PDH利用负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂，这些催化剂对丙烯生产表现出高活性。

3. 为了克服失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略：

- 添加促进剂，如后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn、Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物，以提高抗结焦能力。

- 将Pt与后过渡金属或主族金属（如Cu和Sn）合金化，以提高对丙烯的选择性。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，减少由于结焦导致的失活，并提高选择性，从而解决氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的关键挑战。通过开发更高效、更稳定的催化剂，研究人员正在努力提高PDH催化剂在工业丙烯生产中的整体性能和可回收性。
