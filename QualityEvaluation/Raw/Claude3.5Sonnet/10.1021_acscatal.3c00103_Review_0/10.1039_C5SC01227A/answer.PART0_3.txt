[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[5] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative process to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods, offering potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. PDH utilizes supported Pt or CrOx catalysts, which show high activity for propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying Pt catalysts with late transition metals or main-group metals like Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards propylene.

3. Developing catalysts that inhibit the adsorption of formed propylene, suppressing secondary cracking reactions and enhancing anti-coking ability.

These strategies aim to address the main challenge of catalyst deactivation due to coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity in PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法提供了一种替代工艺，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，具有潜在的盈利能力。

2. PDH利用负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂，这些催化剂对丙烯生产表现出高活性。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 添加后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn，Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等促进剂，以增加抗结焦能力。

2. 将Pt催化剂与后过渡金属或主族金属（如Cu和Sn）合金化，以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 开发能抑制生成的丙烯吸附的催化剂，抑制二次裂解反应并增强抗结焦能力。

这些策略旨在解决PDH过程中由于结焦而导致的催化剂失活这一主要挑战，同时保持高活性和选择性。
