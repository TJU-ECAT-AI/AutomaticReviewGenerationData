[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023"

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "Promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering dedicated processes for propylene production. Traditional methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking produce propylene as a co-product, which limits the ability to increase propylene output without affecting other products.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These include:

1. Using CO2 as a co-reactant in CO2-PDH processes, which helps remove thermodynamic limitations and increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions.

2. Developing chromium-based catalysts supported on siliceous Beta zeolite (SiBeta), which show high activity and selectivity for propene production.

3. Dealumination of the zeolite support, which significantly impacts catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta achieves high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promotes unwanted propane cracking.

4. Optimizing chromium content and dispersion on the support to maximize the number of redox Cr species, which correlates with catalytic performance up to a certain point.

5. Utilizing CO2 as a promoter, which enhances the formation rate of propene in cycles with CO2 addition compared to those without it.

These strategies aim to create more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the growing demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供专门的丙烯生产工艺来应对工业需求增长的挑战。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解将丙烯作为副产品生产，这限制了增加丙烯产量而不影响其他产品的能力。

正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可循环性。这些策略包括：

1. 在CO2-PDH过程中使用CO2作为共反应物，有助于消除热力学限制，并通过连续反应中的氢结合增加产量。

2. 开发以硅质Beta沸石(SiBeta)为载体的铬基催化剂，显示出高活性和高选择性的丙烯生产能力。

3. 沸石载体的脱铝，对催化性能有显著影响。SiBeta的低酸性可实现高丙烯选择性(超过80%)，而AlBeta的高酸性则促进不需要的丙烷裂解。

4. 优化载体上的铬含量和分散度，以最大化氧化还原铬物种的数量，这与催化性能在一定程度上相关。

5. 利用CO2作为促进剂，在添加CO2的循环中提高丙烯的生成速率，相比无CO2的循环更高。

这些策略旨在为PDH过程创造更高效和稳定的催化剂，满足丙烯不断增长的需求，同时克服传统生产方法的局限性。
