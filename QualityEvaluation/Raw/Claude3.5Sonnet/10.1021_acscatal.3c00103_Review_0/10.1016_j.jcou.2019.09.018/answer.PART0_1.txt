[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses."

[2] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023"

[3] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs. However, this process has disadvantages such as reversibility and endothermalness."

[4] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."

[5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH"

[6] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a selective process to obtain propene directly from propane. This is important as traditional production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking, where propene is obtained as a co-product, are unable to meet the growing demand without negatively impacting other valuable products.

To overcome the limitations of traditional PDH, which include reversibility and endothermalness, researchers are developing innovative alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH) and dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). These processes aim to remove thermodynamic limits or increase production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions.

In terms of catalyst design strategies, researchers are focusing on:

1. Improving dispersion and presence of redox chromium species, which are crucial for high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

2. Dealumination of zeolite supports, which has been shown to have a significant impact on catalytic properties. For example, low acidity SiBeta supports achieve high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity AlBeta promotes undesirable propane cracking.

3. Optimizing chromium content and distribution on the support to enhance activity and selectivity.

4. Developing supports with high surface areas (like mesoporous materials) to ensure better dispersion of active species.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve selectivity towards propene, and reduce deactivation issues, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种从丙烷直接获得丙烯的选择性工艺来应对工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。这一点很重要，因为像蒸汽裂解和催化裂解这样的传统生产方法，其中丙烯作为副产品获得，无法满足不断增长的需求而不对其他有价值的产品产生负面影响。

为了克服传统PDH的局限性，包括可逆性和吸热性，研究人员正在开发创新的替代方案，如与O2的氧化脱氢(ODH)和在CO2存在下的脱氢(CO2-PDH)。这些工艺旨在消除热力学限制或通过连续反应中的氢结合来增加产量。

在催化剂设计策略方面，研究人员正在关注：

1. 改善分散性和存在还原性铬物种，这对CO2-PDH的高催化性能至关重要。

2. 沸石支撑体的脱铝，这已被证明对催化性能有显著影响。例如，低酸性SiBeta支撑体可实现高选择性的丙烯(80%以上)，而高酸性AlBeta则促进不希望的丙烷裂解。

3. 优化支撑体上的铬含量和分布，以提高活性和选择性。

4. 开发具有高比表面积的支撑体(如介孔材料)，以确保活性物种更好的分散。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，改善对丙烯的选择性，并减少失活问题，最终导致更高效和可持续的PDH工艺。
