          [1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH"

[6] "Promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene through several innovative approaches:

1. Alternative processes: PDH offers dedicated processes for propylene production, unlike traditional methods (steam cracking, catalytic cracking) where propylene is a co-product. This allows for increased propylene output without affecting other valuable products.

2. Co-reagent utilization: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2 and dehydrogenation with CO2 (CO2-PDH) use co-reagents to overcome thermodynamic limitations of traditional PDH or increase production through hydrogen binding.

3. Innovative catalyst designs: 
   a. Chromium incorporation in siliceous Beta zeolites (SiBeta) has produced active and selective catalysts for CO2-PDH.
   b. Dealumination of zeolite supports significantly impacts catalytic properties. Low-acidity SiBeta achieves high propene selectivity (>80%), while high-acidity AlBeta promotes unwanted propane cracking.
   c. Optimizing chromium content and dispersion on supports to maximize redox Cr species, which correlates with catalytic performance.

4. CO2 as a promoter: The addition of CO2 in reaction cycles enhances the formation rate of propene compared to cycles without it.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing deactivation issues, enhancing stability, and improving recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. By optimizing support materials, metal loading, and preparation methods, researchers are working towards more sustainable propylene production to meet growing industrial demands.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过几种创新方法应对工业丙烯需求不断增长的挑战：

1. 替代工艺：PDH提供专门的丙烯生产工艺，不同于传统方法（蒸汽裂解、催化裂解）中丙烯作为副产品。这允许增加丙烯产量而不影响其他有价值的产品。

2. 共反应物利用：与O2的氧化脱氢(ODH)和与CO2的脱氢(CO2-PDH)使用共反应物来克服传统PDH的热力学限制或通过氢结合增加产量。

3. 创新催化剂设计：
   a. 将铬引入硅质Beta沸石(SiBeta)已经为CO2-PDH生产出活性和选择性都很高的催化剂。
   b. 沸石载体的脱铝对催化性能有显著影响。低酸性SiBeta实现高丙烯选择性(>80%)，而高酸性AlBeta促进不需要的丙烷裂解。
   c. 优化载体上的铬含量和分散度，以最大化氧化还原铬物种，这与催化性能相关。

4. CO2作为促进剂：在反应循环中添加CO2可提高丙烯的生成速率，相比无CO2的循环更高。

这些策略旨在为PDH工艺开发更高效和稳定的催化剂，解决失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH工艺中的可循环性。通过优化载体材料、金属负载和制备方法，研究人员正在努力实现更可持续的丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
