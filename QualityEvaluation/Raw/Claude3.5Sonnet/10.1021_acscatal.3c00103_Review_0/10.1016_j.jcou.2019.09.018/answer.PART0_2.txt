[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023"

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta. The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure"

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "It is clear from Table 3 that CrxSiBeta exhibits high catalytic performance, similar to other well know chromium oxide-based system supported on mesoporous silica supports (SBA-1, SB-15, MCM-41, MSU-x) or active carbon. In CrxSiBeta series maximum initial yield 27.2 % was obtained on the sample with 7wt % of Cr."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering alternative production methods to traditional steam cracking and catalytic cracking. These techniques include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2 and dehydrogenation with CO2 (CO2-PDH), which utilize co-reagents to overcome thermodynamic limitations or increase production through hydrogen binding.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to enhance performance in PDH processes. One approach involves incorporating chromium into siliceous Beta zeolites (SiBeta) through a two-step post-synthesis preparation procedure. This method has produced active and selective catalysts for CO2-PDH.

Dealumination of the zeolite support has been shown to have a significant impact on catalytic properties. Low-acidity SiBeta supports achieve high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high-acidity AlBeta supports promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.

The CrxSiBeta catalyst series has demonstrated high catalytic performance, comparable to other chromium oxide-based systems supported on mesoporous silica or activated carbon. The best performance in this series was achieved with 7 wt% Cr loading, yielding an initial propene yield of 27.2%.

These developments in catalyst design aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. By optimizing support materials, metal loading, and preparation methods, researchers are working towards more efficient and sustainable propylene production to meet growing industrial demands.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供传统蒸汽裂解和催化裂解之外的替代生产方法来应对工业丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。这些技术包括氧气氧化脱氢(ODH)和二氧化碳辅助脱氢(CO2-PDH)，它们利用共反应物来克服热力学限制或通过氢键结合增加产量。

正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略以提高PDH过程的性能。一种方法是通过两步后合成制备程序将铬引入硅质Beta沸石(SiBeta)。这种方法已经为CO2-PDH生产出活性和选择性都很高的催化剂。

沸石载体的脱铝已被证明对催化性能有显著影响。低酸性SiBeta载体可实现高丙烯选择性(超过80%)，而高酸性AlBeta载体则促进不良的丙烷裂解反应。

CrxSiBeta催化剂系列表现出高催化性能，可与其他以介孔硅或活性炭为载体的铬氧化物系统相媲美。该系列中最佳性能是在7 wt%铬负载下实现的，初始丙烯产率达27.2%。

这些催化剂设计的发展旨在克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可循环性。通过优化载体材料、金属负载和制备方法，研究人员正在努力实现更高效和可持续的丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
