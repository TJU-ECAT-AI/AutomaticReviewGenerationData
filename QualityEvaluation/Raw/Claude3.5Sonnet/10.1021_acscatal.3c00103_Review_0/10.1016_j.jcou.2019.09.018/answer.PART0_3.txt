[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[3] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."

[4] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."

[5] "Over all materials investigated conversion of propane drops with TOS, slightly for Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite with low Cr content (Cr0.5SiBeta and Cr1.0SiBeta) and much significantly for Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite with higher Cr content (higher than 2 Cr wt %)."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering dedicated processes for propylene production. Traditional methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are limited in their ability to meet the growing demand without negatively impacting other valuable co-products.

PDH processes, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH) and dehydrogenation with CO2 (CO2-PDH), utilize co-reagents to overcome thermodynamic limitations of traditional PDH or increase production through hydrogen binding. These processes typically achieve higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on developing chromium-based catalysts supported on siliceous materials like SiBeta zeolite. These catalysts show a correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield, with optimal performance observed up to 2 wt% Cr content.

To address deactivation issues and enhance stability, researchers are exploring the effects of dealumination on catalyst supports. Dealuminated SiBeta supports show improved catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH compared to their alumina-rich counterparts.

However, challenges remain in maintaining catalyst stability over time. Catalysts with higher Cr content (above 2 wt%) show more significant drops in propane conversion over time-on-stream. This suggests that further research is needed to optimize catalyst composition and structure to improve long-term stability and recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供专门的丙烯生产工艺来满足不断增长的工业丙烯需求。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解在满足不断增长的需求方面受到限制，同时不会对其他有价值的副产品产生负面影响。

PDH工艺，特别是与O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）和与CO2的脱氢（CO2-PDH），利用共反应物来克服传统PDH的热力学限制或通过氢结合增加产量。这些工艺通常比商业非氧化脱氢实现更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

创新的催化剂设计策略专注于开发以SiBeta沸石等硅质材料为载体的铬基催化剂。这些催化剂显示出氧化还原Cr位点数量与丙烯产率之间的相关性，在Cr含量达到2 wt%时观察到最佳性能。

为了解决失活问题并提高稳定性，研究人员正在探索脱铝对催化剂载体的影响。与富铝的对应物相比，脱铝的SiBeta载体在CO2-PDH中表现出更好的催化活性和选择性。

然而，保持催化剂长期稳定性仍然面临挑战。Cr含量较高（超过2 wt%）的催化剂随着反应时间的推移，丙烷转化率下降更为显著。这表明需要进一步研究优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高氧化和非氧化PDH工艺中的长期稳定性和可回收性。
