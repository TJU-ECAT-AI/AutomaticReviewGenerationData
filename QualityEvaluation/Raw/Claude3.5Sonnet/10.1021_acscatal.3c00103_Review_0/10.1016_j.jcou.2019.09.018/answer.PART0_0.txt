[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research. One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[4] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[5] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene in several ways:

1. PDH provides a selective process for obtaining propene directly from propane, helping to meet the growing demand without decreasing production of other valuable products from traditional methods like steam cracking.

2. Innovative catalyst designs are being developed to overcome limitations of traditional PDH:

- Use of co-reagents like O2 (ODH) or CO2 (CO2-PDH) to remove thermodynamic limitations and increase propene yield.

- Development of new catalyst materials like Cr-containing Beta zeolites, which offer advantages such as:
  - Three-dimensional pore structure 
  - Large pore openings
  - High thermal and acid stability
  - Large surface area for high chromium dispersion

3. Dealumination of zeolite supports (e.g. SiBeta vs AlBeta) is being explored to improve catalyst properties:
  - Lower acidity of SiBeta achieves higher propene selectivity (>80%)
  - Reduces unwanted cracking reactions 

4. Focus on understanding and optimizing the role of chromium species in the catalysts to enhance activity, selectivity and stability.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing issues of deactivation and improving overall performance for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种从丙烷直接获得丙烯的选择性过程，有助于满足不断增长的需求，同时不减少传统方法（如蒸汽裂解）中其他有价值产品的生产。

2. 正在开发创新的催化剂设计，以克服传统PDH的局限性：

- 使用O2（ODH）或CO2（CO2-PDH）等共反应物来消除热力学限制并增加丙烯产率。

- 开发新的催化剂材料，如含铬Beta沸石，具有以下优势：
  - 三维孔道结构
  - 大孔开口
  - 高热稳定性和酸稳定性
  - 大比表面积，有利于铬的高度分散

3. 正在探索沸石载体的脱铝（如SiBeta与AlBeta的比较）以改善催化剂性能：
  - SiBeta的较低酸度可实现更高的丙烯选择性（>80%）
  - 减少不需要的裂化反应

4. 着重于理解和优化催化剂中铬物种的作用，以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在为氧化和非氧化PDH过程开发更高效、更稳定的催化剂，解决失活问题，并提高工业丙烯生产的整体性能。
