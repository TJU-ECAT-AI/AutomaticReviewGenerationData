<quotes>

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."

[2] "Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research. One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

[4] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[5] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene in several ways:

1. PDH provides a selective process for obtaining propene directly from propane, helping to meet the growing demand without decreasing production of other valuable products from traditional methods like steam cracking.

2. Innovative catalyst designs are being developed to overcome limitations of traditional PDH:

- Use of co-reagents like O2 (ODH) or CO2 (CO2-PDH) to remove thermodynamic limitations and increase propene yield.

- Development of new catalyst materials like Cr-containing Beta zeolites, which offer advantages such as:
  - Three-dimensional pore structure 
  - Large pore openings
  - High thermal and acid stability
  - Large surface area for high chromium dispersion

3. Dealumination of zeolite supports (e.g. SiBeta vs AlBeta) is being explored to improve catalyst properties:
  - Lower acidity of SiBeta achieves higher propene selectivity (>80%)
  - Reduces unwanted cracking reactions 

4. Focus on understanding and optimizing the role of chromium species in the catalysts to enhance activity, selectivity and stability.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing issues of deactivation and improving overall performance for industrial propylene production.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a selective process to obtain propene directly from propane. This is important as traditional production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking, where propene is obtained as a co-product, are unable to meet the growing demand without negatively impacting other valuable products.

To overcome the limitations of traditional PDH, which include reversibility and endothermalness, researchers are developing innovative alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH) and dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). These processes aim to remove thermodynamic limits or increase production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions.

In terms of catalyst design strategies, researchers are focusing on:

1. Improving dispersion and presence of redox chromium species, which are crucial for high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

2. Dealumination of zeolite supports, which has been shown to have a significant impact on catalytic properties. For example, low acidity SiBeta supports achieve high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity AlBeta promotes undesirable propane cracking.

3. Optimizing chromium content and distribution on the support to enhance activity and selectivity.

4. Developing supports with high surface areas (like mesoporous materials) to ensure better dispersion of active species.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve selectivity towards propene, and reduce deactivation issues, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering dedicated processes for propylene production. Traditional methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are limited in their ability to meet the growing demand without negatively impacting other valuable co-products.

PDH processes, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH) and dehydrogenation with CO2 (CO2-PDH), utilize co-reagents to overcome thermodynamic limitations of traditional PDH or increase production through hydrogen binding. These processes typically achieve higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on developing chromium-based catalysts supported on siliceous materials like SiBeta zeolite. These catalysts show a correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield, with optimal performance observed up to 2 wt% Cr content.

To address deactivation issues and enhance stability, researchers are exploring the effects of dealumination on catalyst supports. Dealuminated SiBeta supports show improved catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH compared to their alumina-rich counterparts.

However, challenges remain in maintaining catalyst stability over time. Catalysts with higher Cr content (above 2 wt%) show more significant drops in propane conversion over time-on-stream. This suggests that further research is needed to optimize catalyst composition and structure to improve long-term stability and recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

PDH工艺，特别是与O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）和与CO2的脱氢（CO2-PDH），利用共反应物来克服传统PDH的热力学限制或通过氢结合增加产量。这些工艺通常比商业非氧化脱氢实现更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

创新的催化剂设计策略专注于开发以SiBeta沸石等硅质材料为载体的铬基催化剂。这些催化剂显示出氧化还原Cr位点数量与丙烯产率之间的相关性，在Cr含量达到2 wt%时观察到最佳性能。

为了解决失活问题并提高稳定性，研究人员正在探索脱铝对催化剂载体的影响。与富铝的对应物相比，脱铝的SiBeta载体在CO2-PDH中表现出更好的催化活性和选择性。

然而，保持催化剂长期稳定性仍然面临挑战。Cr含量较高（超过2 wt%）的催化剂随着反应时间的推移，丙烷转化率下降更为显著。这表明需要进一步研究优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高氧化和非氧化PDH工艺中的长期稳定性和可回收性。

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These include:

1. Using CO2 as a co-reactant in CO2-PDH processes, which helps remove thermodynamic limitations and increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions.

3. Dealumination of the zeolite support, which significantly impacts catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta achieves high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promotes unwanted propane cracking.

4. Optimizing chromium content and dispersion on the support to maximize the number of redox Cr species, which correlates with catalytic performance up to a certain point.

5. Utilizing CO2 as a promoter, which enhances the formation rate of propene in cycles with CO2 addition compared to those without it.

These strategies aim to create more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the growing demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods.
