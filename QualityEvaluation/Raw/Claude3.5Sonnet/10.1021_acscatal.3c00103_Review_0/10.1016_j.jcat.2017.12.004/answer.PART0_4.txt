[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an attractive alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH can directly convert propane to propylene, helping to meet the growing demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These include:

1. Exploring novel catalysts: Instead of traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts that have price and deactivation disadvantages, researchers are investigating V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts. V-based catalysts, in particular, are seen as promising alternatives due to their reasonable price and environmental friendliness.

2. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods: The study describes a one-step synthesis method for preparing VOX-SiO2 catalysts, with careful control of gelation and calcination temperatures to optimize catalyst structure and performance.

3. Enhancing long-term stability: The optimized 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability, maintaining high propene selectivity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

4. Improving recyclability: The study demonstrated that the catalyst could be regenerated in situ and maintain its performance over multiple cycles, addressing the issue of catalyst deactivation.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, making PDH a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种替代传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)的有吸引力的选择来应对工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。PDH可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，有助于满足不断增长的需求。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些包括：

1. 探索新型催化剂：研究人员正在研究基于V、Ga和Sn的催化剂，而不是具有价格和失活缺点的传统Pt和Cr基催化剂。特别是基于V的催化剂，由于其合理的价格和环境友好性，被视为有前景的替代品。

2. 优化催化剂制备方法：该研究描述了一种制备VOX-SiO2催化剂的一步合成方法，通过仔细控制凝胶化和煅烧温度来优化催化剂结构和性能。

3. 增强长期稳定性：优化的60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂表现出优异的长期稳定性，在多个反应-再生循环中保持高丙烯选择性。

4. 提高可回收性：研究表明，该催化剂可以原位再生并在多个循环中保持其性能，解决了催化剂失活的问题。

这些策略旨在为氧化和非氧化PDH过程开发更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，使PDH成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
