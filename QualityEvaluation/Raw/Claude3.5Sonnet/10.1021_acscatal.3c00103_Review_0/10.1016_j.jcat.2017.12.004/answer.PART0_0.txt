[1] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH can be classified into two main types: oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Oxidative PDH has advantages such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition. However, it generates unwanted by-products due to deep oxidation of propene.

Non-oxidative PDH has been commercially implemented using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. However, these catalysts face challenges related to high costs, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns, particularly with CrOX species.

To overcome these limitations, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs using alternative materials such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts. V-based catalysts, in particular, show promise as they are cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

One innovative catalyst design strategy involves the development of VOX-doped porous SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2). These catalysts have shown excellent performance in non-oxidative PDH. For instance, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibited remarkable long-term stability over eight reaction-regeneration cycles. It maintained high propene selectivity (around 91%) and showed only a gradual decrease in propane conversion (from 55% to 45% over 4 hours).

These advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and address deactivation issues in PDH processes, making them more viable for industrial applications.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供替代传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的生产方法来满足工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。PDH可以分为两种主要类型：氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢。

氧化PDH具有避免热力学平衡限制和减少碳沉积等优点。然而，由于丙烯的深度氧化，它会产生不想要的副产品。

非氧化PDH已经使用Pt和Cr基催化剂在商业上实施。但是，这些催化剂面临着高成本、失活问题和环境问题的挑战，特别是与CrOX物种相关的问题。

为了克服这些限制，研究人员正在使用V、Ga和Sn等替代材料开发创新的催化剂设计。特别是V基催化剂显示出前景，因为它们具有成本效益和环境友好性。

一种创新的催化剂设计策略涉及开发VOX掺杂的多孔SiO2固体(VOX-SiO2)。这些催化剂在非氧化PDH中表现出优异的性能。例如，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂在八个反应-再生循环中表现出显著的长期稳定性。它保持了高丙烯选择性（约91%），并且丙烷转化率仅缓慢下降（4小时内从55%降至45%）。

这些催化剂设计的进展旨在提高稳定性，改善可回收性，并解决PDH过程中的失活问题，使其更适合工业应用。
