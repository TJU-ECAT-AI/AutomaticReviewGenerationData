[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an attractive alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for more targeted production of propylene to meet growing demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. The study focuses on vanadium-based catalysts as a potential alternative to platinum and chromium catalysts, which suffer from high costs and deactivation issues. Vanadium catalysts offer advantages of being reasonably priced and environmentally friendly.

The researchers developed a novel VOX-SiO2 catalyst synthesized through an in-situ one-step method. By optimizing the gelation and calcination temperatures, they created a catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) that exhibits excellent long-term stability. This catalyst maintained high propene selectivity (~91%) over eight reaction-regeneration cycles, with only a modest decrease in propane conversion from 55% to 45% over 4 hours.

This work demonstrates how innovative catalyst design strategies can address key challenges in PDH processes. By developing catalysts with improved stability and recyclability, researchers are working towards more efficient and sustainable propylene production to meet growing industrial demands.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种替代传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化)的有吸引力的选择来应对工业对丙烯需求增加的挑战。PDH允许更有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计。该研究专注于钒基催化剂作为铂和铬催化剂的潜在替代品，后者存在成本高和失活问题。钒催化剂具有价格合理和环境友好的优势。

研究人员通过原位一步法合成开发了一种新型VOX-SiO2催化剂。通过优化凝胶化和煅烧温度，他们创造了一种具有优异长期稳定性的催化剂(60-VOX-SiO2-580)。该催化剂在八个反应-再生循环中保持了高丙烯选择性(~91%)，4小时内丙烷转化率仅从55%温和下降到45%。

这项工作展示了创新的催化剂设计策略如何解决PDH过程中的关键挑战。通过开发具有改进的稳定性和可回收性的催化剂，研究人员正在努力实现更高效和可持续的丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
