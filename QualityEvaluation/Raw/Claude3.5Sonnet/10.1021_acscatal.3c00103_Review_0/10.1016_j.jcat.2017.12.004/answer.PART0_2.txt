[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an attractive alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for more targeted production of propylene to meet growing demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. One promising approach is the use of vanadium-based catalysts as alternatives to traditional platinum and chromium catalysts. V-based catalysts offer advantages of being reasonably priced and environmentally friendly.

Specific catalyst design strategies to improve performance and recyclability include:

1. Developing porous silica-supported vanadium oxide (VOX-SiO2) catalysts through one-step synthesis methods.

2. Optimizing gelation and calcination temperatures during catalyst preparation to enhance dispersion of active species and structural stability. 

3. Creating mesoporous catalyst structures with high surface areas to improve activity.

4. Incorporating regeneration cycles to restore catalyst performance after deactivation.

These innovative approaches have yielded catalysts with remarkable long-term stability. For example, an optimized VOX-SiO2 catalyst demonstrated excellent performance over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, maintaining high propene selectivity of around 91% even as conversion decreased slightly.

By addressing deactivation and stability challenges through advanced catalyst design, PDH techniques are becoming increasingly viable for industrial propylene production to meet growing demand.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种有吸引力的替代传统生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化）来应对丙烯工业需求增长的挑战。PDH允许更有针对性地生产丙烯以满足日益增长的需求。

为了克服失活问题并增强PDH过程的稳定性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计。一种有前景的方法是使用钒基催化剂作为传统铂和铬催化剂的替代品。钒基催化剂具有价格合理和环境友好的优势。

提高性能和可回收性的具体催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 通过一步合成方法开发多孔二氧化硅负载的氧化钒（VOX-SiO2）催化剂。

2. 优化催化剂制备过程中的凝胶化和煅烧温度，以增强活性物种的分散性和结构稳定性。

3. 创建具有高比表面积的介孔催化剂结构以提高活性。

4. 引入再生循环以恢复失活后的催化剂性能。

这些创新方法已经产生了具有显著长期稳定性的催化剂。例如，一种优化的VOX-SiO2催化剂在多个反应-再生循环中表现出优异的性能，即使转化率略有下降，丙烯选择性仍保持在91%左右的高水平。

通过先进的催化剂设计解决失活和稳定性挑战，PDH技术正在变得越来越适合工业丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的需求。
