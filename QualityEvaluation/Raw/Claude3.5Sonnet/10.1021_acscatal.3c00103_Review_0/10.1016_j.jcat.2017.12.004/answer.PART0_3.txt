[1] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH processes can be classified into oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Oxidative PDH (ODHP) has advantages such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition. However, it generates unwanted by-products due to deep oxidation of propene.

Non-oxidative PDH has been commercialized using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. However, these catalysts face issues with high cost, deactivation, and environmental concerns (particularly for Cr-based catalysts).

To overcome these challenges, researchers are developing novel catalyst designs using materials like vanadium, gallium, and tin. V-based catalysts are particularly promising as they are cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

One innovative catalyst design strategy involves creating porous VOX-SiO2 solids through an in-situ one-step synthesis method. By optimizing gelation and calcination temperatures, researchers have developed catalysts with improved stability and recyclability. For example, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst demonstrates remarkable long-term stability over eight reaction-regeneration cycles, maintaining high propene selectivity (around 91%) and showing only a gradual decrease in propane conversion (from 55% to 45% over 4 hours).

These advancements in catalyst design aim to enhance PDH processes by improving catalyst stability, reducing deactivation issues, and enabling better recyclability, thus making PDH a more viable and sustainable option for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种替代传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的生产方法来解决工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。PDH过程可以分为氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢。

氧化PDH（ODHP）具有避免热力学平衡限制和减少碳沉积等优势。然而，它会由于丙烯的深度氧化而产生不需要的副产品。

非氧化PDH已经使用铂基和铬基催化剂实现了商业化。然而，这些催化剂面临高成本、失活和环境问题（尤其是铬基催化剂）。

为了克服这些挑战，研究人员正在开发使用钒、镓和锡等材料的新型催化剂设计。钒基催化剂特别有前景，因为它们是铂基和铬基催化剂的经济有效和环境友好的替代品。

一种创新的催化剂设计策略涉及通过原位一步合成方法创建多孔VOX-SiO2固体。通过优化凝胶化和煅烧温度，研究人员开发出具有改进的稳定性和可回收性的催化剂。例如，60-VOX-SiO2-580催化剂在八个反应-再生循环中表现出显著的长期稳定性，保持高丙烯选择性（约91%），并且丙烷转化率仅缓慢下降（4小时内从55%降至45%）。

这些催化剂设计的进展旨在通过提高催化剂稳定性、减少失活问题和实现更好的可回收性来增强PDH过程，从而使PDH成为工业丙烯生产更可行和可持续的选择。
