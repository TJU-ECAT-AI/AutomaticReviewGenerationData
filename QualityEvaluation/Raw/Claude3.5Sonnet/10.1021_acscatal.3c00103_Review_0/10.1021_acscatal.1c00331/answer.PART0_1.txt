[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."

[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[4] "First, a simple relation between the concentration of coke with time, [...] was given by Voorhies."

[5] "The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst."

[6] "As summarized in Table 1, most of the appropriate modification methods increase the activity and selectivity and decrease the amount of coke."

[7] "In recent days, the new strategies of catalysts design in PDH are proposed and verified to effectively curb coke formation. The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability."

[8] "Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a more targeted and efficient approach to propylene production compared to traditional cracking methods. It allows for on-purpose, large-scale propylene production, helping meet the dramatically increased demand.

2. PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstock, particularly from shale gas resources, opening new opportunities for propylene production.

3. The process is more selective towards propylene compared to conventional cracking methods.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Modification of Pt-based catalysts: Researchers are working on altering the structure and composition of Pt catalysts to curb coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

2. Use of promoters: Adding elements like Sn, Cu, and In to Pt catalysts has shown improvements in activity, selectivity, and coke resistance.

3. Support engineering: Modifying catalyst supports through doping or altering pore structures can help reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

4. Single atom/site strategy: This new approach achieves both good activity and impressive stability by minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation.

5. Confined cluster strategy: Developing subnanometer PtSn clusters confined in zeolites has shown excellent resistance to coke formation and improved stability.

6. Kinetic modeling: Researchers are developing more sophisticated models to understand and predict coke formation, which can inform better catalyst design.

7. Regeneration techniques: While prevention strategies are improving, efforts are also focused on developing effective regeneration methods to prolong catalyst life and improve recyclability.

These strategies aim to address the primary challenge of coke formation in PDH processes, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance and extending catalyst lifetime in industrial applications.
