Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a more promising and effective route for large-scale propylene production. PDH has already been exploited in industry, with platinum-based catalysts employed in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex.

However, coke formation during PDH severely undermines catalytic performance and stability, making it urgent to find effective ways to reduce coking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome these issues:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: For example, single Pt atoms surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduce the barrier for propene desorption, making product desorption more favorable than deep dehydrogenation. This greatly diminishes coke formation and extends catalyst lifetime.

2. Confined metal clusters: Subnanometer Pt clusters confined in zeolites can be precisely deposited at specific positions, creating unique interactions between the catalyst and support. This approach has shown excellent resistance to coke formation.

3. Promoters and support modifications: Various metal promoters (e.g., Sn, Cu, In) and support additives are being explored to enhance stability and reduce coking.

4. Regeneration techniques: Methods to effectively burn off coke deposits and restore catalyst activity are being optimized.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and extend the operational lifetime of PDH catalysts by addressing the key challenge of coke deposition.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种更有前景和有效的大规模丙烯生产路线，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。PDH已经在工业中得到应用，铂基催化剂被用于UOP公司的Oleflex等商业工艺中。

然而，PDH过程中的积碳形成严重影响了催化性能和稳定性，因此迫切需要找到有效的方法来减少积碳。正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 单原子/单位点催化剂：例如，被惰性铜包围的单个铂原子显著降低了丙烯脱附的能垒，使产物脱附比深度脱氢更有利。这大大减少了积碳形成并延长了催化剂寿命。

2. 受限金属簇：限制在分子筛中的亚纳米铂簇可以精确沉积在特定位置，在催化剂和载体之间创造独特的相互作用。这种方法表现出优异的抗积碳能力。

3. 助剂和载体改性：正在探索各种金属助剂（如Sn、Cu、In）和载体添加剂，以提高稳定性并减少积碳。

4. 再生技术：正在优化有效燃烧积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性的方法。

这些策略旨在通过解决积碳沉积这一关键挑战，来提高催化剂稳定性，改善可回收性，并延长PDH催化剂的运行寿命。
