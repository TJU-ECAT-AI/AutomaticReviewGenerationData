[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[3] "First, the polymerization of adsorbed propylene was considered as the pathway of coke formation. First, propylene formed a propylene dimer (PD). Then PD reacts with propylene to form coke precursor (CP). The monolayer coke is formed through the reaction between CP and PD or propylene. Finally, the multilayer coke is formed from monolayer coke."

[4] "The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. The propane dehydrogenation is not a size-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent. This difference opened the opportunity which can achieve good activity and reduce cokes by diminishing side reactions from the rational adjustment of catalyst size."

[5] "Recently, Corma's group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.5−0.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a more efficient and selective on-purpose production method compared to traditional cracking processes. PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the abundance of light alkanes from shale gas discoveries.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: These catalysts achieve good activity and impressive stability by exploiting the size-dependent nature of side reactions. By using single Pt atoms or sites, the catalysts can maintain high activity for propane dehydrogenation while minimizing coke-forming side reactions.

2. Confined metal clusters: Researchers have developed PtSn cluster catalysts confined within zeolite structures. This approach allows for precise control over the size and location of the catalytic sites, leading to improved stability and coke resistance.

3. Promoter addition: The use of promoters, such as Sn, helps to modify the catalytic properties of Pt from both geometric and electronic perspectives. This can simultaneously increase activity and stability.

4. Support modification: Additives to conventional supports like alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support, improving catalyst longevity.

5. Coke migration strategies: Efforts are being made to promote the migration of coke from active metal sites to the support, allowing the catalyst to accommodate more coke before regeneration is necessary.

These strategies aim to address the primary challenge of coke formation, which severely undermines catalytic performance and stability in PDH processes. By developing catalysts that are more resistant to coking or can better manage coke formation, researchers are working to improve the overall efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH catalysts.
