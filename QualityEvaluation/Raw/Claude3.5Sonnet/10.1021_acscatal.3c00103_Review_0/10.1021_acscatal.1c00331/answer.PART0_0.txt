[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[3] "First, the polymerization of adsorbed propylene was considered as the pathway of coke formation. First, propylene formed a propylene dimer (PD). Then PD reacts with propylene to form coke precursor (CP). The monolayer coke is formed through the reaction between CP and PD or propylene. Finally, the multilayer coke is formed from monolayer coke."

[4] "The concept of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. The propane dehydrogenation is not a size-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are size-dependent. This difference opened the opportunity which can achieve good activity and reduce cokes by diminishing side reactions from the rational adjustment of catalyst size."

[5] "Recently, Corma's group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.5−0.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a more efficient and selective on-purpose production method compared to traditional cracking processes. PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which is particularly advantageous given the abundance of light alkanes from shale gas discoveries.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: These catalysts achieve good activity and impressive stability by exploiting the size-dependent nature of side reactions. By using single Pt atoms or sites, the catalysts can maintain high activity for propane dehydrogenation while minimizing coke-forming side reactions.

2. Confined metal clusters: Researchers have developed PtSn cluster catalysts confined within zeolite structures. This approach allows for precise control over the size and location of the catalytic sites, leading to improved stability and coke resistance.

3. Promoter addition: The use of promoters, such as Sn, helps to modify the catalytic properties of Pt from both geometric and electronic perspectives. This can simultaneously increase activity and stability.

4. Support modification: Additives to conventional supports like alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support, improving catalyst longevity.

5. Coke migration strategies: Efforts are being made to promote the migration of coke from active metal sites to the support, allowing the catalyst to accommodate more coke before regeneration is necessary.

These strategies aim to address the primary challenge of coke formation, which severely undermines catalytic performance and stability in PDH processes. By developing catalysts that are more resistant to coking or can better manage coke formation, researchers are working to improve the overall efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种比传统裂解工艺更高效和选择性的定向生产方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这在页岩气发现带来大量轻烃的背景下尤其有优势。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 单原子/位点催化剂：这些催化剂通过利用副反应的尺寸依赖性来实现良好的活性和令人印象深刻的稳定性。通过使用单个铂原子或位点，催化剂可以保持丙烷脱氢的高活性，同时最大限度地减少形成焦炭的副反应。

2. 受限金属簇：研究人员开发了限制在沸石结构内的PtSn簇催化剂。这种方法允许精确控制催化位点的大小和位置，从而提高稳定性和抗焦性。

3. 助剂添加：使用助剂（如Sn）有助于从几何和电子角度修改Pt的催化性能。这可以同时提高活性和稳定性。

4. 载体改性：向常规载体（如氧化铝）添加添加剂可以改变酸碱强度，促进金属和载体之间的焦炭转移，从而提高催化剂的寿命。

5. 焦炭迁移策略：正在努力促进焦炭从活性金属位点向载体迁移，使催化剂在再生之前能容纳更多焦炭。

这些策略旨在解决焦炭形成这一主要挑战，焦炭形成严重影响PDH过程中的催化性能和稳定性。通过开发更能抵抗焦炭或更好地管理焦炭形成的催化剂，研究人员正在努力提高PDH催化剂的整体效率、稳定性和可回收性。
