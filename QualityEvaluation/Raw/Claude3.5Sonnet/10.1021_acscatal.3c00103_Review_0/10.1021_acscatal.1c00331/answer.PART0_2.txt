[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "Although the process has been commercialized with high selectivity for decades, the prevention of coke deposition is still a daunting challenge."

[3] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation. Consequently, the cokes are largely diminished as evidenced by the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

[5] "The catalyst with a small ensemble of Pt, such as atomic Pt wire and Pt single atom/site surrounding by inactive elements, seems to be a good candidate, which may be synthesized via alloying and spatial confinement by support."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a more efficient and selective on-purpose production route compared to traditional methods. PDH utilizes the abundance of light alkanes from shale gas discoveries to directly produce propylene.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: These catalysts, such as Pt/Cu single atom alloys, reduce coke formation by lowering the barrier for propene desorption, making it more favorable than deep dehydrogenation.

2. Confined metal clusters: Subnanometer PtSn clusters confined in zeolites show excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions with the support.

3. Small Pt ensembles: Catalysts with atomic Pt wires or single Pt atoms surrounded by inactive elements are promising candidates for reducing coke formation.

4. Support engineering: Modifying supports can facilitate coke transfer between metal and support, improving catalyst durability.

5. Promoter addition: Elements like Sn can tune Pt's catalytic properties, increasing both activity and stability.

These strategies aim to minimize coke deposition, which is the main challenge in maintaining catalyst stability and performance in PDH processes. Improved catalyst designs also focus on enhancing recyclability by lowering regeneration temperatures and preventing metal sintering during regeneration cycles.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)通过提供比传统方法更高效和选择性的定向生产路线来满足工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。PDH利用页岩气发现带来的轻烷烃丰富资源直接生产丙烯。

为了克服失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 单原子/位点催化剂：这些催化剂，如Pt/Cu单原子合金，通过降低丙烯脱附的能垒来减少积碳形成，使其比深度脱氢更有利。

2. 限域金属簇：限域在分子筛中的亚纳米PtSn簇由于与载体的独特相互作用，表现出优异的抗积碳性能。

3. 小型Pt集合体：带有原子Pt线或被惰性元素包围的单Pt原子的催化剂是减少积碳形成的有希望的候选者。

4. 载体工程：改性载体可以促进金属与载体之间的积碳转移，提高催化剂的耐久性。

5. 助剂添加：像Sn这样的元素可以调节Pt的催化性能，同时提高活性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在最小化积碳沉积，这是保持PDH过程中催化剂稳定性和性能的主要挑战。改进的催化剂设计还致力于通过降低再生温度和防止再生循环过程中的金属烧结来提高可回收性。
