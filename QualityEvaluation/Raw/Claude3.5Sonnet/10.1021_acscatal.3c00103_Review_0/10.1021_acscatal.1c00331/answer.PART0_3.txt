[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years. (1) The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity."

[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. (20,21) However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[4] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation. Consequently, the cokes are largely diminished as evidenced by the lifetime of the catalyst."

[5] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a more selective and energy-efficient route for propylene production compared to conventional steam or catalytic cracking methods.

2. As an on-purpose catalytic process, PDH allows for massive propylene production, meeting the dramatically increased demand.

3. PDH utilizes abundant light alkanes from shale gas discoveries, opening new opportunities for propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Single atom/site catalysts: Pt atoms surrounded by inert metals like Cu or Zn reduce coke formation by lowering the barrier for propene desorption.

2. Confined subnanometer clusters: Pt clusters confined in zeolites show excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions with the support.

3. Promoter addition: Metals like Sn are added to Pt catalysts to improve selectivity and stability by modifying geometric and electronic properties.

4. Support modification: Additives to conventional alumina supports can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer between metal and support.

5. Regeneration techniques: Methods are being developed to burn off coke deposits at lower temperatures, reducing energy costs and maintaining catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to address the main challenge of coke deposition, which severely undermines catalytic performance and stability in PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. 与传统的蒸汽或催化裂解方法相比，PDH提供了一种更具选择性和能源效率的丙烯生产路线。

2. 作为一种定向催化工艺，PDH允许大规模生产丙烯，满足急剧增加的需求。

3. PDH利用页岩气发现带来的丰富轻烷烃资源，为丙烯生产开辟了新的机会。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 单原子/单位点催化剂：被惰性金属如Cu或Zn包围的Pt原子通过降低丙烯脱附的能垒来减少积碳形成。

2. 限域亚纳米团簇：限制在沸石中的Pt团簇由于与载体的独特相互作用，表现出优异的抗积碳能力。

3. 助剂添加：向Pt催化剂中添加Sn等金属，通过改变几何和电子性质来提高选择性和稳定性。

4. 载体改性：向传统的氧化铝载体添加添加剂可以改变酸碱强度，促进金属与载体之间的积碳转移。

5. 再生技术：正在开发在较低温度下燃烧积碳沉积物的方法，以减少能源成本并保持催化剂活性。

这些策略旨在解决积碳沉积这一主要挑战，因为积碳严重损害了PDH过程中的催化性能和稳定性。
