Abstract
Advances in fossil fuel exploration have continued to drive availability of lower alkane feedstocks for the chemical industry. Lower alkanes are potential precursors to the plethora of basic organic chemicals. However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry. Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes. This review highlights developments in non-oxidative, autothermal and oxidative dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes. We examine reaction routes to dehydrogenation of lower alkenes, and analyze the CH activation mechanism of commercial catalysts in order to gain insight into rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures.

1. Introduction
Lower alkanes are readily available feedstocks from petroleum and gas resources. They are potential precursors to many value-added chemicals. However, there are very few commercial processes based on direct conversion of light alkanes to valuable chemicals. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons
[1]
. Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents). Chemical processing under these severe conditions typically require large capital investments.
The traditional application of light alkanes is based on the release of stored energy in the CC and CH bonds as heat energy via combustion. This reaction is less demanding in term of product selectivity because it simply entails moving from the extreme reduced state to complete oxidation of the alkanes. However, value-added chemicals obtainable from light alkanes are in-between the permissible oxidation states of a carbon atom (see
Fig. 1
)
[2]
. Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds that contain at least one carbon atom that can be assigned an oxidation number between  4 and + 4

Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have π-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. At present, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the main technologies used for industrial production ethene and propene. With these technologies, ethene production rate is higher than that of propene. However, market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future
[7]
. Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes.
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching (

.
Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O. In principle, ODH is devoid of equilibrium constraints on the yield of alkenes since the co-product (water) can be readily removed from the system
[9]
. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology.
Lower alkenes are monomers for the rapidly expanding polyolefin polymer industries and hence direct alkane-to-alkene processes have continued to attract industrial interest. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation. We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies. We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches.
2. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
Stoichiometrically, non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2, is a simple reaction; however, inherent thermodynamic hurdles and kinetic complications are associated with the elementary steps of the reaction. The reaction is endothermic and, depending on the chain length, removal of two hydrogen atoms from the alkanes requires 113134 kJ/mol. Patented non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation technologies can be categorized according to catalyst type, composition and reactor design, and mode of heat energy input (
Table 1
)
[10]
. The process usually involves repeated cycles of a dehydrogenation reaction and catalyst regeneration. As shown in
Table 1
, commercial catalysts used for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes are based on platinum or chromium oxide. The two catalyst types produce different by-products and require different regeneration treatments. Moreover, factors responsible for irreversible deactivation of each catalyst type differ. In the next section, we provide brief descriptions about the nature of the active sites for the two catalyst types.

2.1. Current industrial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts
2.1.1. Platinum-based catalysts
Platinum is a ubiquitous catalyst for CH activation reactions in petroleum refining. The high CH rupture and low CC scission activity of platinum makes it a selective alkane dehydrogenation catalyst. Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric. Tin atoms/clusters may donate valence electrons to 5d bands of the platinum atoms. There are reported density functional theory (DFT) calculations, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and spectroscopic evidences that support an electronic interaction between platinum and tin. A small amount of tin (15 wt.% of platinum) is sufficient for the electronic interaction, but the geometric effect requires a larger amount of tin
[9]
,
[10]
.
Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors. Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions. Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially. Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst. The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of second hydrogen from platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The dissociative adsorption of the alkane substrate involves two platinum atoms and it is the rate-limiting step. The step is irreversible but the remaining steps are reversible
[11]

[12]

[13]
.
2.1.2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts
Transition metal oxides can activate CH bonds via hydrogen abstraction. Since the pioneer report by Frey and Huppke, supported chromium oxide has stood out as a superior oxide-based catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Industrial chromium oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of chromate salt between 5 and 15 wt.% Cr loadings on high surface support material
[14]
,
[15]
. The impregnated support is dried at (25100 C) followed by calcination in air at 500600 C for 6 h. Alumina is the preferred over silica, but zirconia is also a promising support material due to its high thermal and chemical stability. As with platinum, the acid sites on the alumina are titrated with alkali. The alkali promoter can also influence the nature of the Cr species present on the catalyst surface
[16]
. Activation of the catalyst is usually carried out in situ using an alkane feed. It is generally agreed that the active sites of the catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 + or Cr2 + species
[17]
. These Cr species are responsible for activation of the CH bond of the alkane substrate. The CH cleavage is assisted by surface oxygen species. The alkane dissociates into an alkyl group bonded to the Cr species and a hydrogen atom bonded to surface oxygen species
[18]
,
[19]
. While the role of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 + or Cr2 + species in the dehydrogenation had been established from characterization results, there are few studies on the nature of the surface oxygen species. To improve the catalyst, understanding whether the oxygen species are ligands of the active cations, are from the active cation-support interface, or are from the support is necessary.
In summary, the first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation. Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation. It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic. If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion. This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts. The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity. This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated. Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts. In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts.
2.2. Microporous zeolite-based catalysts
2.2.1. Adsorption of light alkanes
Zeolites are ubiquitous materials in petroleum refining processes, and are used as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular sieves, etc.
[20]
. Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced. Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts. A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes. Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework. In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This agrees with Hashiguchi et al.
[26]
, who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst. Wender et al.
[27]
showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates. Subbotina et al.
[28]
also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms. Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites. Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations. Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate. Sievers et al.
[29]
,
[30]
also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules. The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation). They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations. The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product. Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius.
Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation. This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation. Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework. This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms. Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks.
2.2.2. CH activation on H-ZSM-5
Reactions involving activation of the CH bond in light alkanes are common in the fuel refining and petrochemical industry. Prominent among these reactions are cracking, isomerization, alkylation, and aromatization. In these reactions, the specificity of CH activation is a priority, because the goal is to upgrade the bulk property of the feed. Since zeolite catalysts have a well-defined structure and active sites, an examination of CH activation on zeolite can provide useful insights into the design of efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane.
The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures
[34]
,
[35]
, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures. Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
. However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated. Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism
[42]
.
The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate. The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane. Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated. Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate. Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path. In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide. This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle. For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in
Scheme 1
. Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite. These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene. In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield. The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution. However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites. Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained

Scheme 1. CH activation paths on zeolite.
The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ (
Scheme 1
). The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity). The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes.
2.2.3. CH activation on Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5
Iglesia and co-workers
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
,
[46]
used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5. They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate. Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites. An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking. Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step. A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al.
[47]
, who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism.
The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites. The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn. Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity
[48]
and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI. Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI
[49]
,
[50]
,
[51]
. Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite. Iglesia and Biscardi
[49]
hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage. It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites
[52]
. Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD. However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD. In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5.
2.2.4. Desorption of H-adatom on Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5
The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals. According to Kanansky et al.
[53]
the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different. Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively. The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively. Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups. The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively. The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in

[53]
.
The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen
[54]
. In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen
[55]
compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O. The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage. They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located. They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton. A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations
[56]
.
High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart
[53]
. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate
[57]
. A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (
Scheme 2
) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O. Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process (
Scheme 3
)
[58]
. This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates.

Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Iglesia and Biscardi
[59]
titrate the proton sites with NaOH. The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively. Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5. The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5. The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH. The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5. The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites.
Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate
[60]
,
[61]
,
[62]
,
[63]
,
[64]
, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage. In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst.
2.2.5. Pt-exchanged Na-[Fe]ZSM-5
Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions
[65]
. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Waku et al.
[66]
exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange. There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM. The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia
[67]
demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively. Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs
[67]
.
Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. However, recent reports by Bell et al.
[68]
,
[69]
,
[70]
show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.
2.2.6. Overview of the mechanisms of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes using commercial catalysts
At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al.
[53]
are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms. In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (
Scheme 2
). The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate. Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5. By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The highlights in this section are presented in
Table 2
. The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature. A recent report by Rothenberg et al.
[71]
provides a lead in this respect. Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible. Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material. However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis. Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis. Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

3. Autothermal alkane dehydrogenation strategies
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane is a highly endothermic process that requires a sustained supply of energy to the reactor. Autothermal reaction systems have been explored as a viable strategy for an alternative means of energy input in alkane dehydrogenation reaction. In this section, we examine the use of sacrificial fuel and selective hydrogen combustion in autothermal non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
3.1. Use of sacrificial fuel
Thermal cracking is a well-documented petrochemical process for production of ethene from long chain alkanes. The reaction requires temperatures that are sufficiently high to rupture C-C or CH and generate free radicals. Hence, high temperature dehydrogenation of light alkanes via a free radical mechanism is conceived as a viable route to generating light alkenes. This approach has been demonstrated to give high ethene yields (> 50%) in dehydrogenation of ethane using structured reactors at high space velocity (short contact time reactors, SCTRs)
[72]
,
[73]
,
[74]
,
[75]
,
[76]
. Pt/Al2O3 is a combustion catalyst that at high temperature and in the presence of oxygen catalyzes non-selective oxidation of alkanes to COx
[77]
. The non-platinum oxidation catalysts, BaMnAl11O19 and LaMnO3, display similar ethene yield as a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
[78]
. An alkane feed can double as both reactant and sacrificial fuel for the reaction. Co-feeding a separate sacrificial fuel has also been explored to increase alkene yield. Catalyst design and reactor configuration are targeted at selective and efficient combustion of the sacrificial fuel to supply the heat required to ignite and sustain the gas phase endothermic dehydrogenation. Donsi et al.
[78]
, investigated the effect of adding CO and H2 on the performance of LaMnO3 and Pt-based monoliths on autothermal dehydrogenation of ethane. They showed that Pt gives higher hydrogen oxidation activity than LaMnO3. Similar ethene yields were obtained using the two catalysts when H2 was the sacrificial fuel. When CO was the sacrificial fuel, LaMnO3 displayed higher ethene selectivity than the Pt catalyst. Addition of Sn and Cu enhanced hydrogen oxidation activity of the Pt catalyst, and the resulting promoted Pt catalyst displayed a higher ethene yield than LaMnO
[79]
,
[80]
,
[81]
. However, the promoted Pt catalyst reportedly suffered from a short half-life due to the volatility of the active phase of the catalyst in the reaction condition. Recently, Cimino et al.
[82]
,
[83]
,
[84]
,
[85]
, were able to combine the robustness of LaMnO3 with the selective hydrogen oxidation of Pt to formulate Pt-LaMnO3 as a novel catalyst for ethene production via the catalytic partial oxidation of ethane with short contact time. Using H2 as a sacrificial fuel, ethene yield and selectivity of approximately 65% and 80%, respectively, were obtained with Pt-LaMnO3. This catalyst is also reportedly being used for propene production via CPO of propane
[86]
.
3.2. Selective hydrogen combustion protocol
As shown in
Table 2
, despite the high alkene selectivity rate obtained with Pt-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, the corresponding yield of alkenes is generally low due to an equilibrium constraint. Selective combustion of hydrogen will not only drive the equilibrium forward, it will also offset part of the energy input for the endothermic dehydrogenation. Selective hydrogen combustion and dehydrogenation can be accomplished with a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system.
3.2.1. Single catalyst system
Only Pt-based catalysts have been explored in the single catalyst system, because Pt can double as both a non-oxidative dehydrogenation and a hydrogen combustion catalyst. In addition, promotion of the Pt catalyst with Sn and Zn enhances the alkene yield
[87]
,
[88]
. The oxygen-alkane mixture is fed directly to the reactor. The oxygen content of the feed is less than the stoichiometric amount required to combust the hydrogen by-product of the dehydrogenation of an alkane so as to minimize undesired alkane combustion. In a recent report, Vajda et al.
[89]
, showed that sub-nanometer platinum clusters display high propene yields in an oxygen co-fed propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst showed turn over frequency (TOF) 40100 times higher than those reported for non-oxidative dehydrogenations. This illustrates improved TOF in autothermal dehydrogenation (selective hydrogen combustion) over non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Removal of hydrogen from the catalyst surface via combustion increases the availability frequency of the active sites for the reaction catalytic cycle. The catalyst is produced by soft landing of Pt810 clusters on porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO, Anopore) membranes coated with alumina (Al2O3/AAO) by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The performance of this catalyst can be explained in part by molecular theory of the structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions
[90]
. CH bond activation is categorized as a class II surface sensitivity, and catalytic reaction rate in this category increases with decreasing particle size of the active metal. Waku et al.
[91]
,
[92]
, observed that co-fed oxygen reacts with the alkane feed when the hydrogen by-product is depleted. They adopted a staged oxygen protocol to minimize hydrocarbon loss. Alkene yield obtained by selective hydrogen removal using staged oxygen mode is about 1.6 times higher than without hydrogen removal. Yu et al.
[93]
, exploit the promoting effect of Ce on the propane conversion and the inhibiting effect of Sn on COx formation to achieve a synergistic performance in Pt-Sn/Ce-γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of a small amount of oxygen improved propene yield by 50% at 546 C.
3.2.2. Multi-catalyst system
In a multi-catalyst system, dehydrogenation and combustion of hydrogen take place over different catalysts or active phases. The catalyst bed may be a physical mixture of dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion catalysts or it may involve use of a membrane or fuel cell reactor system
[94]
,
[95]
,
[96]
.
3.2.2.1. Conventional fixed bed reactor system
In the conventional fixed bed reactor system, a solid oxygen carrier (SOC) is physically mixed with the dehydrogenation catalyst. The reactor operation can be concurrent or in repeated cycles of dehydrogenation/combustion of hydrogen until the lattice oxygen of the SOC becomes depleted, followed by re-oxidation of the SOC catalyst. There are two important requirements for the success of this approach: the design of efficient SOC catalysts and compatibility of the SOC with the dehydrogenation catalysts. The key determinants of the suitability of a SOC are that it be inert to hydrocarbons but easily reduced by hydrogen at typical alkane dehydrogenation temperatures, and that it has a slower deactivation rate than the dehydrogenation catalyst.
Conventional solid oxygen carriers (e.g., Y-, or Ca-doped ZrO2) are unsuitable for selected hydrogen combustion because of their low oxygen flux at low temperature. They operate at higher temperatures (8001000 C) than typical alkane dehydrogenation temperature. At high temperature, alkanes are prone to thermal cracking. In order to meet the requirements listed above, supported oxides of p-block metals have been evaluated for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode. The catalysts show excellent selectivity for hydrogen combustion, but they fall short of the stability criteria. The catalysts sinter during reduction because their melting points are below or near the dehydrogenation temperature. In addition to redox property, a melting point above the alkane dehydrogenation temperature thus becomes an important parameter for material selection in the catalyst design
[97]
. Given its unique redox property (physical stability, high oxygen mobility) ceria (CeO2), has become a natural starting material for this application. Although ceria is not selective for hydrogen oxidation, Graaf and co-workers

demonstrated that its reduction behavior can be tuned toward selective hydrogen combustion by metal doping. For example, a Bi-doped ceria is more selective to hydrogen combustion than the undoped ceria (

[102]
.
Other dopants investigated by the group include: Cu, W, Zr, Fe, Sn, Zn. In general, doped ceria is found to be more selective to hydrogen combustion than undoped ceria. Non-ceria materials are also being explored as solid oxygen carriers and selective hydrogen oxidation catalysts
[105]
. Au(35)wt/TiO2 catalysts exhibit acceptable selectively for hydrogen oxidation at 550 C when fed with H2O2 mixture. Selectivity of the catalysts depends on the proportion of hydrogen to oxygen in the reactor; selectivity increases with an increasing hydrogen to oxygen ratio
[106]
. Perovskite oxide, La0.9Sr0.1MnO3, and PbCrO4 display higher catalytic performance for selective hydrogen combustion in simulated propane dehydrogenation feeds than metal-doped ceria catalysts

[108]
.
3.2.2.2. Membrane or fuel cell reactor systems
The membrane or fuel cell reactor arrangement is based on reducing the risk of explosion in autothermal reactor systems. The reactants mixture (oxygen, alkane, alkene and hydrogen) at the typical temperature of dehydrogenation (550 C) constitute an explosion risk. But the likelihood of an explosion is lowered using a membrane or fuel cell reactor, since the alkane feed and oxygen supply to the active phases are deposited on the opposite sides of a membrane (
Fig. 4
).

[109]
.
In addition to the requirements for a solid oxygen carrier listed in
Section 3.2.2.1
, efficiency of the reaction depends on the ratio of ionic (proton or oxide ion) to electronic conductivity of the membrane. Both ionic and electronic conductivity are required for the membrane reactor mode, but only ionic conductivity is required for fuel cell mode where the electronic conductivity is generated by a metallic conductor through an external load to complete the cell circuit (
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
). Although in each case the dehydrogenation reaction equilibrium will be driven forward through removal/combustion of hydrogen, the membrane reactor mode has received more attention, because the hydrogen combustion takes place in the same partition of the reactor as the dehydrogenation. The heat release is thus readily available to offset part of the energy input for the dehydrogenation reaction. Compared to the use of SOC catalysts in fixed bed reactor systems that involve alternate cycles of reduction (hydrogen combustion) and regeneration (re-oxidation)
[110]
,
[111]
,
[112]
,
[113]
, the membrane reactor mode is less tedious to operate. Studies in this area have focused on oxide ion-conducting membrane. The efficiency of this approach depends on the membrane type and geometry
[114]
,
[115]
,
[116]
. The membrane should have sufficiently high oxygen flux at the dehydrogenation temperature and the geometry should afford high surface area. Generally reported membranes explored for dehydrogenation of alkane are perovskite oxides. Apatite-type Ln-silicates, La9.33(SiO4)6O2, are also potential membrane material for dehydrogenation of alkanes

Fig. 6. Fuel cell reactor modes.
In the fuel cell reactor mode, when the membrane is an oxide ion conductor, the reactor is essentially a hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a dehydrogenation catalyst deposited on the anode instead of an oxidation catalyst. SOFC for partial or total oxidation of hydrocarbons is an active area of interest for production of syngas and oxygenates
[118]
,
[119]
,
[120]
. However, few reports exist on dehydrogenation of alkanes in a fuel cell reactor with an oxide ion conductor. Dehydrogenation of propane in a proton conducting fuel cell reactor has been investigated by Feng et al.
[121]
. They carried out a reaction at 700 C using Y-doped BaCeO3 as a solid proton conductor, and a Pt catalyst anode. The high reaction temperature negatively affects propene selectivity because of parallel side cracking reactions (propane, hydrogen). An oxide ion membrane reactor could allow a lower reaction temperature and improve propene selectivity. Alkenes, hydrogen and electrical energy can be obtained from dehydrogenation of alkanes in a proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactor when run without an oxygen feed. This cogeneration mode has been reported for dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene
[122]
,
[123]
,
[124]
. This reaction mode is less appropriate for propane dehydrogenation because propene selectivity is more sensitive to reaction temperature than ethene selectivity. And may account for why there is yet any similar report on propane dehydrogenation in cogeneration mode.
4. Oxidative dehydrogenation
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of a light alkane is an exothermic process. ODH is another reaction route to an alkene from the corresponding alkane. Alkane type and reaction conditions influence the performance of a given ODH catalyst. Catalytic systems that have high ethene yield and acceptable performance have been reported, but the yields of higher alkenes (propene, butene) via ODH of corresponding alkanes (propane, butane) are low. Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry. In contrast to non-ODH, where the CH bond is activated directly by the metal (via oxidative addition and surface oxygen assisted deprotonation), it is generally accepted that ODH is initiated by oxygen species via hydrogen (homolytic CH bond cleavage), proton or hydride (heterolytic CH bond cleavage) abstraction. In this section, we examine propane ODH catalysts and attempt to identify the phase or species that control the performance of the catalysts.
4.1. Groups V and VI transition metal oxides
Groups V and VI transition metal oxides have been explored for use in the ODH of ethane and propane either as bulk catalysts or supported on higher surface area materials. Vanadium has enjoyed more attention than other members of the groups, and VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield. Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s). Propene selectivity of VMgO increase when promoted with alkali ions, but at the cost of a decline in activity. The VMgO systems are usually characterized by several phases (MgV2O6, Mg2V2O7, Mg3V2O8, etc.), and there is no consensus on which of these phases is the most active for ODH
[125]
,
[126]
,
[127]
. V-hydroxylcalcium apatite has been reported to display similar catalytic performance as VMgO systems ( 30% propene yield)
[128]
. Propene yields from supported vanadium catalysts are generally lower than those of VMgO systems. Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with increasing VOx (isolated monovanadates or polyvanadate) surface density until there is monolayer coverage of the support. Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area
[129]
,
[130]
,
[131]
,
[132]
. The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure. Supported molybdenum catalysts follow the same trend as supported vanadium; they are characterized by higher propene selectivity but lower yield than vanadium counterparts due to their lower activity.
4.1.1. Reduction propertiesperformance relationship for group V and VI transition metal oxides
The turnover rates in the ODH of propane correlate with reducibility of ZrO2 supported VOx, MoOx, NbOx and WOx catalysts. ODH rates have also been linked to H2 reduction of the metal oxides
[133]
,
[134]
. However, Khodakov et al.
[135]
, argue that H2 reduction of an oxide does not give sufficient insight into the elementary steps taking place on the catalyst surface. They found that UVvisible absorption edge energy is a more consistent tool for predicting ODH activity of metal oxides, and explained this as the UVvisible absorption edge measures the energy of metal-ligand (oxygen) electrons transfer of the metal oxide. ODH turnover of propane, and propene formation rates increase with a decrease in the electronic transition energies of the supported metal oxides (

VOx is the most promising ODH catalyst among the groups V and VI transition metal oxides (
Fig. 7
,
Fig. 8
). However, there remains the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over the VOx (groups V and VI transition metal oxides). This challenge is summarized in the macro-kinetic reaction network of propane over VOx catalysts (
Fig. 9
).

.
Kinetic data of ODH for propane on ZrO2 supported VOx, MoOx, NbOx and WOx catalysts follow a Marsvan Krevelen model
[136]
,
[137]
. In this model, alkanes react with lattice oxygen of the oxo metal species. This creates oxygen vacancies in the catalyst and the oxygen-deficient oxo metal species are re-oxidized via interaction with adsorbed O2. The adsorbed oxygen molecule can be incorporated into the oxo metal species through sequential reduction processes: O2(g)  O2(ads)  O2-  O22-  O-  O2-   
[138]
. The reaction order of ODH reactions with respect to alkanes is usually one, or unity. This suggests weak surface adsorption of alkane on the catalyst(s), or that the alkane reacts from the gas phase via the EleyRideal mechanism. However, the reaction order with respect to oxygen varies between zero and 0.5, which suggests a continuum of species, from exclusively lattice oxygen atoms to adsorbed oxygen atoms, are involved in the CH activation
[139]
. Using kinetic isotopic studies, Iglesia et al.
[140]
demonstrated that the selective ODH path and direct combustion of propane (k1 and k2) share the same rate-determining step; for both reaction paths, CH activation is the kinetically relevant step.
One suggested explanation for the increase in k3 with increasing propane conversion, is that the allylic CH bond in propene is weaker than the methylene CH bond in propane. Hence, propene has high propensity to undergo further oxidation in the ODH reaction condition
[140]
,
[141]
. However, Zboray et al.
[142]
have shown that the rate of alkene combustion depends strongly on heat of adsorption of alkenes and only slightly on the presence of weak allylic CH bonds. The heats of adsorption of alkenes on acidic sites are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes. Hence the value k3 may be linked to an increasing surface propene/propane ratio increasing propane conversion. Propene adsorbs on the acid sites more readily than propane does, leading to increased surface residence time and susceptibility to attack by surface oxygen species
[139]
. There are two sources of acid sites on a supported VOx catalyst  the V-centre and the support material. Titration of the acid site of support with alkali ions has been shown to increase propene selectivity but at the expense of a decrease in propane conversion due to lower reducibility of the VOx or MoOx domain
[143]
,
[144]
. The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity. Dinse et al.
[145]
argue that increasing the extent of the VOx phase reduction decreases its Lewis acidity, which, in turn, decreases ethene adsorption and combustion. Ovsitser et al.
[146]
also observed that increasing the extent of reduction of VOx phase by propane leads to higher propene selectivity.
4.1.2. VOx phases and oxygen species over supported VOx ODH catalysts
The V in supported VOx phase has one V = O and three VOS or VOV ligand oxygen species (where VOS is the oxygen ligand bridging V and the support; and VOV is the oxygen ligand bridging two V). VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds
[147]
,
[148]
. There was an earlier consensus that the V = O ligand is the lattice oxygen species in VOx ODH catalysts that is responsible for the k1 path in
Fig. 9
[149]
,
[149]
,
[150]
,
[151]
,
[152]
. Hence, proposed mechanisms of ODH of alkanes over supported VOx catalysts assume the VO ligand is a critical part of the catalyst (
Fig. 10
). From
Fig. 10
, ODH can follow the path of reduction of V5 +  V3 + or V5 +  V4 +. Dinse et al.
[153]
used high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance EPR to determine the oxidation states of vanadium species TiO2-, γ-Al2O3-, and SiO2 (SBA-15) on supported VOx catalysts, before and after being used for ODH of propane. They did not detect any V3 + in any of the samples. The V3 + species was therefore considered either short-lived or non-existent during ODH of propane. They found only one kind of V4 + surface site in the SBA-15 support catalyst, but different kinds of V4 + sites are present in the alumina-supported VOx catalyst, while V4 + centers are not detected in the titanium-supported catalyst. Ti3 + and surface-trapped electrons (O2 radicals) are generated by the catalytic reaction of the TiO2-supported catalyst. The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction. After exposure to reaction conditions, carbon-centered radicals are detected in SBA-15, while oxo-radicals are found on alumina-supported catalysts.

.
Kondratenko and Brckner
[155]
investigated the nature of active oxygen species that were formed when the initial lattice oxygen of the catalyst is used up. They used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect formation of a Vn + O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species on the surface of a pre-reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalyst, after contact with gas-phase O2. The oxygen species, identified by spectra simulation, reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO at room temperature. However, no radical species was observed when O2 was replaced with N2O as the oxidant. This is explained by N2O decomposing to N2 followed by rapid formation of nucleophilic O2  oxide ions.
In summary, a large proportion of CH activation on supported VOx catalysts occurs through homolytic CH bond scission following the V5 +  V4 + reduction pathway. As mentioned in
Section 4.1.1
, this lower VOx reduction pathway reportedly leads to poor alkene selectivity. We can rationalize that scission of the dπ bond of VO may yields a diradical species, VO The oxygen radical end cleaves the CH bond, forming an OH bond and an alkyl radical, while the lone electron on the vanadium radical interacts with O2 to form an oxo-radical or non-lattice O2 species. Thus, the poor selectivity of this V5 +  V4 + reduction pathway becomes traceable to the highly reactive radical intermediates (alkyl, oxo-radical and non-lattice O2 species) and less likely due to the Lewis acidity of the V-centre as suggested by Dinse et al.
[151]
.
Although the CH activation over VOx discussed thus far has V = O at its center, there are reports that contest whether V = O is the source of the active oxygen for CH activation and other catalytic reactions of supported MOx catalysts. Muylaert and Voort
[156]
argued that M = O functionality is too stable relative to other surface oxygen ligands to constitute the CH activation site. While this issue is yet to be resolved unequivocally, analyses on factors affecting alkene selectivity in the ODH of alkanes suggest that eliminating the homolytic CH activation mechanism can be a key to designing an optimal catalyst for ODH of alkanes. Identification of the phase or species that can lead to a heterolytic CH activation pathway is a step toward achieving this objective. Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al.

, reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4. Schacht et al.
[158]
, indicate an unprecedented propene selectivity using a VOx catalyst prepared by vanadium doping at the interlayer of MgAl-layered double hydroxides; these authors report that 99.97% propene selectivity is obtained at 21% propane conversion over 26.2% VOx/MgAlO (Mg/Al = 3, calcined at 973 K for 6 h) using a C3H8:O:N2 (17:17:66) feed at 693 K. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalyst revealed V5 + and V3 + oxidations of vanadium before and after the reaction, respectively. The authors noted that performance of the catalyst is closely related to Mg/Al ratio and interlayer integration of vanadium in the catalyst precursor, double layer hydroxide. In contrast to Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 supported VOx catalysts (where the VOx is anchored on the support via covalent bond and the vanadium center was not reduced below V4 +), the VOx in the VOx/MgAlO catalyst is adsorbed on the double layer hydroxide by ionic interaction and this mode affords a deeper extent of reduction of the vanadium center. Similar V5 +/V3 + redox couple was reported by Kenta et al.
[159]
. Isolated VO43  species were identified as the active site in a vanadium catalyst prepared from V(t-BuO)3O loaded with SiO2. The active sites became reduced to the V3 + species and regenerated by molecular oxygen during the ODH of propane. The unprecedented selectivity of the VOx/MgAlO may be attributed to the heterolytic CH activation pathway, the reduction of V5 + to V3 + and the weak surface acidity of the catalyst. Water is a by-product in ODH, and in the presence of water the Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides regenerate and restore the favorable conditions for the V3 +/V5 + redox cycle.
4.2. Ni-based catalyst systems
Non-stoichiometric metal oxides are known to have redox properties that are relevant for catalytic applications. NiOx is a non-stoichiometric oxide, and the Ni-center has various oxidation states. The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes.

shows the performance of some Ni-based catalysts for the ODH of ethane and propane. Entry 37 of
Table 3
shows similar propene yields irrespective of the nature of the promoter of the NiOx. It is also of note that the presence of a promoter (ceria) that has well documented redox properties (oxygen vacancy, oxygen mobility) has no significant impact on the performance of the catalyst. This suggests that the NiOx is the main active phase of the catalyst and the lower propene yield of entry 2 in
Table 3
may be attributable to a lower density of NiOx phase in the catalyst. Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism
[169]
, there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the CH activation step. Since electron-deficient late transition metal cations are electrophilic, direct participation of the Ni-center via electrophilic metalation cannot be ruled out.

NiOLiCl/SZ (entry 1 in
Table 3
) gives higher performance with ethane than with propane. Ethane conversion and selectivity are higher (about 5 and 1.5 times, respectively) than that of propane. The lower selectivity with propane may be attributable to a higher propensity of propene for side reactions on acid sites of the catalyst surface. However, lower propane conversion is, in contrast, expected to follow the reactivity order of the alkanes (propane > ethane) based on the CH bond energies. The reaction conditions are similar for propane and ethane, and the difference in reaction rate may be attributable to reaction compatibility of the CH of the alkanes to the active oxygen species. It is generally accepted that the rate-limiting step of ODH is abstraction of the first hydrogen from the alkane. From the catalysts in
Table 3
, it is difficult to make a direct claim about the nature of the hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in the rate-limiting step.
Considering the tendency of electrophilic metalation in CH activation, the rate-limiting step is most likely proton abstraction. Different oxygen species are on the catalyst surface with varied nucleophilicity. Idriss and Seebauer
[170]
correlate reaction rates over oxidation catalysts that involve hydride transfer with chemical harness (polarizability) of surface ligands. Polarizability of the catalyst oxygen species is a function of surface perturbation. The order of polarizability of surface oxygen species is: O2 < O < O < O22 < O2 < O2. Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen. It appears that some degree of compatibility is present between the CH of ethane and the active oxygen species in NiOLiCl/SZ. Comparison of the performance of NiOLiCl/SZ with other Ni-based catalysts (entries 8, 9 in
Table 3
) for ODH of ethane shows similar ethene selectivity but higher ethane conversion for NiOLiCl/SZ. The superior performance of NiOLiCl/SZ is strongly related to the presence and synergy of LiCl with NiO. Lithium and halide containing catalysts are discussed in the next section, as is the potential of optimizing such catalyst systems toward high propene yield in the ODH of propane. Entries 37 of
Table 3
show similar propene yield, probably because the active oxygen species are produced on the catalysts during the reaction. Differences in propane conversion and propene selectivities may be due to difference in catalyst surface areas and space velocities.
4.3. Lithium and halide-containing catalysts for the ODH of propane
A number of lithium-doped alkaline earth metal oxides have been investigated for use during ODH of lower alkanes. ODH activities of these catalysts are generally low at temperatures below 550 C
[171]
,
[172]
,

,
[174]
,
[175]
,
[176]

,
[179]
. But at higher temperatures, and in the presence of halide compounds as promoters, ODH activity and alkene selectivities of Li-based catalysts increase with increasing temperature. ODH over these catalysts proceeds via heterogeneous-homogeneous or EleyRideal mechanisms. This is in contrast to ODH over vanadium-based catalysts which proceed via the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, in which removal and replenishment of active (lattice) oxygen is a key elementary step. The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical. The CH activation takes place on the surface of the catalyst while subsequent transformation of the alkyl radical to alkene takes place in gas phase. Product selectivity is thus largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry. Leveles et al.
[170]
investigated activation of propane over Li/MgO and found that only a small fraction of the oxygen ions in Li/MgO catalysts can be removed by reduction with H2 at 600 C. Catalytic activity of Li/MgO is strongly correlated with the number of oxygen vacancies created by the reductive thermal treatment. Leveles et al.
[170]
suggested that active sites (oxygen species) are created by Li defects on MgO (as [Li+ O]) and that the active site activates the propane molecule via hydrogen atom abstraction and formation of a propyl radical. The hydrogen atom reacts with surface oxygen species (O) to form a surface hydroxyl radical (OH).
The remaining transformations of the propyl in the gas phase and regeneration of the active site proposed by Leveles et al.
[172]
, are presented in
Table 4
.

Table 5
shows the performance of some ODH catalysts that contain lithium and halides. Catalysts containing a halide ion display higher alkene selectivities than halide-free catalysts (entry 4 of
Table 5
). Alkene selectivity increases with decreasing Lewis acidity of the metal ions (
Table 5
, entries 1, 7b & 7d vs. entries 2, 3, 4, 5, 7a & 7c). Based on the heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism, after activation of alkane on the catalyst surface, propagation steps take place in the gas phase. Product selectivity of ODH of propane on Li/MgO had been analyzed by Leveles et al.
[172]
through gas phase reactions of the propyl radical. They argue that radical chemistry favors high propene selectivity since the allyl radical (C3H5.) is more stable than the propyl radical (C3H7.), and propene is more stable than propane in the gas phase. Hence, unwanted reactions of propene occur mainly on the catalyst surface. Increasing surface Lewis acidity increases the tendency of re-adsorption of alkenes and unwanted reactions on the catalyst. Titration of acid sites in Li/Dy/Mg/O/Cl with potassium (entries 7b & 7d in
Table 5
) decreases the ability of the catalyst to activate propane at the primary carbon atom.

investigated the kinetics and mechanisms for ODH of ethane using the catalysts Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl). The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of Dy2O3Mg/O with LiNO3 and LiCl, leading to Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl), respectively. The reaction rate on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) was an order of magnitude greater than that on Li/Dy/Mg/O. The reaction mechanisms on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) and Li/Dy/Mg/O/are purely heterogeneous and heterogeneous-homogeneous, respectively. During the reaction, LiCl melts and reacts with adsorbed oxygen to form [Li+ OCl]. The proposed sequence of the elementary steps of ethane conversion over Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) are as follows:
The catalytic cycle is similar to the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism; the active site, [OCl] is formed in situ by interaction of a surface chloride ion with dissociatively adsorbed oxygen molecule. After CH activation, the active site transforms to [OH] and HCl. Subsequently, the [OH] is discharged as H2O while the chloride ion re-enters the catalytic cycle. The ethane conversion occurs via simultaneous abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by [OCl.]. The active site is a radical complex of two nucleophilic atoms, each capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate. This type of ODH catalyst system is not restricted to alkali metal halide-doped alkaline earth metal oxides. The halide promotion effect has also been observed in materials with defective oxygen atoms
[180]
and in ODH catalysts based on rare earth oxides promoted with fluoride ions. The catalysts prepared include: CeO2/2CeF3, Sm2O3/4CeF3, Nd2O3/4CeF3 and Y2O3/4CeF3. CeO2/2CeF3 displays the best performance with very high propene selectivity (
Table 6
, entry 1), even without Li doping. The ODH activity of CeO2/2CeF3 is due to the presence of lattice oxygen or the redox property of CeO2, and the high propene selectivity may be attributed to the formation of similar active sites as described for Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl).

impregnated commercial SiO2 with alkali chlorides and created catalysts after calcination at 700 C for 3 h. The resulting catalysts were tested for ODH of ethane. The authors hypothesized that the addition of alkali metal chloride would produce oxygen defects in SiO2. The performances of the catalysts are presented in
Table 6
(entries 2a, 2b & 2c). Ethene yields of the catalysts increase with increasing Lewis acidity of the alkali ion, but the catalysts' stability follows the order: Na > Li > K. In entries 3 and 4 of
Table 6
, a chlorine compound is co-fed with the propane/O2 feed streams. The presence of the chlorine compound reportedly increases propene selectivity in each case. A chloride modified MoO3/SiO2-TiO2 was also reported by Chang et al.
[184]
to improve propene selectivity compared to a chloride-free catalyst. A close look at
Table 5
,
Table 6
show that reaction temperatures are generally higher in the alkali metal halide catalysts due to their higher reduction temperatures. ODH activities of the catalysts are related to presence of dual nucleophilic atoms in the active site. Nucleophilicity of the initial lattice oxygen depends on the dopant cation. The rational choice of the dopant cation can increase the alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Interaction of LiCl with an adsorbed oxygen atom results in a nucleophilic species capable of dual attack on an alkane substrate. Propene selectivity is reported to increase with increasing mobility of the chloride ion in M/Dy/Mg/O/Cl (M = Li, Na, K) catalysts, but this comes at the expense of a lower propene yield due to the increased melting point of the chlorides. CeO2/2CeF3 gives moderate propane conversion rates with high propene selectivity. Doping CeO2/2CeF3 with a cation of high redox potential and of comparable Lewis acid strength with Li should be explored for enhanced propane conversion.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we examined catalysts and reaction routes with potential for dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes. The main approaches to alkane dehydrogenation are: non-oxidative, autothermal and oxidative dehydrogenation. The non-oxidative approach, despite its inherent thermodynamic hurdles and kinetic complications has been developed to industrial-level standards using chromium or platinum-based catalysts with different reactor configurations. CH activation is a key elementary step in alkane-alkene conversion. The platinum-based catalysts activate the CH bond via an oxidative addition mechanism, while CH activation using chromium-based catalysts occur via Lewis base-assisted deprotonation. Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.
The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding. The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls. However, the performances of oxidative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are not yet attractive for industrial operations. Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity. Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts. Thus CH activation on heterogeneous catalysts can be a continuum from an electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, depending on the metal center and the surface oxygen species of ligands. This continuum had been identified for CH activation in homogeneous catalysts
[185]
,
[186]
,
[187]
. CH activation is achieved at relatively milder conditions in these homogeneous catalyst systems. Insights from the homogeneous catalyst systems can provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Also sMMO and pMMO enzymes have been known to activate CH bonds at very mild conditions. Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 have been implicated to contain sites that mimic the active sites of these enzymes
[188]
,
[189]
,
[190]
,
[191]
,
[192]
. The enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide insight into the performance of the CuAl catalyst reported by Rotenberg and co-workers
[71]
. It seems clear that exploring possibilities of creating active site mimics (enzymes and homogeneous catalysts) in solid frameworks is a promising direction toward efficient CH activation and alkane dehydrogenation over heterogeneous catalysts.
