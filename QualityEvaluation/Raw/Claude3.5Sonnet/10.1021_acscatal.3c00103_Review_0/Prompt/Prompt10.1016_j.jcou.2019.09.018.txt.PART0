Abstract
New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta. The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation. The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined. Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

1. Introduction
Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [
1
]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products. Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products. Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time.
Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without simultaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research. One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs. However, this process has disadvantages such as reversibility and endothermalness. An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions. Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products. Some possibility of CO2-PDH integration with syngas or propene required processes are proposed previously [

]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [
10
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
]. In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested. It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [
18
,
27
,
28
]. From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000m2g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [

]. Others tested support, for instance γ-Al2O3, which is commercially used for chromium dispersion in PDH catalyst (CATOFIN Process) or active carbon are less useful. Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [

].
In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
]. We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550C for 15h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13molL1 HNO3 solution at 80C for 4h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95C overnight.
Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis methodwet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103molL1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was contacted with solution containing 3.2·103molL1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. Then, the separation of the solids from the suspensions were done in evaporator under vacuum of a membrane pump for 2h in air at 60C. Finally, all materials were calcined at 550C for 6h. The sample with SiBeta contained 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 7wt % of Cr were labelled as Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta, Cr2.0SiBeta, Cr5.0SiBeta and Cr7.0SiBeta and this with AlBeta, containing 2wt % of Cr was labelled as Cr2.0AlBeta.
2.2. Materials characterization
Textural properties of supports and catalysts were determined from the low-temperature adsorption/desorption isotherms using the Micromeritics (ASAP 2020). Priori to measurements the samples were degassed under vacuum at 350C for 12h. Total pore volume were measured for the value of p/p0=0,98 and the surface area of the samples were calculated from nitrogen isotherm data using BET and Langmuir models. The micropore volume was determined using the t-plot method.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of supports and catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα radiation (λ=154,05pm) in 2θ range of 545.
Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before analysis, the samples were pressed at 1toncm2 into thin wafers of ca. 10mgcm2 and placed inside the IR cell. Then, the wafers were activated by calcination in static conditions at 723K for 3h in O2 (1.6·104Pa) andoutgassed at 573K (103Pa) for 1h. After the wafers were contacted at room temperature with gaseous Py (133Pa). The IR spectra were recorded after desorption at room temperature and 423K for 1h with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer (resolution 2cm1, 128 scans). The reported spectra were obtained after subtraction of the spectrum recorded before Py adsorption.
29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5kHz. Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 4.2μs excitation pulse and a 10s recycle delay.
27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16MHz and 130.33MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively. An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1N solution was used as second reference to determine chemical shifts. 1H MAS NMR was recorded with a 90 pulse duration of 2.9μs and a recycle delay of 5s and 16 accumulations. A small-flip-angle technique with a pulse of 1.2μs (π/8), 0.5s for the recycle delay and 2048 accumulations was used for recorded 27Al MAS NMR.
The total Cr content (CrICP) in the samples was determined using an Optima 2100 DV (Perkin-Elmer, USA) ICP-OES instrument, equipped with axially viewed plasma. In the typical mineralization procedure, a sample (ca. 50mg) was crashed and mixed with 2g of NaNO3 (POCh-Polish Chemical Reagents) and 2g of NaOH (POCh-Polish Chemical Reagents) in a melting pot. Then, the mixture was heated to 600C in air. The mineralization mixture was cooled to RT, dissolved in deionized water and filtered. CrICP was determined in a dissolved solution.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out using microreactor connected on-line with a GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. In NH3-TPD measurements about 0.1g sample (mixed with SiC to constant volume 1,5mL) was preheated under helium (99.999vol %, Linde) with heating rate 10Cmin1 to 550C, kept for 2h, and then cooled to 100C under the same atmosphere. Subsequently, ammonia (99.98vol %, Linde) at flow rate 20mLmin1 for 30min were adsorbed at 100C. The sample was then flashed by helium at a flow rate 30mLmin1 for 2h. The NH3-TPD measurement was conducted by heating the sample from 100C to 800C with the heating rate of 10Cmin1.
In H2-TPR experiments 0.1g of sample dilute with SiC was first preheated in air flow for 30min at 550C and then in dry He (99.999vol. %, Linde,) stream for next 30min. After that the sample was cooled down in the He stream to 100C. The H2-TPR analysis was then performed using mixture of N2/H2 (95/5vol. %, Air Liquide) environment at a total flow rate 30mLmin1 and ramped from 100 to 650C with heating rate of 10Cmin1. The H2 consumption was measured using TCD and NiO (99.999 %, Aldrich) was used as a reference for the calibration of H2 consumption.
Diffuse reflectance UVvis analysis was conducted using an Ocean Optics HR2000+ spectrometer (integration time 50ms, 50 scans) equipped with an DH-2000 BAL halogen-deuterium light source. The spectra were recorded between 225 to 800nm and barium sulfate (99% Sigma-Aldrich) was use as a standard.
During selected catalytic tests carried out at 550C experiments with the oxidation state of chromium species was monitored using UVvis equipment mentioned above (integration time 25ms, 25scans) and a high temperature reflection probe (FCR-7UV400-2-ME-HTX, 7×400μm fibers). The probe was attached at the top of quartz microreactor within the distance of 23mm from catalyst bed.
2.3. Catalyst evaluation
CO2-PDH reaction was carried out in a flow-type quartz reactor. Typically, 0.2g of the catalyst (grain size 0.20.3mm) was preheated in a stream of dry helium (99.999vol. %, Linde) for 30min at 550C before each catalytic measurements, and then the reaction was started at 550C under atmospheric pressure. The feed consisted of a mixture of propane (99.96vol %, Linde) and CO2 (99.996vol %, Linde) diluted with helium. The volumetric ratio of CO2/C3H8/He=5/1/9 was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 30mLmin1. In reference catalytic test without CO2 (non-oxidative dehydrogenation) the volumetric ratio of C3H8/ He=1/14 was used.
The composition of the reactor exhaust was analyzed by gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, Hayesep Q and molecular sieve 5A columns. H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 were separated by Hayesep Q column while CH4 and CO were separated using column with molecular sieve 5A.
Activity normalized per catalyst weight (1), conversion of propane (2) and carbon dioxide (3), yield of propene (4) and selectivity to hydrocarbon products (5) were calculated as:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Support characterization
Initially, AlBeta (Si/Al=17) and SiBeta (Si/Al=1000) were characterized for clarify dealumination effect on structure, texture and acid-base properties. As shown in
Fig. 1
, the crystallinity of Beta zeolite is preserved after dealumination and in the SiBeta support any extra lattice crystalline compounds and long range amorphization do not occur. The increase of 2 theta value of the main diffraction line after dealumination from 22.5 (AlBeta) to 22.7 (SiBeta) indicates contraction of the Beta matrix, in line with earlier investigations (

Moreover, the dealumination leads to small change in porosity and specific surface area. After HNO3 treatment the BET specific surface area (SBET) increases from 642m2 g1 (AlBeta) to 724m2 g1 (SiBeta) while the total pore volume from 0.52cm3g1 (AlBeta) to 0.72cm3 g1 (SiBeta) [
38
]. In contrary to structure and texture changes the dealumination has much significant impact on acidity. The NH3-TPD profiles for AlBeta and SiBeta are compared on
Fig. 2
A. In both cases two maxima at 200C (LT) and 370C (HT) are observed on the NH3-TPD profiles suggesting the presence of two type of acid sites, such as Lewis acid sites related to the presence in zeolite structure of Al3+ ions (maximum at around of 200C) and Bronsted acid sites related to the acidic proton of SiO(H) Al groups (maximum at around of 370C), in agreement with earlier reports [

However, the intensity of these two peaks on SiBeta profile is much lower than on AlBeta profile indicating clearly that dealumination leads to significant reduction of acid sites number.
Presence of both type acidic sites is confirmed by FTIR investigation with pyridine as probe molecule

Fig. 3

The treatment of AlBeta zeolite with HNO3 solution involve of elimination of Al atoms from the framework evidenced by disappearance of IR bands at 3778, 3661 and 3606cm1 related to AlOH groups (
Fig. 3
A), in agreement with our earlier investigation [
[41]
,
[42]
,
[43]
]. The appearance of narrow band at 3735 and shoulder at 3710cm1 related to isolated silanol groups and of a broad band at 3524cm1 due to H-bonded SiOH groups in SiBeta reveals the presence of vacant T-atom sites [
41
,
44
]. As shown in
Table 1
, the number of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites decrease strongly when AlBeta zeolite is dealuminated and only traces of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites are detected in SiBeta.

To determine the nature and strength of acidic centres in AlBeta, Cr2.0AlBeta, SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta zeolite samples, the adsorption of pyridine as probe molecules has been performed.
Fig. 3
B presents the FTIR spectra of AlBeta, Cr2.0AlBeta, SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta after adsorption of pyridine at room temperature and after that desorption by outgassing 1h under vacuum of 103Pa at 150C. The several IR bands at 1637, 1622, 1610, 1546, 1490, and 1450cm1 are observed for AlBeta related to Bronsted acidic centres (the bands at 1637 and 1546cm1), Lewis acidic centres (the bands at 1622, 1610 and 1450cm1), Brnsted and Lewis acidic centres (the band at 1490cm1). The bands typical of pyridinium cations are seen at 1545 and 1637cm1, indicating the presence of Brnsted acidic centres related to the acidic proton of AlO(H)Si groups, in line with earlier data [
45
]. The bans at 1450cm1 correspond to pyridine interacting with strong Lewis acidic centres (Al3+). The band at 1490cm1 corresponds to pyridine interacting with both Brnsted and Lewis acidic centres.
The 27Al MAS NMR of AlBeta zeolite posses 4 resonances (
Fig. 4
). The signals at 54.8 and 52.5ppm associated to aluminum atoms present in two types of the tetrahedral environment of the framework. The signals at 1.7 and 10ppm correspond to aluminum atoms in two types of octahedral environment. The first narrow peak, could be attributed to aluminum atoms in a tetrahedral environment near water molecules and the second a large peak could be attributed to extraframework species. Due to dealumination, the 27Al NMR spectrum of SiBeta zeolite (
Fig. 4
) present only one a small signal at 52.5ppm corresponding to aluminum atoms in the framework of zeolite [

Moreover, dealumination leads also to significant reduction of basic sites number. The CO2-TPD profiles for both materials are reported on
Fig. 2
B. In the case of AlBeta one intensive and a broad maximum ca. 200C (LT) with high temperature (HT) shoulder appeared, confirming presence of weak and medium basic sites which can be assigned to desorption weakly adsorbed CO2 (physisorbed) and decomposition of carbonates like species. In contrast, the amount of CO2 adsorbed on dealuminated support (SiBeta) is much lower than that on parent AlBeta support. Two maxima with very low intensity at about 200 and 350C appear. The quantitative calculation reported in
Table 1
indicates that the total amount of CO2 adsorbed on SiBeta is more than 8 times lower than on AlBeta.
3.2. Catalysts characterization
Using SiBeta support the series of Cr-containing SiBeta catalysts was prepared by wet impregnation. Based on AlBeta support the Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst was prepared as well. Base characterization results of SiBeta series are summarized in

Chemical analysis confirms good reproducibility of Cr incorporation into the Beta zeolite. Both BET and Langmuir specific surface areas as well as total pore volume drops gradually with the total Cr content indicating that chromium deposition on SiBeta leads to porosity and surface area reduction, simultaneously.
The decrease of the 2θ value of the narrow main diffraction line around 2θ of 22.60 after introduction of Cr ions (
Fig. 1
) indicates some expansion of the Beta structure and suggests that the latter are incorporated into lattice sites. The 2θ value of this diffraction line decreases from 22.71 (SiBeta) to 22.64 (Cr0.5SiBeta), 22.61 (Cr1.0SiBeta) and 22.56 (Cr2.0SiBeta) which indicates expansion of the matrix after incorporation of chromium ions into framework of SiBeta support. For higher Cr content, the decreasing of the 2θ value of this diffraction line is not observed (
Fig. 1
), so it suggests that for higher amount than 2 Cr wt % the Cr ions are introduced in the extra-framework position of the zeolite structure.
In contrast, the same 2 theta value of the main diffraction line at 22.55 for AlBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta suggests that upon wet impregnation of AlBeta support with Cr(NO3)3 precursor expansion of zeolite matrix do not occurred. It indicates that Cr ions are introduced in the extra-framework position of Beta structure.
The incorporation of Cr leading to Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta induces a reduction of intensity of the bands of silanol groups, isolated and hydrogen bonded at 3735 and 3524cm1 respectively (
Fig. 3
). Similar change has been observed for incorporation of vanadium and cobalt ions into SiBeta suggesting that silanol groups are consumed in the reaction with chromium nitrate and Cr ions are simultaneously incorporated into framework of Beta zeolite, in agreement with later reports [
41
,
44
]. In addition, introduction of Cr ions in the AlBeta support leads to decreasing of Brnsted acid sites from 235.6μmolg1 for AlBeta to 227.3μmolg1 Cr2.0AlBeta and Lewis acid sites from 134.8μmolg1 for AlBeta to 126.4μmolg1 for Cr2.0AlBeta. For SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta only traces of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites are observed.
The incorporation of chromium in SiBeta and AlBeta causes a decrease in the signal corresponding to the (OSi)3Si(OH) group (102.2ppm), which suggests an interaction between the chromium and the silanols of the zeolite (
Fig. 5
). The effect is much more important on Cr2.0SiBeta than on Cr2.0AlBeta.
In presence of chromium, the signals of bridging hydroxyl protons in AlBeta (4.7ppm) and the signal of H-bonded SiOH groups present at vacant T-atom sites in SiBeta (4.5ppm) are very disturbed (
Fig. 6
). These modifications are due to the paramagnetic properties of chromium, which indicates a proximity between the species.
Furthermore, an oxidation state of chromium species in fresh samples was monitored using UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS).
Fig. 7
A summarizes the spectra recorded in the range of 225800nm that is characteristic for charge transfer (CT) and d-d transition of chromium species. In all cases, in the CT transition region two peaks at 270nm and 360nm are detected. These peaks are assigned to CT of Cr6+-O2 transition in monochromate species attached with support [
52
,

]. In the case of catalysts with 5 or higher wt % of Cr an additional bands with low intensity in d-d region appeared (

Presence of Cr(VI) species in fresh samples is confirmed by H2-TPR experiments (
Fig. 7
B). In all cases a single reduction maximum between 450 to 470C was observed. This maximum is assigned to reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) species [
[54]
,
[55]
,
[56]
]. However, over ordered and unordered silica supports a deeper reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(II) may also occur [

[58]
].
Quantitative results of H2-TPR (
Table 2
) reveal that the hydrogen consumption rises with the Crtotal content indicating systematic rises of redox Cr(VI) species concentration. However, the ratio of H2/Crtotal drops from 1.46 to 0.81 as Cr content rise from 0.5 to 7wt % suggesting that with Crtotal content rises faster contribution of non redox Cr species (mainly Cr2O3 amorphous and crystalline) than redox ones. UVvis DRS results (
Fig. 6
A) confirm that above 2wt % rise the intensity of the d-d transition bands characteristic of Cr(III) species which are non-redox in nature while XRD indicates α-Cr2O3 formation above 5wt % of Cr (

).

It is clear from
Table 3
that CrxSiBeta exhibits high catalytic performance, similar to other well know chromium oxide-based system supported on mesoporous silica supports (SBA-1, SBA-15, MCM-41, MSU-x) or active carbon. In CrxSiBeta series maximum initial yield 27.2 % was obtained on the sample with 7wt % of Cr.
Moreover, it is clear that dealumination significantly improve both activity and selectivity. In the case of Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst, the low selectivity to propylene is due to high concentration of strong acid sites over AlBeta support which prefer cracking of propane. Thus, over Cr2.0AlBeta in product predominates methane, ethane and ethene produced in cracking reaction.
The variation of propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. time-on-stream (TOS) are summarized in
Fig. 8
. Over all materials investigated conversion of propane drops with TOS, slightly for Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite with low Cr content (Cr0.5SiBeta and Cr1.0SiBeta) and much significantly for Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite with higher Cr content (higher than 2 Cr wt %). The selectivity to propene variation has opposite trend than propane conversion. It is also clear that in all cases the deactivation has not monotonic trend. It is faster at the beginning of the process and slow down with TOS.

To clarify deactivation process the catalysts was investigated upon catalytic test by UVvis DRS. During the CO2-PDH process over Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta the spectra were collected in two time period. The first period between 01min and second ones between 1240min on stream. The

Fig. 9. UVvis DRS spectra recorded during CO2-PDH at 550C over Cr2.0SiBeta (A and B) and Cr2.0AlBeta (C and D). Spectra show in region between 01min (A and C) and between 1240min (B and D) in interval 5s. and 10min, respectively.
In both cases, spectra of degassed in helium samples (fresh catalysts before CO2-PDH process) have two main maxima at 270nm and 360nm characteristic for CT transitions of Cr(VI) species. These maxima are reduced rapidly during first minute in contact with CO2-C3H8 mixture (
Fig. 9
A and C). Simultaneously, new broad bands between 650700nm appear indicating reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)/Cr(II) species. The letter species were found to be catalytically active in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [
56
]. Their also involve in the dehydrogenation with CO2 [
10
,
27
,
28
]. Ohisih et al. [
59
] have proposed redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) species in which CO2 acts as a mild oxidant. However, CO2 is very weak oxidant. As we found previously Cr(VI) species reduced with CO selectively to Cr(II) species are very slowly reoxidized by ultrapure CO2 (additionally deoxygenated and dry) [
62
]. This may suggest that in the case of chromium-containing SiBeta catalyst an oxidation role of CO2 cannot be responsible alone for observed promoting effect.
In the second time period (between 1240min on stream) continuous rise of the intensity in whole range was observed that confirms a darkening of the sample due to coke formation. Tracking of the intensity variation at 1000nm indicates that darkening of the catalysts is faster at the beginning of the process and slow down with TOS unlike to propylene yield (inset to
Fig. 9
B and D). This variation of coke formation rate with TOS can be explained based on higher reactivity of propylene than propane. Because coke is produced more easily from propene its high yield leads to faster deactivation. Similar effect was observed in propane dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 [
63
,
64
].

Fig. 10. The variation of propene yield with hydrogen consumption (proportional to number of Cr redox species) for several different chromium oxide based catalysts. Hydrogen consumption was calculated per catalysts weight based on H2-TPR experiments. Sample notations: Crx/SBA-1(imp), Crx/SBA-15, Crx/SiO2-a (silica support from Aldrich) and Crx/SiO2-p (silica support from Polish Chemical Reagents) catalysts obtained by impregnation [
28
]; Crx/SBA-1(syn) catalyst prepared by Cr incorporation during SBA-1 synthesis [
65
]; The values in the brackets indicates total Cr content in the catalysts.
Over different Cr-containing Beta materials the yield of propene rise with the number of redox Cr species which on various silicas depend on their pore structure and specific surface area of method of Cr incorporation/deposition as well as total Cr content. Typically, the yield rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value (monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles. In CrxSiBeta series linear proportion between formation rate and number of redox species is observed up to 2wt % of Cr. After exceeding this content catalytic performance did not correlate further with number of redox sites. In this respect the CrxSiBeta catalysts exhibits quite different behavior than chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-1 or SB-15). In the latter case propane rate was proportional to redox Cr species in wide range (between 0713.6wt % of Cr) while in CrxSiBeta series the yield of propene reminds constant at and above 5wt % of Cr.
Finally, the effect of CO2 on catalytic performance was investigated.
Fig. 11
shows the variation of formation rate of propene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen with TOS in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, respectively. The switching process was carried out over Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta catalysts.

Promoting effect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it. Similar promoting effect was observed over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on different pure siliceous supports, such as non-ordered SiO2 or ordered MCM-41, SBA-15, SBA-1, MSU-x [
5
,
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
14
,
15
,
27
,
28
]. Typically, CO2 addition enhances propene formation in comparison with PDH carried out using dilution with inert gas only [
5
,
27
,
28
]. Over Cr2.0SiBeta, in CO2 presence, rises formation rate of propene and carbon monoxide while at the same time decreases formation rate of hydrogen. It should be pointed hear that addition CO2 never stops formation of hydrogen. Changes of formation rate of propene and hydrogen in cycles with and without CO2 are similar suggesting that positive effect of CO2 on propene production is due mainly due to shifting propane dehydrogenation equilibria via RWGS reaction. A good catalytic performance of Cr-containing catalysts in RWGS reaction was confirmed previously [
13
,
27
]. The equilibria calculations for two-step pathway of CO2-PDH process i.e. for PDH reaction coupling with RWGS reaction and for single PDH confirm that CO2 addition enhances significantly equilibrium conversion of propane [
66
]. Under reaction conditions applied in this work (p=1atm, t=550C and feed with molar ratio C3H8:CO2:Inert=1:5:9 or C3H8:Inert=1:14) the equilibrium conversion of propane rise from 70 % in PDH process to 89 % in CO2-PDH process [
2
].
Taking in count above and considering very weak oxidative abilities of CO2 against reduced Cr species it can be conclude that over chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts propene is produced mainly by PDH pathways facilitated by hydrogen removing in RWGS. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) pathway has small contribution because CO2 reoxidize very slowly reduced Cr species.

It should be pointed hear that the promoting effect observed in the case of Cr2.0SiBeta is similar to those observed on Cr-based catalysts supported on ordered or unordered mesoporous silicas. Over all these catalysts CO2 addition enhance only partially propene formation (1025 %). Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palladium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the effect of CO2 on Cr-based systems is moderate [
3
]. This variation of CO2 effect with catalyst can be explained by different contribution of PODH and PDH pathways. In the case of Pd/Ce-based catalysts a dissociation of CO2 to active O species and CO over ceria-based support facilitated both PODH and RWGS reactions, while over Cr/Silica based (or Si reach supports) catalysts such dissociation is not pronounced thus propene is produced mainly in PDH reaction.
In the contrast, over Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst CO2 exerts negative effect, e.g. the formation rate of propene drops in the process carried out with CO2. In this respect the Cr2.0AlBeta exhibits similar catalytic behavior to CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [
2
,
5
,
11
]. In the latter case the poisoning effect of CO2 was assigned to strong CO2 adsorption on the surface of γ-Al2O3. FTIR investigation with CO2 as a probe molecule have revealed that on the surface of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 carbon dioxide is strongly adsorbed in form of carbonates which may limit dehydrogenation of propane [
2
]. The quantitative CO2-TPD measurements show that amount CO2 adsorption on AlBeta is much higher than over dealuminated form (SiBeta) (
Table 1
). This confirms stronger interaction of CO2 with AlBeta which may explain poisoning effect observed over the Cr2.0AlBeta zeolite catalyst.
4. Conclusions
Catalytic performance of chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts was investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in CO2 assistance. Dealumination with acid nitrate leads to significantly reduction of Si/Al module from 17 to 1000. This has great impact on catalytic performance in CO2-PDH process. A comparative catalytic results indicate that the promoting effect of CO2 propylene formation was observed on Cr2.0SiBeta. On this dealuminated form of Beta zeolite both the yield and selectivity to propene rise in the presence of CO2. In contrasts, on Cr2.0AlBeta zeolite catalyst CO2 exerts negative effect similar to poisoning effect observed over γ-Al2O3 based chromium oxide catalyst. Moreover, in series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation between number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.
