Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by utilizing the growing reserves of propane from shale-gas deposits. This method offers a direct and efficient route to produce propylene, which is crucial for various industrial products.

Traditional PDH processes use catalysts based on chromium or platinum, but these have significant drawbacks. Chromium is highly toxic, while platinum is expensive, limiting the expansion of PDH technology. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs.

One promising strategy is the active site isolation approach. This method aims to create catalysts with isolated active sites, which can enhance selectivity and stability. A notable example is the development of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite.

This new catalyst design, referred to as CoOx@NC/S-1, demonstrates impressive performance in PDH reactions. It achieves a propane conversion rate of 40% with a propene selectivity of 97%. Importantly, it shows excellent stability, maintaining its performance even after 10 hours of reaction at 600°C.

The synthesis of this catalyst involves a two-step process: pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1, followed by calcination in air. This method effectively creates isolated cobalt oxide sites, which are key to the catalyst's performance.

By confining isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials, researchers have found a way to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis. This approach addresses the deactivation issues that often plague PDH catalysts, improving their longevity and recyclability.

These advancements in catalyst design for PDH processes represent significant progress in addressing the growing demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods. They offer improved stability, enhanced selectivity, and potentially more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to current industrial catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过利用页岩气中不断增加的丙烷储量来应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战。这种方法为生产丙烯提供了一种直接有效的途径，而丙烯对于各种工业产品至关重要。

传统的PDH工艺使用基于铬或铂的催化剂，但这些催化剂存在显著缺点。铬具有高度毒性，而铂价格昂贵，限制了PDH技术的扩展。为了克服这些问题，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计。

一种有前景的策略是活性位点隔离方法。这种方法旨在创造具有隔离活性位点的催化剂，可以提高选择性和稳定性。一个显著的例子是在氮掺杂碳层中开发空间隔离的钴氧化物位点，这些位点支撑在硅铝石沸石上。

这种新的催化剂设计，称为CoOx@NC/S-1，在PDH反应中表现出令人印象深刻的性能。它实现了40%的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性为97%。重要的是，它表现出优异的稳定性，即使在600°C下反应10小时后仍能保持其性能。

这种催化剂的合成涉及一个两步过程：在硅铝石上负载的双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑骨架材料的热解，随后在空气中进行煅烧。这种方法有效地创造了隔离的钴氧化物位点，这是催化剂性能的关键。

通过将隔离的金属位点限制在N掺杂碳材料中，研究人员找到了一种增强异相催化中金属物种稳定性的方法。这种方法解决了经常困扰PDH催化剂的失活问题，提高了它们的寿命和可循环性。

这些PDH过程催化剂设计的进展代表了在应对不断增长的丙烯需求的同时克服传统生产方法局限性的重大进步。它们提供了改进的稳定性、增强的选择性，以及潜在的更具成本效益和环境友好的替代方案，可以取代当前的工业催化剂。
