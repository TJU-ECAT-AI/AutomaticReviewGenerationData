Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a direct and efficient route to convert propane into propene. PDH capitalizes on the growing availability of propane from shale gas reserves, providing a sustainable feedstock for propylene production.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. One key approach is the active site isolation strategy, which has proven effective in enhancing catalytic performance. Researchers are moving away from traditional catalysts like Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, which have limitations due to toxicity and high cost, respectively.

A promising new catalyst design involves spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst is synthesized through a two-step process involving pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks and subsequent calcination. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 40% propane conversion with over 97% propene selectivity. Importantly, it shows no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600°C, indicating improved stability and potential for better recyclability compared to traditional catalysts.

This innovative approach to catalyst design addresses the key challenges in PDH processes by utilizing more abundant and less toxic materials, enhancing catalytic performance, and significantly improving stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种将丙烷直接高效转化为丙烯的途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的挑战。PDH利用页岩气储量中丙烷的日益增加，为丙烯生产提供了可持续的原料。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。一个关键方法是活性位点隔离策略，这已被证明可以有效提高催化性能。研究人员正在摒弃传统的Cr/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，这些催化剂由于毒性和高成本而存在局限性。

一种有前景的新型催化剂设计涉及在硅铝石沸石（S-1）支撑的氮掺杂碳层中的空间隔离的氧化钴位点（CoOx@NC/S-1）。这种催化剂通过两步法合成，包括双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑框架的热解和随后的煅烧。所得催化剂表现出卓越的性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和97%以上的丙烯选择性。重要的是，在600°C下进行10小时的PDH反应后，它没有显示出明显的失活，表明与传统催化剂相比，稳定性得到了提高，并且具有更好的可回收性潜力。

这种创新的催化剂设计方法通过利用更丰富和毒性较低的材料，提高催化性能，并显著改善催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和寿命，解决了PDH过程中的关键挑战。
