Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a direct and efficient route to convert propane into propene. PDH has gained attention due to the growing demand for propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas deposits.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. One such strategy is the active site isolation approach, which has proven effective in enhancing catalytic performance in PDH. 

A notable example of this strategy is the development of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst is synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks and subsequent calcination in air.

This novel catalyst design demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, achieving a propane conversion of 40% with propene selectivity exceeding 97%. Importantly, the catalyst shows no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600°C, indicating improved stability and potential for recyclability.

These advancements in catalyst design aim to address the limitations of traditional catalysts used in commercial PDH processes, such as the toxicity of Cr-based catalysts and the high cost of Pt-based catalysts. By developing more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts, researchers are working to overcome the challenges in PDH processes and meet the growing industrial demand for propylene.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供直接高效的方式将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。由于对丙烯的需求不断增长以及页岩气开采带来的丙烷储量增加，PDH技术受到了广泛关注。

为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善PDH过程中的可回收性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。其中一种策略是活性位点隔离方法，这种方法已被证明能有效提高PDH的催化性能。

这种策略的一个显著例子是在硅铝酸盐-1分子筛上开发的氮掺杂碳层包裹的空间隔离钴氧化物位点(CoOx@NC/S-1)。这种催化剂通过两步法合成，包括双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑框架的热解和随后在空气中的煅烧。

这种新型催化剂设计在PDH反应中表现出优异的催化性能，丙烷转化率达40%，丙烯选择性超过97%。重要的是，该催化剂在600°C下进行10小时PDH反应后没有明显的失活，表明其稳定性得到提高，具有良好的循环使用潜力。

这些催化剂设计的进展旨在解决商业PDH过程中传统催化剂的局限性，如基于Cr的催化剂的毒性和基于Pt的催化剂的高成本。通过开发更高效、更稳定和更具成本效益的催化剂，研究人员正在努力克服PDH过程中的挑战，以满足不断增长的工业丙烯需求。
