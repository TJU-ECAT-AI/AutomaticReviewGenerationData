Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene from propane. PDH is gaining attention due to the growing demand for propylene and increased availability of propane from shale gas deposits.

Traditional PDH processes use catalysts based on chromium or platinum, but these have drawbacks such as toxicity and high cost. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs. One promising strategy is the active site isolation approach, which aims to create catalysts with isolated, highly selective active sites.

A notable example of this innovative catalyst design is the development of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst is synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks and subsequent calcination.

The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst demonstrates excellent performance in PDH, achieving 40% propane conversion with 97% propene selectivity. Importantly, it shows high stability, with no significant decrease in propane conversion after 10 hours of reaction at 600°C. This addresses the critical issues of catalyst deactivation and stability in PDH processes.

While the literature does not specifically mention recyclability or oxidative PDH processes, the focus on developing stable, highly selective catalysts represents a significant step towards more efficient and sustainable PDH technologies. These advancements aim to meet the increasing industrial demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种更直接和高效的方法从丙烷生产丙烯来解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。由于丙烯需求的增长和页岩气中丙烷储量的增加，PDH正受到越来越多的关注。

传统的PDH工艺使用基于铬或铂的催化剂，但这些催化剂存在毒性和高成本等缺点。为了克服这些问题，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计。一种有前景的策略是活性位点隔离方法，旨在创造具有隔离的、高度选择性活性位点的催化剂。

这种创新催化剂设计的一个显著例子是在氮掺杂碳层中开发空间隔离的钴氧化物位点，这些位点支持在硅铝酸盐-1沸石上（CoOx@NC/S-1）。这种催化剂是通过两步法合成的，包括双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑骨架的热解和随后的煅烧。

CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和97%的丙烯选择性。重要的是，它显示出高稳定性，在600°C反应10小时后，丙烷转化率没有显著降低。这解决了PDH过程中催化剂失活和稳定性的关键问题。

虽然文献没有具体提到可回收性或氧化PDH过程，但专注于开发稳定、高选择性的催化剂代表着朝着更高效和可持续的PDH技术迈出了重要一步。这些进展旨在满足工业对丙烯日益增长的需求，同时克服传统生产方法的局限性。
