          [1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

[2] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

[5] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed"

[6] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis"

[7] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

[8] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a direct and efficient route to convert propane into propene. PDH capitalizes on the growing availability of propane from shale gas reserves, providing a sustainable feedstock for propylene production.

Traditional PDH processes use catalysts based on chromium (Cr/Al2O3) or platinum (PtSn/Al2O3), but these have significant drawbacks such as toxicity and high cost, limiting the expansion of PDH technology. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst designs.

One key approach is the active site isolation strategy, which has proven effective in enhancing catalytic performance. A promising new catalyst design involves spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst is synthesized through a two-step process involving pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks and subsequent calcination.

The resulting CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 40% propane conversion with over 97% propene selectivity. Importantly, it shows no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600°C, indicating improved stability and potential for better recyclability compared to traditional catalysts.

This innovative approach to catalyst design addresses key challenges in PDH processes by:
1. Utilizing more abundant and less toxic materials
2. Enhancing catalytic performance
3. Significantly improving stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions
4. Potentially offering better recyclability

By confining isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials, researchers have found a way to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis, addressing the deactivation issues that often plague PDH catalysts and improving their longevity and recyclability.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种将丙烷直接高效转化为丙烯的途径，解决了工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的挑战。PDH利用页岩气储量中丙烷的日益增加，为丙烯生产提供了可持续的原料。

传统的PDH工艺使用基于铬（Cr/Al2O3）或铂（PtSn/Al2O3）的催化剂，但这些催化剂存在显著缺点，如毒性和高成本，限制了PDH技术的扩展。为了克服这些问题，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计。

一个关键方法是活性位点隔离策略，这已被证明可以有效提高催化性能。一种有前景的新型催化剂设计涉及在硅铝石沸石（S-1）支撑的氮掺杂碳层中的空间隔离的氧化钴位点（CoOx@NC/S-1）。这种催化剂通过两步法合成，包括双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑框架的热解和随后的煅烧。

所得CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂表现出卓越的性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和97%以上的丙烯选择性。重要的是，在600°C下进行10小时的PDH反应后，它没有显示出明显的失活，表明与传统催化剂相比，稳定性得到了提高，并且具有更好的可回收性潜力。

这种创新的催化剂设计方法通过以下方式解决了PDH过程中的关键挑战：
1. 利用更丰富和毒性较低的材料
2. 提高催化性能
3. 显著改善催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和寿命
4. 潜在地提供更好的可回收性

通过将隔离的金属位点限制在N掺杂碳材料中，研究人员找到了一种增强异相催化中金属物种稳定性的方法，解决了经常困扰PDH催化剂的失活问题，提高了它们的寿命和可循环性。
