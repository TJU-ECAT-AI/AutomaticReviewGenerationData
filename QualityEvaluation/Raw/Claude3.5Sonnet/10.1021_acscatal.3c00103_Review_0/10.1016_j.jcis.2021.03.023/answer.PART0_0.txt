Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method that utilizes the growing reserves of propane from shale-gas deposits. This approach helps meet the rising demand for propene, which is crucial for producing various products like propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

Traditional PDH processes, such as the Catofin process using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, face limitations due to the toxicity of chromium and the high cost of platinum. These issues have spurred the development of innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes.

One promising approach is the active site isolation strategy, which has proven effective in addressing these challenges. This strategy involves developing various methods to isolate active sites, preventing unwanted side reactions and improving catalyst performance.

A notable innovation in catalyst design is the confinement of isolated metal sites in nitrogen-doped carbon materials. This approach has been widely used to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis, addressing the issue of catalyst deactivation.

The research presented in the literature showcases a novel catalyst design: spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst is synthesized through a two-step process involving the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks and subsequent calcination.

The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst demonstrates impressive performance in PDH, achieving a propane conversion of 40% with a propene selectivity of 97%. Importantly, it shows excellent stability, with no significant decrease in propane conversion after a 10-hour PDH reaction at 600°C. This high performance and stability represent a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of catalyst deactivation and improving recyclability in PDH processes.

These innovations in catalyst design, particularly the use of earth-abundant elements like cobalt and the strategy of site isolation, offer promising solutions to the limitations of traditional PDH methods. They pave the way for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly propylene production to meet growing industrial demands.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过利用页岩气储量中不断增长的丙烷资源，为丙烯的生产提供了一种替代方法，从而解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求挑战。这种方法有助于满足对丙烯不断增长的需求，而丙烯对于生产各种产品如环氧丙烷、聚丙烯和丙烯腈至关重要。

传统的PDH工艺，如使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺，由于铬的毒性和铂的高成本而面临限制。这些问题促使了创新催化剂设计策略的发展，以克服PDH工艺中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性。

一种有前景的方法是活性位点隔离策略，这种策略在解决这些挑战方面已被证明是有效的。该策略涉及开发各种方法来隔离活性位点，防止不需要的副反应，提高催化剂性能。

催化剂设计的一个显著创新是将孤立的金属位点限制在氮掺杂的碳材料中。这种方法已被广泛用于增强异相催化中金属物种的稳定性，解决了催化剂失活的问题。

文献中介绍的研究展示了一种新型催化剂设计：在硅铝酸盐-1沸石（CoOx@NC/S-1）上支撑的氮掺杂碳层内的空间隔离的氧化钴位点。这种催化剂是通过一个两步过程合成的，包括双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑框架的热解和随后的煅烧。

CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂在PDH中表现出令人印象深刻的性能，丙烷转化率达到40%，丙烯选择性达到97%。重要的是，它显示出优秀的稳定性，在600°C下进行10小时的PDH反应后，丙烷转化率没有显著下降。这种高性能和稳定性代表了在解决PDH过程中催化剂失活问题和提高可回收性方面的重大进展。

这些催化剂设计的创新，特别是使用地球上丰富的元素如钴和位点隔离策略，为传统PDH方法的局限性提供了有前景的解决方案。它们为更高效、更具成本效益和更环保的丙烯生产铺平了道路，以满足不断增长的工业需求。
