[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[5] "All dehydrogenation catalysts deactivate with time-on-stream, several processes being responsible for the deactivation of the different types of catalysts discussed in this Review. However, there has been a clear consensus in the literature since the mid-1970s identifying coke deposition as the main cause of deactivation."

[6] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a more selective and efficient route to produce propylene compared to traditional cracking processes, which have low selectivity and high energy demands.

2. PDH takes advantage of the abundant and low-cost propane feedstock from shale gas, making it economically favorable in current market conditions.

3. PDH is an on-purpose technique that can produce polymer-grade propylene, addressing the supply gap created by the shift to ethane cracking.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Catalyst design improvements aim to lower noble metal loading, increase stability, and enhance energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

2. Research is ongoing to develop alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), that can potentially replace PtSn and CrOx systems.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation is being explored to overcome thermodynamic limitations and achieve full paraffin conversion.

4. Solid oxygen carriers are being investigated as a means to selectively oxidize hydrogen and shift the equilibrium.

5. Membrane reactor systems are being developed to remove hydrogen and drive the reaction towards higher olefin yields.

6. Advanced operando spectroscopy techniques are being implemented to monitor catalyst deactivation and optimize regeneration processes in industrial settings.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and overcome the limitations of both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.
