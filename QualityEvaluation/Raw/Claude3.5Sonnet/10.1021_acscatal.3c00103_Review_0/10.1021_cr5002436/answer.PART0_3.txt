Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

<quotes>

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[5] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[6] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides an alternative, more economical feedstock and efficient conversion technology compared to traditional high-energy, low-selectivity processes like steam cracking.

2. PDH takes advantage of favorable market conditions, as its profitability is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene.

3. PDH offers higher selectivity towards specific olefins compared to traditional methods.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Improving catalyst formulations to lower noble metal loading and increase stability.

2. Developing more effective regeneration processes to combat coke-induced deactivation.

3. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation to overcome thermodynamic limitations and achieve full paraffin conversion.

4. Investigating the use of solid oxygen carriers for selective hydrogen combustion.

5. Implementing advanced monitoring techniques like operando spectroscopy for better process control and catalyst lifetime management.

These strategies aim to improve the overall efficiency, stability, and recyclability of PDH catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过以下几种方式解决了丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战：

1. 与传统的高能耗、低选择性过程(如蒸汽裂解)相比，PDH提供了更经济的原料和高效的转化技术。

2. PDH利用了有利的市场条件，因为其盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异。

3. 与传统方法相比，PDH对特定烯烃的选择性更高。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 改进催化剂配方以降低贵金属负载量并提高稳定性。

2. 开发更有效的再生过程以应对焦炭沉积导致的失活。

3. 探索氧化脱氢以克服热力学限制并实现全烷烃转化。

4. 研究使用固体氧载体进行选择性氢燃烧。

5. 实施先进的监测技术，如原位光谱法，以实现更好的过程控制和催化剂寿命管理。

这些策略旨在提高氧化和非氧化PDH过程中催化剂的整体效率、稳定性和可循环性。
