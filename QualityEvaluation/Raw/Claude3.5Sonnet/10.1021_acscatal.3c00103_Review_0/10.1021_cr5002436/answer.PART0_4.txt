[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[6] "All dehydrogenation catalysts deactivate with time-on-stream, several processes being responsible for the deactivation of the different types of catalysts discussed in this Review. However, there has been a clear consensus in the literature since the mid-1970s identifying coke deposition as the main cause of deactivation."

[7] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[8] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved. O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a more economical and efficient alternative to high-energy, low-selectivity traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. It takes advantage of the abundance and low cost of propane from shale gas, making it a profitable option in current market conditions.

3. PDH is an on-purpose technique that produces propylene exclusively, unlike traditional methods that yield a mixture of products.

4. The industry is rapidly expanding PDH capacity, with many new installations announced worldwide to meet growing propylene demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Using supports with little to no Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.

2. Modifying reaction conditions by cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 to control coke deposition.

3. Developing oxidative dehydrogenation processes using O2 or CO2 as oxidizing agents to achieve full paraffin conversion and reduce or eliminate coke formation.

4. Exploring alternative catalysts and promoters to improve activity, selectivity, and stability.

5. Implementing advanced regeneration techniques and process control methods to maintain catalyst performance over time.

These strategies aim to address the main challenge of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, improve catalyst stability and recyclability, and enhance the overall efficiency of PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH为高能耗、低选择性的传统工艺（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化）提供了更经济、更高效的替代方案。

2. 它利用了页岩气中丰富且低成本的丙烷资源，使其在当前市场条件下成为一个有利可图的选择。

3. PDH是一种定向技术，专门生产丙烯，不同于传统方法产生的混合产品。

4. 该行业正在迅速扩大PDH产能，全球已宣布多个新装置，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH工艺的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 使用几乎没有或完全没有布朗斯特酸性的载体，或毒化酸性位点以减少积碳形成。

2. 通过共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2来改变反应条件，控制积碳沉积。

3. 开发使用O2或CO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢工艺，以实现烷烃的完全转化并减少或消除积碳形成。

4. 探索替代催化剂和助剂，以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。

5. 实施先进的再生技术和过程控制方法，以维持催化剂的长期性能。

这些策略旨在解决由积碳沉积导致的催化剂失活这一主要挑战，提高催化剂的稳定性和可循环使用性，并提高PDH工艺的整体效率。
