Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, especially given the abundance of propane resources from shale gas exploitation.

Both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes have been developed. The oxidative PDH approach offers favorable thermodynamic conditions but suffers from poor propane utilization and low propylene yield due to the complex reaction atmosphere. In contrast, the nonoxidative PDH technique, with its simpler reaction components, has already been implemented in industrial production.

However, PDH processes face challenges related to catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke accumulation and sintering of active compounds at high temperatures. To overcome these issues and enhance catalyst stability and recyclability, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies focus on three main areas:

1. Promoter introduction
2. Metal-support interaction enhancement
3. Support modification

These design strategies are often interconnected and can have varying effects on catalytic performance depending on the specific catalytic system. Researchers are working to understand how these strategies function in complex catalytic systems to develop more stable and efficient PDH catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种新颖且有前景的丙烯生产路线来应对丙烯工业需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战，特别是考虑到页岩气开采带来的丙烷资源丰富。

氧化和非氧化PDH过程都已经开发出来。氧化PDH方法提供了有利的热力学条件，但由于反应环境复杂，导致丙烷利用率低和丙烯产率低。相比之下，反应组分更简单的非氧化PDH技术已经在工业生产中得到应用。

然而，PDH过程面临着催化剂失活的挑战，主要是由于高温下焦炭积累和活性化合物烧结。为了克服这些问题并提高催化剂的稳定性和可回收性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略主要集中在三个方面：

1. 引入助剂
2. 增强金属-载体相互作用
3. 载体改性

这些设计策略通常是相互关联的，并且可能对不同的催化系统产生不同的催化性能影响。研究人员正在努力理解这些策略在复杂催化系统中的作用机制，以开发更稳定、更高效的PDH催化剂。
