Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, especially in the context of abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation.

Both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes have been developed. The oxidative PDH approach offers favorable thermodynamic conditions but suffers from poor propane utilization and low propylene yield due to the complex reaction atmosphere. In contrast, the nonoxidative PDH technique, with its simpler reaction components, has already been implemented in industrial production.

However, PDH catalysts often face rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability due to coke accumulation and sintering of active compounds at high temperatures. To overcome these issues and enhance stability and recyclability, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies focus on three main areas:

1. Promoter introduction
2. Metal-support interaction enhancement
3. Support modification

These design strategies are often interconnected and may have varying effects on catalytic performance depending on the specific catalytic system. Researchers are working to understand how these strategies function in complex catalytic systems to improve overall performance and stability in PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种新颖且有前景的路线来生产丙烯，特别是在页岩气开采带来丰富丙烷资源的背景下，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。

研究人员开发了氧化和非氧化PDH工艺。氧化PDH方法提供了有利的热力学条件，但由于反应环境复杂，导致丙烷利用率低和丙烯产率低。相比之下，反应组分更简单的非氧化PDH技术已经在工业生产中得到应用。

然而，PDH催化剂通常面临着由于高温下焦炭积累和活性组分烧结而导致的快速失活和再生能力差的问题。为了克服这些问题并提高稳定性和可循环性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略主要集中在三个方面：

1. 引入助剂
2. 增强金属-载体相互作用
3. 载体改性

这些设计策略通常是相互关联的，并且可能对不同催化系统的催化性能产生不同的影响。研究人员正在努力了解这些策略在复杂催化系统中的作用机制，以提高PDH过程的整体性能和稳定性。
