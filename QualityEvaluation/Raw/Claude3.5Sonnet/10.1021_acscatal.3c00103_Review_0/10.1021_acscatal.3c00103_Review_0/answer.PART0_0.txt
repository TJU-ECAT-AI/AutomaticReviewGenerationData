Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, especially in the context of abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation.

There are two main PDH approaches: oxidative (OPDH) and nonoxidative (PDH). While OPDH has favorable thermodynamic conditions, it suffers from poor propane utilization and low propylene yield due to the complex reaction atmosphere. In contrast, nonoxidative PDH has simpler reaction components and has already been implemented in industrial production.

However, PDH catalysts often face rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability due to coke accumulation and sintering of active compounds at high temperatures. To overcome these issues and enhance stability and recyclability, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies focus on three main areas:

1. Promoter introduction
2. Metal-support interaction enhancement
3. Support modification

These design strategies are often intertwined and may have varying effects on catalytic performance depending on the specific catalytic system. Researchers are working to understand how these strategies function in complex catalytic systems to improve overall performance and address the deactivation issues in PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种新颖且有前景的途径来生产丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯需求不断增加以及传统生产方法局限性的挑战，特别是在页岩气开采带来丰富丙烷资源的背景下。

PDH技术主要有两种方法：氧化脱氢（OPDH）和非氧化脱氢（PDH）。尽管OPDH具有有利的热力学条件，但由于反应环境复杂，导致丙烷利用率低和丙烯产率低。相比之下，非氧化PDH具有更简单的反应组分，并且已经在工业生产中得到应用。

然而，PDH催化剂常常面临快速失活和再生能力差的问题，这主要是由于在高温下发生积碳和活性化合物烧结。为了克服这些问题并提高稳定性和可循环性，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略主要集中在三个方面：

1. 引入助剂
2. 增强金属-载体相互作用
3. 改性载体

这些设计策略通常是相互交织的，并且可能对不同催化系统的催化性能产生不同的影响。研究人员正在努力理解这些策略在复杂催化系统中的作用机制，以改善整体性能并解决PDH过程中的失活问题。
