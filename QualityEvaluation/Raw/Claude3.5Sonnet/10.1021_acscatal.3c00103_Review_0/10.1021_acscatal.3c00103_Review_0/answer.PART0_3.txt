Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods by offering a novel and promising route to produce propylene, especially with the availability of abundant propane resources from shale gas exploitation.

Both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes have been developed. While oxidative PDH (OPDH) offers favorable thermodynamic conditions, it suffers from poor propane utilization and low propylene yield due to the complex reaction atmosphere. In contrast, nonoxidative PDH has already been implemented in industrial production due to its simpler reaction components.

However, PDH catalysts often face rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability due to coke accumulation and sintering of active compounds at high temperatures. To overcome these issues and enhance stability and recyclability, researchers are developing various innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies focus on three main areas:

1. Promoter introduction
2. Metal-support interaction enhancement
3. Support modification

These design strategies are often interconnected and their effects on catalytic performance can vary depending on the specific catalytic system. Researchers are working to unravel these complex relationships to better understand how these strategies function and to develop more stable and efficient PDH catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种新型且有前景的丙烯生产路线来解决日益增长的工业丙烯需求和传统生产方法的局限性，特别是在页岩气开采带来丰富丙烷资源的背景下。

氧化和非氧化PDH过程都已经开发。虽然氧化PDH（OPDH）提供了有利的热力学条件，但由于反应环境复杂，导致丙烷利用率低和丙烯产率低。相比之下，由于反应组分更简单，非氧化PDH已经在工业生产中得到应用。

然而，PDH催化剂常常面临快速失活和再生能力差的问题，这是由于在高温下发生积碳和活性化合物烧结。为了克服这些问题并提高稳定性和可循环性，研究人员正在开发各种创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略主要集中在三个方面：

1. 引入助剂
2. 增强金属-载体相互作用
3. 载体改性

这些设计策略通常是相互关联的，它们对催化性能的影响可能因具体的催化系统而异。研究人员正在努力解开这些复杂的关系，以更好地理解这些策略如何发挥作用，并开发出更稳定、更高效的PDH催化剂。
