Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising alternative for propylene production, driven by the increasing industrial demand and shifting global energy landscapes. This process has gained significant attention due to its potential to address the growing propylene supply gap, particularly in regions with abundant shale gas resources. However, one of the primary challenges facing PDH technology is catalyst deactivation, which can significantly impact process efficiency and economic viability. To overcome this hurdle, researchers and industry professionals have been focusing on innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at enhancing stability and recyclability. These efforts include developing novel support materials, optimizing metal dispersion, and incorporating promoters to mitigate coking and sintering. Additionally, advanced regeneration techniques and process modifications are being explored to extend catalyst lifetime and improve overall performance. As the PDH process continues to evolve, these advancements in catalyst technology are expected to play a crucial role in establishing it as a sustainable and competitive route for propylene production, capable of meeting the growing demands of various industries while adapting to the changing energy landscape.
