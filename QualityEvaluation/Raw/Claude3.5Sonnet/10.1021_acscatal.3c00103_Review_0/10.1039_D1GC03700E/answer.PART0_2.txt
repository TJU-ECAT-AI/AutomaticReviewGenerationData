[1] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."

[4] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2. Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."

[5] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. Direct dehydrogenation (DDH) offers an environmentally preferable alternative to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, with lower energy consumption.

2. DDH using Pt or Cr-based catalysts provides high space-time yields, though coking remains an issue requiring reactor cycling for regeneration.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH-O2) avoids coking but faces challenges with overoxidation. Recent development of boron-based catalysts shows promise in addressing this.

4. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH-CO2) offers environmental benefits but currently suffers from low propene yields compared to DDH and ODH-O2.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed include:

1. For DDH and ODH-O2: Focus on improving selectivity to propene to enhance stability and reduce deactivation.

2. For ODH-CO2: Emphasis on increasing intrinsic activity with respect to CO2 activation.

3. Exploring new catalyst materials like boron-based catalysts for ODH-O2 to overcome limitations of traditional metal oxide catalysts.

4. Developing catalysts with balanced acid-base properties to promote propane activation and propene desorption while minimizing side reactions.

5. Investigating supported nanoparticle catalysts and intermetallic compounds as alternatives to conventional oxide catalysts.

These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing the key challenges in propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战：

1. 直接脱氢(DDH)提供了比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解更环保的替代方案，能耗更低。

2. 使用基于Pt或Cr的催化剂的DDH提供了高空时收率，尽管结焦仍然是一个问题，需要反应器循环进行再生。

3. 氧气氧化脱氢(ODH-O2)避免了结焦，但面临过度氧化的挑战。最近开发的基于硼的催化剂在解决这个问题上显示出了希望。

4. 二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢(ODH-CO2)提供了环境效益，但目前丙烯产率比DDH和ODH-O2低一个数量级。

正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 对于DDH和ODH-O2：专注于提高对丙烯的选择性，以增强稳定性并减少失活。

2. 对于ODH-CO2：强调提高对CO2活化的本征活性。

3. 探索新的催化剂材料，如用于ODH-O2的基于硼的催化剂，以克服传统金属氧化物催化剂的局限性。

4. 开发具有平衡酸碱性质的催化剂，以促进丙烷活化和丙烯脱附，同时最小化副反应。

5. 研究负载纳米粒子催化剂和金属间化合物作为传统氧化物催化剂的替代品。

这些策略旨在克服失活问题，增强稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性，解决丙烯生产中的关键挑战。
