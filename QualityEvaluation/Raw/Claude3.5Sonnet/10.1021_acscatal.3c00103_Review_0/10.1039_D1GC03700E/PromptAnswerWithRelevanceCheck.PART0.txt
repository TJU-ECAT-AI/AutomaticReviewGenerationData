[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."

[5] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct, on-purpose route to produce propylene, helping to fill the gap between supply from traditional methods (steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking) and growing demand.

2. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes are being developed, offering flexibility in production methods.

3. PDH can potentially operate at lower temperatures than steam cracking, potentially reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability:

1. Focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation in non-oxidative PDH.

2. Development of new support materials and promoters to improve catalyst stability and reduce coking.

3. Exploration of novel active components beyond traditional chromium oxide and platinum-based catalysts, such as boron-based catalysts for oxidative PDH.

4. Investigation of oxidative PDH processes, particularly using O2 as an oxidant, which can potentially avoid coke formation entirely.

5. Ongoing research into catalyst regeneration methods to extend catalyst lifetime and improve process efficiency.

These strategies aim to develop more stable, efficient, and sustainable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the key challenges of catalyst deactivation and improving overall process performance.

Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "The commercial interest in further developing dehydrogenation technologies is evident from a simple examination of the patent literature. Fig. 4a shows the number of patents filed annually since 1980 that disclose inventions of novel catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. There is a marked increase over time, which has accelerated in the last decade."

[3] "Deep oxidation remains a challenge for VOx and other supported metal oxides. However, it is clear than B-based catalysts, although recently developed and less understood in both structure and mechanism, have clear potential for commercialisation due to the high selectivity at high propane conversion."

[4] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few."

[5] "Overall, it is clear that an important and rapidly developing area of ODH-O2 catalysis is the application of boron-based materials. Many reports corroborate that BO and B-OH species, or a mix between the two (i.e., B(OHx)O3x) are the active sites for h-BN based catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH processes are being developed as "on-purpose" methods to directly produce propylene and fill the supply gap that cannot be met by traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. There is significant industrial interest in developing improved PDH catalysts, as evidenced by the marked increase in patent filings for novel PDH catalysts over the past few decades.

3. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes are being explored. Oxidative PDH using oxygen (ODH-O2) avoids coking issues but faces challenges with deep oxidation for many catalysts.

4. Boron-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for ODH-O2, offering high selectivity at high propane conversion. These catalysts show potential for commercialization despite being recently developed.

5. For non-oxidative PDH, efforts are focused on improving catalyst stability and reducing deactivation. While incremental improvements have been made to chromium-based catalysts, poor on-stream stability remains a significant barrier.

6. Research is ongoing to understand the active sites and reaction mechanisms, particularly for newer catalysts like boron-based materials. This fundamental knowledge is crucial for designing catalysts with improved performance and stability.

Overall, innovative catalyst design strategies are being pursued to overcome deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These include exploring new catalyst materials, optimizing support structures, and developing promoters to modulate catalyst properties.

[1] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component."

[4] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2. Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."

[5] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades.
