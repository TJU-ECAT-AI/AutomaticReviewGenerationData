[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "The commercial interest in further developing dehydrogenation technologies is evident from a simple examination of the patent literature. Fig. 4a shows the number of patents filed annually since 1980 that disclose inventions of novel catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. There is a marked increase over time, which has accelerated in the last decade."

[3] "Deep oxidation remains a challenge for VOx and other supported metal oxides. However, it is clear than B-based catalysts, although recently developed and less understood in both structure and mechanism, have clear potential for commercialisation due to the high selectivity at high propane conversion."

[4] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few."

[5] "Overall, it is clear that an important and rapidly developing area of ODH-O2 catalysis is the application of boron-based materials. Many reports corroborate that BO and B-OH species, or a mix between the two (i.e., B(OHx)O3x) are the active sites for h-BN based catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH processes are being developed as "on-purpose" methods to directly produce propylene and fill the supply gap that cannot be met by traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. There is significant industrial interest in developing improved PDH catalysts, as evidenced by the marked increase in patent filings for novel PDH catalysts over the past few decades.

3. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes are being explored. Oxidative PDH using oxygen (ODH-O2) avoids coking issues but faces challenges with deep oxidation for many catalysts.

4. Boron-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for ODH-O2, offering high selectivity at high propane conversion. These catalysts show potential for commercialization despite being recently developed.

5. For non-oxidative PDH, efforts are focused on improving catalyst stability and reducing deactivation. While incremental improvements have been made to chromium-based catalysts, poor on-stream stability remains a significant barrier.

6. Research is ongoing to understand the active sites and reaction mechanisms, particularly for newer catalysts like boron-based materials. This fundamental knowledge is crucial for designing catalysts with improved performance and stability.

Overall, innovative catalyst design strategies are being pursued to overcome deactivation, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These include exploring new catalyst materials, optimizing support structures, and developing promoters to modulate catalyst properties.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH工艺正在被开发为"定向"方法，直接生产丙烯并填补传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足的供应缺口。

2. 工业界对开发改进的PDH催化剂有很大兴趣，这从过去几十年新型PDH催化剂专利申请数量的显著增加可以看出。

3. 氧化和非氧化PDH工艺都在被探索。使用氧气的氧化PDH(ODH-O2)避免了结焦问题，但许多催化剂面临深度氧化的挑战。

4. 基于硼的催化剂已成为ODH-O2的有前景候选者，在高丙烷转化率下提供高选择性。尽管这些催化剂是最近开发的，但它们显示出商业化的潜力。

5. 对于非氧化PDH，研究重点是提高催化剂稳定性和减少失活。虽然铬基催化剂已经取得了渐进式改进，但反应过程中的稳定性差仍然是一个重大障碍。

6. 正在进行的研究致力于理解活性位点和反应机理，特别是对于较新的催化剂如基于硼的材料。这些基础知识对设计性能和稳定性更好的催化剂至关重要。

总的来说，正在追求创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服失活、增强稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性。这些策略包括探索新的催化剂材料、优化支撑结构，以及开发调节催化剂性能的助剂。
