[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."

[5] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct, on-purpose route to produce propylene, helping to fill the supply gap that cannot be met by existing steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.

2. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes have been developed, using various oxidants like O2, CO2, and N2O, expanding the options for propylene production.

3. Direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is currently the only commercially operated PDH process, using chromium oxide or platinum-tin oxide catalysts. However, these catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coking and require frequent regeneration.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Catalyst design is focusing on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the need for regeneration.

2. New support materials and promoters are being explored to improve catalyst stability and reduce precious metal usage.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen (ODH-O2) is being investigated as a coke-free alternative, with recent developments in boron-based catalysts showing significant promise for commercial application.

4. Research is ongoing to develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and longevity, using abundant and environmentally friendly materials.

These strategies aim to create more efficient, stable, and recyclable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the growing demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of current technologies.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH提供了一种直接、定向的丙烯生产路线，有助于填补现有蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足的供应缺口。

2. 开发了氧化和非氧化PDH工艺，使用O2、CO2和N2O等各种氧化剂，扩大了丙烯生产的选择范围。

3. 直接脱氢（DDH）目前是唯一商业运营的PDH工艺，使用氧化铬或铂-氧化锡催化剂。然而，这些催化剂面临着由于结焦造成的快速失活，需要频繁再生。

为了克服失活问题并提高催化剂性能，正在开发几种创新策略：

1. 催化剂设计正致力于减少导致结焦的深度脱氢反应，从而提高稳定性并减少再生需求。

2. 正在探索新的载体材料和助剂，以提高催化剂稳定性并减少贵金属使用量。

3. 正在研究氧气氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）作为无结焦的替代方案，最近在硼基催化剂方面的发展显示出商业应用的重大前景。

4. 研究正在进行，以开发具有更高活性、选择性和寿命的催化剂，使用丰富且环境友好的材料。

这些策略旨在为PDH工艺创造更高效、更稳定和可回收的催化剂，满足不断增长的丙烯需求，同时克服当前技术的局限性。
