[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "As a catalyst support component, Al2O3 has been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation processes due to its appropriate chemical properties, high structural stability and low cost. However, an inherent and major problem of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst system is rapid deactivation, which occurs as a consequence of coke formation."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking. Therefore, the future of DDH catalyst design should focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking."

[5] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts. The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct, on-purpose route to produce propylene, helping to fill the gap between supply from traditional methods (steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking) and growing demand.

2. Both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes are being developed, offering flexibility in production methods.

3. PDH can potentially operate at lower temperatures than steam cracking, potentially reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability:

1. Focus on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation in non-oxidative PDH.

2. Development of new support materials and promoters to improve catalyst stability and reduce coking.

3. Exploration of novel active components beyond traditional chromium oxide and platinum-based catalysts, such as boron-based catalysts for oxidative PDH.

4. Investigation of oxidative PDH processes, particularly using O2 as an oxidant, which can potentially avoid coke formation entirely.

5. Ongoing research into catalyst regeneration methods to extend catalyst lifetime and improve process efficiency.

These strategies aim to develop more stable, efficient, and sustainable catalysts for PDH processes, addressing the key challenges of catalyst deactivation and improving overall process performance.
