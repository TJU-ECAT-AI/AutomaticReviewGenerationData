[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades. At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."

[2] "Currently, non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is the only commercialised process, and this is reflected in the high spacetime yield commonly reported over the most active catalysts which are typically Pt or Cr based. However, the formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODH-O2) does not suffer from coke formation, but can lead to overoxidation, limiting the yield of propene. While no commercial processes have yet been developed, a promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component. These catalysts are amongst the most active and selective reported to date for this reaction."

[4] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2. Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."

[5] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2. The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. Direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is currently the only commercialized process, offering high space-time yields using Pt or Cr-based catalysts. However, coke formation remains a significant challenge, requiring frequent regeneration.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 (ODH-O2) avoids coke formation but can lead to overoxidation. Recent developments in boron-based catalysts for ODH-O2 show promise in terms of activity and selectivity.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 (ODH-CO2) is being explored for its environmental benefits, but currently suffers from low propene yields compared to DDH and ODH-O2.

Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome these challenges include:

1. For DDH and ODH-O2: Focus on improving selectivity to propene to reduce unwanted side reactions and extend catalyst lifetime.

2. For ODH-CO2: Addressing the low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2 activation.

3. Exploring more abundant and sustainable catalytic elements to replace scarce or toxic materials like Pt and Cr.

4. Developing catalysts with improved stability and recyclability to reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles and enhance overall process efficiency.

These strategies aim to create more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable PDH processes to meet the growing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法的局限性：

1. 直接脱氢（DDH）目前是唯一商业化的工艺，使用Pt或Cr基催化剂提供高空时产率。然而，积碳形成仍是一个重大挑战，需要频繁再生。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）避免了积碳形成，但可能导致过度氧化。最近在基于硼的ODH-O2催化剂方面的发展在活性和选择性方面显示出了前景。

3. 二氧化碳氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）因其环境效益而受到关注，但目前的丙烯产率与DDH和ODH-O2相比仍然较低。

创新的催化剂设计策略以克服这些挑战包括：

1. 对于DDH和ODH-O2：专注于提高丙烯选择性，以减少不必要的副反应并延长催化剂寿命。

2. 对于ODH-CO2：解决与CO2活化相关的低内在活性问题。

3. 探索更丰富和可持续的催化元素，以替代稀缺或有毒的材料，如Pt和Cr。

4. 开发具有改进的稳定性和可回收性的催化剂，以减少再生周期的频率并提高整体工艺效率。

这些策略旨在创造更高效、更可持续和更具经济可行性的PDH工艺，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，同时解决环境问题。
