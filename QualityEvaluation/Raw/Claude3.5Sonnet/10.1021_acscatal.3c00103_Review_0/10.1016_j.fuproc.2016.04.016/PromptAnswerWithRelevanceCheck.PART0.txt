[1] "Market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2 → H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2 → CnH2n + H2O."

[5] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for more direct and targeted production of propylene from propane feedstock.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. For non-oxidative PDH:
- Use of platinum-based catalysts promoted with elements like tin to improve stability and selectivity.
- Development of supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates that require no alkali titration of acidic sites, reducing side reactions.
- Exploration of zeolite-based supports to achieve high metal dispersion and stability, as demonstrated by Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts.

2. For oxidative PDH:
- Design of vanadium oxide catalysts with specific support interactions to control the nature of active sites.
- Investigation of nickel-based catalysts with various promoters to enhance selectivity.
- Development of lithium and halide-containing catalysts that operate via different mechanisms to achieve high selectivity at higher temperatures.

3. For both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH:
- Exploration of bimetallic catalysts and novel support materials to balance activity and stability.
- Investigation of catalyst preparation methods to control metal particle size and distribution.
- Design of reactor configurations and process conditions to optimize catalyst performance and lifespan.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, reduce coke formation, enhance propylene selectivity, and ultimately increase catalyst recyclability. The oxidative approach also addresses the energy input challenge by coupling endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen oxidation. However, further research is needed to develop commercially viable oxidative PDH catalysts that can match the performance of current non-oxidative PDH processes.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas sources. This helps to supplement traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking that may not be able to keep up with the growing demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Platinum-based catalysts: These are typically promoted with tin to improve performance and stability. The support material is impregnated with a solution of platinum and tin precursors.

2. Zeolite-supported catalysts: High platinum dispersion on zeolites through ion-exchange has shown unprecedented performance, as demonstrated by Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This approach aims to improve energy efficiency by combining endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. However, it requires innovative catalyst design to achieve proper synergy between these steps and selective CH and hydrogen combustion.

4. Nanoparticle catalysts: Sub-nanometer platinum clusters have shown promising results in ODH processes, with significantly higher turnover frequencies compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. Bimetallic catalysts: Combinations like Pt-Sn and Pt-Ga on various supports are being explored to enhance stability and selectivity.

These strategies aim to create catalysts that are more resistant to coking, have improved stability over multiple cycles, and maintain high selectivity towards propylene. The goal is to develop PDH processes that are more efficient, have longer catalyst lifetimes, and require less frequent regeneration, thus improving overall process economics and sustainability.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering alternatives to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH processes can be classified into non-oxidative and oxidative approaches.

For non-oxidative PDH, commercial catalysts are primarily based on platinum or chromium oxide. Platinum catalysts are usually promoted with tin to enhance performance and stability. Chromium oxide catalysts are prepared by impregnating high surface area supports with chromate salts. Both catalyst types require different regeneration treatments to address deactivation issues.

In oxidative PDH, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome challenges:

1. VMgO systems show promise due to their high selectivity and propene yield. Their performance can be further enhanced by promotion with redox metal ions.

2. NiOx-based catalysts are being investigated for their redox properties and non-stoichiometric nature. The Ni-center is thought to directly participate in C-H activation, which could lead to improved catalytic performance.

3. Research is ongoing to develop catalysts that can efficiently activate C-H bonds under milder conditions, drawing inspiration from homogeneous catalysts and enzyme mimics.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and increase propene yield in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. The development of more efficient catalysts could make PDH a more viable alternative for propylene production, addressing the growing demand in the industry.
