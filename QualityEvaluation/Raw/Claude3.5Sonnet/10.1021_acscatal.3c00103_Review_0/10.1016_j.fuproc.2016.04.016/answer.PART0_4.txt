Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering alternatives to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Current industrial PDH processes use platinum and chromium-based catalysts in non-oxidative, highly endothermic reactions.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Auto-thermal and oxidative PDH strategies are being explored to offset energy input requirements, though these technologies are still immature.

2. Researchers are gaining insights into CH bond activation mechanisms to improve catalyst performance.

3. VMgO systems promoted with redox metal ions show promising selectivity and propene yield for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

4. CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts demonstrate high propene selectivity without lithium doping.

5. Exploration of zeolite-supported platinum nanoparticles and incorporation of redox-active adatoms in zeolite frameworks are potential areas for enhancing catalyst activity and stability.

6. Development of catalysts mimicking enzyme active sites, such as those found in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5, may provide insights for efficient CH activation and alkane dehydrogenation.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst performance, stability, and recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing the limitations of current industrial methods and meeting the growing demand for propylene.
