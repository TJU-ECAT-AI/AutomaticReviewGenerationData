Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas sources. This helps to supplement traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking that may not be able to keep up with the growing demand.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Platinum-based catalysts: These are typically promoted with tin to improve performance and stability. The support material is impregnated with a solution of platinum and tin precursors.

2. Zeolite-supported catalysts: High platinum dispersion on zeolites through ion-exchange has shown unprecedented performance, as demonstrated by Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This approach aims to improve energy efficiency by combining endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. However, it requires innovative catalyst design to achieve proper synergy between these steps and selective CH and hydrogen combustion.

4. Nanoparticle catalysts: Sub-nanometer platinum clusters have shown promising results in ODH processes, with significantly higher turnover frequencies compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. Bimetallic catalysts: Combinations like Pt-Sn and Pt-Ga on various supports are being explored to enhance stability and selectivity.

These strategies aim to create catalysts that are more resistant to coking, have improved stability over multiple cycles, and maintain high selectivity towards propylene. The goal is to develop PDH processes that are more efficient, have longer catalyst lifetimes, and require less frequent regeneration, thus improving overall process economics and sustainability.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供从丙烷直接生产丙烯的途径来满足不断增长的工业丙烯需求，丙烷可以从天然气资源中大量获得。这有助于补充可能无法跟上不断增长需求的传统生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 铂基催化剂：这些催化剂通常用锡促进以提高性能和稳定性。将铂和锡前体的溶液浸渍到载体材料上。

2. 分子筛负载催化剂：通过离子交换在分子筛上实现高铂分散度显示出前所未有的性能，如Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂所示。

3. 氧化脱氢(ODH)：这种方法旨在通过将吸热脱氢与放热氢燃烧相结合来提高能源效率。然而，它需要创新的催化剂设计来实现这些步骤之间的适当协同作用以及选择性CH和氢燃烧。

4. 纳米颗粒催化剂：亚纳米级铂簇在ODH过程中显示出有希望的结果，与传统的非氧化脱氢相比，周转频率显著提高。

5. 双金属催化剂：正在探索Pt-Sn和Pt-Ga等组合在各种载体上的应用，以提高稳定性和选择性。

这些策略旨在创造出更耐焦炭、在多个循环中稳定性更好、并保持对丙烯高选择性的催化剂。目标是开发更高效、催化剂寿命更长、再生频率更低的PDH过程，从而提高整体工艺经济性和可持续性。
