[1] "Market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future"

[2] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[3] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[4] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."

[5] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a direct and selective route for propylene production from propane. This is particularly important as the demand for propylene derivatives is projected to outpace that of ethylene derivatives in the near future.

PDH processes face several challenges, including catalyst deactivation, stability issues, and the need for improved recyclability. To overcome these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Mechanistic insights: Researchers are focusing on understanding the CH bond activation mechanisms to guide catalyst improvement efforts. This includes identifying the specific surface oxygen species and hydrogen species involved in the activation process.

2. Novel materials: Exploration of new catalyst materials, such as NiOx-based catalysts, is ongoing. The goal is to create solid matrices that can selectively produce the desired active species when exposed to molecular oxygen.

3. Promoters and supports: Addition of promoters and careful selection of supports are being investigated to enhance catalyst stability and selectivity. For example, the use of ceria or other metal oxides as promoters has shown promise in some catalyst systems.

4. Nanostructured catalysts: Development of catalysts with controlled nanostructures, such as sub-nanometer platinum clusters, has demonstrated improved activity and stability.

5. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Research into ODH catalysts aims to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative PDH and reduce coke formation. However, challenges remain in bridging the gap between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

6. Thermal management: Strategies to manage the highly endothermic nature of PDH reactions are being developed, including the use of novel reactor designs and heat integration techniques.

7. Regeneration protocols: Improved catalyst regeneration methods are being studied to extend catalyst lifetime and enhance overall process efficiency.

These innovative approaches aim to create more stable, active, and selective catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, ultimately addressing the growing demand for propylene in a more efficient and sustainable manner.
