[1] "Market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2 → H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2 → CnH2n + H2O."

[5] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for more direct and targeted production of propylene from propane feedstock.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. For non-oxidative PDH:
- Use of platinum-based catalysts promoted with elements like tin to improve stability and selectivity.
- Development of supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates that require no alkali titration of acidic sites, reducing side reactions.
- Exploration of zeolite-based supports to achieve high metal dispersion and stability, as demonstrated by Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts.

2. For oxidative PDH:
- Design of vanadium oxide catalysts with specific support interactions to control the nature of active sites.
- Investigation of nickel-based catalysts with various promoters to enhance selectivity.
- Development of lithium and halide-containing catalysts that operate via different mechanisms to achieve high selectivity at higher temperatures.

3. For both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH:
- Exploration of bimetallic catalysts and novel support materials to balance activity and stability.
- Investigation of catalyst preparation methods to control metal particle size and distribution.
- Design of reactor configurations and process conditions to optimize catalyst performance and lifespan.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, reduce coke formation, enhance propylene selectivity, and ultimately increase catalyst recyclability. The oxidative approach also addresses the energy input challenge by coupling endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen oxidation. However, further research is needed to develop commercially viable oxidative PDH catalysts that can match the performance of current non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种替代传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的生产方法来满足工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。PDH允许从丙烷原料中更直接和有针对性地生产丙烯。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 对于非氧化PDH：
- 使用以锡等元素促进的铂基催化剂，以提高稳定性和选择性。
- 开发如锌和镁铝酸盐等不需要碱性滴定酸性位点的载体，减少副反应。
- 探索沸石基载体，以实现高金属分散度和稳定性，如Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂所示。

2. 对于氧化PDH：
- 设计具有特定载体相互作用的钒氧化物催化剂，以控制活性位点的性质。
- 研究具有各种促进剂的镍基催化剂，以提高选择性。
- 开发含锂和卤化物的催化剂，通过不同的机制在较高温度下实现高选择性。

3. 对于氧化和非氧化PDH：
- 探索双金属催化剂和新型载体材料，以平衡活性和稳定性。
- 研究催化剂制备方法，以控制金属粒子大小和分布。
- 设计反应器配置和工艺条件，以优化催化剂性能和使用寿命。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，减少积碳形成，提高丙烯选择性，并最终增加催化剂的可回收性。氧化法还通过将吸热脱氢与放热氢氧化耦合来解决能量输入挑战。然而，还需要进一步研究开发商业可行的氧化PDH催化剂，以匹配当前非氧化PDH工艺的性能。
