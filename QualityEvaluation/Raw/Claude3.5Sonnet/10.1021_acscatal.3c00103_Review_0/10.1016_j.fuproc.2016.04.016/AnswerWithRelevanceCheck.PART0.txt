          [1] "Market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2 → H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2 → CnH2n + H2O."

[5] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

[6] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors."

[7] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation."

[8] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[9] "VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield. Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s)."

[10] "NiOx is a non-stoichiometric oxide, and the Ni-center has various oxidation states. The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes."

[11] "Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the C–H activation step."

[12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."

[13] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."

[14] "CeO2/2CeF3 displays the best performance with very high propene selectivity, even without Li doping."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering alternatives to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH allows for more direct and targeted production of propylene from propane feedstock.

To overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, several innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed:

1. Platinum-based catalysts: These are typically promoted with tin to improve performance and stability. The support material is impregnated with a solution of platinum and tin precursors. High platinum dispersion on zeolites, as demonstrated by Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts, has shown unprecedented performance.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This approach aims to lower energy requirements by combining endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. It requires innovative catalyst design to achieve proper synergy between these steps and selective CH and hydrogen combustion.

3. VMgO systems: These show promise due to their high selectivity and propene yield, especially when promoted with redox metal ions.

4. NiOx-based catalysts: These are being investigated for their redox properties and non-stoichiometric nature. The Ni-center is thought to directly participate in C-H activation, which could lead to improved catalytic performance.

5. Rational design approach: This involves identifying compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species involved in CH activation, then creating a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen.

6. CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts: These demonstrate high propene selectivity without the need for lithium doping.

7. Mechanistic insights: Understanding CH bond activation mechanisms is crucial for catalyst improvement endeavors.

These strategies aim to create catalysts that are more resistant to coking, have improved stability over multiple cycles, maintain high selectivity towards propylene, and are more energy-efficient. The goal is to develop PDH processes that have longer catalyst lifetimes, require less frequent regeneration, and ultimately improve overall process economics and sustainability.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统生产方法的替代方案，解决了工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。PDH允许从丙烷原料中更直接和有针对性地生产丙烯。

为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发几种创新的催化剂设计策略：

1. 铂基催化剂：这些催化剂通常用锡促进以提高性能和稳定性。将铂和锡前体的溶液浸渍到载体材料上。通过离子交换在沸石上实现高铂分散度，如Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂所示，显示出前所未有的性能。

2. 氧化脱氢(ODH)：这种方法旨在通过将吸热脱氢与放热氢燃烧相结合来降低能量需求。它需要创新的催化剂设计来实现这些步骤之间的适当协同作用以及选择性CH和氢燃烧。

3. VMgO系统：由于其高选择性和丙烯产率，这些系统显示出前景，特别是在与氧化还原金属离子促进时。

4. 基于NiOx的催化剂：正在研究这些催化剂的氧化还原特性和非化学计量性。Ni中心被认为直接参与C-H活化，这可能会导致催化性能的提高。

5. 理性设计方法：这涉及识别参与CH活化的兼容表面氧物种和氢物种，然后创建一个固体基质，该基质在暴露于分子氧时可以选择性地产生这些物种。

6. CeO2/2CeF3催化剂：这些催化剂在不需要锂掺杂的情况下表现出高丙烯选择性。

7. 机理洞察：理解CH键活化机理对催化剂改进工作至关重要。

这些策略旨在创造出更耐焦炭、在多个循环中稳定性更好、保持对丙烯高选择性、并且能源效率更高的催化剂。目标是开发具有更长催化剂寿命、需要较少再生频率的PDH过程，并最终提高整体工艺经济性和可持续性。
