Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering alternatives to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH processes can be classified into non-oxidative and oxidative approaches.

For non-oxidative PDH, commercial catalysts are primarily based on platinum or chromium oxide. Platinum catalysts are usually promoted with tin to enhance performance and stability. Chromium oxide catalysts are prepared by impregnating high surface area supports with chromate salts. Both catalyst types require different regeneration treatments to address deactivation issues.

In oxidative PDH, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome challenges:

1. VMgO systems show promise due to their high selectivity and propene yield. Their performance can be further enhanced by promotion with redox metal ions.

2. NiOx-based catalysts are being investigated for their redox properties and non-stoichiometric nature. The Ni-center is thought to directly participate in C-H activation, which could lead to improved catalytic performance.

3. Research is ongoing to develop catalysts that can efficiently activate C-H bonds under milder conditions, drawing inspiration from homogeneous catalysts and enzyme mimics.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and increase propene yield in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. The development of more efficient catalysts could make PDH a more viable alternative for propylene production, addressing the growing demand in the industry.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供替代传统生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）的方式来满足工业对丙烯日益增长的需求。PDH工艺可分为非氧化和氧化两种方法。

对于非氧化PDH，商业催化剂主要基于铂或氧化铬。铂催化剂通常用锡促进以提高性能和稳定性。氧化铬催化剂是通过将铬酸盐浸渍到高比表面积载体上制备的。这两种催化剂类型都需要不同的再生处理来解决失活问题。

在氧化PDH方面，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略来克服挑战：

1. VMgO系统由于其高选择性和丙烯产率而显示出前景。通过与氧化还原金属离子的促进，其性能可以进一步提高。

2. 正在研究基于NiOx的催化剂的氧化还原特性和非化学计量性。Ni中心被认为直接参与C-H活化，这可能会导致催化性能的提高。

3. 研究正在进行，以开发能在较温和条件下有效活化C-H键的催化剂，从均相催化剂和酶模拟物中汲取灵感。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，改善可回收性，并在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中增加丙烯产率。更高效催化剂的开发可能使PDH成为丙烯生产的更可行的替代方案，从而满足行业不断增长的需求。
