[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient."

[6] "The incorporation of Sn into the Co/NC microwave catalyst gives a high selectivity (80%) to propylene at the whole process and the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst does not show any significant change after tested for 180min."

[7] "Apparently, the addition of Sn has a significant positive effect on the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction. It may be ascribed to that the introduction of Sn can facilitate the transfer of the carbon deposits from metal to the carrier, therefore improves the catalytic stability."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH directly converts propane to propylene, offering a more efficient route compared to traditional by-production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking, which have low yields.

2. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, helping to meet the growing demand that traditional methods cannot satisfy.

3. PDH can utilize abundant propane resources, such as those from shale gas, as feedstock.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability include:

1. Using non-precious metal catalysts like CoSn/NC to reduce costs while maintaining high activity.

2. Incorporating promoters like Sn into catalysts to improve stability and selectivity. The addition of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal to carrier, reducing coking and enhancing catalyst longevity.

3. Utilizing microwave catalysis to enable low-temperature operation (e.g., 450°C), which helps reduce side reactions and coking that occur at higher temperatures in conventional PDH.

4. Developing catalysts with optimized acidity to minimize undesirable side reactions.

5. Creating catalysts with improved resistance to sintering and carbon deposition to extend catalyst lifetime.

These strategies aim to address the major challenges in PDH processes, namely catalyst deactivation due to coking and sintering, and the need for high reaction temperatures. By improving catalyst stability, selectivity, and allowing for lower operating temperatures, these innovations are making PDH a more viable and efficient process for propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战：

1. PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与蒸汽裂解和催化裂解等传统副产品生产方法相比，提供了更高效的途径，这些传统方法产率较低。

2. PDH允许定向生产丙烯，有助于满足传统方法无法满足的不断增长的需求。

3. PDH可以利用丰富的丙烷资源作为原料，如页岩气中的丙烷。

为克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性而开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括：

1. 使用CoSn/NC等非贵金属催化剂，在保持高活性的同时降低成本。

2. 将Sn等助剂引入催化剂以提高稳定性和选择性。添加Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属向载体的转移，减少结焦并延长催化剂寿命。

3. 利用微波催化实现低温操作（如450°C），有助于减少常规PDH中高温下发生的副反应和结焦。

4. 开发具有优化酸度的催化剂，以最大限度地减少不必要的副反应。

5. 创造具有改进的抗烧结和抗碳沉积能力的催化剂，以延长催化剂寿命。

这些策略旨在解决PDH过程中的主要挑战，即由于结焦和烧结导致的催化剂失活，以及对高反应温度的需求。通过提高催化剂的稳定性、选择性，并允许在较低的操作温度下进行，这些创新正在使PDH成为一种更可行和更高效的丙烯生产工艺。
