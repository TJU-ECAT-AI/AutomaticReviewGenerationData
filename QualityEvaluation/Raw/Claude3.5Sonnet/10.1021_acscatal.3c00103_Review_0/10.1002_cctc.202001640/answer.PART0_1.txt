[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[6] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[7] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH directly converts propane to propylene, offering a more targeted and potentially higher-yield approach compared to traditional steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes, which produce propylene as a by-product.

2. PDH can utilize abundant propane resources, particularly from shale gas, providing a new feedstock source for propylene production.

3. The direct conversion process potentially allows for better control and optimization of propylene yield compared to by-production methods.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Development of non-precious metal catalysts, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst, which can offer cost advantages over traditional precious metal catalysts.

2. Use of microwave catalysis to enable lower reaction temperatures, potentially reducing coking and other side reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation.

3. Incorporation of promoters like Sn to improve catalyst stability and reduce deactivation by coking.

4. Design of catalysts with specific acid-base properties to optimize selectivity and reduce unwanted side reactions.

5. Exploration of novel support materials, such as N-doped carbon, to enhance catalyst performance and stability.

6. Use of microwave heating to achieve more selective heating of the catalyst, potentially improving propylene selectivity by maintaining a lower gas-phase temperature.

These strategies aim to address the key challenges in PDH processes, including the high temperatures typically required, catalyst deactivation due to coking, and achieving high propylene selectivity while maintaining good conversion rates.
