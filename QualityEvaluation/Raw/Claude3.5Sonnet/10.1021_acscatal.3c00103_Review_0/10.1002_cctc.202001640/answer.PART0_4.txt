[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[5] "Therefore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts is currently of major research interest. Many other promising catalysts that are less hazardous than chromium or cheaper than platinum are being investigated, including gallium, cobalt, nickel, iron oxide."

[6] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[7] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[8] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH offers a direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is more efficient than traditional by-production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking that yield insufficient amounts to meet growing demand.

2. PDH allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources, particularly from shale gas, as feedstock for high-value propylene production.

3. Microwave-assisted PDH, as demonstrated with the CoSn/NC catalyst, enables lower reaction temperatures (450°C) compared to conventional PDH (550-700°C), potentially reducing energy consumption and side reactions.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed include:

1. Non-precious metal catalysts: Researchers are exploring catalysts based on cobalt, nickel, iron, and gallium as alternatives to expensive platinum or hazardous chromium catalysts.

2. Bimetallic systems: The CoSn/NC catalyst demonstrates how combining metals (cobalt and tin) can enhance stability and selectivity.

3. Carbon-based supports: Using nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) as a support material improves microwave absorption and catalyst performance.

4. Microwave-responsive materials: Designing catalysts that efficiently absorb microwave energy allows for selective heating and improved reaction control.

These strategies aim to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability by:

1. Reducing coke formation: The CoSn/NC catalyst showed good stability over 180 minutes without visible changes, indicating resistance to coking.

2. Lowering reaction temperatures: Microwave-assisted PDH at lower temperatures can minimize sintering and thermal degradation of catalysts.

3. Improving selectivity: The CoSn/NC catalyst achieved 75% propylene selectivity at 450°C, reducing unwanted side reactions.

4. Enhancing catalyst longevity: The stable performance of the CoSn/NC catalyst suggests improved recyclability and longer catalyst lifetimes.

These advancements in PDH catalysts and processes offer promising solutions to meet the growing demand for propylene while addressing the limitations of traditional production methods.
