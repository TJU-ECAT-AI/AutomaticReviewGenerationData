Highly Effective Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene by Microwave Catalysis at Low Temperature over CoSn/NC Microwave Catalyst
Graphical Abstract
Zzaapp! The direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 is reported by microwave catalysis over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst for the first time at low temperature, for which the CoSn/NC catalyst has an outstanding activity with a high C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity up to 15% and 80%, respectively, even at 450C. This work opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature.
Abstract
The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge. Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C. Comparatively, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity were respectively only 3.2% and 67.8% for CoSn/NC catalyst at 450C in the conventional reaction mode under identical conditions. Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min. Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect. This work provides a novel approach for highly effective direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave irradiation at low temperature.
1 Introduction
Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products.1 Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply.2 A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking.3 Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand.4 At the same time, because of abundant coal resources, the coal-to-propylene method has been widely used in industrial applications. However, due to the policy adjustment in recent years, the price of coal has risen sharply and the price of propylene has shifted downward. This situation has caused the profit of the coal-to-propylene process has been far less than before, which makes it extremely urgent to explore novel, lower-cost ways to produce propylene. In recent years, the shale gas that is an abundant source of propane has emerged, making it very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals including C2 to C4 olefins.5 Moreover, there is a large extent of the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes people pay attention to the process of direct dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene with high added value. To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). In this regard, it would be desirable to exploit a new environment-friendly dehydrogenation catalyst system with high activity, good stability and much lower cost.
Recently, there is increasing attention that the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction potentially opening the way for the production of propylene.9 Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium.10 According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter.11 Therefore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts is currently of major research interest. Many other promising catalysts that are less hazardous than chromium or cheaper than platinum are being investigated, including gallium,4, 12 cobalt,13 nickel,14 iron15 oxide. Moreover, researches have revealed that these catalysts which have potential to be commercialized in the future have promising catalytic properties.16 Hu etal.17 reported that single-site Co2+/SiO2 exhibits selectivity >95% at 550C and >90% at 650C with stable activity over 24h in the selective propane dehydrogenation. On the other hand, mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel showed higher conversion and selectivity at 600C owing to the well-dispersed Co2+ in the alumina matrix, which revealed the non-redox type nature of cobalt coordinated with alumina as an active phase for propane dehydrogenation.13c Meanwhile, Sun etal.18 found that at loadings below 10wt%, the surface Co spinel formed from tetrahedral Co2+ ions during the course of reaction constituted the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, when at high loadings (above 10wt.%), only Co3O4 crystallites that were easily reduced to metallic Co species presented, resulting in cracking reaction and the formation of abundant methane. Yet in another study, Li etal.13e reported an initial induction period was observed for the pre-reduced and fresh catalysts, however with re-oxidation of the catalyst gave a high selectivity (93.0%) to propylene at the whole process for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. So far, from all the studies reported in the literatures, these Co-based catalysts have better catalytic performance in direct propane dehydrogenation reaction among environmentally friendly non-precious metal catalysts. However, the reaction temperature (600C) is very high in the conventional reaction mode. Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption.
Recently, the application of microwave irradiation to chemical reactions has received great attention, because it can increase spectacularly reaction rates and selectivity, and save energy through reductions in the reaction temperature and time, therefore, the use of microwave irradiation is in line with the concept of green chemistry, which cannot be achieved through conventional reaction mode.19 Recently, our group found that direct decomposition of NO reaction and direct decomposition of H2S reaction can be dramatically accelerated under microwave irradiation.19c, 20 This significant microwave effect is expected to address the challenging problem in direct propane dehydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, microwave irradiation is considered as a promising approach to reduce energy consumption effectively. However, the key to achieve the highly effective direct dehydrogenation reaction by microwave catalysis is to design outstanding catalysts.
The development of excellent microwave catalysts for microwave catalytic reactions is very critical, because an excellent microwave catalyst can display dramatic enhancement in reaction rates and selectivity. Unfortunately, no exact knowledge can furnish reference to design excellent microwave catalysts for microwave catalytic reactions so far.21 Microwave catalysts should be good at absorbing microwaves.22 Carbon materials as good microwave absorbing materials, are beneficial to be used as the catalyst receptors under microwave irradiation.23 Furthermore, owing to the high thermal stability, good conductivity, large porosity, and tunable functional groups compared with traditional metal and metal oxide catalysts, nanocarbons are important catalysts for various catalytic reactions, including oxidative dehydrogenation,24 direct dehydrogenation,25 electrocatalysis,26 oxidation,27 and reactions in supercapacitors.28 Moreover, Co-based catalysts have better catalytic performance among non-precious metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction in the conventional mode. In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking.29 Therefore, we attempt to design CoSn/NC as novel microwave catalyst for PDH under microwave irradiation, in which the cobalt as the active site, the Sn as the promoter and the carbon nitride phase as the catalyst support. To the best of our knowledge, CoSn/NC as microwave catalyst in PDH under microwave irradiation has not been reported yet so far.
At the same time, although microwave irradiation has been successfully applied in some catalytic reactions that cannot carried out in the conventional reaction mode, the intrinsic nature of microwave irradiation on catalytic reactions has still not been illuminated, especially the direct dehydrogenation of propane reaction.29a Up to now, some scholars believe that hot-spots is the main reason for microwave-accelerated heterogeneous gas-phase catalytic reaction mechanisms.19a However, the hot-spots hypothesis has been questioned recently. Indeed, Serpone etal.19b reported excessively formed hot-spots may have a negative influence on the heterogeneous catalytic reaction system. Therefore, the real reason for propane direct dehydrogenation reaction by microwave catalysis is still unclear.
Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature.
2 Results
2.1 Catalytic performance of CoSn/NC for Propane Dehydrogenation under microwave irradiation at low temperature
We first synthesized Co/NC by the solvothermal method. Then, in order to enhance the activity and thermal stability, we have introduced Sn species. We studied the catalytic activity and chemical stability of Co/NC and CoSn/NC microwave catalysts at low temperature of 450C for direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 into C3H6 in the microwave catalytic reaction mode. The initial specific activity, conversion of propane, and selectivity to propene, ethane, ethene and methane are summarized in TableS1, while variations of propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. time-on-stream over the Co/NC and CoSn/NC are shown in Figure1. It can be clearly seen from TableS1, Co/NC catalyst was highly active for pyrolysis and coking, Moreover, the propane conversion of the Co/NC catalyst gradually decreases within 180minutes of the reaction (Figure1). Surprisingly, the incorporation of Sn into the Co/NC microwave catalyst gives a high selectivity (80%) to propylene at the whole process and the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst does not show any significant change after tested for 180min. As for the selectivity of Co/NC catalyst after 130min, this phenomenon is similar to Ref. 30. It approaches to those over the CoSn/NC catalyst, which may be due to the very low propane conversion.30 Apparently, the addition of Sn has a significant positive effect on the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction. It may be ascribed to that the introduction of Sn can facilitate the transfer of the carbon deposits from metal to the carrier, therefore improves the catalytic stability.31 The experimental results are consistent with the previously reported PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and PtSn/MgAlO catalysts in direct PDH under conventional reaction mode.31, 32

2.2 Catalytic performance of CoSn/NC for Propane Dehydrogenation under different reaction modes
To further demonstrate the superiority of microwave irradiation to the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction, we tested the catalytic performance of CoSn/NC microwave catalyst under the microwave catalytic reaction mode and the conventional reaction mode, respectively. The result is shown in Figure2. The propane conversion is extremely low (3.2%) at 450C in the conventional reaction mode. Interestingly, the propane conversion can achieve 15% under microwave catalytic reaction mode. Moreover, the propylene selectivity in the microwave catalytic reaction mode is much higher than the propylene selectivity in the conventional mode at the same temperature. We have also investigated the effect of reaction temperature on direct propane dehydrogenation reaction in different reaction modes over the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. The results are displayed in Figure2b and Figure2c. The C3H8 conversion can achieve 5.4% and C3H6 selectivity is 85.4% at 300C in the MCRM. Comparatively, the C3H8 conversion at 450C in the CRM is only 3.2%, and the C3H6 selectivity is only 67.8%. Obviously, the propane conversion increases with the increase of temperature, while the propylene selectivity decreases with the increase of temperature. Furthermore, Compared with the catalytic performance of the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst in the conventional reaction mode, microwave irradiation significantly reduced the reaction temperature of direct propane dehydrogenation and obtained higher catalytic performance. Previously, our work of direct H2S decomposition reaction proved that the H2S equilibrium conversion can be broken under microwave irradiation.19c We give a comparison of the equilibrium conversion and the propane conversion in microwave catalytic reactor mode at different temperatures. As can be seen from Figure2b, the corresponding equilibrium C3H8 conversion in the conventional reaction mode is respectively 6.11% at 300C, 8.16% at 350C, 15.60% at 400C and 25.77% at 450C.1a Comparatively, the propane conversion under microwave catalytic reaction mode at 450C can only achieve 15%. Unfortunately, microwave catalysis did not break the equilibrium conversion of the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction in our catalytic system. Therefore, the above results indicate that CoSn/NC microwave catalyst display high catalytic performance for direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 by microwave catalysis at low temperature 450C and the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min. Furthermore, we provide a comparison with the recently reported Co catalysts in PDH reaction. The result is shown in TableS2. In the table, CRM means conventional reaction mode, and MCRM means microwave catalytic reaction mode. From all the studies reported in the literatures, these Co-based catalysts have better catalytic performance in direct propane dehydrogenation reaction among environmentally friendly non-precious metal catalysts. However, the reaction temperature (550600C) is very high in the conventional reaction mode. Here, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode. TableS2 also proves that the application of microwave irradiation to propane dehydrogenation reaction can increase spectacularly reaction rates and selectivity, and save energy through reductions in the reaction temperature and time.

2.3 Microwave heating behavior of catalysts
The expected reaction temperature of the catalyst in microwave catalytic reaction mode is related to the microwave absorption capacity of the material itself. In other words, the better the microwave absorption performance of the catalyst is, the higher the temperature of the catalyst bed is under steady-state. So we studied the microwave heating behavior of catalysts under microwave irradiation. We use N2 through the bed of the sample during the measurements. The result is shown in Figure3. The bed temperature gradually reaches a steady state with the extension of the microwave irradiation time. For the Co/NC microwave catalyst, the equilibrium temperature in the microwave catalytic reaction mode can reach 450C for about 400s at a microwave power of 100W. With the introduction of the Sn species, the CoSn/NC sample can reach 360C for about 800s at a microwave power of 100W. Compared with the microwave heating behavior of Co/NC, although the microwave absorption performance of CoSn/NC is slightly weaker, it still has good microwave absorption ability. As reported in previous studies, the addition of Sn can improve the propylene selectivity in the conventional reaction mode.31, 33 Furthermore, the experiments of microwave heating behavior show that the CoSn/NC and Co/NC catalysts are all excellent microwave-absorbing materials. Therefore, the CoSn/NC display much higher catalytic performance than that of Co/NC catalyst in the microwave catalysis reaction mode. For the catalytic activity tests in the microwave catalytic reaction mode, the specific reaction temperature of the catalyst bed can be achieved by adjusting the microwave input power.

2.4 Catalyst characterization
In order to further illustrate the catalyst performance and structure of the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, we performed a series of characterizations. Figure4 displays XRD pattern of the fresh Co/NC and the fresh and used CoSn/NC microwave catalysts. For the XRD pattern of fresh Co/NC catalyst, it only shows characteristic diffraction peaks of carbon materials at 2θ value of 27 and 44, which is assigned to (002) and (100) of the N-doped carbon lattice plane.34 For the fresh CoSn/NC, diffraction peaks centered at 2θ= 30.7, 32.1, 43.9, 44.9, 55.3, 62.5, 63.8, 64.7, 72.4, 73.2, 79.5 and 89.4indicative of tetragonal structured tin (a=b=5.831Å, c=3.182Å), which is consistent with reported values (JCDPS No. 04-0673).35 In addition, there is a small amount of SnO2 crystal phase. No diffraction peaks of cobalt are detectable in all samples, which may be due to that the amount of cobalt in all samples is too small and uniformly distributed to be detected by the XRD technique.

To prove the existence of cobalt species, (HR)TEM images and EDX spectrum were further performed. TEM images (Figure5a) and elemental mapping images (Figure5c) reveal the uniform distribution of dense loading of N, Co and Sn. Moreover, the EDX spectrum (Figure5d) of the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst proves the existence of Co species, despite no diffraction peaks of Co species in XRD pattern. Figure5e shows the particle size of the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, which is clearly seen the particle size is mainly distributed between 25nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the CoSn/NC sample is presented in Figure5b. As can be seen, obvious lattice fringes with an interplane spacing of 2.915Å and 1.205Å are in good agreement with the (200) and (312) plane of tetragonal tin, this is consistent with the XRD analysis. Beyond that, the lattice fringes of SnO is observed to be 2.90Å, corresponding to the (101) plane of the SnO.

The FT-IR spectra of the fresh Co/NC and CoSn/NC microwave catalysts are presented in Figure6. The absorption bands at 435cm1 may be due to stretching and bending vibrations of OSnO bands, whereas the peak at 675cm1 could be assigned to stretching vibration of SnO band.36 This is consistent with XRD results and HRTEM results, respectively. The sharp absorption peak at 1395cm1 is attributed to the functional groups of CN bond,34 while the absorption bands at 1413cm1 are related to the existence of NC=O bond.37

The N2 physisorption analysis in Figure7a demonstrates that the CoSn/NC sample has an IV physisorption isotherm, which could illustrate that the mesoporous structure of the catalyst sample. BET surface area of the fresh and used CoSn/NC microwave catalysts in Table1. The fresh CoSn/NC catalyst has a BET surface area of 478.89m2/g, while the used sample decreases slightly to 435.94m2/g, which may be due to a little carbon deposition during direct dehydrogenation of propane reaction. Furthermore, the fresh and used CoSn/NC samples were studied by Raman spectroscopy (Figure7b). The result indicates the presence of carbon atom in samples. Moreover, as compared with the fresh CoSn/NC, the intensity ratio between D band (1360cm1) and G band (1589cm1) of the used CoSn/NC sample increase to 2.65. However, the fresh and used samples possessed a similar crystalline degree according to the Raman peak. It indicates that microwave irradiation at 450C for a long time did not affect the crystallinity of the catalyst.38 This result is consistent with XRD pattern. These results may account for the accumulation of carbon during the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction, which reduces the graphitization degree of the catalyst. This result is in good agreement with the BET analysis.

The presence of Lewis acidic center plays an important role in propane dehydrogenation reaction. To investigate the surface acidity, pyridine infrared (IR) spectroscopy was utilized to probe the acidity of the CoSn/NC catalyst. It can be seen from Figure8a that both samples displayed well resolved bands at 1448cm1, 1490cm1, 1575cm1, and 1610cm1 ascribed to the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites but a negligible band at 1540cm1 assigned to pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites.13c, 39 These results indicate that Lewis acid sites are present on the surfaces of the Co/NC and CoSn/NC microwave catalysts. The number of acid sites was titrated by NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3TPD). The NH3TPD spectra for the Co/NC and CoSn/NC microwave catalysts are presented in Figure8b. To compare with each other, all the results were normalized. It is clear that The NH3TPD profiles of Co/NC catalyst display three desorption peaks with maximal temperatures (TM) at 152C, 278C and 460C. The TM of the desorption peaks for CoSn/NC catalysts are 160C, 238C, 310C. As is known, the NH3 desorptions in the temperature regions of 120200C, 200350C, 350460C were regarded as the weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively.40 To obtain the semiquantitative results of total acidity and the distribution of acidic strength, a Gaussian peak fitting method was adopted to deconvolute the NH3TPD curves.41 The fitted peaks and fitting results are presented in Figure8b and Table2, respectively. The peak areas are corresponding to the number of acid centers. The total peak areas for Co/NC and CoSn/NC catalysts are both 100. The areas of three different peaks for Co/NC catalyst are 8.6, 67.8, and 23.6, whereas, for CoSn/NC catalyst, the areas are 10.1, 37.1, and 52.8. From the results, we can find that the amount of strong acid centers decreases significantly and the amount of weak acid centers increases after the addition of Sn. Moreover, the peak in the high temperature has the tendency to move toward to the low temperature and the high temperature peak almost disappears. These indicate that the addition of Sn may neutralize the strong acid sites preferentially. Taking into account that the side reactions are mainly catalyzed by strong acid centers,42 it can also be said that the undesirable side reactions do not easily occur over the CoSn/NC catalyst.

XPS survey spectrum of the fresh CoSn/NC catalyst was shown in Figure9a, there are the peaks of C, N, Co, Sn and O elements. The C 1s spectrum of the fresh sample in Figure9b could be deconvoluted to three Gaussian peaks, including CC sp2 hybridization at 284.5eV, CN/C=C at 285.4eV, CO at 288.5eV, respectively.38a, 43 Figure9c shows the N 1s XPS spectrum, one peak at around 398.3eV corresponds to pyridinic-N, the remaining two peaks at 400.3eV and 401.3eV are attributed to pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.44 The XPS Co 2p spectrum (Figure9d) shows that there are Co2+ and satellite peaks, which might serve as the active phase of propane dehydrogenation reaction.13c, 18 Figure9e presents the XPS spectrum of Sn 3d region.

3 Discussion
3.1 The nature of active phase in CoSn/NC microwave catalyst
Most researchers think that the Co2+ sites are proposed to act as Lewis acidic active sites in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation.13c, 13e Hu etal.13c report the synthesis and characterization of a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel (CoAl) as an active and selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel showed higher conversion and selectivity at 600C owing to the well-dispersed Co2+ in the alumina matrix, which revealed the non-redox type nature of cobalt coordinated with alumina as an active phase for propane dehydrogenation. However, this year, Yuan etal.46 reported that the metallic Co formed insitu during the reaction are the active sites. They found that the 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5 CoSiBeta catalyst after pre-reduction treatment at 600C. Moreover, Wang etal.35a demonstrated that Sn plays a leading role in dehydrogenation as a highly active component. To further figure out the nature of catalyst performance and active phase, we performed the control experiments and the results shown in Figure10. As can be seen, the mono-metallic Sn/NC catalyst has poor catalyst performance and the C3H6 selectivity is only 45%. It is highly active for pyrolysis and coking. Furthermore, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the pre-reduction CoSn/NC microwave catalyst is 10% and 65%, respectively, which is lower than the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. The influence of cobalt in different states on direct dehydrogenation of propane may be greatly related to the carrier. In our catalyst system, the activity of the pre-reduction catalyst decreases and there is no induction period, indicating that Co2+ is likely to be the active site.

Furthermore, as can be seen from TableS1, Co/NC catalyst was highly active for pyrolysis and coking, while the incorporation of Sn into the Co/NC microwave catalyst gives a high selectivity (80%) to propylene. Regarding the reasons for the obvious difference of product selectivity between Co/NC and CoSn/NC catalysts, it may be explained from the pyridine infrared (IR) and NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3TPD) characterizations. The incorporation of Sn may neutralize the strong acid sites on the Co/NC catalyst preferentially, which makes the undesirable side reaction difficult to occur on the CoSn/NC catalyst.
3.2 The reason for catalytic stability over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst under microwave irradiation
As can be seen from Figure2a, the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst exhibits good stability for 180minutes under microwave catalytic reaction mode. For the purpose of illuminating the possible reasons causing good stability for 180minutes under microwave irradiation, we attempted to look for some possible reasons. First, from the XRD pattern, the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst still shows a similar structure compare with the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. What's more, the BET surface area of the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst is closed to the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, as shown in Table1. The above results may be part of the reason but not enough to explain the catalytic stability over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst under microwave irradiation. In order to further elucidate the good stability of CoSn/NC microwave catalyst and the microwave effect, the chemical state of elements in the used CoSn/NC were characterized by XPS. From Figure11a, XPS spectrum of the used CoSn/NC indicates that C, N, Co, Sn and O elements still exist. Importantly, the Co 2p spectra of the used CoSn/NC in Figure11d, Co2+ still exist in the used CoSn/NC catalyst, which also suggests the active sites for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction have existed. At the same time, the observation of another peak at 778.1eV suggests the presence of Co0, which may be due to that the reaction process makes the transformation of partial Co2+ species to metal Co species. Figure11b,c,e indicate that the states of C, N and Sn in the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst are similar to the fresh microwave catalyst. Furthermore, the content of these components in the fresh and used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst are calculated by XPS characterization results (Table3). In contrast to the fresh CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, the content of active phase Co2+ in the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst is around 89.04%, which has slightly decreased. Furthermore, the content of metallic Co only accounts for 10%. Meanwhile, Sn0 species hardly changed in the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, which is consisted of XRD pattern. It is speculated that Co2+ may be the active site because the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst after pre-reduction does not have satisfactory activity. Moreover, according to the XPS spectrum for Co 2p of the used CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, after the catalyst was subjected to microwave irradiation for 180min, the content of Co2+ decreased slightly, and the spent catalyst structure hardly changed compared with the fresh catalyst, which is probably why the catalyst could maintain stability.

Therefore, the stability for 180minutes of CoSn/NC microwave catalyst may be due to the synergistic effect of cobalt, tin main phases. Moreover, the structure of the spent microwave catalyst does not differ significantly after the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction under microwave irradiation. Although these findings can help to improve the dehydrogenation performance of CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, much detailed work cannot be carried out to give an insight into the explicit reaction mechanism because of lacking the insitu characterization. Unfortunately, insitu characterization under microwave irradiation is still a great challenge so far.
3.3 Microwave direct catalytic effect
Figure1 and Figure2 indicate that microwave irradiation significantly reduce the reaction temperature of direct propane dehydrogenation and obtain higher catalytic performance compared with the conventional reaction mode over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst. These phenomena are extremely interesting, but what causes these phenomena?
In order to illuminate the possibilities causing the significant enhancement under microwave irradiation, we first explore some possible reasons from the hot-spots hypothesis. In the early studies of microwave-driven catalytic reaction, many researchers believe that there are hot-spots or large temperature gradients in the catalyst beds under microwave irradiation. That is, those temperatures are considered to be much higher than the average temperature of the beds. In particular, Zhang etal.47 reported that the hot-spots temperatures are 100200C higher than the overall average temperature of the catalyst bed when the temperature range under microwave irradiation is as high as 800C. Moreover, some researchers have recently reported that the formation and control of hot-spots in catalysts irradiated by microwave have been observed using high-speed cameras.48 For comparison, we assume that the hot-spots temperature under microwave irradiation is higher than the catalyst bed temperature by about 150C (the temperature range under microwave irradiation is only 300450C in this work). The comparison results are shown in TableS3. For the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, the corresponding C3H8 conversion in the CRM can achieve 3.2% at 450C, 5.4% at 500C, 11.1% at 550C, and 13.1% at 600C, and C3H6 selectivity is 67.8% at 450C, 63.4% at 500C, 61.0% at 550C, and 54.8% at 600C, respectively. Surprisingly, the C3H8 conversion in the MCRM is only 5.4% at 300C, 7.8% at 350C, 9.8% at 400C and 15% at 450C, and C3H6 selectivity is 85.4% at 300C, 81.0% at 350C, 78.0% at 400C, and 74.2% at 450C. From the above results, the catalytic performance under microwave irradiation is significantly higher than the corresponding catalyst performance at hot-spots temperature in the conventional reaction mode, except for the C3H8 conversion at 500C, which may be due to microwave selectivity heating. Ramirez etal. reported that Microwave (MW) heating has been applied to increase the selectivity to propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.49 They found that the preferential heating of the solid monolith (made of carbon nitride phase, a good microwave receptor) perhaps underwent a rapid and selective heating under microwaves. In other words, the gas phase remained at a lower temperature. The lower gas-phase temperature allows to minimize undesired by-products during the direct propane dehydrogenation. However, the more limited performance is delivered by the same catalytic system when it is subjected to conventional heating in a fixed-bed reactor configuration. Therefore, higher propylene selectivity is achieved in comparison with conventional heating conditions. This concept has been previously demonstrated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane using CO2 (rather than oxygen) as the oxidant.50 In their system, the catalyst was almost 100% selective and all unselective contributions came from the gas phase. This indicates that microwave heating can reduce the temperature of the gas phase, and a significant solid-gas temperature gap is induced, which reduce undesired by-products and thus improve the propylene selectivity.
So far, the hot-spot hypothesis has been considered as the main mechanism leading to microwave accelerated gas-solid catalytic reactions. Moreover, we do not deny the existence of hot-spot temperatures, but the catalytic active sites are usually atoms, free radicals, ions and surface defects, and the size of hot-spots are up to 901000μm.47 In other words, it is difficult to define a hot spot as an active center. Previously, our work of direct NO decomposition reaction and direct decomposition of H2S by microwave catalysis both confirmed that the dramatic accelerations under microwave irradiation was not simply ascribed to the hot-spots hypothesis.38a, 51 In fact, it is generally believed that microwave irradiation works on polar molecules.52 Microwave irradiation is beneficial to the desorption and adsorption of polar molecules.53 Whereas C3H8 is a non-polar molecule, that is, it cannot be activated by microwave. As shown in Figure2b, microwave catalysis did not break the equilibrium conversion of the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction in our catalytic system.
To further demonstrate the microwave direct catalytic effect, we calculated the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction. For kinetic experiment details, see the Supporting Information. The Arrhenius plot is described in FigureS1, and the apparent activation energy for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in Table4. Ea is approximately 59.58kJmol1 (59.582.8kJmol1) for CoSn/NC catalyst in the CRM. Surprisingly, the Ea of CoSn/NC in the MCRM is as low as 20.58kJmol1 (20.581.2kJmol1), which is much lower than the Ea of catalyst in the CRM. Similarly, Stiegman etal.54 also found that the apparent activation energy decreased from 118.4kJmol1 under conventional convective heating to 38.5kJmol1 under microwave irradiation for the carbon-carbon dioxide (Boudouard) reaction. The direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst in the MCRM can work effectively at such a low reaction temperature because of the low activation energy. Clearly, this indicates that CoSn/NC catalyst exhibits a microwave catalytic effect in the MCRM.
