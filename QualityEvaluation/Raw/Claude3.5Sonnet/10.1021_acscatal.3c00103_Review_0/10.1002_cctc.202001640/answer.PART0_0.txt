[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[5] "Herein, we report a new approach for the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 at low temperature by microwave catalysis over non-precious CoSn/NC microwave catalyst."

[6] "It is found that the microwave direct catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 over CoSn/NC microwave catalyst at low temperature (450C) is highly efficient. The C3H8 conversion is 15% and the C3H6 selectivity is 75% at 450C."

[7] "Furthermore, the microwave catalyst does not show visible change after tested for 180min."

[8] "Importantly, the apparent activation energy of CoSn/NC catalyst drop from 59.58kJ/mol in the conventional reaction mode to 20.98kJ/mol in microwave catalytic reaction mode, which suggests a significant microwave direct catalytic effect."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH provides a direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is more efficient than traditional by-production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking that yield insufficient amounts to meet demand.

2. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, helping to address the supply shortage created by steadily increasing demand across major markets.

3. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes:

a) Use of non-precious metal catalysts: The study reports a novel CoSn/NC microwave catalyst, which is non-precious and shows high efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

b) Microwave catalysis: This innovative approach allows for low-temperature operation (450°C), which helps mitigate issues of coke deposition and sintering that typically occur at higher temperatures in conventional PDH processes.

c) Enhanced stability: The microwave catalyst showed no visible change after 180 minutes of operation, indicating improved stability.

d) Lower activation energy: The apparent activation energy of the CoSn/NC catalyst dropped significantly from 59.58 kJ/mol in conventional mode to 20.98 kJ/mol in microwave catalytic mode, suggesting improved efficiency and potentially better recyclability.

e) Improved selectivity: The microwave catalytic approach achieved 75% propylene selectivity at 450°C, which is relatively high for PDH processes.

These innovative strategies demonstrate progress in addressing the key challenges of catalyst deactivation, stability, and recyclability in PDH processes, while also offering the potential for more energy-efficient propylene production to meet growing industrial demand.
