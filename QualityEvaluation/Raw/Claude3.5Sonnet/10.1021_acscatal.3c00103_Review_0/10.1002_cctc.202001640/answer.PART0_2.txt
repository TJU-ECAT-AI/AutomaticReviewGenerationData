[1] "Except for ethylene, propylene is the second most important petrochemical product. It is not only the raw material for the three major synthetic materials such as plastic, synthetic fiber and synthetic rubber, but also the main chemical feedstock for acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Especially in recent years, the demand for these building blocks has increased steadily, and all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production, which creates a situation where demand is in short supply."

[3] "A traditional process of producing propylene has been supplied by steam cracking and catalytic cracking. Nevertheless, in these two processes, propylene is obtained through by-production, the yield is too low to supply the huge demand."

[4] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium."

[5] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[6] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

[7] "Surprisingly, the incorporation of Sn into the Co/NC microwave catalyst gives a high selectivity (80%) to propylene at the whole process and the CoSn/NC microwave catalyst does not show any significant change after tested for 180min."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods in several ways:

1. PDH directly converts propane to propylene, offering a more targeted and potentially higher-yield approach compared to traditional steam cracking and catalytic cracking methods, which produce propylene as a by-product.

2. PDH allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources, particularly from shale gas, providing a new feedstock source for propylene production.

3. PDH can potentially operate at lower temperatures than traditional methods, reducing energy consumption and associated costs.

Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in PDH processes include:

1. Development of non-precious metal catalysts: Researchers are exploring alternatives to costly and scarce Cr and Pt-based catalysts, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst mentioned in the literature.

2. Incorporation of promoters: Adding elements like Sn to catalysts has shown to improve selectivity and stability, as demonstrated by the CoSn/NC catalyst which maintained high propylene selectivity (80%) and showed no significant change after 180 minutes of operation.

3. Utilization of microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM): This novel approach allows for PDH reactions to occur at lower temperatures, potentially reducing coking and improving catalyst longevity.

4. Design of mesoporous structures: Catalysts with high surface areas and well-dispersed active sites, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst, can enhance catalytic performance and stability.

5. Optimization of acid site distribution: By carefully controlling the strength and distribution of acid sites on the catalyst surface, researchers aim to minimize undesirable side reactions and improve selectivity to propylene.

These strategies collectively aim to address the main challenges in PDH processes, including catalyst deactivation, high energy requirements, and the need for improved selectivity and stability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过以下几种方式解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法限制的挑战：

1. PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解方法相比，提供了一种更有针对性和潜在更高产率的方法，后者将丙烯作为副产品生产。

2. PDH允许利用丰富的丙烷资源，特别是来自页岩气的丙烷，为丙烯生产提供了新的原料来源。

3. PDH可能在比传统方法更低的温度下运行，减少能源消耗和相关成本。

正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，以克服PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，包括：

1. 开发非贵金属催化剂：研究人员正在探索替代昂贵和稀缺的Cr和Pt基催化剂的方案，如文献中提到的CoSn/NC催化剂。

2. 添加助剂：向催化剂中添加如Sn等元素已被证明可以提高选择性和稳定性，如CoSn/NC催化剂展示的高丙烯选择性(80%)和在180分钟运行后没有显著变化。

3. 利用微波催化反应模式(MCRM)：这种新方法允许PDH反应在较低温度下进行，可能减少结焦并提高催化剂寿命。

4. 设计介孔结构：具有高表面积和良好分散活性位点的催化剂，如CoSn/NC催化剂，可以提高催化性能和稳定性。

5. 优化酸位分布：通过精心控制催化剂表面酸位的强度和分布，研究人员旨在最小化不良副反应并提高丙烯的选择性。

这些策略集体旨在解决PDH过程中的主要挑战，包括催化剂失活、高能耗要求，以及在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中提高选择性和稳定性的需求。
