[1] "Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012."

[2] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."

[3] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[4] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes."

[5] "This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method with high propene selectivity. PDH helps to close the gap between propene demand and production from traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These include:

1. Development of alternative catalysts based on ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient compared to commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts.

2. Regulating the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts through control of phase composition and crystallite size.

3. Investigating the effects of monoclinic vs. tetragonal ZrO2 phases and different crystallite sizes on catalyst performance.

4. Optimizing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus sites), which are believed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Studying the relationship between catalyst reducibility, ionic conductivity, and PDH activity to gain insights for tailored catalyst design.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity while addressing the drawbacks of traditional catalysts such as the high cost and chlorine treatment required for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, and the potential health effects associated with Cr(VI) in CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供具有高丙烯选择性的定向生产方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。PDH有助于弥合传统方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)所产生的丙烯需求与产量之间的差距。

为了克服PDH过程中的失活问题并提高稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些包括：

1. 开发基于ZrO2的替代催化剂，与商业CrOx和含Pt催化剂相比，这些催化剂更加环保和经济高效。

2. 通过控制相组成和晶粒尺寸来调节ZrO2催化剂的活性和选择性。

3. 研究单斜相与四方相ZrO2以及不同晶粒尺寸对催化剂性能的影响。

4. 优化配位不饱和锆阳离子(Zrcus位点)的浓度，这些位点被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

5. 研究催化剂还原性、离子导电性和PDH活性之间的关系，以获得定制催化剂设计的见解。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂的稳定性、活性和选择性，同时解决传统催化剂的缺点，如Pt/Al2O3催化剂所需的高成本和氯气处理，以及CrOx/Al2O3催化剂中Cr(VI)可能带来的健康影响。
