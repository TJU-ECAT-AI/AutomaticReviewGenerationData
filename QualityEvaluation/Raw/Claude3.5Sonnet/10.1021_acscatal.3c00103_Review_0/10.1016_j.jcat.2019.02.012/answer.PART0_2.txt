Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering on-purpose propylene production with high selectivity. This helps to close the gap between propylene demand and production from traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Alternative catalyst materials: Researchers are exploring ZrO2-based catalysts as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives to commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts.

2. Tuning catalyst properties: A new strategy focuses on regulating the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts through controlling phase composition (monoclinic vs tetragonal) and crystallite size.

3. Understanding structure-activity relationships: Studies aim to identify the kind of active sites and factors affecting their generation over different ZrO2 structures, providing insights for tailored catalyst design.

4. Optimizing crystallite size: Smaller crystallite sizes have been found to increase propene formation rates and selectivity for both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2.

5. Investigating phase effects: Monoclinic ZrO2 has shown higher activity and propene selectivity compared to tetragonal ZrO2, related to its ability to generate more active sites.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in PDH processes, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供高选择性的定向丙烯生产来解决工业丙烯需求增加的挑战。这有助于弥合传统方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)丙烯需求和生产之间的差距。

为了克服失活问题并提高催化剂性能,正在开发创新策略:

1. 替代催化剂材料:研究人员正在探索基于ZrO2的催化剂,作为商业CrOx和含Pt催化剂的环境友好和成本效益高的替代品。

2. 调整催化剂性能:一种新策略侧重于通过控制相组成(单斜vs四方)和晶粒尺寸来调节ZrO2催化剂的活性和选择性。

3. 了解结构-活性关系:研究旨在识别不同ZrO2结构上的活性位点类型和影响其生成的因素,为定制催化剂设计提供见解。

4. 优化晶粒尺寸:研究发现,对于单斜和四方ZrO2,较小的晶粒尺寸可以提高丙烯生成速率和选择性。

5. 研究相效应:单斜ZrO2显示出比四方ZrO2更高的活性和丙烯选择性,这与其生成更多活性位点的能力有关。

这些策略旨在增强催化剂稳定性,提高可回收性,克服PDH过程中的失活问题,最终实现更高效和可持续的丙烯生产。
