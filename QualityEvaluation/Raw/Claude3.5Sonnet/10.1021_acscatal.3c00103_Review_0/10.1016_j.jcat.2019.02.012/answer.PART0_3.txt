[1] "Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012."

[2] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively."

[3] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[4] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes."

[5] "This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a dedicated on-purpose production method with high propene selectivity. This helps to bridge the gap between propylene demand and production from traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, several innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Development of alternative catalysts: Researchers are exploring ZrO2-based catalysts as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives to traditional CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. These new catalysts show promising activity and selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane.

2. Tuning catalyst properties: A new strategy focuses on regulating the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 catalysts by controlling their phase composition (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size. This approach allows for fine-tuning of catalyst performance.

3. Understanding structure-activity relationships: Researchers are investigating the fundamental aspects of how catalyst structure affects performance, including the role of coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) as active sites and the impact of crystallite size on reducibility and conductivity.

4. Optimizing reaction conditions: Studies are being conducted to understand the effects of reaction temperature, feed composition, and contact time on product selectivity and coke formation.

5. Investigating coke formation mechanisms: Operando UV-vis spectroscopy is being used to study the formation of different types of coke species during the PDH reaction, providing insights for developing strategies to minimize coking.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, improve recyclability, and optimize overall process performance in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes, addressing the key challenges in industrial propylene production.
