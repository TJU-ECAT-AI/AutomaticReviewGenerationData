[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity."

[2] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[3] "The knowledge derived can be used for further optimizing PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts and also extended to other non-reducible metal oxides."

[4] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[5] "In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering a selective on-purpose production method. To overcome deactivation issues and improve catalyst performance, innovative strategies are being developed:

1. Development of alternative catalysts based on ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient compared to commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts.

2. Optimization of ZrO2-based catalysts by controlling crystal phase and crystallite size. Monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity and selectivity than tetragonal ZrO2.

3. Increasing the ratio of active Zrcus sites to coke-forming sites to enhance propene selectivity and reduce deactivation.

4. Focusing on non-oxidative PDH processes, which offer high propene selectivity.

5. Extending the knowledge gained from ZrO2 catalysts to other non-reducible metal oxides for further improvements in PDH catalyst design.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity while reducing deactivation issues in PDH processes. The approach of tailoring catalyst structure at the nanoscale level provides a promising direction for developing more efficient and durable PDH catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供一种选择性的定向生产方法来解决工业对丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。为了克服失活问题并提高催化剂性能，正在开发创新策略：

1. 开发基于ZrO2的替代催化剂，与商业CrOx和含Pt催化剂相比，这些催化剂环境友好且具有成本效益。

2. 通过控制晶体相和晶粒尺寸来优化基于ZrO2的催化剂。单斜相ZrO2表现出比四方相ZrO2更高的活性和选择性。

3. 增加活性Zrcus位点与生成积炭位点的比例，以提高丙烯选择性并减少失活。

4. 专注于非氧化PDH过程，该过程提供高丙烯选择性。

5. 将从ZrO2催化剂获得的知识扩展到其他不可还原金属氧化物，以进一步改进PDH催化剂设计。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂的稳定性、活性和选择性，同时减少PDH过程中的失活问题。在纳米尺度上调整催化剂结构的方法为开发更高效和更耐用的PDH催化剂提供了一个有前景的方向。
