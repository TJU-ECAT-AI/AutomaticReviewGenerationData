[7] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene by offering an on-purpose production method with high propene selectivity. This helps to close the gap between propene demand and production from traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in PDH processes, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed. These include:

1. Developing alternative catalysts based on ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient compared to commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts.

2. Creating coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) as active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. These can be formed by doping zirconia with metal oxides, high-temperature reductive treatment, or loading small amounts of metal nanoparticles like Ru and Rh.

3. Regulating the activity and selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size control. This strategy aims to optimize catalyst performance by tailoring its structural properties.

4. Investigating the effects of monoclinic vs. tetragonal ZrO2 phases and varying crystallite sizes on propene formation rates and selectivity.

These approaches focus on developing catalysts with improved activity, stability, and selectivity to address the limitations of current industrial PDH processes and meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供具有高丙烯选择性的定向生产方法来解决工业丙烯需求不断增加的挑战。这有助于缩小传统方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)产生的丙烯供需缺口。

为了克服失活问题并提高PDH过程的稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些包括：

1. 开发基于ZrO2的替代催化剂，与商业CrOx和含Pt催化剂相比，这些催化剂更环保和成本效益高。

2. 创建配位不饱和的锆阳离子(Zrcus)作为脱氢反应的活性位点。这些可以通过用金属氧化物掺杂氧化锆、高温还原处理或负载少量金属纳米粒子(如Ru和Rh)来形成。

3. 通过相组成和晶粒尺寸控制来调节ZrO2在PDH中的活性和选择性。这种策略旨在通过调整催化剂的结构特性来优化其性能。

4. 研究单斜相与四方相ZrO2以及不同晶粒尺寸对丙烯生成速率和选择性的影响。

这些方法着重于开发具有改进的活性、稳定性和选择性的催化剂，以解决当前工业PDH过程的局限性，并满足日益增长的丙烯需求。
