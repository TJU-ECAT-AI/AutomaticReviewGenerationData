[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been tested for CO2-ODHP. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but further increases lead to decline, possibly due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 likely generates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active in dehydrogenation.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may affect performance.

4. Support properties: The β-Ga2O3 support itself shows high dehydrogenation activity, and its interaction with chromium species is important.

5. Surface area: Higher Cr loadings may decrease surface area, negatively impacting catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading and support properties. At lower loadings, dispersed Cr3+ species form on the β-Ga2O3 surface. As loading increases, these species aggregate and may form larger chromium oxide clusters, potentially explaining the decline in performance at very high loadings.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物，已被用于CO2-ODHP反应测试。其中，铬和镓氧化物基材料由于其高脱氢活性和选择性而表现出良好的前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：随着Cr含量增加到6.8 wt%，丙烯产率逐渐提高，但进一步增加会导致性能下降，可能是由于表面积降低。

2. 表面物种：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物可能会生成高活性的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢反应中非常活跃。

3. 酸度：Cr沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这可能会影响性能。

4. 载体性质：β-Ga2O3载体本身具有高脱氢活性，其与铬物种的相互作用很重要。

5. 比表面积：较高的Cr负载量可能会降低比表面积，从而对催化性能产生负面影响。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在较低负载量时，分散的Cr3+物种在β-Ga2O3表面形成。随着负载量的增加，这些物种会聚集并可能形成更大的铬氧化物簇，这可能解释了在非常高的负载量下性能下降的原因。

Chromium and gallium oxides show promising activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but higher loadings cause a decline, likely due to decreased surface area.

2. Generation of active species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 creates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active for dehydrogenation.

3. Acidity: Chromium deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may impact performance.

4. Support properties: β-Ga2O3 was chosen as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

5. Synergistic effects: The combination of chromium and gallium oxides appears to enhance overall catalytic performance compared to individual oxides.

The evolution of chromium species depends on loading, with optimal performance around 6.8 wt% Cr. Support properties like surface area and acidity also influence the nature and distribution of active chromium sites.

铬和镓氧化物在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：增加铬负载量至6.8 wt%可逐渐提高丙烯产率，但更高的负载量会导致性能下降，可能是由于表面积减小。

2. 活性物种生成：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物会产生高活性的表面Cr3+物种，有利于脱氢反应。

3. 酸性：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这可能会影响性能。

4. 载体性质：选择β-Ga2O3作为载体是因为它具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

5. 协同效应：铬和镓氧化物的组合似乎比单独的氧化物具有更好的整体催化性能。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量，在约6.8 wt%铬时性能最佳。载体的性质，如表面积和酸性，也会影响活性铬位点的性质和分布。

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading, with optimal performance at moderate loadings (around 6.8 wt% in this study) balancing increased active sites with maintained surface area. The support (β-Ga2O3 in this case) plays a crucial role in dispersing the chromium species and contributing to the overall catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. As chromium content increases, more active Cr3+ species are formed on the β-Ga2O3 surface, enhancing catalytic performance. However, excessive loading may lead to a decrease in surface area and consequently, catalytic activity.

1. Chromium content: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 enhances dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition. 

2. Surface species: Chromium oxide deposition generates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acidity: Chromium deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which affects performance.

4. Temperature: CO2 enhances propene yield above 848 K and partially suppresses catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

5. Support properties: The study uses β-Ga2O3 as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by loading and support properties. As chromium content increases, there is a gradual increase in propene yield up to a certain point (6.8 wt% in this study), after which it declines. This suggests an optimal loading for chromium species on the β-Ga2O3 support.

2. 表面物种：氧化铬的沉积产生高度活跃的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢过程中起重要作用。

3. 酸性：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这影响了性能。

4. 温度：在848 K以上，CO2提高了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。

5. 载体性质：研究使用β-Ga2O3作为载体，因为它具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。随着铬含量的增加，丙烯产率逐渐增加，直到达到某个点（在本研究中为6.8 wt%），之后开始下降。这表明在β-Ga2O3载体上存在铬物种的最佳负载量。
