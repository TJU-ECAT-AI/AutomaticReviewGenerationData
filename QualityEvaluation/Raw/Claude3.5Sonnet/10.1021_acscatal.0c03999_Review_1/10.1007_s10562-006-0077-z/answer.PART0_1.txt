[1] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[2] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene."

[3] "With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption"

Chromium and gallium oxides show promising activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but higher loadings cause a decline, likely due to decreased surface area.

2. Generation of active species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 creates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active for dehydrogenation.

3. Acidity: Chromium deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may impact performance.

4. Support properties: β-Ga2O3 was chosen as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

5. Synergistic effects: The combination of chromium and gallium oxides appears to enhance overall catalytic performance compared to individual oxides.

The evolution of chromium species depends on loading, with optimal performance around 6.8 wt% Cr. Support properties like surface area and acidity also influence the nature and distribution of active chromium sites.

铬和镓氧化物在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：增加铬负载量至6.8 wt%可逐渐提高丙烯产率，但更高的负载量会导致性能下降，可能是由于表面积减小。

2. 活性物种生成：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物会产生高活性的表面Cr3+物种，有利于脱氢反应。

3. 酸性：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这可能会影响性能。

4. 载体性质：选择β-Ga2O3作为载体是因为它具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

5. 协同效应：铬和镓氧化物的组合似乎比单独的氧化物具有更好的整体催化性能。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量，在约6.8 wt%铬时性能最佳。载体的性质，如表面积和酸性，也会影响活性铬位点的性质和分布。
