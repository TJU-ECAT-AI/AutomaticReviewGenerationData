[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been tested for CO2-ODHP. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but further increases lead to decline, possibly due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 likely generates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active in dehydrogenation.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may affect performance.

4. Support properties: The β-Ga2O3 support itself shows high dehydrogenation activity, and its interaction with chromium species is important.

5. Surface area: Higher Cr loadings may decrease surface area, negatively impacting catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading and support properties. At lower loadings, dispersed Cr3+ species form on the β-Ga2O3 surface. As loading increases, these species aggregate and may form larger chromium oxide clusters, potentially explaining the decline in performance at very high loadings.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物，已被用于CO2-ODHP反应测试。其中，铬和镓氧化物基材料由于其高脱氢活性和选择性而表现出良好的前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：随着Cr含量增加到6.8 wt%，丙烯产率逐渐提高，但进一步增加会导致性能下降，可能是由于表面积降低。

2. 表面物种：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物可能会生成高活性的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢反应中非常活跃。

3. 酸度：Cr沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这可能会影响性能。

4. 载体性质：β-Ga2O3载体本身具有高脱氢活性，其与铬物种的相互作用很重要。

5. 比表面积：较高的Cr负载量可能会降低比表面积，从而对催化性能产生负面影响。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在较低负载量时，分散的Cr3+物种在β-Ga2O3表面形成。随着负载量的增加，这些物种会聚集并可能形成更大的铬氧化物簇，这可能解释了在非常高的负载量下性能下降的原因。
