[1] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition."

[3] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[4] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption"

The literature compares chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP, highlighting their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 enhances dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition. 

2. Surface species: Chromium oxide deposition generates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acidity: Chromium deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which affects performance.

4. Temperature: CO2 enhances propene yield above 848 K and partially suppresses catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

5. Support properties: The study uses β-Ga2O3 as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by loading and support properties. As chromium content increases, there is a gradual increase in propene yield up to a certain point (6.8 wt% in this study), after which it declines. This suggests an optimal loading for chromium species on the β-Ga2O3 support.

文献比较了铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，强调了它们的高脱氢活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：在β-Ga2O3上沉积氧化铬可以提高脱氢活性和抗积碳能力。

2. 表面物种：氧化铬的沉积产生高度活跃的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢过程中起重要作用。

3. 酸性：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这影响了性能。

4. 温度：在848 K以上，CO2提高了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。

5. 载体性质：研究使用β-Ga2O3作为载体，因为它具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。随着铬含量的增加，丙烯产率逐渐增加，直到达到某个点（在本研究中为6.8 wt%），之后开始下降。这表明在β-Ga2O3载体上存在铬物种的最佳负载量。
