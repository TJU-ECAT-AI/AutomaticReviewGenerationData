[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves the average yield of propene, but further increases lead to a decline, possibly due to reduced surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species, which are highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acid site strength: Chromium deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, as confirmed by IR studies of pyridine adsorption.

4. Support properties: The β polymorph of Ga2O3 was chosen as an active support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. As chromium content increases, more active Cr3+ species are formed on the β-Ga2O3 surface, enhancing catalytic performance. However, excessive loading may lead to a decrease in surface area and consequently, catalytic activity.

文献比较了各种用于CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物。其中，铬和镓氧化物基材料由于其高脱氢活性和选择性而显示出良好的效果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：铬含量增加到6.8 wt%时，丙烯的平均产率逐渐提高，但进一步增加会导致产率下降，可能是由于表面积减小。

2. 表面物种：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积氧化铬会产生高活性的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢过程中起重要作用。

3. 酸性位强度：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸性位的强度，这通过吡啶吸附的IR研究得到了证实。

4. 载体性质：选择β-Ga2O3多晶型作为活性载体，是因为其具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。随着铬含量的增加，在β-Ga2O3表面形成更多活性Cr3+物种，提高了催化性能。然而，过量负载可能导致表面积减小，从而降低催化活性。
