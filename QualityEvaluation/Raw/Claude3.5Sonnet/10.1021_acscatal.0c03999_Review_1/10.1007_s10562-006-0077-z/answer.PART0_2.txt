[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with chromium and gallium oxides showing promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. 

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually increases propene yield, then declines at higher loadings due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species that are highly active in dehydrogenation.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface.

4. Support properties: The β-Ga2O3 support itself shows high dehydrogenation activity.

5. Surface area: Higher surface area generally correlates with better catalytic performance up to a point.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading, with optimal performance at moderate loadings (around 6.8 wt% in this study) balancing increased active sites with maintained surface area. The support (β-Ga2O3 in this case) plays a crucial role in dispersing the chromium species and contributing to the overall catalytic activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物，已被用于CO2-ODHP反应测试，其中铬和镓氧化物由于其高脱氢活性和选择性而表现出良好的前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：增加铬含量至6.8 wt%时，丙烯产率逐渐增加，但在更高含量时由于表面积降低而下降。

2. 表面物种：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积氧化铬会产生高活性的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢过程中非常活跃。

3. 酸度：铬的沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度。

4. 载体性质：β-Ga2O3载体本身表现出高脱氢活性。

5. 表面积：在一定程度上，较高的表面积通常与更好的催化性能相关。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量，在适度负载量（本研究中约为6.8 wt%）时性能最佳，这平衡了增加的活性位点和保持的表面积。载体（在本例中为β-Ga2O3）在分散铬物种和贡献整体催化活性方面起着关键作用。
