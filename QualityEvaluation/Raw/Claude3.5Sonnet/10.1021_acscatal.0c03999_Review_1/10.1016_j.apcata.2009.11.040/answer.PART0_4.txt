[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable for CO2-ODHP among various metal oxide catalysts. 

For gallium oxide catalysts, CO2 helps suppress deactivation by coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide catalysts show a different mechanism, where CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium catalysts include:
1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of support

These factors affect the concentration of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+) which are crucial for the redox mechanism.

For SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is as follows:
- At low Cr loadings: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate, with high Cr dispersion
- At higher Cr loadings: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 also form, with lower dispersion

This evolution of chromium species significantly influences the catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

在各种金属氧化物催化剂中，铬和镓氧化物基催化剂被报道为CO2-ODHP过程中最活跃、最选择性和最稳定的催化剂。

对于镓氧化物催化剂，CO2有助于抑制因焦炭形成导致的失活，并通过去除脱氢反应中产生的H2来提高丙烯产率。

铬氧化物催化剂表现出不同的机制，其中CO2作为氧化剂参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。

影响铬催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：
1. 铬负载量
2. 制备条件
3. 铬的前驱体化合物
4. 载体的性质

这些因素影响着对氧化还原机制至关重要的氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+）的浓度。

对于SiO2负载的铬氧化物催化剂，随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变如下：
- 在低铬负载量时：氧化还原铬物种（主要是以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+）占主导，铬分散度高
- 在较高铬负载量时：非氧化还原的聚合Cr3+物种和结晶Cr2O3也形成，分散度较低

铬物种的这种演变显著影响了CO2-ODHP过程中的催化性能。
