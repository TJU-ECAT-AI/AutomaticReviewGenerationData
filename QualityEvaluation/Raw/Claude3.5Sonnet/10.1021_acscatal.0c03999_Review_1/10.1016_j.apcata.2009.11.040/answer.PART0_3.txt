[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable for CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance differ:

For gallium oxide catalysts, CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation. 

For chromium oxide catalysts, CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Their performance depends on redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature.

In SiO2-supported chromium catalysts, redox Cr6+ species (chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings with high dispersion. At higher loadings and lower dispersion, non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 also form.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is thus primarily determined by the chromium loading and the degree of dispersion on the support. Higher loadings and lower dispersion lead to the formation of less active Cr3+ species and Cr2O3 crystals, while lower loadings and higher dispersion favor the formation of more active Cr6+ species.

据报道，铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。影响它们催化性能的关键因素有所不同：

对于镓氧化物催化剂，CO2抑制了积碳的形成，并通过去除脱氢反应中产生的H2来提高丙烯的产率。

对于铬氧化物催化剂，CO2在氧化脱氢过程中充当氧化剂。它们的性能取决于氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+），这些物种的浓度受铬负载量、制备条件、铬前体和支撑体性质的影响。

在SiO2负载的铬催化剂中，当铬负载量低且分散度高时，以氧化还原Cr6+物种（铬酸盐或多铬酸盐）为主。当负载量较高且分散度较低时，也会形成非氧化还原的聚合Cr3+物种和晶态Cr2O3。

因此，负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变主要由铬负载量和在支撑体上的分散程度决定。较高的负载量和较低的分散度导致形成活性较低的Cr3+物种和Cr2O3晶体，而较低的负载量和较高的分散度有利于形成活性较高的Cr6+物种。
