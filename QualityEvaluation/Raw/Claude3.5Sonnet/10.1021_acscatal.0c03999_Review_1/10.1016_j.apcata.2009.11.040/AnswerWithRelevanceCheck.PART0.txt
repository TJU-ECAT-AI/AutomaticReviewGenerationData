          [1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

          Among various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable. However, they operate through different mechanisms:

Gallium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 acts as an oxidant, promoting propene yield through its oxidative abilities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium catalysts include:
1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of support

These factors affect the concentration and distribution of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+), which are crucial for the catalytic mechanism.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts varies with loading and support properties:

- At low Cr loadings with high dispersion: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate
- At higher Cr loadings with low dispersion: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present

This evolution of chromium species significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. To achieve higher activity in chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP, high dispersion of chromium oxide species at high Cr loadings is desirable.

          在各种用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）的金属氧化物催化剂中，铬和镓氧化物基催化剂被报道为最活跃、最选择性和最稳定的。然而，它们通过不同的机制运作：

镓氧化物基催化剂：CO2抑制积碳形成，并通过去除脱氢过程中产生的H2来提高丙烯产率。

铬氧化物基催化剂：CO2作为氧化剂，通过其氧化能力在丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢过程中促进丙烯产率。

影响铬催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：
1. 铬负载量
2. 制备条件
3. 铬前驱体化合物
4. 载体的性质

这些因素影响了氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+）的浓度和分布，这些物种对催化机制至关重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变随负载量和载体性质而变化：

- 在低铬负载量和高分散度时：以氧化还原型铬物种（主要是Cr6+，以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式存在）为主
- 在高铬负载量和低分散度时：也存在非氧化还原型Cr3+聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3

铬物种的这种演变对催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性产生重大影响。为了在CO2-ODHP中获得更高活性的铬氧化物基催化剂，应在高铬负载条件下实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散。
