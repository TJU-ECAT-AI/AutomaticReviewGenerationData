[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). However, they operate through different mechanisms:

Gallium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 acts as an oxidant, promoting propene yield through its oxidative abilities.

For chromium oxide catalysts, the key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of the support

These factors affect the concentration and distribution of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+), which are crucial for the catalytic mechanism.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts varies with loading:

- At low Cr loadings: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate, with high Cr dispersion.
- At higher Cr loadings: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 also form, with lower dispersion.

This evolution of chromium species significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP.

据报道，铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，它们通过不同的机制运作：

镓氧化物基催化剂：CO2抑制积碳形成，并通过去除脱氢过程中产生的H2来提高丙烯产率。

铬氧化物基催化剂：CO2作为氧化剂，通过其氧化能力促进丙烯产率。

对于铬氧化物催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量
2. 制备条件
3. 铬前驱体化合物
4. 载体的性质

这些因素影响了氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+）的浓度和分布，这些物种对催化机制至关重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变随负载量而变化：

- 低铬负载量：氧化还原铬物种（主要是以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+）占主导地位，具有高度分散性。
- 高铬负载量：非氧化还原多聚Cr3+物种和结晶Cr2O3也会形成，分散度较低。

铬物种的这种演变对催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性产生重大影响。
