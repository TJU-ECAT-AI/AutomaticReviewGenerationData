[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), focusing on chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts as the most active, selective, and stable. 

For gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation. 

Chromium oxide-based catalysts benefit from CO2's oxidative abilities, with CO2 acting as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of support

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts varies with loading and support properties:

- At low Cr loadings with high dispersion: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate
- At higher Cr loadings with low dispersion: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present

The presence of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) is crucial for the proposed redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts.

文献比较了各种用于CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）的金属氧化物催化剂，重点关注铬和镓氧化物基催化剂，认为它们是最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的。

对于镓氧化物基催化剂，CO2抑制了积碳形成，并通过去除脱氢反应中产生的H2来提高丙烯产率。

铬氧化物基催化剂则受益于CO2的氧化能力，CO2在氧化脱氢过程中充当氧化剂。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的负载量
2. 制备条件
3. 铬的前驱体化合物
4. 载体的性质

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变随负载量和载体性质而变化：

- 在低铬负载量和高分散度时：以氧化还原型铬物种（主要是Cr6+，以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式存在）为主
- 在高铬负载量和低分散度时：也存在非氧化还原型Cr3+聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3

氧化还原型铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的存在对铬氧化物基催化剂的提议氧化还原机制至关重要。
