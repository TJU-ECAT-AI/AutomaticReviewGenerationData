          [1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

[5] "Yields in both C3H6 and total olefins (just + 3-5%) exhibited a similar trend by increasing the Cr loading, indicating that basic and side reactions were affected in a similar way by this parameter."

[6] "It is noteworthy that in the case of 2.0-Cr/DHS YC3H6 of ca. 47% was attained using CO2 as oxidant, which is significantly higher than the performance of the best catalyst reviewed by Cavani et al.."

[7] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

[8] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."

          The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing various loadings (0.25-2.0 wt% Cr) prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Key findings include:

1. Catalyst properties: High surface area (600-1000 m2/g) porous systems were achieved. The only chromium species detected were surface chromates, with the amount of Cr sites linearly proportional to Cr loading.

2. Catalytic performance: The catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900-1000 minutes of testing. Propene yields as high as 40-47% were achieved, particularly with CO2 as the oxidant.

3. Influence of oxidants: Different oxidants (CO2, O2, CO2+O2) affected the chromium oxidation state. With CO2 as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of Cr sites was as low as +2, while with O2 (alone or mixed with CO2), it was around +3.

4. Structure-performance relationship: The oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) was correlated with propene selectivity. The difference in oxidation state depending on the oxidant used might contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4.

5. Effect of Cr loading: Increasing Cr content generally led to increased yields of C3H6 and total olefins, with both showing similar trends.

These Cr/SiO2 catalysts demonstrated promising performance for CO2-ODHP, with high stability and good propene yields. The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the Cr loading, the nature of the oxidant, and the resulting oxidation state of the Cr species during the reaction.

          这项研究主要关注了Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用，比较了通过直接水热合成法制备的不同铬负载量（0.25-2.0 wt%）的催化剂。主要发现包括：

1. 催化剂性质：获得了高比表面积（600-1000 m2/g）的多孔系统。检测到的唯一铬物种是表面铬酸盐，Cr位点数量与Cr负载量呈线性关系。

2. 催化性能：催化剂在长达900-1000分钟的测试中表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性。特别是使用CO2作为氧化剂时，丙烯产率高达40-47%。

3. 氧化剂的影响：不同的氧化剂（CO2、O2、CO2+O2）影响铬的氧化态。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，Cr位点的平均氧化态低至+2，而使用O2（单独或与CO2混合）时，氧化态约为+3。

4. 结构-性能关系：反应过程中Cr物种的氧化态（Cr2+/Cr3+）与丙烯选择性相关。根据所使用的氧化剂不同，氧化态的差异可能导致C3H6和C2H4选择性和产率的差异。

5. Cr负载量的影响：增加Cr含量通常导致C3H6和总烯烃产率增加，两者呈现相似的趋势。

这些Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出令人鼓舞的性能，具有高稳定性和良好的丙烯产率。影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是Cr负载量、氧化剂的性质以及反应过程中Cr物种的氧化态。
