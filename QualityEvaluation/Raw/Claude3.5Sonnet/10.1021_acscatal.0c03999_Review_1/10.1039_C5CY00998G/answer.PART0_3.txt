[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."

[3] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."

[4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[6] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing their performance with different Cr loadings and oxidants. Key findings include:

1. Cr/SiO2 catalysts with 0.25-2.0 wt% Cr loading were prepared using direct hydrothermal synthesis, resulting in high surface area (600-1000 m2g-1) porous systems.

2. Higher Cr content decreased mesopore regularity but did not limit catalytic performance.

3. Surface chromates were the only Cr species detected, accompanied by Brnsted acid centers.

4. All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation, with propene yields up to 40% after 900 minutes of testing.

5. The oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) correlated with propene selectivity, depending on the oxidant used.

6. When CO2 was used as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of Cr sites was as low as +2, while it was +3 when O2 was present.

7. The difference in Cr oxidation state likely contributes to variations in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4, depending on the oxidant used.

These findings highlight the importance of Cr loading, support properties, and oxidant choice in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP. The evolution of Cr species, particularly their oxidation state, plays a crucial role in selectivity and yield of desired products.

该研究聚焦于Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现，比较了不同Cr负载量和氧化剂的影响。主要发现包括：

1. 使用直接水热合成法制备了Cr含量为0.25-2.0 wt%的Cr/SiO2催化剂，得到了高比表面积（600-1000 m2g-1）的多孔系统。

2. 较高的Cr含量降低了介孔的规则性，但并未限制催化性能。

3. 只检测到表面铬酸盐物种，伴随有布朗斯特酸中心。

4. 所有催化剂在900分钟测试后仍表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，丙烯产率高达40%。

5. 反应过程中Cr物种的氧化态（Cr2+/Cr3+）与丙烯选择性相关，取决于所使用的氧化剂。

6. 当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，Cr位点的平均氧化态低至+2，而在存在O2时为+3。

7. Cr氧化态的差异可能导致C3H6和C2H4选择性和产率的变化，这取决于所使用的氧化剂。

这些发现强调了Cr负载量、载体性质和氧化剂选择对Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的重要性。Cr物种的演变，特别是其氧化态，在目标产物的选择性和产率方面起着至关重要的作用。
