[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing their performance to other reported catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high stability and propene yields up to 40%, even after 900 minutes of testing.

2. The catalysts' performance was influenced by Cr loading (0.25-2.0 wt%) and surface area (600-1000 m2g-1).

3. Different oxidants (CO2 vs. O2) affected the chromium oxidation state during the reaction, which correlated with propene selectivity.

4. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the average Cr oxidation state was +2, while with O2 (alone or mixed with CO2), it was +3.

5. The difference in Cr oxidation state likely contributes to variations in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4, depending on the oxidizing agent used.

These findings highlight the importance of Cr oxidation state and oxidant choice in determining catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

这项研究主要关注Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，并与其他报道的催化剂进行了比较。主要发现包括：

1. 通过直接水热合成制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂表现出高稳定性，即使在测试900分钟后，丙烯产率仍可达40%。

2. 催化剂的性能受Cr负载量（0.25-2.0 wt%）和比表面积（600-1000 m2g-1）的影响。

3. 不同的氧化剂（CO2 vs. O2）影响反应过程中铬的氧化态，这与丙烯选择性相关。

4. 使用CO2作为氧化剂时，铬的平均氧化态为+2，而使用O2（单独或与CO2混合）时为+3。

5. 铬氧化态的差异可能是导致C3H6和C2H4选择性和产率变化的原因，这取决于所使用的氧化剂。

这些发现强调了铬氧化态和氧化剂选择对CO2-ODHP反应中催化剂性能的重要性。
