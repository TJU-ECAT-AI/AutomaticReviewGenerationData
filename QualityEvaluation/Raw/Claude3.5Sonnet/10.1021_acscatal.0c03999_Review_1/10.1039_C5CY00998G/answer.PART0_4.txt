[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."

[5] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."

[6] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing different Cr loadings (0.25-2.0 wt%) and oxidants (CO2, O2, CO2+O2). Key findings include:

1. Catalyst preparation and structure: Direct hydrothermal synthesis produced high surface area (600-1000 m2/g) catalysts with mesoporous structure. Higher Cr content decreased mesopore regularity but did not limit catalytic performance.

2. Chromium species: Surface chromates were the only Cr species detected, accompanied by Brnsted acid centers. The amount of Cr sites increased linearly with Cr loading.

3. Catalytic performance: All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900 minutes. Propene yields up to 40% were achieved, particularly when using CO2 as the sole oxidant.

4. Oxidation state of Cr: The oxidant used influenced the Cr oxidation state during reaction. With CO2, Cr2+ was predominant, while with O2 or CO2+O2, Cr3+ was more prevalent.

5. Selectivity correlation: The oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction is suggested to correlate with propene selectivity.

The study demonstrates that Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis are promising for CO2-ODHP, with high activity, selectivity, and stability. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in determining the Cr oxidation state and, consequently, the catalyst's selectivity towards propene.

该研究主要关注Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用，比较了不同Cr负载量（0.25-2.0 wt%）和氧化剂（CO2、O2、CO2+O2）的影响。主要发现包括：

1. 催化剂制备和结构：直接水热合成法制备的催化剂具有高比表面积（600-1000 m2/g）和介孔结构。随着Cr含量增加，介孔的规则性降低，但并未限制催化性能。

2. 铬物种：只检测到表面铬酸盐物种，伴随有布朗斯特酸中心。Cr位点数量与Cr负载量呈线性增长。

3. 催化性能：所有催化剂在900分钟内都表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性。特别是使用CO2作为唯一氧化剂时，丙烯产率高达40%。

4. Cr的氧化态：使用的氧化剂影响反应过程中Cr的氧化态。使用CO2时，Cr2+占主导；而使用O2或CO2+O2时，Cr3+更为普遍。

5. 选择性相关性：反应过程中Cr物种的氧化态（Cr2+/Cr3+）被认为与丙烯选择性相关。

研究表明，通过直接水热合成制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中具有很大潜力，表现出高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。氧化剂的选择在决定Cr氧化态和催化剂对丙烯的选择性方面起着关键作用。
