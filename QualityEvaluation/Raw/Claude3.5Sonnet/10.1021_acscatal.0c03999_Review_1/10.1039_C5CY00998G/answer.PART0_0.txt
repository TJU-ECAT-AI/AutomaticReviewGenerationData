[1] "Yields in both C3H6 and total olefins (just + 3-5%) exhibited a similar trend by increasing the Cr loading, indicating that basic and side reactions were affected in a similar way by this parameter."

[2] "It is noteworthy that in the case of 2.0-Cr/DHS YC3H6 of ca. 47% was attained using CO2 as oxidant, which is significantly higher than the performance of the best catalyst reviewed by Cavani et al.."

[3] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

[5] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, showing they can achieve high activity and selectivity. Key factors influencing performance include:

1. Cr loading: Higher Cr content generally led to increased yields of C3H6 and total olefins.

2. Oxidant type: CO2 as oxidant resulted in higher propene yields compared to O2 or CO2+O2 mixtures. The 2.0-Cr/DHS catalyst achieved an initial C3H6 yield of 47% with CO2, maintaining 40% after 1000 minutes.

3. Chromium oxidation state: With CO2 as oxidant, Cr sites were in the +2 oxidation state on average, while with O2 present, they were in the +3 state. This difference likely contributes to variations in selectivity.

4. Chromium dispersion: All catalysts had highly dispersed surface chromate species, with the amount of Cr sites linearly proportional to Cr loading.

5. Support properties: While high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure were achieved, they did not appear crucial for high catalytic activity.

The Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed excellent stability and performance, achieving propene yields among the highest reported in literature for CO2-ODHP.

这项研究主要关注Cr/SiO2催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，表明它们可以实现高活性和选择性。影响性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：更高的Cr含量通常导致C3H6和总烯烃产率增加。

2. 氧化剂类型：与O2或CO2+O2混合物相比，使用CO2作为氧化剂可获得更高的丙烯产率。2.0-Cr/DHS催化剂使用CO2时初始C3H6产率达47%，反应1000分钟后仍保持40%。

3. 铬的氧化态：使用CO2作为氧化剂时，Cr位点平均氧化态为+2，而存在O2时为+3。这种差异可能导致选择性的变化。

4. 铬的分散度：所有催化剂都具有高度分散的表面铬酸盐物种，Cr位点数量与Cr负载量呈线性关系。

5. 载体性质：虽然实现了高比表面积和有序介孔结构，但这些特性似乎并非高催化活性的必要条件。

通过直接水热合成制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂表现出优异的稳定性和性能，在CO2-ODHP反应中实现了文献报道的最高丙烯产率之一。
