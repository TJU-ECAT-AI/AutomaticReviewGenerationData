[1] "Yields in both C3H6 and total olefins (just + 3-5%) exhibited a similar trend by increasing the Cr loading, indicating that basic and side reactions were affected in a similar way by this parameter."

[2] "It is noteworthy that in the case of 2.0-Cr/DHS YC3H6 of ca. 47% was attained using CO2 as oxidant, which is significantly higher than the performance of the best catalyst reviewed by Cavani et al.."

[3] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

[5] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, showing they can achieve high activity and selectivity. Key factors influencing performance include:

1. Cr loading: Higher Cr content generally led to increased yields of C3H6 and total olefins.

2. Oxidant type: CO2 as oxidant resulted in higher propene yields compared to O2 or CO2+O2 mixtures. The 2.0-Cr/DHS catalyst achieved an initial C3H6 yield of 47% with CO2, maintaining 40% after 1000 minutes.

3. Chromium oxidation state: With CO2 as oxidant, Cr sites were in the +2 oxidation state on average, while with O2 present, they were in the +3 state. This difference likely contributes to variations in selectivity.

4. Chromium dispersion: All catalysts had highly dispersed surface chromate species, with the amount of Cr sites linearly proportional to Cr loading.

5. Support properties: While high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure were achieved, they did not appear crucial for high catalytic activity.

The Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed excellent stability and performance, achieving propene yields among the highest reported in literature for CO2-ODHP.

这项研究主要关注Cr/SiO2催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，表明它们可以实现高活性和选择性。影响性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：更高的Cr含量通常导致C3H6和总烯烃产率增加。

2. 氧化剂类型：与O2或CO2+O2混合物相比，使用CO2作为氧化剂可获得更高的丙烯产率。2.0-Cr/DHS催化剂使用CO2时初始C3H6产率达47%，反应1000分钟后仍保持40%。

3. 铬的氧化态：使用CO2作为氧化剂时，Cr位点平均氧化态为+2，而存在O2时为+3。这种差异可能导致选择性的变化。

4. 铬的分散度：所有催化剂都具有高度分散的表面铬酸盐物种，Cr位点数量与Cr负载量呈线性关系。

5. 载体性质：虽然实现了高比表面积和有序介孔结构，但这些特性似乎并非高催化活性的必要条件。

通过直接水热合成制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂表现出优异的稳定性和性能，在CO2-ODHP反应中实现了文献报道的最高丙烯产率之一。

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."

[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[4] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[5] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing various loadings (0.25-2.0 wt% Cr) prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Key findings include:

1. Catalyst properties: High surface area (600-1000 m2/g) porous systems were achieved. The only chromium species detected were surface chromates, accompanied by Brnsted acid centers.

2. Catalytic performance: The catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900 minutes of testing. Propene yields as high as 40% were achieved.

3. Influence of oxidants: Different oxidants (CO2, O2, CO2+O2) affected the chromium oxidation state. With CO2 as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of Cr sites was as low as +2, while with O2 (alone or mixed with CO2), it was around +3.

4. Structure-performance relationship: The oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) was correlated with propene selectivity. The difference in oxidation state depending on the oxidant used might contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4.

5. Chromium evolution: The study suggests that the evolution of chromium species is influenced by both the loading and the oxidant used in the reaction. This evolution plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

While the study doesn't directly compare Cr/SiO2 to other metal oxide catalysts, it demonstrates that these Cr-based catalysts show promising performance for CO2-ODHP, with high stability and good propene yields. The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the Cr loading, the nature of the oxidant, and the resulting oxidation state of the Cr species during the reaction.

1. Catalyst preparation and structure: Direct hydrothermal synthesis produced high surface area (600-1000 m2/g) catalysts with mesoporous structure. Higher Cr content decreased mesopore regularity but did not limit catalytic performance.

2. Chromium species: Surface chromates were the only Cr species detected, accompanied by Brnsted acid centers. The amount of Cr sites increased linearly with Cr loading.

3. Catalytic performance: All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900 minutes. Propene yields up to 40% were achieved, particularly when using CO2 as the sole oxidant.

4. Oxidation state of Cr: The oxidant used influenced the Cr oxidation state during reaction. With CO2, Cr2+ was predominant, while with O2 or CO2+O2, Cr3+ was more prevalent.

5. Selectivity correlation: The oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction is suggested to correlate with propene selectivity.

The study demonstrates that Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis are promising for CO2-ODHP, with high activity, selectivity, and stability. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in determining the Cr oxidation state and, consequently, the catalyst's selectivity towards propene.
