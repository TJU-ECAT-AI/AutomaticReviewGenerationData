[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[3] "The color of the calcined catalysts studied in the present paper changed from bright yellow over pale yellow to dark green with the Cr loading increasing from 0.7 to 13.7 wt%."

[4] "The presence of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species differently interacting with the silica support [3,21]. On the contrary, the TPR profiles of the catalysts with the higher Cr loadings show only one reduction maximum in the temperature range of 590690 K."

[5] "Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases. Several studies have revealed that the Cr6+ species generate the dehydrogenation activity [18]."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, highlighting supported chromium oxide-based materials as the most promising due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

2. Oxidation state: Cr6+ species generate dehydrogenation activity, which are then reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species under reaction conditions.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of chromium species on the support leads to better catalytic performance.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects the interaction with chromium species and their reducibility.

5. Catalyst preparation method: Impacts the distribution and oxidation state of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is observed through color changes, from bright yellow (low loading, predominantly Cr6+) to dark green (high loading, mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+). H2-TPR studies show that the number of Cr6+ species increases up to 6.8 wt% Cr, correlating with increased catalytic activity. At higher loadings, the formation of less active crystalline Cr2O3 leads to decreased performance.

文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能，突出了负载型铬氧化物基材料由于其高催化活性而最具前景。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：在低负载时，具有配位空位的单核Cr3+物种活性很高。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3。

2. 氧化态：Cr6+物种产生脱氢活性，在反应条件下被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+物种。

3. 分散度：铬物种在载体上的分散度越高，催化性能越好。

4. 载体性质：载体的性质影响与铬物种的相互作用及其可还原性。

5. 催化剂制备方法：影响铬物种的分布和氧化态。

铬物种随负载量的演变可通过颜色变化观察到，从亮黄色（低负载，主要为Cr6+）到深绿色（高负载，Cr3+和Cr6+的混合物）。H2-TPR研究表明，Cr6+物种的数量随铬含量增加到6.8 wt%，与催化活性的增加相关。在更高的负载量下，形成活性较低的结晶Cr2O3导致性能下降。
