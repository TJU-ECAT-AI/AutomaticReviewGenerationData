[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."

[5] "On the surface of the calcined silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts the Cr6+ species have been detected for all the Cr-containing samples. However, at low loadings (below saturation coverage) the Cr6+ species were found to be dominant, whereas above the saturation coverage a-Cr2O3 was formed."

[6] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

Supported chromium oxide catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity. 

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are dominant and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low loadings. Under reaction conditions, these reduce to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are considered the active sites for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state. Silica supports like MCM-41 facilitate the formation and stabilization of dispersed Cr species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At higher loadings, crystalline α-Cr2O3 forms, which is less active than dispersed species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading involves a transition from highly dispersed, predominantly Cr6+ species at low loadings to a mixture of Cr6+, Cr3+, and crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP.

由于具有高催化活性，负载型氧化铬催化剂被认为是CO2-ODHP反应中最有前景的催化剂。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：通常更高的分散度会带来更好的催化活性。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，具有配位空位的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位并具有高活性。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和晶态Cr2O3。

3. 氧化态：最初，催化剂表面存在Cr6+物种，尤其是在低负载量时。在反应条件下，这些物种还原为Cr3+/Cr2+物种，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

4. 载体性质：载体的性质影响铬的分散度和氧化态。像MCM-41这样的硅载体有利于分散铬物种的形成和稳定。

5. 晶相形成：在较高负载量时，形成晶态α-Cr2O3，其活性低于分散态物种。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变涉及从低负载量时高度分散的主要为Cr6+物种，到高负载量时Cr6+、Cr3+和晶态Cr2O3混合物的转变。这种演变显著影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
