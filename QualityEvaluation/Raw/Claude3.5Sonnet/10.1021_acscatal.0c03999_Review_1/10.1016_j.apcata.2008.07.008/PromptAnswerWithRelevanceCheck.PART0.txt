[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The UVvis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are prevalent and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low Cr content. These Cr6+ species increase with Cr loading up to 6.8 wt%, correlating with increased catalytic activity. However, under reaction conditions, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are believed to be the catalytically active species for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state stability, influencing overall catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. At low loadings, highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ species dominate, while higher loadings lead to the formation of polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing different chromium oxidation states and influencing their reducibility, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

由于具有高催化活性，负载型铬氧化物催化剂被认为是CO2-ODHP反应中最有前景的催化剂。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：更高的分散度通常会导致更好的催化活性。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，具有配位空位的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位并具有高活性。随着负载量的增加，会形成活性较低的聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3。

3. 氧化态：最初，催化剂表面存在Cr6+物种，尤其是在低铬含量时。这些Cr6+物种随着铬负载量的增加而增加，最高可达6.8 wt%，与催化活性的增加相关。然而，在反应条件下，Cr6+物种被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+物种，这些被认为是脱氢反应的活性物种。

4. 载体性质：载体的性质影响铬的分散度和氧化态稳定性，从而影响整体催化性能。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，高度分散的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位，而高负载量会导致聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3的形成。载体在稳定不同铬氧化态和影响其可还原性方面起着关键作用，这反过来又影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。

However, at low loadings (below saturation coverage) the Cr6+ species were found to be dominant, whereas above the saturation coverage a-Cr2O3 was formed."

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are dominant and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low loadings. Under reaction conditions, these reduce to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are considered the active sites for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state. Silica supports like MCM-41 facilitate the formation and stabilization of dispersed Cr species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At higher loadings, crystalline α-Cr2O3 forms, which is less active than dispersed species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading involves a transition from highly dispersed, predominantly Cr6+ species at low loadings to a mixture of Cr6+, Cr3+, and crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP.

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, highlighting supported chromium oxide-based materials as the most promising due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

2. Oxidation state: Cr6+ species generate dehydrogenation activity, which are then reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species under reaction conditions.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of chromium species on the support leads to better catalytic performance.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects the interaction with chromium species and their reducibility.

5. Catalyst preparation method: Impacts the distribution and oxidation state of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is observed through color changes, from bright yellow (low loading, predominantly Cr6+) to dark green (high loading, mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+). H2-TPR studies show that the number of Cr6+ species increases up to 6.8 wt% Cr, correlating with increased catalytic activity. At higher loadings, the formation of less active crystalline Cr2O3 leads to decreased performance.

Supported chromium oxide catalysts are among the most active for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to higher activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, highly active mononuclear Cr3+ species predominate. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Oxidation state: Cr6+ species are present after calcination, especially at low loadings. These reduce to catalytically active Cr3+/Cr2+ species under reaction conditions.

4. Support properties: Supports that facilitate electron transfer can promote formation of active Cr2+ species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading follows this general pattern:
- Low loading: Dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species
- Increasing loading: Formation of polymeric species 
- High loading: Crystalline Cr2O3 formation

The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, which balances high dispersion with sufficient active sites. Support properties that promote dispersion and facilitate redox behavior of chromium species are beneficial for catalytic performance.

负载的氧化铬催化剂是CO2-ODHP（用CO2氧化脱氢丙烷）中最活跃的催化剂之一。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：一般来说，分散度越高，活性越高。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，高活性的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3。

3. 氧化态：焙烧后存在Cr6+物种，特别是在低负载量时。这些物种在反应条件下还原为具有催化活性的Cr3+/Cr2+物种。

4. 载体性质：能促进电子转移的载体可以促进活性Cr2+物种的形成。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变通常遵循以下模式：
- 低负载量：分散的单核Cr3+和Cr6+物种
- 负载量增加：形成聚合物种
- 高负载量：形成结晶Cr2O3

最佳负载量似乎在6.8 wt% Cr左右，这在高分散度和足够的活性位点之间取得了平衡。能促进铬物种分散和促进其氧化还原行为的载体性质有利于提高催化性能。
