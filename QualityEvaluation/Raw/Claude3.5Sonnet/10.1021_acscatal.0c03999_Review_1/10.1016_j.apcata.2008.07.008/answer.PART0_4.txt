[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."

[5] "On the contrary, the TPR profiles of the catalysts with the higher Cr loadings show only one reduction maximum in the temperature range of 590690 K. An increase in the Cr content above 3.4 wt% of Cr results in an appearance of additional low-temperature reduction maximum at about 553 K."

[6] "The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants conversion."

Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are predominant and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state.

4. Chromium oxidation state: Cr6+ species are precursors to the catalytically active Cr3+/Cr2+ species.

5. Reaction temperature: Higher temperatures generally increase conversion but may reduce selectivity.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading:

- Low loadings: Highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ species
- Intermediate loadings: Mix of mononuclear and polymeric species
- High loadings: Formation of crystalline Cr2O3

The optimal chromium loading appears to be around 6.8 wt%, beyond which catalytic activity decreases due to the formation of less active crystalline Cr2O3 and possible pore blocking.

由于其高催化活性，负载的氧化铬基催化剂被认为是CO2-ODHP最有前景的催化剂。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：更高的分散度通常会导致更好的催化活性。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，单核Cr3+物种与配位空位占主导地位且活性很高。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和晶态Cr2O3。

3. 载体特性：载体的性质影响铬的分散度和氧化态。

4. 铬的氧化态：Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr3+/Cr2+物种的前体。

5. 反应温度：较高的温度通常会增加转化率，但可能会降低选择性。

铬物种随负载量的演变：

- 低负载量：高度分散的单核Cr3+物种
- 中等负载量：单核和聚合物种的混合
- 高负载量：晶态Cr2O3的形成

最佳的铬负载量似乎在6.8 wt%左右，超过这个量时，由于形成活性较低的晶态Cr2O3和可能的孔道堵塞，催化活性会降低。
