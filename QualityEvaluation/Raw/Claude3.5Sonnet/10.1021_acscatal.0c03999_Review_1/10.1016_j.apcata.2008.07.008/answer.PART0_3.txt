[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The UVvis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

Supported chromium oxide catalysts are among the most active for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to higher activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, highly active mononuclear Cr3+ species predominate. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form.

3. Oxidation state: Cr6+ species are present after calcination, especially at low loadings. These reduce to catalytically active Cr3+/Cr2+ species under reaction conditions.

4. Support properties: Supports that facilitate electron transfer can promote formation of active Cr2+ species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading follows this general pattern:
- Low loading: Dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species
- Increasing loading: Formation of polymeric species 
- High loading: Crystalline Cr2O3 formation

The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, which balances high dispersion with sufficient active sites. Support properties that promote dispersion and facilitate redox behavior of chromium species are beneficial for catalytic performance.

负载的氧化铬催化剂是CO2-ODHP（用CO2氧化脱氢丙烷）中最活跃的催化剂之一。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：一般来说，分散度越高，活性越高。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，高活性的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和结晶Cr2O3。

3. 氧化态：焙烧后存在Cr6+物种，特别是在低负载量时。这些物种在反应条件下还原为具有催化活性的Cr3+/Cr2+物种。

4. 载体性质：能促进电子转移的载体可以促进活性Cr2+物种的形成。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变通常遵循以下模式：
- 低负载量：分散的单核Cr3+和Cr6+物种
- 负载量增加：形成聚合物种
- 高负载量：形成结晶Cr2O3

最佳负载量似乎在6.8 wt% Cr左右，这在高分散度和足够的活性位点之间取得了平衡。能促进铬物种分散和促进其氧化还原行为的载体性质有利于提高催化性能。
