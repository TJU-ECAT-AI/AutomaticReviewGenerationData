          [1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[6] "No Cr6+ was detected in any of the three samples, demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period of reaction"

[7] "Takahara et al. discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."

[8] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

          The study compares the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, with a focus on Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Key findings and factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2-supported chromium oxides show improved activity with CO2 addition, while Al2O3-supported ones experience reduced activity.

2. Metal loading: Ru modification significantly impacts performance, with a volcano-shaped activity trend observed as a function of Ru loading. The optimal 1 wt% Ru loading resulted in a two-fold enhancement in C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Catalyst composition: The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%. The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt% Ru) showed the highest propane conversion and propylene production rate.

4. Overloading effect: Increasing Ru loading beyond the optimal amount (e.g., to 3 wt%) led to decreased propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. Evolution of chromium species: Cr6+ species are quickly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial reaction period. The reduced chromium species remain stable throughout the reaction, as evidenced by similar XPS peak positions after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction.

6. Redox properties: Ru modification only slightly enhanced the redox properties of the catalysts, suggesting that this enhancement is not the sole reason for improved catalytic activity.

7. Reaction pathways: The main reaction pathway evolves from direct dehydrogenation to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to reforming as Ru loading increases.

These factors demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, metal oxidation states, and catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing catalyst formulations for improved activity and selectivity.

          该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性，重点关注Ru改性的SiO2负载铬氧化物催化剂。关键发现和影响催化性能的因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2负载的铬氧化物在添加CO2时活性提高，而Al2O3负载的则活性降低。

2. 金属负载量：Ru改性显著影响性能，随Ru负载量的变化观察到火山形活性趋势。最佳的1 wt% Ru负载使C3H6产率比未改性催化剂提高了两倍。

3. 催化剂组成：未改性的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂显示出79%的C3H6选择性。Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂（1 wt%钌）表现出最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

4. 过度负载效应：将Ru负载量增加到最佳量以上（如3 wt%）会导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性下降。

5. 铬物种的演变：Cr6+物种在反应初期快速还原为Cr3+或Cr2+。还原态的铬物种在整个反应过程中保持稳定，这从反应5分钟和50分钟后XPS峰位置相似可以得到证实。

6. 氧化还原性质：Ru改性仅略微增强了催化剂的氧化还原性能，表明这种增强不是提高催化活性的唯一原因。

7. 反应路径：随着Ru负载量的增加，主要反应路径从直接脱氢演变为两步氧化脱氢，然后转变为重整反应。

这些因素表明了催化剂组成、金属氧化态和CO2-ODHP反应催化性能之间复杂的相互作用，突出了优化催化剂配方以提高活性和选择性的重要性。
