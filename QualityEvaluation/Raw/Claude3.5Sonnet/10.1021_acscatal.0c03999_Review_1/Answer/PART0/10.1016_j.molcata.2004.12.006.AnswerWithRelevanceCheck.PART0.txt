          [1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "The increase in Cr content leads gradually to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and finally crystalline -chromia phases."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

[6] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%."

[7] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."

[8] "It is considered that, at higher Cr contents, the dispersion of Cr species decreased by the aggregation (vide infra) partly due to the decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure."

          Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 exhibited the highest activity, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity for styrene. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested (V, Ga, Fe).

2. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which structural changes occurred, leading to decreased dispersion and aggregation of Cr species.

3. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: 
   - Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as the active monochromate species.
   - During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active.
   - The catalytic cycle likely involves a redox process between Cr(III) and Cr(II).

4. Chromium species evolution:
   - At low loadings, isolated Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form on the support surface.
   - As loading increases, these species gradually transform into di- or polychromate species, then amorphous phases, and finally crystalline chromia phases.

5. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure provide an effective support for dispersing chromium species. However, at higher Cr contents, the structural regularity decreases, leading to aggregation.

6. Regeneration ability: Deactivated catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen or CO2, which reoxidizes polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra.

The evolution of chromium species is particularly important, as the transformation from dispersed Cr(VI)O4 to aggregated Cr(III)O6 species during the reaction is linked to catalyst deactivation. The ability to regenerate the active Cr(VI) species through oxidative treatments is key to maintaining catalyst performance.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中表现出不同的活性和选择性。在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，实现了65%的乙苯转化率，苯乙烯的选择性超过90%。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：铬显示出比其他测试金属（V、Ga、Fe）更优越的性能。

2. 铬负载量：活性随Cr含量增加而增加，直到1.7 wt%，超过此含量会发生结构变化，导致Cr物种的分散度降低和聚集。

3. 铬的氧化态和配位：
   - 最初，四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4形成为活性单铬酸盐物种。
   - 在反应过程中，它被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6，活性较低。
   - 催化循环可能涉及Cr(III)和Cr(II)之间的氧化还原过程。

4. 铬物种演变：
   - 在低负载量时，载体表面形成孤立的四面体Cr(VI)O4物种。
   - 随着负载量增加，这些物种逐渐转变为二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种，然后是非晶相，最后是结晶的氧化铬相。

5. 载体性质：MCM-41的高比表面积和有序介孔结构为分散铬物种提供了有效的载体。然而，在较高的Cr含量下，结构规整性降低，导致聚集。

6. 再生能力：失活的催化剂可以通过氧气或CO2处理再生，将聚合的Cr(III)O6八面体重新氧化为单体Cr(VI)O4四面体。

铬物种的演变尤为重要，因为在反应过程中分散的Cr(VI)O4向聚集的Cr(III)O6物种的转变与催化剂失活有关。通过氧化处理恢复活性Cr(VI)物种的能力是保持催化剂性能的关键。
