          [1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≈ 50% and olefin ≈ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

[6] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."

[7] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."

          Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. The activity sequence for C3H6 yield is Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Cr oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading and coverage: A monolayer Cr coverage is generally optimal. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species may decompose to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support affects Cr dispersion and evolution. Metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are commonly used. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41) and carbon-based supports can provide better Cr dispersion.

4. Metal-support interaction: Relatively weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, appear to benefit C3H6 formation.

5. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3. This evolution is heavily influenced by the Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。C3H6产率的活性顺序为Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ 无。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的氧化态：较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对于获得高C3H6产率很重要。

2. 铬的负载量和覆盖度：单层铬覆盖通常是最佳的。低于这个阈值时，C3H6产率随铬含量增加而增加。超过这个阈值，过量的铬物种可能会分解为无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒。

3. 载体性质：载体的性质影响铬的分散和演变。常用的金属氧化物载体包括Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2、TiO2和SiO2。有序介孔材料（SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41）和碳基载体可以提供更好的铬分散性。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：相对较弱的金属-载体相互作用（如SiO2）似乎有利于C3H6的形成。

5. 铬结构：铬结构的变化对铬负载量敏感，并决定了活性。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量的演变通常遵循以下顺序：接枝Cr6+ → 分散Cr6+氧化物 → 微晶Cr3+ → 晶态α-Cr2O3。这种演变受铬覆盖度和载体结构性质的影响很大。
