          [1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

[7] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 6008C: (i) a Cr31 species; (ii) a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; (iii) a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."

[8] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[9] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

          The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. Three types of chromium species are present in calcined catalysts: Cr3+, water-soluble Cr6+, and grafted Cr6+.

2. At low chromium oxide loadings (&lt;2 wt% CrO3), all chromium exists as grafted Cr6+ species, which reaches a maximum of 1.5 wt% and does not increase further at higher loadings.

3. As loading increases (>4 wt% CrO3), Cr3+ species start to form and increase linearly with loading.

4. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but doesn't fully cover the surface.

6. Catalyst activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings (15.3 wt% CrO3) where activity decreases.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Chromium oxide loading
- Support surface area and crystalline structure
- Distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species
- Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings

While the study focuses on dehydrogenation catalysts rather than CO2-ODHP, these insights into chromium species evolution are likely relevant to other reactions catalyzed by supported chromium oxide catalysts.

          该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现。然而，它提供了关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的见解：

1. 焙烧后的催化剂中存在三种铬物种：Cr3+、水溶性Cr6+和接枝Cr6+。

2. 在低铬氧化物负载量时（&lt;2 wt% CrO3），所有铬以接枝Cr6+形式存在，该物种达到最大值1.5 wt%，并在更高负载量下不再增加。

3. 随着负载量增加（>4 wt% CrO3），Cr3+物种开始形成，并随负载量线性增加。

4. 结晶态α-Cr2O3仅在较高的铬氧化物负载量下出现。

5. 接枝Cr6+的量与载体表面积成正比，但不会完全覆盖表面。

6. 催化剂活性通常与总铬含量成正比，但在非常高的负载量（15.3 wt% CrO3）时活性下降。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
- 铬氧化物负载量
- 载体表面积和晶体结构
- Cr6+和Cr3+物种的分布
- 在高负载量下形成结晶态α-Cr2O3

虽然该研究侧重于脱氢催化剂而非CO2-ODHP，但这些关于铬物种演变的见解可能与其他由负载铬氧化物催化剂催化的反应相关。
