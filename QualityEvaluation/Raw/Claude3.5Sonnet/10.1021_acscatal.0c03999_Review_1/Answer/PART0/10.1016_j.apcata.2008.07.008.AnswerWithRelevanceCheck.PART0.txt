          [1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The UVvis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

[6] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."

[7] "The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants conversion."

          Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are prevalent and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, beyond which catalytic activity decreases.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low Cr content. These Cr6+ species increase with Cr loading up to 6.8 wt%, correlating with increased catalytic activity. However, under reaction conditions, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are believed to be the catalytically active species for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state stability, influencing overall catalytic performance. For example, MCM-41 support facilitates high dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading follows this pattern:
- Low loading: Highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species
- Increasing loading: Formation of polymeric species 
- High loading: Crystalline Cr2O3 formation

This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          由于具有高催化活性，负载型铬氧化物催化剂被认为是CO2-ODHP反应中最有前景的催化剂。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的分散度：通常更高的分散度会带来更好的催化活性。

2. 铬的负载量：在低负载量时，具有配位空位的单核Cr3+物种占主导地位并具有高活性。随着负载量的增加，形成活性较低的聚合物种和晶态Cr2O3。最佳负载量似乎在6.8 wt% Cr左右，超过这个量时催化活性会降低。

3. 氧化态：最初，催化剂表面存在Cr6+物种，尤其是在低铬含量时。这些Cr6+物种随着铬负载量的增加而增加，最高可达6.8 wt%，与催化活性的增加相关。然而，在反应条件下，Cr6+物种被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+物种，这些被认为是脱氢反应的活性物种。

4. 载体性质：载体的性质影响铬的分散度和氧化态稳定性，从而影响整体催化性能。例如，MCM-41载体有利于铬物种的高度分散。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量的演变遵循以下模式：
- 低负载量：高度分散的单核Cr3+和Cr6+物种
- 负载量增加：形成聚合物种
- 高负载量：形成晶态Cr2O3

这种演变显著影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
