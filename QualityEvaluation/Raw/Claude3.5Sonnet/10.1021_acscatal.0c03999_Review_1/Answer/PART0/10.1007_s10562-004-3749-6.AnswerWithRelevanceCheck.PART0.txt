          [1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

          The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) vary significantly based on several key factors:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide follows a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The choice of support greatly affects catalyst performance. For example, CrOx/SiO2 shows enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 experiences decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Acidity/basicity of the support: This property strongly influences the catalytic behavior of supported chromium catalysts.

4. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2, increasing chromium content leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

5. Properties of CO2: Both the acidic and redox properties of CO2 play important roles in the dehydrogenation process, affecting reaction yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the loading and support properties. As chromium loading increases, the interaction between chromium species and the support changes, leading to different catalytic behaviors. The support material (e.g., SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly influences how chromium species evolve and interact with CO2, ultimately affecting the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的活性和选择性因几个关键因素而显著不同：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂倾向于遵循氧化途径，而镓氧化物则遵循非氧化还原途径。

2. 载体材料：载体的选择极大地影响催化剂性能。例如，CrOx/SiO2在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而CrOx/Al2O3的产率和选择性则下降。

3. 载体的酸碱性：这一性质强烈影响负载型铬催化剂的催化行为。

4. 铬负载量：对于CrOx/SiO2，随着铬含量增加，He中产率与CO2中产率的比值（YHe/YCO2）升高。相反，对于CrOx/Al2O3，更高的负载量减少了CO2的毒化效应。

5. CO2的性质：CO2的酸性和氧化还原性质在脱氢过程中都起着重要作用，影响反应产率。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关。随着铬负载量的增加，铬物种与载体之间的相互作用发生变化，导致不同的催化行为。载体材料（如SiO2与Al2O3）显著影响铬物种的演变及其与CO2的相互作用，最终影响催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。
