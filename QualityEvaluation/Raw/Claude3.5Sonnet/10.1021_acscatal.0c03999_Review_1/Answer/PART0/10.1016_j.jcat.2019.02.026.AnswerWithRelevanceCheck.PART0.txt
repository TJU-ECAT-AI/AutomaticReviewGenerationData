          [1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Furthermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."

[3] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[4] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[5] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

[6] "Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area, crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%)."

[7] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."

[8] "For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane."

          Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Chromium loading: An optimal loading (e.g., 7% in the case of Cr-ZrO2) results in the highest catalytic activity.
2. Oxidation state: Initially, higher concentrations of Cr6+ species contribute to enhanced activity. During the reaction, Cr3+ species become the main active sites.
3. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium species on the support surface lead to better catalytic performance.
4. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species.
5. Surface area
6. Crystalline structure of the support
7. Surface acidity
8. Redox properties

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties involves:

1. Initial state: At lower loadings, isolated Cr6+ species are dominant. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.
2. During reaction: Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main catalytically active species.
3. Redox cycling: The balance between reduction by propane and oxidation by CO2 influences the evolution of chromium species during the reaction.
4. Support effect: The support (e.g., ZrO2) influences the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species, which in turn affects their evolution during the reaction.

The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than that from isolated Cr6+. The presence of CO2 helps maintain the Cr3+ oxidation state, preventing further reduction to less active Cr2+ species.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP，包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂。其中，铬氧化物表现出特别高的活性。

影响铬基催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：最佳负载量（如Cr-ZrO2的7%）会产生最高的催化活性。
2. 氧化态：初始时，较高浓度的Cr6+物种有助于提高活性。在反应过程中，Cr3+物种成为主要活性位点。
3. 分散度：高度分散在载体表面的铬物种会导致更好的催化性能。
4. 载体性质：载体的性质（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性。
5. 比表面积
6. 载体的晶体结构
7. 表面酸性
8. 氧化还原性质

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变包括：

1. 初始状态：在较低负载量时，孤立的Cr6+物种占主导地位。随着负载量的增加，形成寡聚Cr6+物种。
2. 反应过程中：在诱导期间，Cr6+物种还原为Cr3+。配位不饱和的寡聚和孤立Cr3+位点成为主要的催化活性物种。
3. 氧化还原循环：丙烷的还原作用和CO2的氧化作用之间的平衡影响反应过程中铬物种的演变。
4. 载体效应：载体（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性，从而影响它们在反应过程中的演变。

由初始聚合态Cr6+还原而来的配位不饱和Cr3+比由孤立态Cr6+还原而来的更活跃。CO2的存在有助于维持Cr3+的氧化态，防止进一步还原为活性较低的Cr2+物种。
