          [1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [6,9,10,14,18,27,28]."

[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32]."

[5] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined."

[6] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

          Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties
4. Chromium loading
5. Acidity of the support

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial:

1. Supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSUx), allow for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.
2. A well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield has been observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading.
3. The support's acidity plays a crucial role in determining selectivity. Low acidity supports like SiBeta lead to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while highly acidic supports like AlBeta promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.
4. The choice of support significantly impacts catalyst performance and CO2 interaction. γ-Al2O3 supports lead to CO2 poisoning, while active carbon supports require frequent regeneration.
5. In switch operation mode, Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts show increased propene formation rates in the presence of CO2, while Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalysts exhibit a negative effect on propene formation rates when CO2 is present.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning both the chromium loading and the support properties to optimize catalyst performance in CO2-PDH reactions.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括含有Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V的催化剂。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 氧化还原铬物种的存在
3. 载体性质
4. 铬负载量
5. 载体的酸性

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要：

1. 具有大比表面积的载体，如有序介孔二氧化硅材料（MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15、MSUx），可以实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散和高浓度。
2. 在铬负载量达到2 wt%之前，氧化还原铬位点的数量与丙烯产率之间存在良好的相关性。
3. 载体的酸度在决定选择性方面起着关键作用。低酸度载体如SiBeta导致较高的丙烯选择性（超过80%），而高酸度载体如AlBeta会促进不希望的丙烷裂解反应。
4. 载体的选择显著影响催化剂性能和CO2相互作用。γ-Al2O3载体导致CO2中毒，而活性炭载体需要频繁再生。
5. 在切换操作模式下，含Cr的SiBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时表现出丙烯生成速率的增加，而含Cr的AlBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时对丙烯生成速率产生负面影响。

这些发现突出了在CO2-PDH反应中，仔细调节铬负载量和载体性质以优化催化剂性能的重要性。
