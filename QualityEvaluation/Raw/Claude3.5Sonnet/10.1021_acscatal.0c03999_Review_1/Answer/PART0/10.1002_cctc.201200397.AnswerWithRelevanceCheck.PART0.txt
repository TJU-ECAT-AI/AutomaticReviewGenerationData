          [1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "Generally, CrOx possesses various types of Cr species, depending on the loading weight of the Cr precursor. As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

[6] "Cr3+ formed from the reduction of higher valence states, that is, Cr6+, are active sites in the ODPH reaction."

          CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium oxidation state: Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, formed from the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, different Cr species form in the order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The silica support influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At higher loadings, α-Cr2O3 crystallites form on top of the dispersed Cr species after complete coverage of the support surface.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading progresses from highly dispersed Cr6+ at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings, with intermediate formation of dispersed oxides and microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide. This progression impacts the number of active sites and catalyst stability.

Additional factors that can influence catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst preparation method, which affects the distribution and oxidation states of chromium species.
- Use of promoters like Ni, which can help maintain the active Cr3+ state and improve catalyst stability.

          与其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出高活性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的氧化态：由Cr6+还原形成的配位不饱和Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。

2. 催化剂失活：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂由于积碳沉积和活性Cr3+还原为非活性Cr2+而迅速失活。

3. 铬负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，不同的Cr物种按以下顺序形成：接枝Cr6+、分散Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物和晶态α-Cr2O3。

4. 载体性质：二氧化硅载体影响铬物种的分散性和稳定性。

5. 晶相形成：在高负载量时，α-Cr2O3晶体在分散Cr物种覆盖载体表面后形成。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变从低负载量时的高度分散Cr6+到高负载量时的晶态α-Cr2O3，中间经历分散氧化物和微晶Cr3+氧化物的形成。这种演变过程影响活性位点的数量和催化剂的稳定性。

影响催化性能的其他因素包括：
- 催化剂制备方法，这影响铬物种的分布和氧化态。
- 使用如Ni等助剂，可以帮助保持活性Cr3+状态并提高催化剂稳定性。
