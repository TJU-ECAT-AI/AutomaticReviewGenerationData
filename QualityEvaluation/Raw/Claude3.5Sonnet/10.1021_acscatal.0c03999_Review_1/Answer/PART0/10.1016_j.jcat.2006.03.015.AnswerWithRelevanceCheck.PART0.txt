          [1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."

[5] "The propylene yields of the modified supported vanadiaalumina catalysts were greater than those of the individual supported metal oxide catalysts at all temperatures."

          The study compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), not CO2-ODHP as mentioned in the question. Key findings include:

1. Activity: Chromia and vanadia catalysts supported on alumina were significantly more active than tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with turnover frequencies (TOFs) about two orders of magnitude higher. Surface CrOx species showed higher overall TOF than VOx species.

2. Selectivity: Propylene selectivity was inversely related to activity. V2O5/Al2O3 showed 72% selectivity compared to 24% for CrO3/Al2O3.

3. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   - Nature of metal oxide: Different metal oxides showed varying activities and selectivities.
   - Interactions between metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased selectivity from 72% to 49%.
   - Temperature: Propylene yield increased with reaction temperature for all catalysts.
   - Promoter effects: Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) enhanced propylene yields compared to individual metal oxide catalysts.

4. The promotional effect of secondary metal oxide modifiers was not due to new phase formation, changes in redox center strength, or changes in exposed alumina sites.

The study does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses more on comparing different metal oxides and their combinations rather than examining the behavior of chromium species specifically.

          该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的性能，而非问题中提到的CO2-ODHP反应。主要发现包括：

1. 活性：以氧化铝为载体的铬酸盐和钒酸盐催化剂的活性显著高于钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂，转化频率(TOF)高出约两个数量级。表面CrOx物种的总体TOF高于VOx物种。

2. 选择性：丙烯选择性与活性呈反比。V2O5/Al2O3的选择性为72%，而CrO3/Al2O3的选择性为24%。

3. 影响催化性能的关键因素：
   - 金属氧化物的性质：不同的金属氧化物表现出不同的活性和选择性。
   - 金属氧化物之间的相互作用：向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx使活性提高6倍，但选择性从72%降至49%。
   - 温度：所有催化剂的丙烯产率随反应温度升高而增加。
   - 促进剂效应：第VI族金属氧化物改性剂（Cr、Mo、W）与单一金属氧化物催化剂相比提高了丙烯产率。

4. 次级金属氧化物改性剂的促进作用并非由于新相的形成、氧化还原中心强度的变化或暴露的氧化铝位点的变化造成的。

该研究没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。它更多地集中在比较不同金属氧化物及其组合，而非专门研究铬物种的行为。
