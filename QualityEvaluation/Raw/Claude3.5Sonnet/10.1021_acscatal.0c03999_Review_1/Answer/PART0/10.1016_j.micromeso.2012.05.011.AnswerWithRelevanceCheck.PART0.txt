          [1] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."

[4] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites)."

[5] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[6] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

          The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal level (7 wt% in this study), after which it plateaus due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Chromium species: Various Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr2O3) are present, with their distribution depending on total Cr content. At low loadings (&lt;7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ species dominate, while at higher loadings, Cr6+ coexists with crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Redox properties: Activity is mainly related to reducible Cr sites participating in a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle.

4. Support properties: The high surface area of SBA-1 allows for better dispersion and stabilization of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

5. Oxidation state evolution: During the reaction, high-valent Cr species rapidly reduce to lower oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr2+), which then participate in the catalytic cycle.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, highly active species at lower loadings to a mix of active species and less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at an intermediate loading (7 wt% Cr) that maximizes the number of active, high-valent Cr species while minimizing inactive Cr2O3 formation.

          该研究主要关注以SBA-1为载体的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的应用。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而上升，直至达到最佳水平（本研究中为7 wt%），之后由于形成无活性的晶态Cr2O3而趋于平稳。

2. 铬物种：存在多种铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr2O3），其分布取决于总铬含量。在低负载量（&lt;7 wt%）时，高价态Cr6+物种占主导，而在高负载量时，Cr6+与晶态Cr2O3共存。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性主要与参与CrOx/CrOx-1氧化还原循环的可还原铬位点有关。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1的高比表面积允许比常规二氧化硅载体更好地分散和稳定铬物种。

5. 氧化态演变：在反应过程中，高价态铬物种迅速还原为低氧化态（Cr3+、Cr2+），随后参与催化循环。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高分散、高活性物种，到高负载时活性物种与低活性晶态Cr2O3混合的转变。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在中等负载量（7 wt% Cr）时达到最佳活性，此时活性高价态Cr物种数量最大化，同时最小化了无活性Cr2O3的形成。
