CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium oxidation state: Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, formed from the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, different Cr species form in the order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The silica support influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At higher loadings, α-Cr2O3 crystallites form on top of the dispersed Cr species after complete coverage of the support surface.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading progresses from highly dispersed Cr6+ at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings, with intermediate formation of dispersed oxides and microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide. This progression impacts the number of active sites and catalyst stability.

Additional factors that can influence catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst preparation method, which affects the distribution and oxidation states of chromium species.
- Use of promoters like Ni, which can help maintain the active Cr3+ state and improve catalyst stability.

Among various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable. However, they operate through different mechanisms:

Gallium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 acts as an oxidant, promoting propene yield through its oxidative abilities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium catalysts include:
1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of support

These factors affect the concentration and distribution of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+), which are crucial for the catalytic mechanism.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts varies with loading and support properties:

- At low Cr loadings with high dispersion: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate
- At higher Cr loadings with low dispersion: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present

This evolution of chromium species significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. To achieve higher activity in chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP, high dispersion of chromium oxide species at high Cr loadings is desirable.

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with chromium-based catalysts showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt%, which provided the best balance of activity and selectivity. Higher loadings led to decreased activity.

2. Dispersion of active phase: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for good catalytic performance. As loading increases beyond the optimal level, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support played an important role in achieving high activity, likely due to its high surface area and presence of oxygen-containing surface groups. Chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on the external surface of the support.

4. Pore accessibility: At higher loadings, Cr2O3 clusters can partially block micropores, affecting catalyst performance.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from highly dispersed Cr at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings (>5 wt%). This transition correlates with a decrease in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining high Cr dispersion for optimal performance. The formation of α-Cr2O3 was confirmed by XRD analysis, showing characteristic peaks for rhombohedral α-Cr2O3 with space group R3c.

The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst showed superior activity compared to other reported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimizing metal loading and maintaining high dispersion on the active carbon support.

The literature provides insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as particularly effective. They are active, selective, and stable for converting CH4 + CO2 mixtures to synthesis gas and for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to alter their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Manganese was found to be the best modifying additive, with increasing Mn content leading to higher CO2 conversion and decreased coking.

3. Specific catalyst compositions were identified as best performing:
   - 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 for general performance
   - 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 for selective propane conversion with CO2

4. The oxidation state of manganese plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance:
   - Oxidized phases (Mn3O4 and Mn2O3) promote total methane oxidation
   - Reduced phases (MnO and MnCO3) assist methane conversion to synthesis gas
   - Intermediate phases promote methane oxidative coupling

5. For Mn-Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, XRD studies show the presence of MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

6. In Mn-Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts, no direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with SiO2 was observed. Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases are present before the reaction, while MnO and MnCO3 are observed during the reaction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst composition and metal loading
- Oxidation state of active metal components
- Support material and its interactions with active components
- Catalyst preparation method and resulting phase composition

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information about how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in XRD due to high dispersity, suggesting that chromium species are highly dispersed on the support at the loadings studied.

The study compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), not CO2-ODHP as mentioned in the question. Key findings include:

1. Activity: Chromia and vanadia catalysts supported on alumina were significantly more active than tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with turnover frequencies (TOFs) about two orders of magnitude higher. Surface CrOx species showed higher overall TOF than VOx species.

2. Selectivity: Propylene selectivity was inversely related to activity. V2O5/Al2O3 showed 72% selectivity compared to 24% for CrO3/Al2O3.

3. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   - Nature of metal oxide: Different metal oxides showed varying activities and selectivities.
   - Interactions between metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased selectivity from 72% to 49%.
   - Temperature: Propylene yield increased with reaction temperature for all catalysts.
   - Promoter effects: Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) enhanced propylene yields compared to individual metal oxide catalysts.

4. The promotional effect of secondary metal oxide modifiers was not due to new phase formation, changes in redox center strength, or changes in exposed alumina sites.

The study does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses more on comparing different metal oxides and their combinations rather than examining the behavior of chromium species specifically.

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, reaching 85% propane conversion. Further increases do not improve conversion.

2. Chromium species: At loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species are present. Above this, α-Cr2O3 particles appear, which are not active for the reaction.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of Cr species leads to better performance. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method produces more highly dispersed Cr compared to wet impregnation.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing Cr content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

5. Optimal performance: The 6.0 wt% Cr catalyst shows the highest activity, with a propene yield of 69%.

6. Preparation method: MVS produces catalysts with higher Cr dispersion, allowing for optimized activity per Cr atom.

7. Surface area: Catalysts maintain a high specific surface area (around 310 m2/g) up to 6.0 wt% loading, with only slight decreases in total pore volume as chromium content increases.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed, active chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at moderate loadings where dispersion is high and inactive species are minimized.

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key findings include:

1. Activity and selectivity:
- SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
- Cr2O3/Al2O3 had lower activity with CO2 than without.
- Cr2O3/AC showed no difference in activity with or without CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
- Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.
- Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed better performance, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
- Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 was more active for propane dehydrogenation than the reduced form.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
- The Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a vital role in CO2 promotion.
- CO2 helps maintain Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation.
- The oxidation state of Cr2O3 surface changes dynamically during the reaction, influenced by the presence of CO2.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between support properties, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalyst's performance for CO2-ODHP.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show the most promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but further increases lead to decline, possibly due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may affect performance.

4. Support properties: β-Ga2O3 was chosen as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

5. Temperature: CO2 enhances propene yield above 848 K and partially suppresses catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

6. Resistance to coke deposition: Chromium oxide deposition enhances resistance to coke formation.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. At lower loadings, dispersed Cr3+ species form on the β-Ga2O3 surface. As loading increases, these species aggregate and may form larger chromium oxide clusters, potentially explaining the decline in performance at very high loadings. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, balancing increased active sites with maintained surface area.

Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are prevalent and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, beyond which catalytic activity decreases.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low Cr content. These Cr6+ species increase with Cr loading up to 6.8 wt%, correlating with increased catalytic activity. However, under reaction conditions, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are believed to be the catalytically active species for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state stability, influencing overall catalytic performance. For example, MCM-41 support facilitates high dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading follows this pattern:
- Low loading: Highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species
- Increasing loading: Formation of polymeric species 
- High loading: Crystalline Cr2O3 formation

This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing various loadings (0.25-2.0 wt% Cr) prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Key findings include:

1. Catalyst properties: High surface area (600-1000 m2/g) porous systems were achieved. The only chromium species detected were surface chromates, with the amount of Cr sites linearly proportional to Cr loading.

2. Catalytic performance: The catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900-1000 minutes of testing. Propene yields as high as 40-47% were achieved, particularly with CO2 as the oxidant.

3. Influence of oxidants: Different oxidants (CO2, O2, CO2+O2) affected the chromium oxidation state. With CO2 as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of Cr sites was as low as +2, while with O2 (alone or mixed with CO2), it was around +3.

4. Structure-performance relationship: The oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) was correlated with propene selectivity. The difference in oxidation state depending on the oxidant used might contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4.

5. Effect of Cr loading: Increasing Cr content generally led to increased yields of C3H6 and total olefins, with both showing similar trends.

These Cr/SiO2 catalysts demonstrated promising performance for CO2-ODHP, with high stability and good propene yields. The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the Cr loading, the nature of the oxidant, and the resulting oxidation state of the Cr species during the reaction.

The study compared the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity and selectivity: 
   - SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
   - Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC activity was unaffected by CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   a) Support material: SiO2 was crucial for CO2 promotion.
   b) Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 resulted in better CO2 promotion, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
   c) Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active than the reduced catalyst.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
   a) Cr2O3 is reduced in a stream of H2.
   b) CO2 can partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst.
   c) The presence of CO2 maintains Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is believed to be more active for propane dehydrogenation.

The study emphasizes the importance of the support material, Cr2O3 loading, and the oxidation state of chromium in determining the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP. The unique interaction between Cr2O3 and SiO2, particularly at their interface, appears to be crucial for the observed CO2 promotion effect.

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe have been studied for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising results, particularly when supported on SiO2, MCM-41, or diamond.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the type of metal oxide and the support material. Different metal oxides follow different reaction pathways - vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxides tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the chromium loading and support properties are important factors. The study mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a specific surface area of 273 m2g-1. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties for these catalysts.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) vary significantly based on several key factors:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide follows a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The choice of support greatly affects catalyst performance. For example, CrOx/SiO2 shows enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 experiences decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Acidity/basicity of the support: This property strongly influences the catalytic behavior of supported chromium catalysts.

4. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2, increasing chromium content leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

5. Properties of CO2: Both the acidic and redox properties of CO2 play important roles in the dehydrogenation process, affecting reaction yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the loading and support properties. As chromium loading increases, the interaction between chromium species and the support changes, leading to different catalytic behaviors. The support material (e.g., SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly influences how chromium species evolve and interact with CO2, ultimately affecting the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. The activity sequence for C3H6 yield is Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Cr oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading and coverage: A monolayer Cr coverage is generally optimal. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species may decompose to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support affects Cr dispersion and evolution. Metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are commonly used. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41) and carbon-based supports can provide better Cr dispersion.

4. Metal-support interaction: Relatively weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, appear to benefit C3H6 formation.

5. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3. This evolution is heavily influenced by the Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) activity and selectivity. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co supported on MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most active site for the reaction.
2. Catalyst support: MCM-41 support provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, enhancing catalyst performance.
3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher propane conversion, despite decreases in surface area and pore volume.
4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The catalytic cycle involves the transformation between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (active species) and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (reduced form).
5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra) before the reaction.
2. During reaction: Transformation to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra).
3. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr3+O6 to Cr6+O4 by CO2.

This redox cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The Cr/MSU-x catalyst shows excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Lower loadings produce higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading range: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%. Maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occur between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Trade-off between conversion and selectivity: As Cr loading increases, propane conversion increases but propylene selectivity decreases slightly, from 95.3% to about 89%.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous MSU-x support likely contributes to the catalyst's high performance compared to other catalysts in literature.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from dispersed, high oxidation state species at low loadings to bulk Cr2O3 crystals at high loadings. This affects the balance between activity and selectivity, with an optimal range for overall performance. Cr/MSU-x exhibits higher propane conversion than most catalysts reported in literature, demonstrating its effectiveness for CO2-ODHP.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) are influenced by several key factors:

1. Nature of support: Chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience an inhibiting effect from CO2.

2. Chromium loading: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as chromium content decreases. This is measured by the ratio of propene yield in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere.

3. Evolution of chromium species: The redox behavior of chromium species depends on loading and support properties. On silica surfaces, especially at low Cr content, deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. This is because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, allowing further reduction to Cr2+. At higher Cr contents, reduction produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its high stability.

4. Role of CO2: In CO2-ODHP, CO2 acts not only as a diluent and heating medium but also as an oxidant, influencing the catalytic performance.

These factors collectively determine the overall activity and selectivity of the catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, with silica-supported low-loading catalysts generally showing better performance due to their enhanced redox properties and interaction with CO2.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 exhibited the highest activity, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity for styrene. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested (V, Ga, Fe).

2. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which structural changes occurred, leading to decreased dispersion and aggregation of Cr species.

3. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: 
   - Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as the active monochromate species.
   - During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active.
   - The catalytic cycle likely involves a redox process between Cr(III) and Cr(II).

4. Chromium species evolution:
   - At low loadings, isolated Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form on the support surface.
   - As loading increases, these species gradually transform into di- or polychromate species, then amorphous phases, and finally crystalline chromia phases.

5. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure provide an effective support for dispersing chromium species. However, at higher Cr contents, the structural regularity decreases, leading to aggregation.

6. Regeneration ability: Deactivated catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen or CO2, which reoxidizes polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra.

The evolution of chromium species is particularly important, as the transformation from dispersed Cr(VI)O4 to aggregated Cr(III)O6 species during the reaction is linked to catalyst deactivation. The ability to regenerate the active Cr(VI) species through oxidative treatments is key to maintaining catalyst performance.

Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. Chromium oxide catalysts:
   - Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation and were effective for propane dehydrogenation.
   - The promoting effect of CO2 was observed only on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts:
   - Ga2O3 was found to be an effective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
   - Ethylene yield doubled in the presence of CO2 compared to reactions without CO2.
   - Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and selective catalytic reduction of NOx.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Silica appears to be an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
2. Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.
3. Presence of CO2: It acts as a promoter, enhancing yields in some cases.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More detailed studies would be needed to elucidate these aspects.

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, with a focus on Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Key findings and factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2-supported chromium oxides show improved activity with CO2 addition, while Al2O3-supported ones experience reduced activity.

2. Metal loading: Ru modification significantly impacts performance, with a volcano-shaped activity trend observed as a function of Ru loading. The optimal 1 wt% Ru loading resulted in a two-fold enhancement in C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Catalyst composition: The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%. The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt% Ru) showed the highest propane conversion and propylene production rate.

4. Overloading effect: Increasing Ru loading beyond the optimal amount (e.g., to 3 wt%) led to decreased propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. Evolution of chromium species: Cr6+ species are quickly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial reaction period. The reduced chromium species remain stable throughout the reaction, as evidenced by similar XPS peak positions after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction.

6. Redox properties: Ru modification only slightly enhanced the redox properties of the catalysts, suggesting that this enhancement is not the sole reason for improved catalytic activity.

7. Reaction pathways: The main reaction pathway evolves from direct dehydrogenation to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to reforming as Ru loading increases.

These factors demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, metal oxidation states, and catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing catalyst formulations for improved activity and selectivity.

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal level (7 wt% in this study), after which it plateaus due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Chromium species: Various Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr2O3) are present, with their distribution depending on total Cr content. At low loadings (&lt;7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ species dominate, while at higher loadings, Cr6+ coexists with crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Redox properties: Activity is mainly related to reducible Cr sites participating in a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle.

4. Support properties: The high surface area of SBA-1 allows for better dispersion and stabilization of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

5. Oxidation state evolution: During the reaction, high-valent Cr species rapidly reduce to lower oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr2+), which then participate in the catalytic cycle.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, highly active species at lower loadings to a mix of active species and less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at an intermediate loading (7 wt% Cr) that maximizes the number of active, high-valent Cr species while minimizing inactive Cr2O3 formation.

The literature primarily compares Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key findings include:

1. Catalyst activity: Cr/SiO2 activity increases with CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 activity decreases significantly with small CO2 additions.

2. Redox cycle: Both catalysts involve a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 species, which plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 effect: CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) under reaction conditions. For Cr/SiO2, this leads to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species, alongside simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

4. Support influence: The support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly affects the catalyst's response to CO2, suggesting that support properties are a key factor in determining catalytic performance.

5. Chromium species evolution: The oxidation state of chromium changes during the reaction, with Cr(III) being oxidized to Cr(VI) by CO2. This evolution of chromium species is crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism and performance.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
- CO2 partial pressure
- Chromium oxidation state and speciation

The evolution of chromium species depends on:
- Support properties (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
- Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 presence
- Redox cycling between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on various other metal oxide catalysts or detailed insights into the effect of chromium loading. However, it highlights the importance of support choice, CO2 partial pressure, and the dynamic nature of chromium oxidation states in determining catalyst activity and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODHP.

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium outperformed other metals (V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) is the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox cycle: The reaction involves a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be regenerated using both oxygen and carbon dioxide, with oxygen being more efficient in reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. Support properties: MCM-41, a mesoporous material with high surface area, allows for good dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra on the support surface.
2. During reaction: Reduction of Cr(VI)O4 to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedra.
3. Deactivation: Formation of aggregated Cr(III)O6 species.
4. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 by O2 or CO2.

The loading and support properties affect the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species, which in turn influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and regeneration ability.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties
4. Chromium loading
5. Acidity of the support

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial:

1. Supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSUx), allow for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.
2. A well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield has been observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading.
3. The support's acidity plays a crucial role in determining selectivity. Low acidity supports like SiBeta lead to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while highly acidic supports like AlBeta promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.
4. The choice of support significantly impacts catalyst performance and CO2 interaction. γ-Al2O3 supports lead to CO2 poisoning, while active carbon supports require frequent regeneration.
5. In switch operation mode, Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts show increased propene formation rates in the presence of CO2, while Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalysts exhibit a negative effect on propene formation rates when CO2 is present.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning both the chromium loading and the support properties to optimize catalyst performance in CO2-PDH reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance, particularly when supported on SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond. The optimal Cr loading range appears to be 1.7-8.0 wt%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, the species evolve from mono- and dichromates to polychromates and eventually Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) at loadings above 3.0 wt%.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: More dispersed chromates correlate with higher catalyst activity.

3. Support properties: SiO2 and diamond supports have shown promising results, likely due to their ability to stabilize and disperse chromium species effectively.

4. Presence of oxygen: Adding up to 5.0 vol% O2 to the reaction mixture significantly increases catalyst activity and stability, while also improving total olefin selectivity despite some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The interaction between chromium species and the support material affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium: Cr6+ species, present as mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure of Cr species: Highly dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3, which has a negative influence on catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms to reactants.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: The interaction between chromium species and the silica support affects the dispersion and stability of active sites.

4. Loading: As chromium loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, the formation of less active amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 becomes more likely, potentially reducing overall catalyst performance.

5. Support properties: The nature of the support influences catalytic properties. For example, CO2 has a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 but a negative effect on Cr2O3/Al2O3.

6. Preparation conditions: Factors like calcination temperature and water content affect the final state of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In-situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

The catalytic performance is optimized when there is a high dispersion of Cr6+ species on the support surface, without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases. This is typically achieved at lower chromium loadings on high surface area supports.

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. Three types of chromium species are present in calcined catalysts: Cr3+, water-soluble Cr6+, and grafted Cr6+.

2. At low chromium oxide loadings (&lt;2 wt% CrO3), all chromium exists as grafted Cr6+ species, which reaches a maximum of 1.5 wt% and does not increase further at higher loadings.

3. As loading increases (>4 wt% CrO3), Cr3+ species start to form and increase linearly with loading.

4. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but doesn't fully cover the surface.

6. Catalyst activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings (15.3 wt% CrO3) where activity decreases.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Chromium oxide loading
- Support surface area and crystalline structure
- Distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species
- Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings

While the study focuses on dehydrogenation catalysts rather than CO2-ODHP, these insights into chromium species evolution are likely relevant to other reactions catalyzed by supported chromium oxide catalysts.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Zirconia-supported catalysts are more active than silica or alumina-supported ones for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This is due to increased surface Cr5+ during regeneration, which forms active Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

2. Metal-support interaction: The strong interaction between chromia and basic zirconia support leads to higher amounts of Cr5+, improving activity. However, different supports can favor different types of active species. For example, γ-alumina favors oligomeric chromium oxide species, while SBA-15 favors isolated chromia species with higher coordination numbers.

3. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved performance, as seen with In2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. A mixed oxide of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield among tested indium-based catalysts.

4. Active species: The nature of the active sites is crucial. For chromium catalysts, dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are believed to be the most active. For indium catalysts, small metallic In particles formed by reduction of In2O3 clusters are thought to be the active species.

5. Loading: For chromium catalysts, activity increases with loading up to a point, after which it drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. This highlights the importance of maintaining a highly dispersed active phase.

6. CO2 effect: CO2 can have a beneficial effect through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by retarding catalyst deactivation at sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

1. At low loadings, isolated CrO42- species predominate.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric CrOCr species become prevalent.
3. At higher loadings, Cr2O3 crystallites form, which can lead to decreased activity.
4. The support influences this evolution, with weaker interactions (e.g., with SBA-15) promoting easier crystallite formation compared to stronger interactions (e.g., with alumina).
5. The optimal catalyst typically has a high dispersion of Cr3+ species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

These factors highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

The literature compares Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods for CO2-ODHP and methane partial oxidation reactions. 

For CO2-ODHP, both DHT and TIE samples show similar catalytic properties, with propylene selectivity higher than 90% and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. During the reaction, chromate species on both catalysts are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

For methane partial oxidation, the DHT sample exhibits remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE sample. This difference is attributed to the chromate species structure, which remains intact during the reaction, and the higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT tends to produce mainly monochromate species, while TIE results in a mixture of monochromates and polychromates.

2. Dispersion of chromate species: Higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample leads to better selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in CO2-ODHP.

4. Evolution of chromium species: During CO2-ODHP, chromate species are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination, while they remain stable during methane partial oxidation.

The study does not provide extensive information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does suggest that the preparation method significantly influences the type and dispersion of chromate species, which in turn affects catalytic performance.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Chromium loading: An optimal loading (e.g., 7% in the case of Cr-ZrO2) results in the highest catalytic activity.
2. Oxidation state: Initially, higher concentrations of Cr6+ species contribute to enhanced activity. During the reaction, Cr3+ species become the main active sites.
3. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium species on the support surface lead to better catalytic performance.
4. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species.
5. Surface area
6. Crystalline structure of the support
7. Surface acidity
8. Redox properties

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties involves:

1. Initial state: At lower loadings, isolated Cr6+ species are dominant. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.
2. During reaction: Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main catalytically active species.
3. Redox cycling: The balance between reduction by propane and oxidation by CO2 influences the evolution of chromium species during the reaction.
4. Support effect: The support (e.g., ZrO2) influences the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species, which in turn affects their evolution during the reaction.

The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than that from isolated Cr6+. The presence of CO2 helps maintain the Cr3+ oxidation state, preventing further reduction to less active Cr2+ species.

Various metal oxide catalysts, including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum, have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature and distribution of chromium species: The activity is determined by the types of chromium species present on the support surface. These can exist as isolated units, bulk oxides, or in different agglomeration forms.

2. Degree of crystallization: Isolated chromium species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 support, while oligomeric species are more active on γ-Al2O3 support.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Cr6+ species are crucial for high initial catalytic activity. During the reaction, these are reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance.

4. Chromium loading: As loading increases (e.g., from 3 to 9 wt%), surface area increases, reaching over 1000 m2/g. Lower loadings (e.g., 3 wt%) tend to have predominantly Cr6+ species, while higher loadings (e.g., 5 wt%) show a mix of Cr3+ and Cr6+ states in both isolated and nanoparticle forms.

5. Support properties: The support material affects the dispersion and nature of chromium species, influencing which forms are more active.

6. Presence of CO2: CO2 suppresses partial deactivation by coke formation and enhances propylene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions. Optimizing the balance of different chromium oxidation states and their dispersion on the support is key to achieving high performance.

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium oxidation state: Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, formed from the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, different Cr species form in the order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The silica support influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At higher loadings, α-Cr2O3 crystallites form on top of the dispersed Cr species after complete coverage of the support surface.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading progresses from highly dispersed Cr6+ at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings, with intermediate formation of dispersed oxides and microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide. This progression impacts the number of active sites and catalyst stability.

Additional factors that can influence catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst preparation method, which affects the distribution and oxidation states of chromium species.
- Use of promoters like Ni, which can help maintain the active Cr3+ state and improve catalyst stability.

Among various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be the most active, selective, and stable. However, they operate through different mechanisms:

Gallium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 suppresses coke formation and enhances propene yield by removing H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts: CO2 acts as an oxidant, promoting propene yield through its oxidative abilities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium catalysts include:
1. Chromium loading
2. Preparation conditions
3. Precursor compound of chromium
4. Nature of support

These factors affect the concentration and distribution of redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+), which are crucial for the catalytic mechanism.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts varies with loading and support properties:

- At low Cr loadings with high dispersion: Redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) dominate
- At higher Cr loadings with low dispersion: Non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present

This evolution of chromium species significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. To achieve higher activity in chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP, high dispersion of chromium oxide species at high Cr loadings is desirable.

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with chromium-based catalysts showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt%, which provided the best balance of activity and selectivity. Higher loadings led to decreased activity.

2. Dispersion of active phase: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for good catalytic performance. As loading increases beyond the optimal level, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support played an important role in achieving high activity, likely due to its high surface area and presence of oxygen-containing surface groups. Chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on the external surface of the support.

4. Pore accessibility: At higher loadings, Cr2O3 clusters can partially block micropores, affecting catalyst performance.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from highly dispersed Cr at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings (>5 wt%). This transition correlates with a decrease in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining high Cr dispersion for optimal performance. The formation of α-Cr2O3 was confirmed by XRD analysis, showing characteristic peaks for rhombohedral α-Cr2O3 with space group R3c.

The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst showed superior activity compared to other reported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimizing metal loading and maintaining high dispersion on the active carbon support.

The literature provides insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as particularly effective. They are active, selective, and stable for converting CH4 + CO2 mixtures to synthesis gas and for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to alter their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Manganese was found to be the best modifying additive, with increasing Mn content leading to higher CO2 conversion and decreased coking.

3. Specific catalyst compositions were identified as best performing:
   - 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 for general performance
   - 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 for selective propane conversion with CO2

4. The oxidation state of manganese plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance:
   - Oxidized phases (Mn3O4 and Mn2O3) promote total methane oxidation
   - Reduced phases (MnO and MnCO3) assist methane conversion to synthesis gas
   - Intermediate phases promote methane oxidative coupling

5. For Mn-Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, XRD studies show the presence of MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

6. In Mn-Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts, no direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with SiO2 was observed. Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases are present before the reaction, while MnO and MnCO3 are observed during the reaction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst composition and metal loading
- Oxidation state of active metal components
- Support material and its interactions with active components
- Catalyst preparation method and resulting phase composition

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information about how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in XRD due to high dispersity, suggesting that chromium species are highly dispersed on the support at the loadings studied.

The study compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), not CO2-ODHP as mentioned in the question. Key findings include:

1. Activity: Chromia and vanadia catalysts supported on alumina were significantly more active than tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with turnover frequencies (TOFs) about two orders of magnitude higher. Surface CrOx species showed higher overall TOF than VOx species.

2. Selectivity: Propylene selectivity was inversely related to activity. V2O5/Al2O3 showed 72% selectivity compared to 24% for CrO3/Al2O3.

3. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   - Nature of metal oxide: Different metal oxides showed varying activities and selectivities.
   - Interactions between metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased selectivity from 72% to 49%.
   - Temperature: Propylene yield increased with reaction temperature for all catalysts.
   - Promoter effects: Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) enhanced propylene yields compared to individual metal oxide catalysts.

4. The promotional effect of secondary metal oxide modifiers was not due to new phase formation, changes in redox center strength, or changes in exposed alumina sites.

The study does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses more on comparing different metal oxides and their combinations rather than examining the behavior of chromium species specifically.

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, reaching 85% propane conversion. Further increases do not improve conversion.

2. Chromium species: At loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species are present. Above this, α-Cr2O3 particles appear, which are not active for the reaction.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of Cr species leads to better performance. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method produces more highly dispersed Cr compared to wet impregnation.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing Cr content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

5. Optimal performance: The 6.0 wt% Cr catalyst shows the highest activity, with a propene yield of 69%.

6. Preparation method: MVS produces catalysts with higher Cr dispersion, allowing for optimized activity per Cr atom.

7. Surface area: Catalysts maintain a high specific surface area (around 310 m2/g) up to 6.0 wt% loading, with only slight decreases in total pore volume as chromium content increases.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed, active chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at moderate loadings where dispersion is high and inactive species are minimized.

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key findings include:

1. Activity and selectivity:
- SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
- Cr2O3/Al2O3 had lower activity with CO2 than without.
- Cr2O3/AC showed no difference in activity with or without CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
- Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.
- Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed better performance, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
- Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 was more active for propane dehydrogenation than the reduced form.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
- The Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a vital role in CO2 promotion.
- CO2 helps maintain Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation.
- The oxidation state of Cr2O3 surface changes dynamically during the reaction, influenced by the presence of CO2.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between support properties, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalyst's performance for CO2-ODHP.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show the most promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but further increases lead to decline, possibly due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may affect performance.

4. Support properties: β-Ga2O3 was chosen as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

5. Temperature: CO2 enhances propene yield above 848 K and partially suppresses catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

6. Resistance to coke deposition: Chromium oxide deposition enhances resistance to coke formation.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. At lower loadings, dispersed Cr3+ species form on the β-Ga2O3 surface. As loading increases, these species aggregate and may form larger chromium oxide clusters, potentially explaining the decline in performance at very high loadings. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, balancing increased active sites with maintained surface area.

Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered the most promising for CO2-ODHP due to their high catalytic activity. The key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Chromium dispersion: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic activity.

2. Chromium loading: At low loadings, mononuclear Cr3+ species with coordinative vacancies are prevalent and highly active. As loading increases, less active polymeric species and crystalline Cr2O3 form. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, beyond which catalytic activity decreases.

3. Oxidation state: Initially, Cr6+ species are present on the catalyst surface, especially at low Cr content. These Cr6+ species increase with Cr loading up to 6.8 wt%, correlating with increased catalytic activity. However, under reaction conditions, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, which are believed to be the catalytically active species for dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects chromium dispersion and oxidation state stability, influencing overall catalytic performance. For example, MCM-41 support facilitates high dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading follows this pattern:
- Low loading: Highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species
- Increasing loading: Formation of polymeric species 
- High loading: Crystalline Cr2O3 formation

This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

The study focuses on Cr/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, comparing various loadings (0.25-2.0 wt% Cr) prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Key findings include:

1. Catalyst properties: High surface area (600-1000 m2/g) porous systems were achieved. The only chromium species detected were surface chromates, with the amount of Cr sites linearly proportional to Cr loading.

2. Catalytic performance: The catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation for up to 900-1000 minutes of testing. Propene yields as high as 40-47% were achieved, particularly with CO2 as the oxidant.

3. Influence of oxidants: Different oxidants (CO2, O2, CO2+O2) affected the chromium oxidation state. With CO2 as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of Cr sites was as low as +2, while with O2 (alone or mixed with CO2), it was around +3.

4. Structure-performance relationship: The oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) was correlated with propene selectivity. The difference in oxidation state depending on the oxidant used might contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4.

5. Effect of Cr loading: Increasing Cr content generally led to increased yields of C3H6 and total olefins, with both showing similar trends.

These Cr/SiO2 catalysts demonstrated promising performance for CO2-ODHP, with high stability and good propene yields. The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the Cr loading, the nature of the oxidant, and the resulting oxidation state of the Cr species during the reaction.

The study compared the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity and selectivity: 
   - SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
   - Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC activity was unaffected by CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   a) Support material: SiO2 was crucial for CO2 promotion.
   b) Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 resulted in better CO2 promotion, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
   c) Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active than the reduced catalyst.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
   a) Cr2O3 is reduced in a stream of H2.
   b) CO2 can partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst.
   c) The presence of CO2 maintains Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is believed to be more active for propane dehydrogenation.

The study emphasizes the importance of the support material, Cr2O3 loading, and the oxidation state of chromium in determining the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP. The unique interaction between Cr2O3 and SiO2, particularly at their interface, appears to be crucial for the observed CO2 promotion effect.

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe have been studied for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising results, particularly when supported on SiO2, MCM-41, or diamond.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the type of metal oxide and the support material. Different metal oxides follow different reaction pathways - vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxides tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the chromium loading and support properties are important factors. The study mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a specific surface area of 273 m2g-1. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties for these catalysts.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) vary significantly based on several key factors:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide follows a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The choice of support greatly affects catalyst performance. For example, CrOx/SiO2 shows enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 experiences decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Acidity/basicity of the support: This property strongly influences the catalytic behavior of supported chromium catalysts.

4. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2, increasing chromium content leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

5. Properties of CO2: Both the acidic and redox properties of CO2 play important roles in the dehydrogenation process, affecting reaction yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the loading and support properties. As chromium loading increases, the interaction between chromium species and the support changes, leading to different catalytic behaviors. The support material (e.g., SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly influences how chromium species evolve and interact with CO2, ultimately affecting the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. The activity sequence for C3H6 yield is Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Cr oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading and coverage: A monolayer Cr coverage is generally optimal. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species may decompose to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support affects Cr dispersion and evolution. Metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are commonly used. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41) and carbon-based supports can provide better Cr dispersion.

4. Metal-support interaction: Relatively weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, appear to benefit C3H6 formation.

5. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3. This evolution is heavily influenced by the Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) activity and selectivity. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co supported on MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most active site for the reaction.
2. Catalyst support: MCM-41 support provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, enhancing catalyst performance.
3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher propane conversion, despite decreases in surface area and pore volume.
4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The catalytic cycle involves the transformation between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (active species) and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (reduced form).
5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra) before the reaction.
2. During reaction: Transformation to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra).
3. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr3+O6 to Cr6+O4 by CO2.

This redox cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The Cr/MSU-x catalyst shows excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Lower loadings produce higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading range: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%. Maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occur between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Trade-off between conversion and selectivity: As Cr loading increases, propane conversion increases but propylene selectivity decreases slightly, from 95.3% to about 89%.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous MSU-x support likely contributes to the catalyst's high performance compared to other catalysts in literature.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from dispersed, high oxidation state species at low loadings to bulk Cr2O3 crystals at high loadings. This affects the balance between activity and selectivity, with an optimal range for overall performance. Cr/MSU-x exhibits higher propane conversion than most catalysts reported in literature, demonstrating its effectiveness for CO2-ODHP.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) are influenced by several key factors:

1. Nature of support: Chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience an inhibiting effect from CO2.

2. Chromium loading: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as chromium content decreases. This is measured by the ratio of propene yield in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere.

3. Evolution of chromium species: The redox behavior of chromium species depends on loading and support properties. On silica surfaces, especially at low Cr content, deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. This is because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, allowing further reduction to Cr2+. At higher Cr contents, reduction produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its high stability.

4. Role of CO2: In CO2-ODHP, CO2 acts not only as a diluent and heating medium but also as an oxidant, influencing the catalytic performance.

These factors collectively determine the overall activity and selectivity of the catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, with silica-supported low-loading catalysts generally showing better performance due to their enhanced redox properties and interaction with CO2.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 exhibited the highest activity, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity for styrene. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested (V, Ga, Fe).

2. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which structural changes occurred, leading to decreased dispersion and aggregation of Cr species.

3. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: 
   - Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as the active monochromate species.
   - During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active.
   - The catalytic cycle likely involves a redox process between Cr(III) and Cr(II).

4. Chromium species evolution:
   - At low loadings, isolated Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form on the support surface.
   - As loading increases, these species gradually transform into di- or polychromate species, then amorphous phases, and finally crystalline chromia phases.

5. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure provide an effective support for dispersing chromium species. However, at higher Cr contents, the structural regularity decreases, leading to aggregation.

6. Regeneration ability: Deactivated catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen or CO2, which reoxidizes polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra.

The evolution of chromium species is particularly important, as the transformation from dispersed Cr(VI)O4 to aggregated Cr(III)O6 species during the reaction is linked to catalyst deactivation. The ability to regenerate the active Cr(VI) species through oxidative treatments is key to maintaining catalyst performance.

Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. Chromium oxide catalysts:
   - Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation and were effective for propane dehydrogenation.
   - The promoting effect of CO2 was observed only on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts:
   - Ga2O3 was found to be an effective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
   - Ethylene yield doubled in the presence of CO2 compared to reactions without CO2.
   - Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and selective catalytic reduction of NOx.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Silica appears to be an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
2. Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.
3. Presence of CO2: It acts as a promoter, enhancing yields in some cases.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More detailed studies would be needed to elucidate these aspects.

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, with a focus on Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Key findings and factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2-supported chromium oxides show improved activity with CO2 addition, while Al2O3-supported ones experience reduced activity.

2. Metal loading: Ru modification significantly impacts performance, with a volcano-shaped activity trend observed as a function of Ru loading. The optimal 1 wt% Ru loading resulted in a two-fold enhancement in C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Catalyst composition: The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%. The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt% Ru) showed the highest propane conversion and propylene production rate.

4. Overloading effect: Increasing Ru loading beyond the optimal amount (e.g., to 3 wt%) led to decreased propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. Evolution of chromium species: Cr6+ species are quickly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial reaction period. The reduced chromium species remain stable throughout the reaction, as evidenced by similar XPS peak positions after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction.

6. Redox properties: Ru modification only slightly enhanced the redox properties of the catalysts, suggesting that this enhancement is not the sole reason for improved catalytic activity.

7. Reaction pathways: The main reaction pathway evolves from direct dehydrogenation to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to reforming as Ru loading increases.

These factors demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, metal oxidation states, and catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing catalyst formulations for improved activity and selectivity.

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal level (7 wt% in this study), after which it plateaus due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Chromium species: Various Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr2O3) are present, with their distribution depending on total Cr content. At low loadings (&lt;7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ species dominate, while at higher loadings, Cr6+ coexists with crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Redox properties: Activity is mainly related to reducible Cr sites participating in a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle.

4. Support properties: The high surface area of SBA-1 allows for better dispersion and stabilization of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

5. Oxidation state evolution: During the reaction, high-valent Cr species rapidly reduce to lower oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr2+), which then participate in the catalytic cycle.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, highly active species at lower loadings to a mix of active species and less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at an intermediate loading (7 wt% Cr) that maximizes the number of active, high-valent Cr species while minimizing inactive Cr2O3 formation.

The literature primarily compares Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key findings include:

1. Catalyst activity: Cr/SiO2 activity increases with CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 activity decreases significantly with small CO2 additions.

2. Redox cycle: Both catalysts involve a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 species, which plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 effect: CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) under reaction conditions. For Cr/SiO2, this leads to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species, alongside simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

4. Support influence: The support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly affects the catalyst's response to CO2, suggesting that support properties are a key factor in determining catalytic performance.

5. Chromium species evolution: The oxidation state of chromium changes during the reaction, with Cr(III) being oxidized to Cr(VI) by CO2. This evolution of chromium species is crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism and performance.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
- CO2 partial pressure
- Chromium oxidation state and speciation

The evolution of chromium species depends on:
- Support properties (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
- Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 presence
- Redox cycling between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) species

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on various other metal oxide catalysts or detailed insights into the effect of chromium loading. However, it highlights the importance of support choice, CO2 partial pressure, and the dynamic nature of chromium oxidation states in determining catalyst activity and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODHP.

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium outperformed other metals (V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) is the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox cycle: The reaction involves a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be regenerated using both oxygen and carbon dioxide, with oxygen being more efficient in reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. Support properties: MCM-41, a mesoporous material with high surface area, allows for good dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra on the support surface.
2. During reaction: Reduction of Cr(VI)O4 to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedra.
3. Deactivation: Formation of aggregated Cr(III)O6 species.
4. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 by O2 or CO2.

The loading and support properties affect the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species, which in turn influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and regeneration ability.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties
4. Chromium loading
5. Acidity of the support

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial:

1. Supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSUx), allow for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.
2. A well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield has been observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading.
3. The support's acidity plays a crucial role in determining selectivity. Low acidity supports like SiBeta lead to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while highly acidic supports like AlBeta promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.
4. The choice of support significantly impacts catalyst performance and CO2 interaction. γ-Al2O3 supports lead to CO2 poisoning, while active carbon supports require frequent regeneration.
5. In switch operation mode, Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts show increased propene formation rates in the presence of CO2, while Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalysts exhibit a negative effect on propene formation rates when CO2 is present.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning both the chromium loading and the support properties to optimize catalyst performance in CO2-PDH reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance, particularly when supported on SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond. The optimal Cr loading range appears to be 1.7-8.0 wt%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, the species evolve from mono- and dichromates to polychromates and eventually Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) at loadings above 3.0 wt%.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: More dispersed chromates correlate with higher catalyst activity.

3. Support properties: SiO2 and diamond supports have shown promising results, likely due to their ability to stabilize and disperse chromium species effectively.

4. Presence of oxygen: Adding up to 5.0 vol% O2 to the reaction mixture significantly increases catalyst activity and stability, while also improving total olefin selectivity despite some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The interaction between chromium species and the support material affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium: Cr6+ species, present as mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure of Cr species: Highly dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3, which has a negative influence on catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms to reactants.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: The interaction between chromium species and the silica support affects the dispersion and stability of active sites.

4. Loading: As chromium loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, the formation of less active amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 becomes more likely, potentially reducing overall catalyst performance.

5. Support properties: The nature of the support influences catalytic properties. For example, CO2 has a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 but a negative effect on Cr2O3/Al2O3.

6. Preparation conditions: Factors like calcination temperature and water content affect the final state of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In-situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

The catalytic performance is optimized when there is a high dispersion of Cr6+ species on the support surface, without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases. This is typically achieved at lower chromium loadings on high surface area supports.

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. Three types of chromium species are present in calcined catalysts: Cr3+, water-soluble Cr6+, and grafted Cr6+.

2. At low chromium oxide loadings (&lt;2 wt% CrO3), all chromium exists as grafted Cr6+ species, which reaches a maximum of 1.5 wt% and does not increase further at higher loadings.

3. As loading increases (>4 wt% CrO3), Cr3+ species start to form and increase linearly with loading.

4. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but doesn't fully cover the surface.

6. Catalyst activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings (15.3 wt% CrO3) where activity decreases.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Chromium oxide loading
- Support surface area and crystalline structure
- Distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species
- Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings

While the study focuses on dehydrogenation catalysts rather than CO2-ODHP, these insights into chromium species evolution are likely relevant to other reactions catalyzed by supported chromium oxide catalysts.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Zirconia-supported catalysts are more active than silica or alumina-supported ones for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This is due to increased surface Cr5+ during regeneration, which forms active Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

2. Metal-support interaction: The strong interaction between chromia and basic zirconia support leads to higher amounts of Cr5+, improving activity. However, different supports can favor different types of active species. For example, γ-alumina favors oligomeric chromium oxide species, while SBA-15 favors isolated chromia species with higher coordination numbers.

3. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved performance, as seen with In2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. A mixed oxide of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield among tested indium-based catalysts.

4. Active species: The nature of the active sites is crucial. For chromium catalysts, dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are believed to be the most active. For indium catalysts, small metallic In particles formed by reduction of In2O3 clusters are thought to be the active species.

5. Loading: For chromium catalysts, activity increases with loading up to a point, after which it drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. This highlights the importance of maintaining a highly dispersed active phase.

6. CO2 effect: CO2 can have a beneficial effect through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by retarding catalyst deactivation at sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

1. At low loadings, isolated CrO42- species predominate.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric CrOCr species become prevalent.
3. At higher loadings, Cr2O3 crystallites form, which can lead to decreased activity.
4. The support influences this evolution, with weaker interactions (e.g., with SBA-15) promoting easier crystallite formation compared to stronger interactions (e.g., with alumina).
5. The optimal catalyst typically has a high dispersion of Cr3+ species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

These factors highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

The literature compares Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods for CO2-ODHP and methane partial oxidation reactions. 

For CO2-ODHP, both DHT and TIE samples show similar catalytic properties, with propylene selectivity higher than 90% and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. During the reaction, chromate species on both catalysts are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

For methane partial oxidation, the DHT sample exhibits remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE sample. This difference is attributed to the chromate species structure, which remains intact during the reaction, and the higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT tends to produce mainly monochromate species, while TIE results in a mixture of monochromates and polychromates.

2. Dispersion of chromate species: Higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample leads to better selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in CO2-ODHP.

4. Evolution of chromium species: During CO2-ODHP, chromate species are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination, while they remain stable during methane partial oxidation.

The study does not provide extensive information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does suggest that the preparation method significantly influences the type and dispersion of chromate species, which in turn affects catalytic performance.

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Chromium loading: An optimal loading (e.g., 7% in the case of Cr-ZrO2) results in the highest catalytic activity.
2. Oxidation state: Initially, higher concentrations of Cr6+ species contribute to enhanced activity. During the reaction, Cr3+ species become the main active sites.
3. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium species on the support surface lead to better catalytic performance.
4. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species.
5. Surface area
6. Crystalline structure of the support
7. Surface acidity
8. Redox properties

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties involves:

1. Initial state: At lower loadings, isolated Cr6+ species are dominant. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.
2. During reaction: Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main catalytically active species.
3. Redox cycling: The balance between reduction by propane and oxidation by CO2 influences the evolution of chromium species during the reaction.
4. Support effect: The support (e.g., ZrO2) influences the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species, which in turn affects their evolution during the reaction.

The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than that from isolated Cr6+. The presence of CO2 helps maintain the Cr3+ oxidation state, preventing further reduction to less active Cr2+ species.

Various metal oxide catalysts, including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum, have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature and distribution of chromium species: The activity is determined by the types of chromium species present on the support surface. These can exist as isolated units, bulk oxides, or in different agglomeration forms.

2. Degree of crystallization: Isolated chromium species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 support, while oligomeric species are more active on γ-Al2O3 support.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Cr6+ species are crucial for high initial catalytic activity. During the reaction, these are reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance.

4. Chromium loading: As loading increases (e.g., from 3 to 9 wt%), surface area increases, reaching over 1000 m2/g. Lower loadings (e.g., 3 wt%) tend to have predominantly Cr6+ species, while higher loadings (e.g., 5 wt%) show a mix of Cr3+ and Cr6+ states in both isolated and nanoparticle forms.

5. Support properties: The support material affects the dispersion and nature of chromium species, influencing which forms are more active.

6. Presence of CO2: CO2 suppresses partial deactivation by coke formation and enhances propylene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions. Optimizing the balance of different chromium oxidation states and their dispersion on the support is key to achieving high performance.
