[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "Generally, CrOx possesses various types of Cr species, depending on the loading weight of the Cr precursor. As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

[6] "Cr3+ formed from the reduction of higher valence states, that is, Cr6+, are active sites in the ODPH reaction."

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

[5] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R3c."

[6] "It should therefore be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support. The formed clusters and crystallites of Cr2O3 partially block an access to the micropores."

[1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols."

[3] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[4] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[5] "The catalyst of the composition 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al203 was the best one."

[6] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs."

[7] "A study of the X-ray structure of the catalyst in situ shows that oxidized Mn phases Mn304 and Mn2O3 promote total methane oxidation (in non-steady-state conditions); reduced phases MnO and MnC03 assist methane conversion into synthesis gas; intermediate phases, where 0- stabilization is possible, promote methane oxidative coupling."

[8] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

[9] "In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst the X-ray diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases are observed before the reaction and MnO and MnC03 are observed during the reaction."

[1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."

[5] "The propylene yields of the modified supported vanadiaalumina catalysts were greater than those of the individual supported metal oxide catalysts at all temperatures."

[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion - it remains on the level of 80%."

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

[7] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3]AI2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

[6] "It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition."

[7] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The UVvis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

[6] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."

[7] "The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants conversion."

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

[5] "Yields in both C3H6 and total olefins (just + 3-5%) exhibited a similar trend by increasing the Cr loading, indicating that basic and side reactions were affected in a similar way by this parameter."

[6] "It is noteworthy that in the case of 2.0-Cr/DHS YC3H6 of ca. 47% was attained using CO2 as oxidant, which is significantly higher than the performance of the best catalyst reviewed by Cavani et al.."

[7] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

[8] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."

[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[6] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

[1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≈ 50% and olefin ≈ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

[6] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."

[7] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[5] "According to the Cr K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[5] "Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, including catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."

[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "The increase in Cr content leads gradually to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and finally crystalline -chromia phases."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

[6] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%."

[7] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."

[8] "It is considered that, at higher Cr contents, the dispersion of Cr species decreased by the aggregation (vide infra) partly due to the decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure."

[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

[4] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[5] "Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[6] "No Cr6+ was detected in any of the three samples, demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period of reaction"

[7] "Takahara et al. discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."

[8] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

[1] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."

[4] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites)."

[5] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[6] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O8 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [6,9,10,14,18,27,28]."

[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32]."

[5] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined."

[6] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium–silica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UV–vis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

[7] "Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."

[8] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

[7] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 6008C: (i) a Cr31 species; (ii) a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; (iii) a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."

[8] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[9] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

[1] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[2] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[3] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[4] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[5] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[6] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[7] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[8] "At low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak."

[9] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[10] "In recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements."

[11] "With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16."

[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[5] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Furthermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."

[3] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[4] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[5] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

[6] "Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area, crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%)."

[7] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."

[8] "For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane."

[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "The catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "Most of the practical methods reported for the preparation of Cr-loaded catalysts resulted in a variety of chromium species. Chromium can be present as an isolated unit and/or bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms."

[5] "The degree of crystallization of the chromium species is also considered to be another important factor in the dehydrogenation reactions. It has been reported in the literature that isolated chromium species are more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than crystalline α-Cr2O3 when SBA-15 was used as the support. On the contrary, oligomeric chromium species were more active than isolated chromium species when γ-Al2O3 was used as the support"

[6] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

[7] "With increase in the chromium loading from 3 to 9 wt%, the surface area was found to increase, and reached more than 1000 m2 g1 at the highest loading of 9% investigated in this study."

[8] "As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies. In the case of 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 sample, the spectra reveal that there might be both 3+ and 6+ states of Cr in isolated and abundant amounts of nanoparticles."

[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "Generally, CrOx possesses various types of Cr species, depending on the loading weight of the Cr precursor. As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

[6] "Cr3+ formed from the reduction of higher valence states, that is, Cr6+, are active sites in the ODPH reaction."

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

[5] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R3c."

[6] "It should therefore be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support. The formed clusters and crystallites of Cr2O3 partially block an access to the micropores."

[1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols."

[3] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[4] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[5] "The catalyst of the composition 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al203 was the best one."

[6] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs."

[7] "A study of the X-ray structure of the catalyst in situ shows that oxidized Mn phases Mn304 and Mn2O3 promote total methane oxidation (in non-steady-state conditions); reduced phases MnO and MnC03 assist methane conversion into synthesis gas; intermediate phases, where 0- stabilization is possible, promote methane oxidative coupling."

[8] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

[9] "In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst the X-ray diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases are observed before the reaction and MnO and MnC03 are observed during the reaction."

[1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."

[5] "The propylene yields of the modified supported vanadiaalumina catalysts were greater than those of the individual supported metal oxide catalysts at all temperatures."

[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion - it remains on the level of 80%."

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

[7] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3]AI2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

[6] "It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition."

[7] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."

[3] "De Rossi et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

[4] "The UVvis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes"

[6] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."

[7] "The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants conversion."

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

[5] "Yields in both C3H6 and total olefins (just + 3-5%) exhibited a similar trend by increasing the Cr loading, indicating that basic and side reactions were affected in a similar way by this parameter."

[6] "It is noteworthy that in the case of 2.0-Cr/DHS YC3H6 of ca. 47% was attained using CO2 as oxidant, which is significantly higher than the performance of the best catalyst reviewed by Cavani et al.."

[7] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

[8] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."

[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[6] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

[1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≈ 50% and olefin ≈ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

[6] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."

[7] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[5] "According to the Cr K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[5] "Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, including catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."

[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "The increase in Cr content leads gradually to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and finally crystalline -chromia phases."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

[6] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%."

[7] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."

[8] "It is considered that, at higher Cr contents, the dispersion of Cr species decreased by the aggregation (vide infra) partly due to the decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure."

[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

[4] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[5] "Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[6] "No Cr6+ was detected in any of the three samples, demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period of reaction"

[7] "Takahara et al. discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."

[8] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

[1] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."

[4] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites)."

[5] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[6] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O8 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [6,9,10,14,18,27,28]."

[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32]."

[5] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined."

[6] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium–silica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UV–vis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

[7] "Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."

[8] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

[7] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 6008C: (i) a Cr31 species; (ii) a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; (iii) a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."

[8] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[9] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

[1] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[2] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[3] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[4] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[5] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[6] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[7] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[8] "At low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak."

[9] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[10] "In recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements."

[11] "With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16."

[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[5] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Furthermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."

[3] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[4] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[5] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

[6] "Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area, crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%)."

[7] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."

[8] "For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane."

[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "The catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "Most of the practical methods reported for the preparation of Cr-loaded catalysts resulted in a variety of chromium species. Chromium can be present as an isolated unit and/or bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms."

[5] "The degree of crystallization of the chromium species is also considered to be another important factor in the dehydrogenation reactions. It has been reported in the literature that isolated chromium species are more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than crystalline α-Cr2O3 when SBA-15 was used as the support. On the contrary, oligomeric chromium species were more active than isolated chromium species when γ-Al2O3 was used as the support"

[6] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

[7] "With increase in the chromium loading from 3 to 9 wt%, the surface area was found to increase, and reached more than 1000 m2 g1 at the highest loading of 9% investigated in this study."

[8] "As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies. In the case of 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 sample, the spectra reveal that there might be both 3+ and 6+ states of Cr in isolated and abundant amounts of nanoparticles."
