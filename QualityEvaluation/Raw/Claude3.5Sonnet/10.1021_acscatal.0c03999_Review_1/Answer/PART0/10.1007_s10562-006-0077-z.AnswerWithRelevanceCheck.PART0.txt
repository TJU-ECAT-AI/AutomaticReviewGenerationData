          [1] "Several different bulk and supported oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active components [110] and potassium oxide was introduced as promoter [7,8]."

[2] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to 6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increases, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr content."

[4] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."

[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption (figure 1)."

[6] "It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition."

[7] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

          Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Among these, chromium and gallium oxide-based materials show the most promising results due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium content: Increasing Cr content up to 6.8 wt% gradually improves propene yield, but further increases lead to decline, possibly due to lower surface area.

2. Surface species: Deposition of chromium oxide on β-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Acidity: Cr deposition decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may affect performance.

4. Support properties: β-Ga2O3 was chosen as a support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area.

5. Temperature: CO2 enhances propene yield above 848 K and partially suppresses catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

6. Resistance to coke deposition: Chromium oxide deposition enhances resistance to coke formation.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. At lower loadings, dispersed Cr3+ species form on the β-Ga2O3 surface. As loading increases, these species aggregate and may form larger chromium oxide clusters, potentially explaining the decline in performance at very high loadings. The optimal loading appears to be around 6.8 wt% Cr, balancing increased active sites with maintained surface area.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物，已被用于CO2-ODHP反应测试。其中，铬和镓氧化物基材料由于其高脱氢活性和选择性而表现出最佳效果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬含量：随着Cr含量增加到6.8 wt%，丙烯产率逐渐提高，但进一步增加会导致性能下降，可能是由于表面积降低。

2. 表面物种：在β-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物会生成高活性的表面Cr3+物种，这些物种在脱氢反应中非常活跃。

3. 酸度：Cr沉积降低了催化剂表面Lewis酸位的强度，这可能会影响性能。

4. 载体性质：选择β-Ga2O3作为载体是因为它具有高脱氢活性、热稳定性和相对较高的比表面积。

5. 温度：在848 K以上，CO2提高了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。

6. 抗积碳能力：氧化铬的沉积提高了抗积碳能力。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在较低负载量时，分散的Cr3+物种在β-Ga2O3表面形成。随着负载量的增加，这些物种会聚集并可能形成更大的铬氧化物簇，这可能解释了在非常高的负载量下性能下降的原因。最佳负载量似乎在6.8 wt%铬左右，这平衡了增加的活性位点和保持的表面积。
