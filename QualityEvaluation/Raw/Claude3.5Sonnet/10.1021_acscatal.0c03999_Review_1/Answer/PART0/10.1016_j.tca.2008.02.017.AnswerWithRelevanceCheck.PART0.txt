          [1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

[5] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R3c."

[6] "It should therefore be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support. The formed clusters and crystallites of Cr2O3 partially block an access to the micropores."

          Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with chromium-based catalysts showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt%, which provided the best balance of activity and selectivity. Higher loadings led to decreased activity.

2. Dispersion of active phase: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for good catalytic performance. As loading increases beyond the optimal level, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support played an important role in achieving high activity, likely due to its high surface area and presence of oxygen-containing surface groups. Chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on the external surface of the support.

4. Pore accessibility: At higher loadings, Cr2O3 clusters can partially block micropores, affecting catalyst performance.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from highly dispersed Cr at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings (>5 wt%). This transition correlates with a decrease in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining high Cr dispersion for optimal performance. The formation of α-Cr2O3 was confirmed by XRD analysis, showing characteristic peaks for rhombohedral α-Cr2O3 with space group R3c.

The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst showed superior activity compared to other reported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimizing metal loading and maintaining high dispersion on the active carbon support.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn，已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，其中铬基催化剂显示出特别高的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属负载量：对于Cr催化剂，最佳负载量约为5 wt%，在活性和选择性之间提供了最佳平衡。更高的负载量会导致活性降低。

2. 活性相的分散度：高度分散的铬物种对于良好的催化性能至关重要。当负载量超过最佳水平时，会形成结晶α-Cr2O3相，这对脱氢反应的活性较低。

3. 载体性质：活性炭载体在实现高活性方面起着重要作用，这可能是由于其高比表面积和含氧表面基团的存在。铬氧化物物种主要沉积在载体的外表面。

4. 孔隙可及性：在更高的负载量下，Cr2O3团簇可能会部分阻塞微孔，影响催化剂性能。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高度分散Cr到高负载时(>5 wt%)的结晶α-Cr2O3的转变。这种转变与催化活性的降低相关，突出了保持高Cr分散度对于最佳性能的重要性。α-Cr2O3的形成通过XRD分析得到确认，显示出菱面体α-Cr2O3（空间群R3c）的特征峰。

Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂与其他报道的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢催化剂相比，显示出优越的活性，证明了优化金属负载量和保持活性炭载体上高分散度的有效性。
