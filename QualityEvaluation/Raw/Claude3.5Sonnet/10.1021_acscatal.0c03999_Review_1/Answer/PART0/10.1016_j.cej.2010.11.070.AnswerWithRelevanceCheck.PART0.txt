          [1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion - it remains on the level of 80%."

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

[7] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

          The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, reaching 85% propane conversion. Further increases do not improve conversion.

2. Chromium species: At loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species are present. Above this, α-Cr2O3 particles appear, which are not active for the reaction.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of Cr species leads to better performance. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method produces more highly dispersed Cr compared to wet impregnation.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing Cr content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

5. Optimal performance: The 6.0 wt% Cr catalyst shows the highest activity, with a propene yield of 69%.

6. Preparation method: MVS produces catalysts with higher Cr dispersion, allowing for optimized activity per Cr atom.

7. Surface area: Catalysts maintain a high specific surface area (around 310 m2/g) up to 6.0 wt% loading, with only slight decreases in total pore volume as chromium content increases.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed, active chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at moderate loadings where dispersion is high and inactive species are minimized.

          这项研究主要关注了用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）的硅胶负载铬氧化物催化剂。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬负载量增加而提高，在6.0 wt%时达到85%的丙烷转化率。进一步增加负载量并未改善转化率。

2. 铬物种：在负载量不超过6.0 wt%时，仅存在铬酸盐物种。超过这个负载量，α-Cr2O3颗粒开始出现，但这些颗粒对反应不活跃。

3. 分散度：铬物种的高分散度导致更好的性能。金属蒸气合成（MVS）方法与湿法浸渍相比，产生了更高分散度的铬。

4. 选择性：丙烯选择性随铬含量增加略有下降，从0.25 wt%铬时的87%降至10.0 wt%铬时的78%。

5. 最佳性能：6.0 wt%铬的催化剂显示出最高活性，丙烯产率达69%。

6. 制备方法：MVS制备的催化剂具有更高的铬分散度，可以优化每个铬原子的活性。

7. 比表面积：催化剂在负载量达到6.0 wt%之前保持较高的比表面积（约310 m2/g），随着铬含量的增加，总孔体积只有轻微下降。

铬物种随负载量的演变显示，高度分散的活性铬酸盐物种形成可达6.0 wt%，超过这个水平后会出现无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在适度负载量下达到最佳活性，此时分散性高且无活性物种最少。
