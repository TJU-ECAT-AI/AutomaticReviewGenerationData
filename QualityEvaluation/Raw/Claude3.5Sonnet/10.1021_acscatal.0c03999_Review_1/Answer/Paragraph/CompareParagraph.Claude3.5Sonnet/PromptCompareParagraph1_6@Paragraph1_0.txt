<file-attachment-contents filename="Review A.txt"> 
Metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) have been extensively studied, with chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts emerging as the most promising due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.040]. Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown particularly high performance, especially when supported on silica-based materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, and SBA-15 [10.1007/s11144-006-0024-4].

The catalytic performance of supported chromium oxide catalysts is influenced by several key factors:

1. Chromium loading: Activity generally increases with Cr content up to an optimal level, typically around 5-7 wt%, beyond which it plateaus or decreases [10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017] [10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.05.011].

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Initially, Cr6+ species in tetrahedral coordination are present as active monochromate species. During the reaction, these are reduced to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4]. The redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ plays a crucial role in the catalytic process [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014].

3. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher dispersion of Cr species leads to better catalytic performance. Monolayer Cr coverage is generally considered optimal for activity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_1].

4. Support properties: The nature of the support significantly affects catalyst performance. SiO2-based supports generally show better results than Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports [10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4].

5. Presence of CO2: CO2 enhances propene yield and suppresses catalyst deactivation for SiO2-supported catalysts, while it has a negative effect on Al2O3-supported catalysts [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80785-4].

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties follows a general pattern:

1. At low loadings, isolated Cr6+ species dominate, primarily as mono- and dichromates [10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019].
2. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form [10.1021/cr5002436].
3. At higher loadings, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide and eventually crystalline α-Cr2O3 form [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

This evolution significantly impacts catalytic performance, with the optimal catalyst typically having a high dispersion of Cr species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive evaluation of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, particularly chromium-based catalysts, reveals the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing novel support materials or surface modifications to enhance Cr dispersion and stability at higher loadings.
2. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts to synergistically improve activity and selectivity.
3. Investigating the potential of in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic evolution of Cr species during the reaction.
4. Optimizing reaction conditions, such as CO2:propane ratio and temperature, to maximize catalyst performance and longevity.
5. Addressing environmental concerns related to chromium usage by developing more sustainable alternatives or improving Cr utilization efficiency.

These avenues of research could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2-ODHP, potentially bridging the gap between laboratory studies and industrial applications.

Metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) have been extensively studied, with chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts emerging as the most promising due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.040]. Among these, chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2) have shown particularly high performance [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

Key factors influencing the catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Chromium loading: The optimal loading typically ranges from 5-7 wt%, with the best results achieved at around 6.8 wt% Cr [10.1016/j.cej.2010.11.070] [10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.05.011]. Higher loadings can lead to decreased activity due to the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 [10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017].

2. Oxidation state and species distribution: Initially, Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates are crucial for high catalytic activity. During the reaction, these are reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation [10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3] [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008].

3. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher dispersion generally leads to better catalytic performance. Supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous materials (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x), allow for high dispersion of chromium oxide species [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018].

4. Support properties: The nature of the support significantly affects catalyst performance. SiO2-supported catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, while Al2O3-supported catalysts experience decreased yield and selectivity [10.1007/s10562-004-3749-6].

5. Presence of CO2: CO2 acts as an oxidant in the reaction, enhancing propene yield and suppressing catalyst deactivation by maintaining Cr in a partially oxidized state [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80785-4].

6. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+ and Cr3+/Cr2+ species is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4].

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_1]. This evolution is heavily influenced by the chromium coverage and textural properties of the support.

At low loadings, highly dispersed mononuclear Cr3+ and Cr6+ species dominate. As loading increases, polymeric species form, and eventually, at higher loadings, crystalline α-Cr2O3 appears. This progression significantly impacts the number of active sites and catalyst stability [10.1002/cctc.201200397].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive evaluation of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, particularly focusing on chromium-based systems, reveals the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions. Future research directions may include:

1. Development of novel support materials that can maintain high chromium dispersion even at higher loadings, potentially leading to catalysts with improved activity and stability.

2. Investigation of bimetallic or multi-component catalysts that combine the beneficial properties of different metal oxides, such as the high activity of chromium with the stability of other elements.

3. In-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic evolution of chromium species under reaction conditions, which could guide the design of more efficient catalysts.

4. Exploration of strategies to fine-tune the redox properties of chromium species, potentially through doping or precise control of the support's surface chemistry.

5. Development of regeneration protocols that can effectively restore the initial distribution of chromium species, extending catalyst lifetime and improving process economics.

These avenues of research could lead to significant advancements in CO2-ODHP technology, potentially enabling more efficient and sustainable production of propylene from propane.
