The comprehensive evaluation of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) encompasses a wide range of research activities, from initial screening to detailed analysis of promising candidates. This systematic approach begins with a broad assessment of various metal oxide catalysts, examining their potential for efficiently converting propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. As the screening process narrows down the most promising options, chromium-based catalysts emerge as particularly noteworthy contenders. Researchers then delve into an in-depth analysis of these chromium catalysts, investigating crucial performance factors such as conversion rates, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions. The evolution of active species during the catalytic process is scrutinized to understand the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface. Furthermore, structure-activity relationships are explored to elucidate the correlation between the catalyst's composition, morphology, and catalytic performance. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of CO2-ODHP but also paves the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for propylene production.
