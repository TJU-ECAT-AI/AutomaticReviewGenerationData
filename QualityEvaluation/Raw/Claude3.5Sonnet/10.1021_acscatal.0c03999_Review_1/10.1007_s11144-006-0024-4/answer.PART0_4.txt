[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe have been studied for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising results, particularly CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/MCM-41, and CrOx/Diamond systems.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the type of metal oxide and the support material. Different metal oxides follow different reaction pathways - vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxides tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the chromium loading and support properties are important factors. The study mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a specific surface area of 273 m2g-1. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties for these catalysts.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe，已被研究用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）。其中，以氧化铬为基础的催化剂显示出最有前途的结果，特别是CrOx/SiO2、CrOx/MCM-41和CrOx/Diamond系统。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是金属氧化物的类型和支撑材料。不同的金属氧化物遵循不同的反应途径 - 钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物倾向于遵循氧化途径，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原途径。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬负载量和支撑材料的性质是重要因素。研究提到了一种制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，其铬负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积为273 m2g-1。然而，文献并未提供关于这些催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量和支撑材料性质变化的详细信息。
