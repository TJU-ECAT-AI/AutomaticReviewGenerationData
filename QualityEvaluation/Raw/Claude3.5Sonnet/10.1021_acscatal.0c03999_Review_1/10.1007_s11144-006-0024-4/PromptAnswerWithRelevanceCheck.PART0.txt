[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

The literature compares several metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe oxides. Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts are identified as the most promising, with CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/MCM-41, and CrOx/Diamond systems showing the best catalytic performance.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide and the support material. The reaction pathway also differs among catalysts, with vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts following an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is influenced by loading and support properties. The literature mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption method with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a specific surface area (SBET) of 273 m2g-1. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties for various supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

文献比较了几种用于CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe氧化物。其中，以氧化铬为基础的催化剂被认为是最有前景的，CrOx/SiO2、CrOx/MCM-41和CrOx/Diamond系统显示出最佳的催化性能。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型和载体材料。不同催化剂的反应路径也有所不同，钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂遵循氧化路径，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原路径。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。文献提到了一种通过平衡吸附法制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，其Cr负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积（SBET）为273 m2g-1。然而，该文档并未提供关于各种负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe have been studied for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising performance, particularly when supported on SiO2, MCM-41, or diamond.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the metal oxide used and the support material. Most metal oxides (V, Cr, Ce, Fe) follow an oxidative pathway for dehydrogenation, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway. This suggests that the mechanistic pathway is an important factor in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

For chromium-based catalysts specifically, the loading amount and support properties play a crucial role. The study mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a surface area of 273 m2/g. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading or support properties for these catalysts.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe，已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）。在这些催化剂中，铬氧化物基催化剂显示出最有前景的性能，特别是当它们被负载在SiO2、MCM-41或金刚石上时。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是所使用的金属氧化物和载体材料。大多数金属氧化物（V、Cr、Ce、Fe）遵循氧化途径进行脱氢，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原途径。这表明反应机理途径是决定催化剂活性和选择性的重要因素。

具体对于铬基催化剂，负载量和载体性质起着至关重要的作用。研究提到了一种CrOx/SiO2催化剂，其铬负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积为273 m2/g。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量或载体性质变化的详细信息。

The literature provides some information on various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but does not give a comprehensive comparison of their activities and selectivities. It mentions that Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe oxides have been tested, with chromium oxide-based catalysts being among the most promising. Specifically, CrOx supported on SiO2, MCM-41, and diamond showed the best catalytic performance.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance are not extensively discussed in the given text. However, it is noted that different metal oxides may operate via different mechanisms. Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts are proposed to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information. It only mentions that for the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption, the chromium loading was 0.9 wt% and the specific surface area was 273 m2g-1. The text does not discuss how chromium species evolve as a function of loading or support properties.

文献提供了一些关于CO2-ODHP的各种金属氧化物催化剂的信息，但没有给出它们活性和选择性的全面比较。它提到已经测试了Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe氧化物，其中以铬氧化物为基础的催化剂最有前途。具体来说，负载在SiO2、MCM-41和金刚石上的CrOx显示出最佳的催化性能。

文中并未广泛讨论影响催化性能的关键因素。然而，文中指出不同的金属氧化物可能通过不同的机制运作。钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂被认为遵循氧化途径，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原途径。

关于负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，文献没有提供详细信息。它只提到通过平衡吸附法制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，铬负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积为273 m2g-1。文中没有讨论铬物种如何随负载量或载体性质的变化而演变。

For most metal oxides (V, Cr, Ce, Fe), an oxidative pathway is proposed, while for gallium oxide, a non-redox pathway is more likely. This suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation varies depending on the metal oxide used.

Regarding chromium species evolution, the literature does not provide detailed information on how chromium species change as a function of loading and support properties. However, it mentions that for the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption, a chromium loading of 0.9 wt% resulted in a specific surface area of 273 m2g-1. This suggests that the support properties (in this case, surface area) are affected by chromium loading, but more detailed information on the evolution of chromium species is not provided in the given text.
