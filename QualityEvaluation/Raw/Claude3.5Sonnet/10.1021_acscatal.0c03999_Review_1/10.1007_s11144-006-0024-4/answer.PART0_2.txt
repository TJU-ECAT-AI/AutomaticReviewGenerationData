[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

The literature provides some information on various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but does not give a comprehensive comparison of their activities and selectivities. It mentions that Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe oxides have been tested, with chromium oxide-based catalysts being among the most promising. Specifically, CrOx supported on SiO2, MCM-41, and diamond showed the best catalytic performance.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance are not extensively discussed in the given text. However, it is noted that different metal oxides may operate via different mechanisms. Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts are proposed to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information. It only mentions that for the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption, the chromium loading was 0.9 wt% and the specific surface area was 273 m2g-1. The text does not discuss how chromium species evolve as a function of loading or support properties.

文献提供了一些关于CO2-ODHP的各种金属氧化物催化剂的信息，但没有给出它们活性和选择性的全面比较。它提到已经测试了Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe氧化物，其中以铬氧化物为基础的催化剂最有前途。具体来说，负载在SiO2、MCM-41和金刚石上的CrOx显示出最佳的催化性能。

文中并未广泛讨论影响催化性能的关键因素。然而，文中指出不同的金属氧化物可能通过不同的机制运作。钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂被认为遵循氧化途径，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原途径。

关于负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，文献没有提供详细信息。它只提到通过平衡吸附法制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，铬负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积为273 m2g-1。文中没有讨论铬物种如何随负载量或载体性质的变化而演变。
