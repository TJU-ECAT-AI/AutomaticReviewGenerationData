[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe have been studied for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising performance, particularly when supported on SiO2, MCM-41, or diamond.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the nature of the metal oxide and the support material. For most metal oxides (V, Cr, Ce, Fe), an oxidative pathway is proposed, while for gallium oxide, a non-redox pathway is more likely. This suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation varies depending on the metal oxide used.

Regarding chromium species evolution, the literature does not provide detailed information on how chromium species change as a function of loading and support properties. However, it mentions that for the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption, a chromium loading of 0.9 wt% resulted in a specific surface area of 273 m2g-1. This suggests that the support properties (in this case, surface area) are affected by chromium loading, but more detailed information on the evolution of chromium species is not provided in the given text.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe，已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）。在这些催化剂中，铬氧化物基催化剂表现出最有前景的性能，特别是当它们负载在SiO2、MCM-41或金刚石上时。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是金属氧化物的性质和载体材料。对于大多数金属氧化物（V、Cr、Ce、Fe），提出了氧化途径，而对于氧化镓，非氧化还原途径更可能。这表明脱氢机理因所使用的金属氧化物而异。

关于铬物种的演变，文献没有提供关于铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。然而，它提到对于通过平衡吸附法制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，0.9 wt%的铬负载量导致了273 m2g-1的比表面积。这表明载体性质（在这种情况下，表面积）受铬负载量的影响，但文中没有提供关于铬物种演变的更详细信息。
