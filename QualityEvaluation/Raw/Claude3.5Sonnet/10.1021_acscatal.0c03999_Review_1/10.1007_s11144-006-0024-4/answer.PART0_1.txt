[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe have been studied for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts have shown the most promising performance, particularly when supported on SiO2, MCM-41, or diamond.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be the metal oxide used and the support material. Most metal oxides (V, Cr, Ce, Fe) follow an oxidative pathway for dehydrogenation, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway. This suggests that the mechanistic pathway is an important factor in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

For chromium-based catalysts specifically, the loading amount and support properties play a crucial role. The study mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a surface area of 273 m2/g. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading or support properties for these catalysts.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe，已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）。在这些催化剂中，铬氧化物基催化剂显示出最有前景的性能，特别是当它们被负载在SiO2、MCM-41或金刚石上时。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是所使用的金属氧化物和载体材料。大多数金属氧化物（V、Cr、Ce、Fe）遵循氧化途径进行脱氢，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原途径。这表明反应机理途径是决定催化剂活性和选择性的重要因素。

具体对于铬基催化剂，负载量和载体性质起着至关重要的作用。研究提到了一种CrOx/SiO2催化剂，其铬负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积为273 m2/g。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量或载体性质变化的详细信息。
