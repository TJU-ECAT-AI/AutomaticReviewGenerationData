[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[3] "For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively."

The literature compares several metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, including Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe oxides. Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts are identified as the most promising, with CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/MCM-41, and CrOx/Diamond systems showing the best catalytic performance.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide and the support material. The reaction pathway also differs among catalysts, with vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts following an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is influenced by loading and support properties. The literature mentions a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption method with 0.9 wt% Cr loading and a specific surface area (SBET) of 273 m2g-1. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties for various supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

文献比较了几种用于CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Ce和Fe氧化物。其中，以氧化铬为基础的催化剂被认为是最有前景的，CrOx/SiO2、CrOx/MCM-41和CrOx/Diamond系统显示出最佳的催化性能。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型和载体材料。不同催化剂的反应路径也有所不同，钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂遵循氧化路径，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原路径。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。文献提到了一种通过平衡吸附法制备的CrOx/SiO2催化剂，其Cr负载量为0.9 wt%，比表面积（SBET）为273 m2g-1。然而，该文档并未提供关于各种负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。
