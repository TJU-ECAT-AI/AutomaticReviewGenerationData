[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion - it remains on the level of 80%."

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "Almost equal catalytic activity of 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS and 5.0%Cr/SiO2-WI catalysts supposed that due to the higher dispersion of chromium species the amount of active centres on the surface of 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was comparable with the amount of active centres on the surface of SiO2-WI - the catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity generally increased with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, reaching 85% propane conversion. Further increases did not improve conversion.

2. Chromium species: At loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species were present. Above this, -Cr2O3 particles appeared, which were not active for the reaction.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of Cr species led to better performance. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method produced more highly dispersed Cr compared to wet impregnation (WI).

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreased with increasing Cr content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

5. Optimal performance: The 6.0 wt% Cr catalyst showed the highest activity, with a propene yield of 69%.

6. Preparation method: MVS produced catalysts with higher Cr dispersion, allowing similar activity at much lower loadings compared to WI catalysts.

These factors demonstrate the importance of optimizing Cr loading and dispersion to balance activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP catalysts.

这项研究主要关注了以二氧化硅为载体的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性通常随铬负载量增加而提高，在6.0 wt%时达到85%的丙烷转化率。进一步增加负载量并未改善转化率。

2. 铬物种：在负载量不超过6.0 wt%时，仅存在铬酸盐物种。超过这个负载量，-Cr2O3颗粒开始出现，但这些颗粒对反应不活跃。

3. 分散度：铬物种的高分散度导致更好的性能。金属蒸气合成（MVS）方法与湿法浸渍（WI）相比，产生了更高分散度的铬。

4. 选择性：丙烯选择性随铬含量增加略有下降，从0.25 wt%铬时的87%降至10.0 wt%铬时的78%。

5. 最佳性能：6.0 wt%铬的催化剂显示出最高活性，丙烯产率达69%。

6. 制备方法：MVS制备的催化剂具有更高的铬分散度，与WI催化剂相比，在much更低的负载量下就能达到相似的活性。

这些因素表明，在CO2-ODHP催化剂中，优化铬负载量和分散度以平衡活性和选择性的重要性。
