[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "Up to the Cr loading of 6.0 wt% the porosity of the catalysts was similar to that exhibited by the bare support, indicating that highly dispersed chromium particles do not block silica pores."

[3] "For the catalysts with low Cr loadings (0.5 and 1.3 wt%) and then increase progressively with the increase of the chromium content"

[4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

[5] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

[6] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP is influenced by several key factors:

1. Chromium loading: The activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%. Beyond this, additional loading does not improve performance.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: MVS technique allows for highly dispersed chromium species on silica surface up to 6.0 wt% loading, optimizing activity per Cr atom.

3. Nature of chromium species: Mono- and polychromate species are active for the reaction. At higher loadings (>6.0 wt%), inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear.

4. Surface area and porosity: Up to 6.0 wt% loading, the catalysts maintain high surface area and porosity similar to the bare support.

5. Acid sites: Formation of chromate species is accompanied by Brønsted acid sites, which increase with Cr content and can lead to coke formation.

6. Support properties: The silica support allows for high dispersion of chromium species without significant pore blocking up to 6.0 wt% loading.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed, active chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at moderate loadings where dispersion is high and inactive species are minimized.

支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化性能受几个关键因素影响：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬负载量增加而提高，最高可达6.0 wt%。超过这个水平，额外的负载不会改善性能。

2. 铬物种的分散性：MVS技术允许在二氧化硅表面上高度分散铬物种，铬负载量最高可达6.0 wt%，优化了每个铬原子的活性。

3. 铬物种的性质：单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种对反应是活性的。在更高的负载量（>6.0 wt%）下，会出现无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。

4. 表面积和孔隙度：在6.0 wt%负载量以下，催化剂保持高表面积和与裸支持体相似的孔隙度。

5. 酸性位点：铬酸盐物种的形成伴随着Brønsted酸性位点的产生，这些位点随铬含量增加而增加，可能导致积碳形成。

6. 载体性质：二氧化硅载体允许在6.0 wt%负载量以下高度分散铬物种，而不会显著堵塞孔隙。

铬物种随负载量的演变显示，高度分散的活性铬酸盐物种形成可达6.0 wt%，超过这个水平后会出现无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在适度负载量下达到最佳活性，此时分散性高且无活性物种最少。
