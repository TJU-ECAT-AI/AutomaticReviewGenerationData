[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "Up to the Cr loading of 6.0 wt% the porosity of the catalysts was similar to that exhibited by the bare support, indicating that highly dispersed chromium particles do not block silica pores."

[3] "For the catalysts with low Cr loadings (0.5 and 1.3 wt%) and then increase progressively with the increase of the chromium content"

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion"

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

The activity and selectivity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP are influenced by several key factors:

1. Chromium loading: As Cr loading increases from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, propane conversion increases, reaching 85% at 6.0 wt%. However, further increase to 10.0 wt% does not improve conversion.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: At lower loadings (up to 6.0 wt%), highly dispersed chromium particles are formed without blocking silica pores. This high dispersion contributes to increased catalytic activity.

3. Nature of chromium species: The catalytic activity is related to the presence of chromate species (mono- and polychromates) grafted on the silica surface. These are the active species for the reaction.

4. Formation of inactive species: At loadings above 6.0 wt%, α-Cr2O3 particles start to form on the catalyst surface. These particles are not active in the CO2-ODHP process.

5. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

6. Surface area and porosity: The catalysts maintain a high specific surface area (around 310 m2/g) up to 6.0 wt% loading, with only slight decreases in total pore volume as chromium content increases.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is crucial for catalyst performance. At lower loadings, well-dispersed chromate species form, leading to high activity. As loading increases, these species increase in number, improving conversion. However, beyond 6.0 wt%, the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 particles begins, which does not contribute to further improvement in catalytic performance.

Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性受以下几个关键因素影响：

1. 铬负载量：当Cr负载量从0.25增加到6.0 wt%时，丙烷转化率增加，在6.0 wt%时达到85%。然而，进一步增加到10.0 wt%并不会提高转化率。

2. 铬物种的分散度：在较低的负载量（最高6.0 wt%）下，形成高度分散的铬颗粒，不会堵塞二氧化硅孔隙。这种高分散度有助于提高催化活性。

3. 铬物种的性质：催化活性与硅胶表面接枝的铬酸盐物种（单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐）的存在有关。这些是反应的活性物种。

4. 非活性物种的形成：当负载量超过6.0 wt%时，α-Cr2O3颗粒开始在催化剂表面形成。这些颗粒在CO2-ODHP过程中不活跃。

5. 选择性：随着铬含量的增加，丙烯选择性略有下降，从0.25 wt% Cr时的87%降至10.0 wt% Cr时的78%。

6. 比表面积和孔隙度：催化剂在负载量达到6.0 wt%之前保持较高的比表面积（约310 m2/g），随着铬含量的增加，总孔体积只有轻微下降。

铬物种随负载量的演变对催化剂性能至关重要。在较低负载量下，形成分散良好的铬酸盐物种，导致高活性。随着负载量的增加，这些物种数量增加，提高了转化率。然而，超过6.0 wt%后，开始形成非活性α-Cr2O3颗粒，这不会进一步提高催化性能。
