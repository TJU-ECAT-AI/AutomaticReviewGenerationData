[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."

[4] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion - it remains on the level of 80%."

[5] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."

[6] "Almost equal catalytic activity of 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS and 5.0%Cr/SiO2-WI catalysts supposed that due to the higher dispersion of chromium species the amount of active centres on the surface of 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was comparable with the amount of active centres on the surface of SiO2-WI - the catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity generally increased with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, reaching 85% propane conversion. Further increases did not improve conversion.

2. Chromium species: At loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species were present. Above this, -Cr2O3 particles appeared, which were not active for the reaction.

3. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of Cr species led to better performance. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method produced more highly dispersed Cr compared to wet impregnation (WI).

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreased with increasing Cr content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

5. Optimal performance: The 6.0 wt% Cr catalyst showed the highest activity, with a propene yield of 69%.

6. Preparation method: MVS produced catalysts with higher Cr dispersion, allowing similar activity at much lower loadings compared to WI catalysts.

These factors demonstrate the importance of optimizing Cr loading and dispersion to balance activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP catalysts.

这项研究主要关注了以二氧化硅为载体的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性通常随铬负载量增加而提高，在6.0 wt%时达到85%的丙烷转化率。进一步增加负载量并未改善转化率。

2. 铬物种：在负载量不超过6.0 wt%时，仅存在铬酸盐物种。超过这个负载量，-Cr2O3颗粒开始出现，但这些颗粒对反应不活跃。

3. 分散度：铬物种的高分散度导致更好的性能。金属蒸气合成（MVS）方法与湿法浸渍（WI）相比，产生了更高分散度的铬。

4. 选择性：丙烯选择性随铬含量增加略有下降，从0.25 wt%铬时的87%降至10.0 wt%铬时的78%。

5. 最佳性能：6.0 wt%铬的催化剂显示出最高活性，丙烯产率达69%。

6. 制备方法：MVS制备的催化剂具有更高的铬分散度，与WI催化剂相比，在much更低的负载量下就能达到相似的活性。

这些因素表明，在CO2-ODHP催化剂中，优化铬负载量和分散度以平衡活性和选择性的重要性。

[1] "Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%)"

[2] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion"

[3] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr). Selectivity to ethylene was on the level of 78% in all investigated range of the chromium loading."

[4] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

[5] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, then plateaus. Propane conversion reaches 85% at 6.0 wt% Cr.

2. Preparation method: Metal vapor synthesis (MVS) achieves higher dispersion and activity per Cr atom compared to wet impregnation. A 0.5 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by MVS shows similar activity to a 5.0 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by wet impregnation.

3. Chromium species: Catalytic activity is related to dispersed chromate species (mono- and polychromates) on the silica surface. At loadings above 6.0 wt%, inactive Cr2O3 particles form instead of additional active chromate species.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing Cr content (87% at 0.25 wt% to 78% at 10.0 wt%). Ethylene selectivity remains constant at 7-8%.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which bulk Cr2O3 particles start to appear, leading to a plateau in catalytic activity.

这项研究主要关注了用于CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)的硅胶负载铬氧化物催化剂。影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 铬负载量:活性随铬含量增加而提高,直至6.0 wt%后趋于平稳。在6.0 wt%铬含量时,丙烷转化率达到85%。

2. 制备方法:与湿法浸渍相比,金属蒸气合成(MVS)法可获得更高的分散度和每个铬原子的活性。通过MVS制备的0.5 wt%铬催化剂显示出与湿法浸渍制备的5.0 wt%铬催化剂相似的活性。

3. 铬物种:催化活性与硅胶表面分散的铬酸盐物种(单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐)有关。当负载量超过6.0 wt%时,会形成无活性的Cr2O3颗粒,而不是额外的活性铬酸盐物种。

4. 选择性:丙烯选择性随铬含量增加略有下降(从0.25 wt%时的87%降至10.0 wt%时的78%)。乙烯选择性保持在7-8%的稳定水平。

随着负载量的变化,铬物种的演变显示,高度分散的铬酸盐物种形成可达到6.0 wt%,超过这个含量后,块状Cr2O3颗粒开始出现,导致催化活性趋于平稳。

The activity and selectivity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for CO2-ODHP are influenced by several key factors:

1. Chromium loading: As Cr loading increases from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, propane conversion increases, reaching 85% at 6.0 wt%. However, further increase to 10.0 wt% does not improve conversion.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: At lower loadings (up to 6.0 wt%), highly dispersed chromium particles are formed without blocking silica pores. This high dispersion contributes to increased catalytic activity.

3. Nature of chromium species: The catalytic activity is related to the presence of chromate species (mono- and polychromates) grafted on the silica surface. These are the active species for the reaction.

4. Formation of inactive species: At loadings above 6.0 wt%, α-Cr2O3 particles start to form on the catalyst surface. These particles are not active in the CO2-ODHP process.

5. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr.

6. Surface area and porosity: The catalysts maintain a high specific surface area (around 310 m2/g) up to 6.0 wt% loading, with only slight decreases in total pore volume as chromium content increases.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is crucial for catalyst performance. At lower loadings, well-dispersed chromate species form, leading to high activity. As loading increases, these species increase in number, improving conversion. However, beyond 6.0 wt%, the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 particles begins, which does not contribute to further improvement in catalytic performance.

Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性受以下几个关键因素影响：

1. 铬负载量：当Cr负载量从0.25增加到6.0 wt%时，丙烷转化率增加，在6.0 wt%时达到85%。然而，进一步增加到10.0 wt%并不会提高转化率。

2. 铬物种的分散度：在较低的负载量（最高6.0 wt%）下，形成高度分散的铬颗粒，不会堵塞二氧化硅孔隙。这种高分散度有助于提高催化活性。

3. 铬物种的性质：催化活性与硅胶表面接枝的铬酸盐物种（单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐）的存在有关。这些是反应的活性物种。

4. 非活性物种的形成：当负载量超过6.0 wt%时，α-Cr2O3颗粒开始在催化剂表面形成。这些颗粒在CO2-ODHP过程中不活跃。

5. 选择性：随着铬含量的增加，丙烯选择性略有下降，从0.25 wt% Cr时的87%降至10.0 wt% Cr时的78%。

6. 比表面积和孔隙度：催化剂在负载量达到6.0 wt%之前保持较高的比表面积（约310 m2/g），随着铬含量的增加，总孔体积只有轻微下降。

铬物种随负载量的演变对催化剂性能至关重要。在较低负载量下，形成分散良好的铬酸盐物种，导致高活性。随着负载量的增加，这些物种数量增加，提高了转化率。然而，超过6.0 wt%后，开始形成非活性α-Cr2O3颗粒，这不会进一步提高催化性能。

The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP is influenced by several key factors:

1. Chromium loading: The activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%. Beyond this, additional loading does not improve performance.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: MVS technique allows for highly dispersed chromium species on silica surface up to 6.0 wt% loading, optimizing activity per Cr atom.

3. Nature of chromium species: Mono- and polychromate species are active for the reaction. At higher loadings (>6.0 wt%), inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear.

4. Surface area and porosity: Up to 6.0 wt% loading, the catalysts maintain high surface area and porosity similar to the bare support.

5. Acid sites: Formation of chromate species is accompanied by Brønsted acid sites, which increase with Cr content and can lead to coke formation.

6. Support properties: The silica support allows for high dispersion of chromium species without significant pore blocking up to 6.0 wt% loading.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed, active chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which inactive α-Cr2O3 particles appear. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at moderate loadings where dispersion is high and inactive species are minimized.

支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化性能受几个关键因素影响：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬负载量增加而提高，最高可达6.0 wt%。超过这个水平，额外的负载不会改善性能。

2. 铬物种的分散性：MVS技术允许在二氧化硅表面上高度分散铬物种，铬负载量最高可达6.0 wt%，优化了每个铬原子的活性。

3. 铬物种的性质：单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种对反应是活性的。在更高的负载量（>6.0 wt%）下，会出现无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。

4. 表面积和孔隙度：在6.0 wt%负载量以下，催化剂保持高表面积和与裸支持体相似的孔隙度。

5. 酸性位点：铬酸盐物种的形成伴随着Brønsted酸性位点的产生，这些位点随铬含量增加而增加，可能导致积碳形成。

6. 载体性质：二氧化硅载体允许在6.0 wt%负载量以下高度分散铬物种，而不会显著堵塞孔隙。

铬物种随负载量的演变显示，高度分散的活性铬酸盐物种形成可达6.0 wt%，超过这个水平后会出现无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在适度负载量下达到最佳活性，此时分散性高且无活性物种最少。
