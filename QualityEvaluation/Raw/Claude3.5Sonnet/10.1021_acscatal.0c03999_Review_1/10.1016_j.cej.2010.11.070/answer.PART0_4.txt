[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[2] "Up to the Cr loading of 6.0 wt% the porosity of the catalysts was similar to that exhibited by the bare support, indicating that highly dispersed chromium particles do not block silica pores."

[3] "By increasing the Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15) all mentioned bands progressively increased in intensity and underwent a light shift towards high frequency, but no other band was observed. At a higher Cr loading 10.0 wt% the intensity of the bands at 40,000, 27,000 and 21,500 cm1 increased insignificantly and a new band at 16,500 cm1 that can be assigned to the lowest CT transition occurring in -Cr2O3 was observed"

[4] "Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%)"

[5] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion  it remains on the level of 80%."

[6] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr). Selectivity to ethylene was on the level of 78% in all investigated range of the chromium loading."

[7] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

[8] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: As Cr loading increases from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, propane conversion increases, reaching 85% at 6.0 wt%. However, further increase to 10.0 wt% does not improve conversion.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows for highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface up to 6.0 wt% loading. This high dispersion contributes to better catalytic activity per Cr atom.

3. Nature of chromium species: The catalytic activity is related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. At loadings above 6.0 wt%, inactive α-Cr2O3 particles start to form instead of additional mono- or polychromate species.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78% at 10.0 wt% Cr. Ethylene selectivity remains constant at 7-8% across all loadings.

5. Preparation method: The MVS method produces catalysts with higher activity per Cr atom compared to wet impregnation. A 0.5 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by MVS shows similar propane conversion to a 5.0 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by wet impregnation.

6. Support properties: The highly dispersed chromium particles do not significantly affect the porosity of the silica support up to 6.0 wt% loading, maintaining a high specific surface area of around 310 m2/g.

These factors contribute to the evolution of chromium species and their impact on catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

该研究主要关注了用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应的硅胶负载铬氧化物催化剂。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：随着铬负载量从0.25增加到6.0 wt%，丙烷转化率增加，在6.0 wt%时达到85%。然而，进一步增加到10.0 wt%并不会提高转化率。

2. 铬物种的分散度：金属蒸气合成（MVS）技术可以在硅胶表面上获得高度分散的铬物种，直到6.0 wt%的负载量。这种高分散度有助于提高每个铬原子的催化活性。

3. 铬物种的性质：催化活性与接枝在硅胶表面上的各种核数的铬酸盐物种有关。当负载量超过6.0 wt%时，开始形成无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒，而不是额外的单核或多核铬酸盐物种。

4. 选择性：随着铬含量的增加，丙烯选择性略有下降，从0.25 wt%铬时的87%降至10.0 wt%铬时的78%。在所有负载量范围内，乙烯选择性保持在7-8%的恒定水平。

5. 制备方法：与湿法浸渍相比，MVS方法制备的催化剂每个铬原子的活性更高。通过MVS制备的0.5 wt%铬催化剂显示出与湿法浸渍制备的5.0 wt%铬催化剂相似的丙烷转化率。

6. 载体性质：高度分散的铬颗粒在6.0 wt%负载量以下不会显著影响硅胶载体的孔隙度，保持了约310 m2/g的高比表面积。

这些因素共同影响了铬物种的演变及其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。
