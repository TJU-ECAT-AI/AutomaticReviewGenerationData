[1] "Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%)"

[2] "Propane conversion increased with the increase of chromium loading and on the catalyst with 6.0 wt% of chromium attained 85%. The further increase of the chromium loading up to 10.0 wt% do not result in the additional increase of propane conversion"

[3] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr). Selectivity to ethylene was on the level of 78% in all investigated range of the chromium loading."

[4] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or polychromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

[5] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr loading up to 6.0 wt%, then plateaus. Propane conversion reaches 85% at 6.0 wt% Cr.

2. Preparation method: Metal vapor synthesis (MVS) achieves higher dispersion and activity per Cr atom compared to wet impregnation. A 0.5 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by MVS shows similar activity to a 5.0 wt% Cr catalyst prepared by wet impregnation.

3. Chromium species: Catalytic activity is related to dispersed chromate species (mono- and polychromates) on the silica surface. At loadings above 6.0 wt%, inactive Cr2O3 particles form instead of additional active chromate species.

4. Selectivity: Propene selectivity slightly decreases with increasing Cr content (87% at 0.25 wt% to 78% at 10.0 wt%). Ethylene selectivity remains constant at 7-8%.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows that highly dispersed chromate species form up to 6.0 wt%, beyond which bulk Cr2O3 particles start to appear, leading to a plateau in catalytic activity.

这项研究主要关注了用于CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)的硅胶负载铬氧化物催化剂。影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 铬负载量:活性随铬含量增加而提高,直至6.0 wt%后趋于平稳。在6.0 wt%铬含量时,丙烷转化率达到85%。

2. 制备方法:与湿法浸渍相比,金属蒸气合成(MVS)法可获得更高的分散度和每个铬原子的活性。通过MVS制备的0.5 wt%铬催化剂显示出与湿法浸渍制备的5.0 wt%铬催化剂相似的活性。

3. 铬物种:催化活性与硅胶表面分散的铬酸盐物种(单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐)有关。当负载量超过6.0 wt%时,会形成无活性的Cr2O3颗粒,而不是额外的活性铬酸盐物种。

4. 选择性:丙烯选择性随铬含量增加略有下降(从0.25 wt%时的87%降至10.0 wt%时的78%)。乙烯选择性保持在7-8%的稳定水平。

随着负载量的变化,铬物种的演变显示,高度分散的铬酸盐物种形成可达到6.0 wt%,超过这个含量后,块状Cr2O3颗粒开始出现,导致催化活性趋于平稳。
