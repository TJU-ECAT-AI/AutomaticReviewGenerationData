The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Instead, it focuses on Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of Ga2O3-based catalysts include:

1. Composition: Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions show improved activity and stability compared to pure Ga2O3.

2. Surface acidity: Weak Lewis acid sites, particularly those related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, are important for high activity and stability.

3. Support effects: Supported gallium oxides can be more active and stable than bulk Ga2O3.

4. Coking resistance: Introduction of Al2O3 in Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions improves resistance to coking and catalyst deactivation.

5. Thermal stability: Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions maintain their structure and surface area better than pure Ga2O3 after repeated regeneration cycles.

The study does not provide information on chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，也没有讨论负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。相反，它主要关注Ga2O3基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

影响Ga2O3基催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 组成：Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体相比纯Ga2O3表现出更好的活性和稳定性。

2. 表面酸性：弱Lewis酸位点，特别是与四面体表面Ga3+位点相关的酸位，对高活性和稳定性很重要。

3. 载体效应：负载型氧化镓比块状Ga2O3更活跃和稳定。

4. 抗结焦性：在Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中引入Al2O3可以改善抗结焦性和催化剂失活。

5. 热稳定性：经过反复再生循环后，Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体比纯Ga2O3能更好地保持其结构和比表面积。

这项研究没有提供关于负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的信息。
