[1] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5, 1721]."

[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8. Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."

[3] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."

[4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Instead, it focuses on Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

For Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts, the key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Composition: GaxAl10xO15 with x=8 showed maximum activity.

2. Aluminum content: Higher aluminum content improved stability.

3. Surface acidity: A high population of weak Lewis acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important for high activity.

4. Solid solution formation: The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions results in abundant tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, enhancing catalytic activity.

While the literature provides insights into Ga2O3-based catalysts, it does not address the specific question about chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts or compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，也没有讨论负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。相反，它主要关注Ga2O3基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

对于Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 组成：GaxAl10xO15中x=8时显示最大活性。

2. 铝含量：更高的铝含量提高了稳定性。

3. 表面酸性：与四面体配位Ga3+阳离子相关的弱Lewis酸位点的高密度对于获得高活性很重要。

4. 固溶体形成：Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成导致大量四面体配位表面Ga3+位点，增强了催化活性。

虽然该文献提供了关于Ga2O3基催化剂的见解，但它并未涉及负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的具体问题，也没有比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现。
