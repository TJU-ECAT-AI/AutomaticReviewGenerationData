[1] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."

[2] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."

[3] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density. This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or discuss chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Instead, it focuses on gallia-alumina mixed oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance of the studied gallia-alumina catalysts include:

1. Aluminum content: Higher aluminum content in Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides led to enhanced stability.

2. Surface acidity: A high population of weak Lewis acid sites, specifically related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, was crucial for achieving high activity and stability.

3. Acid site strength: Weak surface acidity correlated positively with propane conversion rates, while medium-strong acidity showed a negative correlation.

These findings suggest that the optimal catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation over gallia-alumina catalysts is achieved by tailoring the composition and surface properties to maximize weak Lewis acid sites while minimizing medium-strong acid sites.

该文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，也没有讨论负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。相反，它主要关注镓-铝混合氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。

影响所研究的镓-铝催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铝含量：Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物中较高的铝含量导致稳定性增强。

2. 表面酸性：高密度的弱Lewis酸位，特别是与四面体配位的Ga3+阳离子相关的酸位，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。

3. 酸位强度：弱表面酸性与丙烷转化率呈正相关，而中强酸性则呈负相关。

这些发现表明，通过调整组成和表面性质以最大化弱Lewis酸位并最小化中强酸位，可以实现镓-铝催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的最佳催化性能。
