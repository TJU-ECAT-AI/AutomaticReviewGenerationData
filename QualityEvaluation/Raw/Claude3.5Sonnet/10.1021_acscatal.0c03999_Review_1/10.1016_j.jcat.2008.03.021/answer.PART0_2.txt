[1] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."

[2] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."

[3] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density. This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

[4] "Given the thermally metastable nature of the γ -type gallium oxide materials [32,34,48], to gain further insight into the affect of repeated regeneration on the phase structure in relation to the catalytic behavior of the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxides, the phase structure of the twice-regenerated catalysts (Fig. 9) was evaluated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 10."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Instead, it focuses on gallium-alumina mixed oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

For the gallium-alumina catalysts studied, key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Aluminum content: Higher aluminum content in Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts led to enhanced stability.

2. Surface acidity: A high population of weak Lewis acid sites, specifically related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, was crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Medium-strong acid sites showed a negative correlation with activity.

3. Thermal stability: The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions improved the thermal stability of the catalysts compared to pure γ-Ga2O3, allowing better performance after repeated regeneration cycles.

These findings suggest that catalyst composition, surface acidity, and thermal stability are important factors in determining catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. However, the study does not provide information on CO2-ODHP specifically or the behavior of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，也没有讨论负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。相反，它主要关注镓-氧化铝混合氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

对于所研究的镓-氧化铝催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铝含量：Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂中较高的铝含量可以提高稳定性。

2. 表面酸性：高密度的弱Lewis酸位点，特别是与四面体配位的Ga3+阳离子相关的酸位点，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。中强酸位点与活性呈负相关。

3. 热稳定性：Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成提高了催化剂的热稳定性，相比纯γ-Ga2O3，在多次再生循环后表现更好。

这些发现表明，催化剂组成、表面酸性和热稳定性是决定丙烷脱氢催化性能的重要因素。然而，该研究并未提供关于CO2-ODHP或负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种行为的具体信息。
