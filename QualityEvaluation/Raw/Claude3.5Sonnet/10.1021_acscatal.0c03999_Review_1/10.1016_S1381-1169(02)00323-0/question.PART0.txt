Abstract
Mn-MCM-41 is found to be the most effective heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene with tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) among several metal ion-containing mesoporous molecular sieves including Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-, and
Mo-MCM-41. ESR, XANES, diffuse reflectance UVVIS, UVRaman and XPS are used to characterize the Mn-MCM-41
synthesized by both direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template ion exchange (TIE) methods. The results suggest that Mn2+
and Mn3+ coexist in the Mn-MCM-41 samples synthesized by both methods and a large part of manganese atoms could
be incorporated into the framework of MCM-41 obtained by the DHT method. The oxidation of either styrene or stilbene
with TBHP as the oxidant over the Mn-MCM-41 produces corresponding epoxide as the main product; the reaction probably
proceeds through a radical intermediate. The TIE catalyst shows higher activity, while the DHT catalyst gives higher TBHP
efficiency for the epoxidation reactions.

1. Introduction
Since
MCM-41
possesses
large
surface
area
(1000 m2 g1) and uniform mesopore with con-
trollable diameter of 210 nm, it is expected as a
desirable material for catalytic applications. However,
in most cases, siliceous mesoporous materials do not
have sufficient intrinsic activities as catalysts, and
thus many studies have concentrated on introducing
catalytically active sites such as metals, metal ions
and metal complexes into mesoporous silica [1,2].

The most popular method for the introduction of ac-
tive sites is the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method,
i.e. direct addition of the metal ion precursors to the
synthesis gel before hydrothermal synthesis. The con-
ventional impregnation method has also been used
to deposit active component onto MCM-41; however
this method cannot ensure the incorporation of active
species into the mesopore of MCM-41, and some
contractions of channels seem to occur during wet
impregnation [3]. Several groups reported grafting
methods [46], i.e. grafting of organometallic com-
plexes or metal ions onto the surface of mesoporous
silica by using surface silanol groups as anchor sites.
Metal ions can also be implanted into MCM-41 with
the template ion exchange (TIE) method [7], i.e. by

exchanging the template cations embraced in the cha-
nnels of the as-synthesized MCM-41 with the metal
ions in solution.
It can be expected that different synthetic meth-
ods would result in different environments of the
active sites introduced to MCM-41. Oldroyd et al. [8]
reported that Ti-MCM-41 prepared by surface graft-
ing method was more active than that prepared by
the DHT method for the epoxidation of cyclohex-
ene with TBHP. We have shown that V-MCM-41
prepared by the TIE and DHT methods possesses
different coordination environment of vanadium and
behaves differently in the partial oxidation of lower
alkanes [911]. Vanadium species introduced by the
TIE method are mainly dispersed on the surface of
channel, preferring the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane and propane, whereas vanadium sites intro-
duced by the DHT method are mainly incorporated
inside the framework of MCM-41, capable of oxi-
dizing propane to acrolein with moderate selectivity.
Recently, we found that Fe-MCM-41 prepared by the
TIE and DHT methods showed remarkably different
coordination environment of iron, resulting in differ-
ent catalytic performance for epoxidation of styrene
with H2O2 [12].
Manganese complexes are well known catalysts for
epoxidation reactions [13]. Recently, many research
groups worked on the immobilization of Mn com-
plexes onto the mesoporous material. Although ion-
exchange method was applied to Al-MCM-41 [14],
only lower loading amount can be obtained by this
method. Caps and Tsang [15] prepared Mn-MCM-41
with a molecular organic chemical vapor deposi-
tion (MOCVD) method. Burch et al. [16] prepared
surface-grafted manganese-oxo species on the walls
of MCM-41 channels and applied it for the complete
oxidation of propene. Iwamoto and coworkers [7]
firstly developed the TIE method for the synthesis of
Mn-MCM-41, and they argued that manganese was
highly dispersed in the mesopore of MCM-41 and
only existed as Mn2+. The Mn-MCM-41 thus pre-
pared exhibited high activity for the epoxidation of
stilbene with TBHP [17].
In the present paper, several metal ion-containing
mesoporous molecular sieves including Mn-, V-, Cr-,
Fe- and Mo-MCM-41 are screened for the epoxidation
of styrene using TBHP as an oxidant. With the most
effective Mn-MCM-41, the influences of synthetic
methods (the DHT and TIE methods) on the nature
of manganese species and catalytic properties in the
epoxidation of either styrene or stilbene are subse-
quently investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
MCM-41 was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis
at 120 C for 96 h using sodium silicate and hexade-
cyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33(CH3)3NBr)
as the silicon source and the template, respectively.
For the TIE synthesis of Mn-MCM-41, 2 g of the
as-synthesized MCM-41 containing ca. 50 wt.% tem-
plate cations was added to an aqueous solution of man-
ganese(II) nitrate (e.g. 48.7 mg Mn(NO3)2·6H2O in
40 ml of H2O for the preparation of the Mn-MCM-41,
TIE, Si/Mn = 124). The mixture was stirred vigor-
ously at ambient temperature for 1 h, and then kept
at 80 C for 20 h. The as-synthesized Mn-MCM-41
(TIE) was finally calcined by heating to 550 C
at a rate of 1 C min1 and kept at 550 C for 6 h
in a flow of dry air (1 dm3 min1). For the DHT
synthesis of Mn-MCM-41, the solution of man-
ganese nitrate was added to the mixture of sodium
silicate and C16H33(CH3)3NBr. For the synthesis
of the Mn-MCM41 (DHT, Si/Mn = 91), 41.7 mg
Mn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to the mixture of 15.4 g
of sodium silicate and 26.4 g of C16H33(CH3)3NBr in
350 ml H2O. After hydrothermal synthesis at 120 C
for 96 h, the product was filtered, washed thoroughly
with deionized water, dried at 40 C in vacuum for
24 h and finally calcined by the same procedure as
described for the TIE method.
Vanadium, chromium and iron were also intro-
duced to MCM-41 by the DHT method following
the same procedure described above using VOC2O4,
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as the sources
of V, Cr, and Fe respectively. Molybdenum was
introduced by the TIE method using MoO2-AA
(bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum dioxide(II)) as
the source of Mo.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded
with an SRA M18XHF diffractometer using Cu K

radiation (40 kV, 300 mA). Small divergent and scat-
tering slits (0.05 and 0.05 mm) were used to avoid the
high background radiation at low diffraction angle.
N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K were measured using
a BELSORP 18SP apparatus (volumetric), and pore
size distribution was obtained by the Dollimore and
Heal (DH) method [18]. The content of manganese
in each sample was determined by ICP measurement
using a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000.
ESR spectroscopic measurements were carried
out at X-band (9 GHz) using a JEOL RE series
JES-RE1X ESR spectrometer. The powdery sample
was loaded into a quartz tube with inner diameter of
3 mm and measured at ambient temperature. X-ray
absorption experiments were carried out at Photon
Factory in National Laboratory for High Energy
Physics (KEK-PF), Tsukuba, Japan, on the BL7C sta-
tion with apparatus operated in the fluorescence and
transmission modes with a doublecrystal Si (1 1 1)
monochrometer. Ring energy and ring current were
2.5 GeV and about 350380 mA, respectively. Energy
was calibrated with Mn K-edge absorption of Mn foil
(6538.0 eV). Energy step of measurement in XANES
region was 0.3 eV.
The diffuse reflectance UVVIS spectra were
recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UVVISNIR spectrom-
eter (Lambda 900). The powder was loaded in a quartz
cell, and the spectra were collected between 200 and
700 nm referenced to BaSO4. UVRaman measure-
ments were carried out using a Renishaw UVVIS
Raman System 1000R. The UV line at 325 nm from
a Kimmon IK3201R-F HeCd laser was used as the
exciting source. A laser output of 30 mW was used
and the maximum incident power at the sample was
approximately 6 mW. XPS measurements were per-
formed on a Shimadzu ESCA-85 spectrometer work-
ing with a hemispherical analyzer. All binding energy
values were referenced to C 1s (284.6 eV).
2.3. Catalytic reaction
Styrene (>98%), trans-stilbene (>98%), tert-butyl
hydroperoxide
(TBHP)
(70%
aqueous
solution)
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and cis-stilbene
(>95%) (Tokyo Kasei) were used as reactants without
further purification. Catalytic reactions were carried
out according to the following procedure. Substrate,
solvent and catalyst were first introduced into a
round-bottom flask. After oxidant was added, the re-
action was started by immersing the flask into water
bath kept at the reaction temperature. The reaction
was carried out under violent stirring. All the products
were quantified by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu
GC-14B) equipped with a BPX5 capillary column
and an FID detector using toluene as an internal stan-
dard. tert-Butyl alcohol produced from TBHP was
also analyzed, from which TBHP conversion was es-
timated. GCMS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP5050A) and
NMR (JEOL FT-NMR Lambda 400NMR) were also
used to identify the products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Epoxidation of styrene over several metal
ion-containing MCM-41
Table 1 shows the catalytic results of several metal
ion-containing MCM-41 in the epoxidation of styrene
using TBHP as an oxidant. It should be noted that
XRD measurements of all these samples showed four
diffraction lines at 2θ degrees of 26ascribed to the
(1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) of MCM-41, sug-
gesting that the mesoporous structure was retained
after the introduction of each metal ion. The oxidation
of styrene gave two main products, i.e. styrene oxide
and benzaldehyde (abbreviated as Sty.oxide and Ben-
zald., respectively in Tables 1, 4 and 5), and TBHP
was converted into tert-butyl alcohol. The efficiency
of TBHP was evaluated from the amount of the ox-
idative products produced from styrene divided by
the amount of the TBHP consumed. In the absence of
catalyst, the yield of styrene oxide was 2.9% at 60 C.
Pure siliceous MCM-41 gave a yield of styrene oxide
of 6.2%. Although V-MCM-41 exhibited the highest
styrene conversion of 20% with a 74.6% selectivity
of styrene oxide, a serious leaching of V species was
observed, resulting in the complete deactivation when
the recovered catalyst was used in the second run.
The leaching of Cr also took place, and the color of
Cr-MCM-41 changed from orange to white after the
reaction. The conversions of styrene over Fe- and
Mo-MCM-41 were lower than that of pure silicious
MCM-41. Among the tested samples, Mn-MCM-41
showed no leaching and gave the highest selectivity
to styrene oxide (81.9%) as well as the highest TBHP

efficiency (100%). Thus, Mn-MCM-41 was the most
effective heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation
of styrene with TBHP as the oxidant.
Mn-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method was
reported to be effective for the epoxidation of stilbene
in a previous study [17]. As described above, differ-
ent synthetic methods would lead to active species
with different nature and coordination environments.
In our studies, we characterize the Mn species intro-
duced into MCM-41 by both DHT and TIE methods
in detail and compare their catalytic properties in the
epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene.
3.2. Structure of Mn-MCM-41
XRD patterns of Mn-MCM-41 with different Si/Mn
ratios synthesized by both DHT and TIE methods are
shown in Fig. 1. In a similar manner to the results
reported in [7], the TIE samples exhibited four typical
diffraction peaks assigned to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0)
and (2 1 0) reflections of a regular hexagonal array
of channels of MCM-41 (Fig. 1df). The intensity of
each peak did not significantly change with increasing
Mn content to 1.48 wt.% (Si/Mn = 61), indicating
no deorganization at long range of the mesoporous
structure of MCM-41 during the TIE synthesis. On
the other hand, the DHT samples showed a clear de-
crease in the peak intensity with an increase in Mn
content (Fig. 1ac). A similar phenomenon was also
observed when other metal cations were introduced
into MCM-41 by using the DHT method, and was
suggested to relate with the existence of non-silica
component in the wall of MCM-41 [19]. When the
Mn content increased to 1.91 wt.% (Si/Mn = 47),
peak intensity was substantially weakened, indicat-
ing a serious decrease in the structural regularity.
Concerning the peak position after introducing man-
ganese, no clear shift was observed with an increase
in Mn content. It should be noted that no Mn oxide
phases were detected on the Mn-MCM-41 prepared
by both TIE and DHT methods from the XRD mea-
surements in high diffraction angle region and that
the samples were pale pink in color. Thus, manganese

species were highly dispersed in the samples prepared
by both methods.
Pore size distributions evaluated by N2 adsorption
isotherms using the DH method are shown in Fig. 2.
Both the TIE samples (Fig. 2df) and the DHT sam-
ples (Fig. 2ac) exhibited sharp pore size distributions
around 2.7 nm. Porous properties of these samples are

both the cases.
ESR spectroscopy was employed to survey the ox-
idation states of Mn species introduced to MCM-41.
Iwamoto and coworkers [7] found a typical Mn2+ ESR
signal for the Mn-MCM-41 (Si/Mn = 20, TIE) and
suggested that manganese existed as Mn2+ in their TIE
sample. We compared the room temperature X-band
ESR spectra of the TIE and DHT samples with various
Si/Mn ratios in Fig. 3. All the Mn-MCM-41 samples
194

synthesized by the TIE method showed sextet lines
with a g value of about 2 and a hyperfine coupling
constant (A value) around 97 G, which were consistent
with Mn2+ (g = 2.0, A = 80100 G) in the environ-
ment of distorted octahedral symmetry. These values
are also close to those reported for Mn-MCM-41 [20]
and MnAPO-5 [21] with the Mn species located at
extra-framework positions. The increase in Mn con-
tent broadened the hyperfine lines significantly and re-
sulted in a considerable decrease in the resolutions of
the whole spectra (Fig. 3ac). This can be attributed
to an increase in the spin exchange interaction due to
a decrease in the Mn2+Mn2+ distance. For the DHT
samples, only very weak sextet lines were observed
even at very low Mn content (Fig. 3df). We think that
this is probably due to the presence of Mn3+ species
in the DHT samples, since Mn3+ is usually ESR silent
owing to its large zero-field splitting [22]. The absence
of any ESR signal for a Mn-containing mesoporous sil-
ica has been attributed to the presence of Mn(III) [23].
Since Mn3+ is more inclined than Mn2+ to be substi-
tuted for Si4+ at the framework position of zeolites or
MCM-41, we speculate that a part of manganese ions
may be incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41
as Mn3+ with the DHT method. The framework vana-

tively, when we introduced iron and vanadium into
MCM-41 using the DHT method [11,12].
The normalized Mn K-edge XANES spectra for
both DHT and TIE samples as well as for the refer-
ence manganese oxides are shown in Fig. 4A, and the
positions of the absorption edge are summarized in

as the first major peak in the corresponding derivative
spectrum. As reported in [2426], we have observed
that the edge positions of the manganese oxides shift

to high energy with an increase in the oxidation state
(MnO < Mn3O4 < Mn2O3 < MnO2). The edge
positions of DHT and TIE samples were 6545.7 and
6545.9 eV, respectively. They were quite close to that
of Mn3O4 (6545.9 eV), indicating the coexistence of
Mn2+ and Mn3+ in both the samples. The shape of
XANES spectrum for the DHT sample was, however,
quite different from that of the TIE sample (Fig. 4B(I
and II)). This indicates that the coordination environ-
ments of manganese in the two samples are different.
Fig. 5 shows the diffuse reflectance UVVIS spec-
tra of the Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by both the meth-
ods. Two bands at ca. 270 and 500 nm were observed
for these samples. The 6A1g 4T2g crystal field tran-
sitions of Mn2+ under the circumstance of Mn3O4 or
MnO showed a band at 500 nm [27]. Thus, the band
at 500 nm was assigned to Mn2+ probably existing on
the surface of MCM-41. However, the band at 270 nm
with such a high intensity was not reported in the liter-
ature. The charge transfer transition of O2Mn3+
in Mn3O4 in which Mn was octahedronally coordi-
nated with oxygen exhibited a band at ca. 320 nm
[27,28]. We thus tentatively assigned the intense band
observed at lower wavelength (270 nm) to the charge
transfer transition of O2Mn3+ in tetrahedral
coordination, i.e. in the framework of MCM-41. At
lower Mn content, mainly Mn2+ sites existed in the
sample synthesized by the TIE method as shown in
Fig. 5A(a and b), while the intensity of the band as-
signed to Mn2+ (500 nm) is relatively smaller and a
larger number of Mn3+ sites exist in the DHT samples.
These are consistent with those obtained from ESR
measurements as described above. As Mn content
increased, no obvious difference could be seen from
UVVIS spectra between these two types of samples,
indicating that both types of Mn species coexist in
the samples. It should be noted that the sensitivities
of the bands at 270 and 500 nm may be different, and
thus the intensities of these bands cannot be used to
evaluate the ratios of Mn2+/Mn3+ in the samples.
UVRaman spectroscopy was used for the charac-
terization of transition metal atoms such as Ti and V
in the framework of molecular sieves [2931]. Fig. 6
shows the UVRaman spectra of Mn-MCM-41 syn-
thesized by both DHT and TIE methods. Weak Raman
bands at ca. 500 and 970 cm1 were observed in the
spectrum of pure silicious MCM-41. These bands can
be assigned to symmetric stretching vibrations of the

SiOSi and anti-symmetric stretching of the SiOSi
vibrations in defects, e.g. the presence of OH con-
nected to the adjacent Si, respectively [29,31]. A very
weak Raman band at 610620 cm1 was newly ob-
served for the Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by the TIE
method. This band was more distinct and other two
additional bands at 515 and 995 cm1 were observed
more clearly for the DHT samples. These bands can-
not be assigned to any bulk Mn oxide phases [33].
A band at 615 cm1 close to that at 620 cm1 ob-
served here was reported in a Raman study of silica
supported manganese oxide, and was considered as
a vibration due to interface MnOSi bonding [33].
We thus think that the band at 610620 cm1 can be
ascribed to surface manganese species on MCM-41.
Two bands at 520 and 1110 cm1 were observed in
the UVRaman spectrum of Ti-MCM-41 and were
assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching
vibrations of SiOTi in the framework of MCM-41
[32]. Therefore, it is reasonable to ascribe the newly
observed bands at 515 and 995 cm1 in the spectra
of Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by the DHT method to
the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of
SiOMn in the framework of MCM-41. These two
bands did not increase with an increase in Mn con-
tent, probably suggesting that the amount of Mn ex-
isting in the framework of MCM-41 was very limited.
The results obtained from UVRaman studies further
suggest that a part of manganese ions can be incorpo-
rated into the framework of MCM-41 with the DHT
method.
XPS was also used to identify the oxidation state
of Mn in the DHT and TIE samples. The binding
energies of Mn 2p3/2 for both TIE and DHT sam-
ples were located around 641.4 eV, coinciding with
the binding energies of MnO (640.5641.4 eV) and
Mn3O4
(641.4 eV) [34,35]. Such results agreed
with the conclusion obtained by ESR, EXAFS and
UVVIS studies that Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexisted in the
Mn-MCM-41 prepared by either DHT or TIE method.
3.3. Epoxidation of styrene over Mn-MCM-41
synthesized by DHT and TIE methods
The effects of solvents and oxidants on the epoxida-
tion of styrene over the Mn-MCM-41 prepared by the
DHT method were first examined and the results are
shown in Table 4. In all the cases, styrene oxide and
benzaldehyde were mainly produced. When MeOH
was used as the solvent, styrene oxide produced further
reacted with methanol to form methoxyphenylacetic
acid in a selectivity of 40% (Table 4, run 4). A small
amount of phenylacetaldehyde (abbreviated as PhAcH
in Table 4, run 3) was also formed when MeCN was
used. The highest styrene conversion was achieved by
using MeCN. The selectivity to styrene oxide could
be improved when a small amount of DMF was added
to MeCN as reported previously during the epoxida-
tion of stilbene over a Mn-MCM-41 prepared by the
TIE method [17]. We used the mixture of DMF and
MeCN as the solvent in most of our studies.
H2O2 and iodosobenzene (PhIO) were also exam-
ined as oxidant. With 30% H2O2 aqueous solution,
the rapid decomposition of H2O2 occurred and no ox-
idation product was obtained except for a very small
amount of benzaldehyde (Table 4, run 5). PhIO as the
oxidant exhibited both lower styrene conversion and
poorer selectivity to styrene oxide as compared with
TBHP as the oxidant (Table 4, run 6).

methods with different Si/Mn ratios for the epox-
idation of styrene. For both types of catalysts, the
conversion of styrene increased with an increase in
Mn content, supporting that Mn was the active site
for epoxidation reactions. The styrene conversion
over the TIE catalyst was about twice as high as that
over the DHT catalyst with the same Mn content. As
described above, most of the manganese sites were
probably dispersed on the surface of mesoporous
channels in the TIE samples, while some manganese
atoms were incorporated inside the wall of MCM-41
in the DHT samples. It is likely that the Mn sites on
the surface of mesoporous channels are more active
than those incorporated inside the framework. Ben-
zoic acid and mandelic acid were also produced prob-
ably from the consecutive oxidation of benzaldehyde
and styrene oxide, respectively over the TIE samples.
However, the efficiency of TBHP for the conversion

of styrene is remarkably higher over the DHT

3.4. Epoxidation of trans-stilbene and cis-stilbene
Iwamoto and coworkers [17] reported the epox-
idation of both trans-stilbene and cis-stilbene over
Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by the TIE method. They,
however, used oxidant (TBHP) in a large excess
amount (mol ratio of TBHP/stilbene = 14) and did
not mention about the efficiency of TBHP [17]. We
think that the efficiency of TBHP is also a vital stan-
dard for evaluating a catalyst. Table 6 compares the
catalytic properties of the DHT and TIE samples in
the epoxidation of trans-stilbene and cis-stilbene. In
a similar way to that observed for styrene oxida-
tion, the TIE sample with a Mn content of 1.48 wt.%
(Si/Mn = 61) exhibited higher conversion of stilbene

than the DHT sample with a Mn content of 1.91 wt.%
(Si/Mn = 47), while the product distributions were
similar, i.e. trans-stilbene oxide and benzaldehyde
were mainly obtained. However, higher efficiency of
TBHP was obtained over the DHT sample. For a 24 h
reaction, the conversion of TBHP on the TIE samples
was 5.4 times as high as (Table 6, runs 1 and 2) that
on the DHT sample, resulting in a very low TBHP
efficiency of the TIE sample (15.1%) than that of the
DHT sample (59.4%).
For the oxidation of cis-stilbene, in addition to ben-
zaldehyde, only trans-stilbene oxide was produced
over both DHT and TIE samples. This feature resem-
bles that reported by Iwamoto and coworkers [17] in
the epoxidation of cis-stilbene over the TIE catalyst.
Thus, irrespective of the synthetic methods, it is likely
that the epoxidation reactions with TBHP over the
Mn-MCM-41 proceed through a radical intermediate.
As shown in Table 6, the conversion of cis-stilbene
was much lower than that of trans-stilbene over the
same catalyst. The lower reactivity of cis-stilbene may
be due to the steric hindrance that retards the reaction
between substrate and oxygen species.
4. Conclusions
Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effec-
tive catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using
TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-
and Mo-containing MCM-41. As suggested by the
characterizations with ESR, XANES, UVVIS and
UVRaman, both Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexisted on the
Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by both DHT and TIE
methods, and some Mn cations might be incorporated
into the framework of MCM-41 in the DHT samples.
The epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene using
TBHP as the oxidant afforded the corresponding
epoxides. The TIE sample exhibited higher conver-
sion of styrene and stilbene than the DHT sample with
the same Mn content, but the DHT sample afforded
higher TBHP efficiency.
