[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr203/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study primarily compares Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).

SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation. In contrast, Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts showed lower activity in the presence of CO2, while Cr2O3/AC catalysts were unaffected by CO2.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was found to be the most effective support for Cr2O3 in CO2-ODHP.

2. Cr2O3 loading: The promoting effect of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content, suggesting that the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a crucial role.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 was more active than reduced Cr2O3. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction.

4. Cr2O3-SiO2 interface: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles are believed to be important for the CO2 promoting effect.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction during propane dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2.
2. Maintenance of a partially oxidized state in the presence of CO2.
3. Higher activity of partially oxidized Cr2O3 compared to reduced Cr2O3.
4. Decreased CO2 promoting effect with increased Cr2O3 loading, highlighting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

These findings emphasize the complex interplay between support material, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

该研究主要比较了不同载体（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。

SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2存在时C3H6产率提高40%，并抑制了催化剂失活。相比之下，Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在时活性降低，而Cr2O3/AC催化剂则不受CO2影响。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2被发现是CO2-ODHP反应中Cr2O3最有效的载体。

2. Cr2O3负载量：CO2的促进效应随Cr2O3含量增加而降低，表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面起关键作用。

3. 铬的氧化态：SiO2上部分氧化的Cr2O3比还原态的Cr2O3更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态。

4. Cr2O3-SiO2界面：Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面被认为对CO2的促进效应很重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 在无CO2的丙烷脱氢过程中被还原。
2. 在CO2存在下保持部分氧化状态。
3. 部分氧化的Cr2O3比还原态的Cr2O3活性更高。
4. CO2促进效应随Cr2O3负载量增加而降低，突显了Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。

这些发现强调了载体材料、铬负载量和氧化态之间复杂的相互作用，在决定负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能方面起着关键作用。
