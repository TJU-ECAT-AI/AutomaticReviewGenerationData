[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SIO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."

[2] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr203/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon (AC), and SiO2 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity and selectivity: SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40%. Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC was unaffected by CO2 presence.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   a) Support material: SiO2 was crucial for CO2 promoting effects.
   b) Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed better promoting effects of CO2.
   c) Catalyst oxidation state: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
   a) The interface between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles plays a vital role in CO2 promotion.
   b) CO2 helps maintain Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation.
   c) The oxidation state of Cr2O3 surface changes dynamically during the reaction, influenced by the presence of CO2.

In summary, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts with lower Cr2O3 loading show the best performance for CO2-ODHP. The promoting effect of CO2 is attributed to its ability to maintain chromium in a partially oxidized state and the unique interaction between Cr2O3 and SiO2 at their interface.

该研究比较了在Al2O3、活性炭（AC）和SiO2上负载的Cr2O3催化剂用于CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能。主要发现如下：

1. 活性和选择性：SiO2负载的Cr2O3表现最佳，CO2的存在使C3H6产率提高了40%。Cr2O3/Al2O3在CO2存在下活性较低，而Cr2O3/AC的活性不受CO2影响。

2. 影响催化性能的关键因素：
   a) 载体材料：SiO2对CO2的促进作用至关重要。
   b) Cr2O3负载量：在SiO2上较低的Cr2O3含量显示出更好的CO2促进效果。
   c) 催化剂氧化态：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2对丙烷脱氢更活跃。

3. 铬物种的演变：
   a) Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面在CO2促进作用中起着至关重要的作用。
   b) CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3处于部分氧化状态，这对丙烷脱氢更有活性。
   c) Cr2O3表面的氧化态在反应过程中动态变化，受CO2存在的影响。

总之，低Cr2O3负载量的SiO2负载Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP中表现最佳。CO2的促进作用归因于其能够保持铬处于部分氧化状态，以及Cr2O3和SiO2在界面处的独特相互作用。
