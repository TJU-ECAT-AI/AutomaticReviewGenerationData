[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr203/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr203 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr203 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), focusing on Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed lower activity in the presence of CO2.

3. Active carbon (AC)-supported Cr2O3 catalyst's activity was unaffected by CO2.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was found to be the most effective support for Cr2O3.

2. Cr2O3 content: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 support showed better performance, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was more active than the reduced form.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction of Cr2O3 in H2 stream.
2. Partial re-oxidation of reduced Cr2O3 by CO2.
3. Maintenance of partially oxidized state during reaction in the presence of CO2, which contributes to better catalytic performance and slower deactivation.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between support properties, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalyst's performance for CO2-ODHP.

该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）中的活性和选择性，重点关注了不同载体上的Cr2O3催化剂：

1. SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2能够提高C3H6产率40%并抑制催化剂失活。

2. Al2O3负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下活性较低。

3. 活性炭（AC）负载的Cr2O3催化剂的活性不受CO2影响。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2被发现是Cr2O3最有效的载体。

2. Cr2O3含量：SiO2载体上较低的Cr2O3含量表现更好，说明Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。

3. 铬的氧化态：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原态更活跃。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. Cr2O3在H2流中被还原。
2. CO2部分再氧化还原态的Cr2O3。
3. 在CO2存在下反应过程中保持部分氧化状态，这有助于提高催化性能并减缓失活。

这些发现突出了载体性质、铬负载量和氧化态之间在决定催化剂CO2-ODHP性能方面的复杂相互作用。
