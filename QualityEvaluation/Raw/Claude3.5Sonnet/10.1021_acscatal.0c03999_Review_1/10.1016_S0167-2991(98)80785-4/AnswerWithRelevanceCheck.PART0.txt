          [1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3]AI2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

          The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key findings include:

1. Activity and selectivity:
- SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
- Cr2O3/Al2O3 had lower activity with CO2 than without.
- Cr2O3/AC showed no difference in activity with or without CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
- Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.
- Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed better performance, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
- Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 was more active for propane dehydrogenation than the reduced form.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
- The Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a vital role in CO2 promotion.
- CO2 helps maintain Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation.
- The oxidation state of Cr2O3 surface changes dynamically during the reaction, influenced by the presence of CO2.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between support properties, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalyst's performance for CO2-ODHP.

          该研究比较了在不同材料（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上负载的Cr2O3催化剂用于CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能。主要发现包括：

1. 活性和选择性：
- SiO2负载的Cr2O3表现最佳，CO2能够提高C3H6产率40%并抑制催化剂失活。
- Cr2O3/Al2O3在CO2存在下活性较低。
- Cr2O3/AC在有无CO2时的活性没有差异。

2. 影响催化性能的关键因素：
- 载体材料：SiO2对CO2的促进作用至关重要。
- Cr2O3负载量：SiO2上较低的Cr2O3含量表现更好，说明Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。
- 铬的氧化态：SiO2上部分氧化的Cr2O3比还原态更活跃于丙烷脱氢。

3. 铬物种的演变：
- Cr2O3-SiO2界面在CO2促进作用中起着至关重要的作用。
- CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3处于部分氧化状态，这对丙烷脱氢更有活性。
- Cr2O3表面的氧化态在反应过程中动态变化，受CO2存在的影响。

这些发现突出了载体性质、铬负载量和氧化态之间在决定催化剂CO2-ODHP性能方面的复杂相互作用。
