[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr203/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compares the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed lower activity in the presence of CO2.

3. Active carbon-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed no change in activity with CO2 addition.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was found to be the most effective support for Cr2O3 in CO2-ODHP.

2. Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed a higher promoting effect of CO2, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 was more active than the reduced form. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction.

4. Cr2O3-support interaction: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles play a crucial role in the promoting effect of CO2.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction of Cr2O3 during C3H8 dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2.

2. Maintenance of a partially oxidized state in the presence of CO2, which contributes to higher activity and stability.

3. A dependency on Cr2O3 loading, with lower loadings showing better performance, likely due to better dispersion and more Cr2O3-SiO2 interface sites.

该研究比较了不同载体（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的性能。主要发现如下：

1. SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2的存在使C3H6产率提高40%，并抑制了催化剂失活。

2. Al2O3负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下活性较低。

3. 活性炭负载的Cr2O3催化剂在有无CO2存在下活性无变化。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2被证明是CO2-ODHP反应中Cr2O3最有效的载体。

2. Cr2O3负载量：SiO2上较低的Cr2O3含量显示出CO2更高的促进效果，说明Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。

3. 铬的氧化态：SiO2上部分氧化的Cr2O3比还原态更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态。

4. Cr2O3-载体相互作用：Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面在CO2的促进作用中起着关键作用。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 在无CO2存在下，C3H8脱氢过程中Cr2O3被还原。

2. 在CO2存在下，保持部分氧化状态，这有助于提高活性和稳定性。

3. 与Cr2O3负载量有关，较低负载量表现更好，可能是由于分散度更好和更多的Cr2O3-SiO2界面位点。
