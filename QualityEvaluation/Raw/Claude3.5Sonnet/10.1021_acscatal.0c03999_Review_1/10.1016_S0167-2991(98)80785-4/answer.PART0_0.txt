[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon (AC), and SiO2 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity and selectivity:
- Cr2O3/SiO2 showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% compared to without CO2.
- Cr2O3/Al2O3 had lower activity with CO2 than without.
- Cr2O3/AC showed no difference in activity with or without CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
- Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.
- Cr2O3-SiO2 interface: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles play an important role in CO2 promotion.
- Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 is more active for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
- Cr2O3 loading: Increasing Cr2O3 content in Cr2O3/SiO2 decreased the promoting effect of CO2, suggesting the importance of the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
- Oxidation state: CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation.

The study highlights the unique properties of SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP, emphasizing the importance of the support material, chromium oxidation state, and the interface between Cr2O3 and SiO2 in determining catalytic performance.
