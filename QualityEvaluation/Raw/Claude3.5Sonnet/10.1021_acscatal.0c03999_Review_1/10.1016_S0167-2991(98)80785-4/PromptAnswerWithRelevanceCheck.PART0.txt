[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), focusing on Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed lower activity in the presence of CO2.

3. Active carbon (AC)-supported Cr2O3 catalyst's activity was unaffected by CO2.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was found to be the most effective support for Cr2O3.

2. Cr2O3 content: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 support showed better performance, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was more active than the reduced form.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction of Cr2O3 in H2 stream.
2. Partial re-oxidation of reduced Cr2O3 by CO2.
3. Maintenance of partially oxidized state during reaction in the presence of CO2, which contributes to better catalytic performance and slower deactivation.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between support properties, chromium loading, and oxidation state in determining the catalyst's performance for CO2-ODHP.
