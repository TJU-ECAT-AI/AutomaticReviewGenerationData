If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about various metal oxide catalysts' activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, factors influencing their catalytic performance, or the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The document appears to be only a title and publication information for a scientific article, without any detailed content about catalyst performance or mechanisms.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information to answer the question about various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, their activity and selectivity, or factors influencing their catalytic performance. The text only provides a title and some basic publication information for a paper about hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2. It does not contain any details about the catalytic performance, comparisons between different catalysts, or information about chromium species evolution. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based on the provided literature.
