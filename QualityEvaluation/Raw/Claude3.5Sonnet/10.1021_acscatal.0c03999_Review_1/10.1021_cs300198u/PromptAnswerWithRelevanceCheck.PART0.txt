If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the given literature excerpt to answer the question about how various metal oxide catalysts compare for CO2-ODHP or the factors influencing their performance. The title and author information alone do not contain sufficient details to address the specifics of catalyst activity, selectivity, or the evolution of chromium species. More of the full text would be needed to properly answer this question.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the limited information given in the provided literature. The text appears to be only a title and author information for a research article, without any details about the study's findings or comparisons of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. To properly address this question, we would need access to the full text of the article, which likely contains the relevant data on catalyst performance, chromium species evolution, and influencing factors.
