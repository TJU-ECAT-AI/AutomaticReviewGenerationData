[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Cr3+ formed from the reduction of higher valence states, that is, Cr6+, are active sites in the ODPH reaction."

[4] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[5] "As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3. The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Oxidation state of chromium: Cr3+ species, formed from the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for the ODHP reaction. 

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, the species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and finally crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The support (e.g., silica) influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Promoters: Addition of promoters like Ni can help maintain the active Cr3+ state and improve catalyst stability.

The evolution of chromium species with increasing loading progresses from highly dispersed Cr6+ species to bulk Cr2O3, with intermediary Cr3+ oxide phases. This progression affects the number and nature of active sites available for the ODHP reaction.

与其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出较高的活性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的氧化态：由Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+物种是ODHP反应的活性位点。

2. 催化剂失活：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂由于积碳沉积和活性Cr3+还原为非活性Cr2+而快速失活。

3. 铬负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，物种从接枝Cr6+演变为分散Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物，最后形成结晶α-Cr2O3。

4. 载体性质：载体（如二氧化硅）影响铬物种的分散性和稳定性。

5. 助剂：添加如Ni等助剂可以帮助保持活性Cr3+状态并提高催化剂稳定性。

随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变从高度分散的Cr6+物种进展到体相Cr2O3，中间经过Cr3+氧化物相。这种演变影响了ODHP反应可用的活性位点的数量和性质。
