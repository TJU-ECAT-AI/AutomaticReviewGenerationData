[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "Generally, CrOx possesses various types of Cr species, depending on the loading weight of the Cr precursor. As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species: The active sites are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. 

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, different species form in the order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The support influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Crystalline phase formation: At high loadings, α-Cr2O3 crystallites form on top of dispersed chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading amount, with a transition from highly dispersed species at low loadings to crystalline phases at high loadings. The support properties affect this evolution by influencing the dispersion and stability of the active Cr3+ sites.

与其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出较高的活性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种：活性位点是配位不饱和的Cr3+物种。

2. 催化剂失活：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂由于积碳沉积和Cr3+还原为非活性Cr2+而快速失活。

3. 铬负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，不同的物种按以下顺序形成：接枝Cr6+、分散Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物和晶态α-Cr2O3。

4. 载体性质：载体影响铬物种的分散和稳定性。

5. 晶相形成：在高负载量时，α-Cr2O3晶体在分散的铬物种上形成。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量，从低负载量时的高度分散物种过渡到高负载量时的晶态相。载体性质通过影响活性Cr3+位点的分散和稳定性来影响这种演变。
