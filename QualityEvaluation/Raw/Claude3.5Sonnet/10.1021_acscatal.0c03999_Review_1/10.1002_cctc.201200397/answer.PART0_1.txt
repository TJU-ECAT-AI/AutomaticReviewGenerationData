[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Oxidation state of chromium: Cr3+ species, particularly coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+, are the active sites for the ODHP reaction. 

2. Catalyst deactivation: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

3. Chromium loading: As chromium loading increases, different Cr species form sequentially - grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Support properties: The silica support influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species.

5. Catalyst preparation method: This affects the distribution and oxidation states of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading amount. At low loadings, highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate. As loading increases, Cr3+ oxides form, eventually leading to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings. The support properties impact this evolution by affecting chromium-support interactions and dispersion.

与其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出高活性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的氧化态：Cr3+物种，特别是配位不饱和的Cr3+，是ODHP反应的活性位点。

2. 催化剂失活：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂由于积碳沉积和Cr3+还原为无活性Cr2+而快速失活。

3. 铬负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，不同的Cr物种按顺序形成 - 接枝Cr6+、分散Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物和结晶α-Cr2O3。

4. 载体性质：二氧化硅载体影响铬物种的分散和稳定性。

5. 催化剂制备方法：这影响铬物种的分布和氧化态。

铬物种的演变取决于负载量。在低负载量时，高度分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位。随着负载量增加，Cr3+氧化物形成，最终在高负载量时形成结晶α-Cr2O3。载体性质通过影响铬-载体相互作用和分散度来影响这种演变。
