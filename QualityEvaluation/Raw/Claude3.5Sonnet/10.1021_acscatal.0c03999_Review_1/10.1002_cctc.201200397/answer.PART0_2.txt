[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "Generally, CrOx possesses various types of Cr species, depending on the loading weight of the Cr precursor. As the Cr precursor increases, Cr species form in the following order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and crystalline α-Cr2O3."

[5] "The final Cr species, α-Cr2O3, build up over underlying dispersed Cr species after the completion of the support coverage."

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity for CO2-ODHP compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The key active sites are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. However, these catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends strongly on the loading amount. As loading increases, Cr species form in the order: grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and finally crystalline α-Cr2O3. At high loadings, α-Cr2O3 forms on top of the dispersed Cr species after the support surface is covered.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
1. Cr loading amount and resulting Cr species formed
2. Oxidation state of Cr (Cr3+ being most active) 
3. Dispersion of Cr species on the support
4. Resistance to coke deposition and reduction to Cr2+
5. Support properties that affect Cr dispersion and stability

The support plays an important role in dispersing and stabilizing active Cr species. Tuning the support properties and Cr loading can help optimize the abundance of active Cr3+ sites while minimizing deactivation pathways.

与其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出较高的活性。关键活性位点是配位不饱和的Cr3+物种。然而，这些催化剂由于积碳沉积和Cr3+还原为无活性Cr2+而快速失活。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变强烈依赖于负载量。随着负载量的增加，Cr物种按以下顺序形成：接枝Cr6+、分散Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物，最后是结晶α-Cr2O3。在高负载量时，α-Cr2O3在分散Cr物种覆盖载体表面后形成。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
1. Cr负载量及由此形成的Cr物种
2. Cr的氧化态（Cr3+最活跃）
3. Cr物种在载体上的分散度
4. 抗积碳沉积和还原为Cr2+的能力
5. 影响Cr分散和稳定性的载体性质

载体在分散和稳定活性Cr物种方面起着重要作用。调节载体性质和Cr负载量可以帮助优化活性Cr3+位点的丰度，同时最小化失活途径。
