[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

[4] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."

The literature provides some information on different metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but does not give a comprehensive comparison:

- Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane and propane dehydrogenation with CO2. 

- Ga2O3 was found to be effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to without CO2.

- Ga2O3-based catalysts are active for light alkane dehydrogenation and NOx reduction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

- Acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst
- Presence of Lewis acid sites (suspected to be active for dehydrogenation)
- Support material (e.g. silica for Cr2O3)

The document does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More research would be needed to fully answer this aspect of the question.

文献提供了一些关于CO2-ODHP不同金属氧化物催化剂的信息，但没有给出全面的比较：

- Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下的乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

- Ga2O3被发现在CO2存在下对乙烷脱氢有效，与无CO2相比，乙烯产率翻倍。

- 基于Ga2O3的催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢和NOx还原具有活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

- 催化剂的酸碱性质
- 路易斯酸位点的存在（被认为对脱氢反应有活性）
- 载体材料（例如Cr2O3的二氧化硅载体）

文献没有提供关于负载量和载体性质对负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题的这一方面，需要进行更多的研究。
