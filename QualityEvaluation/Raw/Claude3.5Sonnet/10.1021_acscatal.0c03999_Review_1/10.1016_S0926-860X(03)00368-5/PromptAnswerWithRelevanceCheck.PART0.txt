[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

The literature compares several metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane and propane dehydrogenation with CO2. 

Ga2O3 was found to be effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reactions without CO2.

Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for light alkane dehydrogenation and NOx reduction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Acidity/basicity properties, which strongly affect gallium oxide catalyst activity.

2. Support effects, as evidenced by the good performance of silica-supported Cr2O3.

3. Presence of CO2, which can significantly enhance yields.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More research would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 酸碱性质，这强烈影响氧化镓催化剂的活性。

2. 载体效应，从二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3的良好性能可以看出。

3. CO2的存在，可以显著提高产率。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随着负载量和载体性质变化而演变的详细信息。需要进行更多研究才能充分解答该问题的这一方面。

Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12].

Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/SiO2, showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation and were effective for propane dehydrogenation as well. The promoting effect of CO2 was observed only on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be an effective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reactions without CO2. Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

3. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

   - Support material: Silica seems to be an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
   - Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.
   - Presence of CO2: It acts as a promoter, enhancing yields in some cases.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More detailed studies would be needed to elucidate these aspects.
