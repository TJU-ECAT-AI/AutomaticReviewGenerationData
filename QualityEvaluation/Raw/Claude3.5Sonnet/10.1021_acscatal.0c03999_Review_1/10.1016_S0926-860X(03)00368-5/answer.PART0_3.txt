Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP:

1. Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2. For propane dehydrogenation, CO2 had a promoting effect only on silica-supported Cr2O3.

2. Ga2O3 was found to be effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reaction without CO2. Ga2O3-based catalysts are also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

3. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
   - Support material (e.g. silica support for Cr2O3)
   - Acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst
   - Presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant

The literature does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More research would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

根据文献，几种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP：

1. Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在乙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。对于丙烷脱氢，CO2仅对二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3有促进作用。

2. Ga2O3被发现在乙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中有效，与无CO2反应相比，乙烯产率翻倍。基于Ga2O3的催化剂对轻烃的脱氢也有活性。

3. 影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
   - 载体材料（例如Cr2O3的二氧化硅载体）
   - 催化剂的酸碱性质
   - CO2作为温和氧化剂的存在

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。需要更多研究才能完全解答该问题的这一方面。
