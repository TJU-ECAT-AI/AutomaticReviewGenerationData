Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/SiO2, showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation and were effective for propane dehydrogenation as well. The promoting effect of CO2 was observed only on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be an effective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reactions without CO2. Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

3. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

   - Support material: Silica seems to be an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
   - Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.
   - Presence of CO2: It acts as a promoter, enhancing yields in some cases.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More detailed studies would be needed to elucidate these aspects.

根据文献，几种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)：

1. 铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在乙烷脱氢中表现出优异的性能，对丙烷脱氢也很有效。CO2的促进作用仅在二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到。

2. 氧化镓(Ga2O3)被发现是CO2存在下乙烷脱氢的有效催化剂，与无CO2反应相比，乙烯产率翻倍。基于Ga2O3的催化剂也对轻烃的脱氢有活性。

3. 影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

   - 载体材料：二氧化硅似乎是CO2-ODHP反应中Cr2O3催化剂的有效载体。
   - 酸碱性质：这些性质强烈影响氧化镓催化剂的催化活性。
   - CO2的存在：它起促进作用，在某些情况下提高产率。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。需要更详细的研究来阐明这些方面。
