[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

[4] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

The literature compares several metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane and propane dehydrogenation with CO2. 

Ga2O3 was found to be effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reactions without CO2.

Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for light alkane dehydrogenation and NOx reduction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Acidity/basicity properties, which strongly affect gallium oxide catalyst activity.

2. Support effects, as evidenced by the good performance of silica-supported Cr2O3.

3. Presence of CO2, which can significantly enhance yields.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More research would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

文献比较了几种用于CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)的金属氧化物催化剂：

Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在乙烷和丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

Ga2O3被发现在乙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中有效，与无CO2反应相比，乙烯产率翻倍。

Ga2O3基催化剂在轻烷烃脱氢和NOx还原中也表现活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 酸碱性质，这强烈影响氧化镓催化剂的活性。

2. 载体效应，从二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3的良好性能可以看出。

3. CO2的存在，可以显著提高产率。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随着负载量和载体性质变化而演变的详细信息。需要进行更多研究才能充分解答该问题的这一方面。
