          [1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]."

[4] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[5] "Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

          Based on the literature, several metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. Chromium oxide catalysts:
   - Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts showed excellent performance for ethane dehydrogenation and were effective for propane dehydrogenation.
   - The promoting effect of CO2 was observed only on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts:
   - Ga2O3 was found to be an effective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
   - Ethylene yield doubled in the presence of CO2 compared to reactions without CO2.
   - Ga2O3-based catalysts were also active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and selective catalytic reduction of NOx.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Silica appears to be an effective support for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
2. Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.
3. Presence of CO2: It acts as a promoter, enhancing yields in some cases.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More detailed studies would be needed to elucidate these aspects.

          根据文献，几种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)：

1. 铬氧化物催化剂：
   - Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在乙烷脱氢中表现出优异的性能，对丙烷脱氢也很有效。
   - CO2的促进作用仅在二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到。

2. 氧化镓(Ga2O3)催化剂：
   - Ga2O3被发现是CO2存在下乙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。
   - 与无CO2反应相比，CO2存在下乙烯产率翻倍。
   - 基于Ga2O3的催化剂也对轻烃的脱氢和NOx的选择性催化还原有活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：二氧化硅似乎是CO2-ODHP反应中Cr2O3催化剂的有效载体。
2. 酸碱性质：这些性质强烈影响氧化镓催化剂的催化活性。
3. CO2的存在：它起促进作用，在某些情况下提高产率。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。需要更详细的研究来阐明这些方面。
