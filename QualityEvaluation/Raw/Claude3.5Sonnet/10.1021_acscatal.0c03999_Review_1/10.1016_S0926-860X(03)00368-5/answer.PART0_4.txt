[1] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence."

[3] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

The literature discusses several metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2):

1. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/SiO2, showed excellent performance for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Ga2O3 was found to be effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, doubling the ethylene yield compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Ga2O3-based catalysts are active for light alkane dehydrogenation and NOx reduction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support properties: SiO2 support was noted to be effective for Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Acidity/basicity properties: These strongly influence the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts.

3. Presence of CO2: CO2 appears to enhance the yield of desired products.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More specific studies would be needed to address this aspect of the question.

文献讨论了几种用于CO2-ODHP（使用CO2的丙烷氧化脱氢）的金属氧化物催化剂：

1. 负载型铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在乙烷和丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

2. 发现Ga2O3对乙烷与CO2的脱氢反应有效，与不使用CO2的反应相比，乙烯产率翻倍。

3. 基于Ga2O3的催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢和NOx还原具有活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体性质：SiO2载体被注意到对Cr2O3催化剂有效。

2. 酸碱性质：这些强烈影响氧化镓催化剂的催化活性。

3. CO2的存在：CO2似乎能提高目标产物的产率。

文献没有提供关于负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。需要进行更具体的研究来解答这个问题的这一方面。
