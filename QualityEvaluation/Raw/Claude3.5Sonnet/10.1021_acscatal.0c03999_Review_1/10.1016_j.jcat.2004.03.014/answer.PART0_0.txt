[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O8 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium outperformed other metals like V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) is the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox cycle: The reaction involves a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra. Propane dehydrogenation occurs on Cr(VI)O4, reducing it to Cr(III)O6.

4. Regeneration ability: Both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate the active Cr(VI)O4 species from Cr(III)O6, with oxygen being more efficient.

5. Support properties: MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve, provides a high surface area and well-dispersed chromium species, contributing to the catalyst's performance.

6. Synthesis method: Direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) was used to prepare the catalysts, which likely influences the dispersion and nature of the chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction involves the transformation of active Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedra. This change in oxidation state and coordination environment is reversible, with CO2 playing a role in regenerating the active species, albeit less efficiently than oxygen. The catalyst's performance is thus closely tied to maintaining the Cr(VI) oxidation state and tetrahedral coordination throughout the reaction cycle.

在测试的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中显示出最高的活性，实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%以上的丙烯选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：当负载在MCM-41上时，铬的性能优于其他金属如V、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Ga。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)（Cr(VI)O4）是活性物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)（Cr(III)O6）活性较低。

3. 氧化还原循环：反应涉及Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环。丙烷脱氢发生在Cr(VI)O4上，将其还原为Cr(III)O6。

4. 再生能力：氧气和二氧化碳都能将Cr(III)O6再生为活性Cr(VI)O4物种，其中氧气的效率更高。

5. 载体性质：MCM-41作为介孔分子筛，提供了高比表面积和良好分散的铬物种，有助于催化剂的性能。

6. 合成方法：使用直接水热合成（DHT）法制备催化剂，这可能影响铬物种的分散性和性质。

在反应过程中，铬物种的演变涉及活性Cr(VI)O4四面体向活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体的转变。这种氧化态和配位环境的变化是可逆的，CO2在再生活性物种中起作用，尽管效率低于氧气。因此，催化剂的性能与在整个反应循环中保持Cr(VI)氧化态和四面体配位密切相关。
