          [1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O8 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

          Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium outperformed other metals (V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) is the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox cycle: The reaction involves a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be regenerated using both oxygen and carbon dioxide, with oxygen being more efficient in reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. Support properties: MCM-41, a mesoporous material with high surface area, allows for good dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra on the support surface.
2. During reaction: Reduction of Cr(VI)O4 to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedra.
3. Deactivation: Formation of aggregated Cr(III)O6 species.
4. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 by O2 or CO2.

The loading and support properties affect the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species, which in turn influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and regeneration ability.

          在测试的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中表现出最高的活性，实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%以上的丙烯选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：在MCM-41载体上，铬的性能优于其他金属（V、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Ga）。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)（Cr(VI)O4）是活性物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)（Cr(III)O6）活性较低。

3. 氧化还原循环：反应涉及Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环，这对维持催化活性至关重要。

4. 再生能力：催化剂可以使用氧气和二氧化碳进行再生，其中氧气在将Cr(III)重新氧化为Cr(VI)方面更有效。

5. 载体性质：MCM-41作为具有高比表面积的介孔材料，允许铬物种良好分散。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 初始状态：在载体表面上分散良好的Cr(VI)O4四面体。
2. 反应过程中：Cr(VI)O4还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体。
3. 失活：形成聚集的Cr(III)O6物种。
4. 再生：通过O2或CO2将Cr(III)O6重新氧化为Cr(VI)O4。

载体的负载量和性质影响铬物种的分散和可及性，进而影响催化剂的活性、选择性和再生能力。
