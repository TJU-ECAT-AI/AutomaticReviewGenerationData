[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The mechanism of catalyst deactivation as well as regeneration was discussed based on the structurecatalytic property relationships. It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Cr outperformed V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) is the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr(VI)O4 and Cr(III)O6 is crucial for catalytic activity.

4. Regeneration capability: Both oxygen and CO2 can regenerate the active Cr(VI)O4 species, though oxygen is more efficient.

5. Support properties: MCM-41 allows for good dispersion of chromium species and facilitates the redox cycle.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction involves:

1. Initial state: Well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species on the support.
2. During reaction: Reduction of Cr(VI)O4 to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedral species.
3. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 by CO2 or O2.

This cycle of reduction and reoxidation of chromium species is key to maintaining catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

在测试的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出最高的活性，实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%以上的丙烯选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：在MCM-41负载的催化剂中，Cr的性能优于V、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Ga。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位状态：四面体配位的Cr(VI)（Cr(VI)O4）是活性物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)（Cr(III)O6）活性较低。

3. 氧化还原性质：铬在Cr(VI)O4和Cr(III)O6之间进行氧化还原循环的能力对催化活性至关重要。

4. 再生能力：氧气和CO2都能再生活性Cr(VI)O4物种，但氧气的效率更高。

5. 载体性质：MCM-41允许铬物种良好分散，并促进氧化还原循环。

铬物种在反应过程中的演变包括：

1. 初始状态：在载体上分散良好的Cr(VI)O4四面体物种。
2. 反应过程中：Cr(VI)O4还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体物种。
3. 再生：CO2或O2将Cr(III)O6重新氧化为Cr(VI)O4。

这种铬物种的还原和再氧化循环是维持Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中催化活性的关键。
