[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "The mechanism of catalyst deactivation as well as regeneration was discussed based on the structurecatalytic property relationships."

[4] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O8 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Among the various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP, Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, achieving a propene conversion of 30% with a selectivity above 90%. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium outperformed other metals (V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) when supported on MCM-41.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (Cr(VI)O4) acts as the active species, while Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (Cr(III)O6) is less active.

3. Redox cycle: The reaction involves a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be regenerated using both oxygen and carbon dioxide, with oxygen being more efficient in reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. Support properties: MCM-41, a mesoporous material with high surface area, allows for good dispersion of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on:

1. Reaction conditions: During the reaction, Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

2. Regeneration treatment: Oxidative treatments with O2 or CO2 can reoxidize Cr(III)O6 back to Cr(VI)O4.

3. Loading: While not explicitly stated, the loading likely affects the dispersion and nature of chromium species on the support.

4. Support interaction: The MCM-41 support appears to stabilize the active Cr(VI)O4 species and facilitate the redox cycle.

Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of chromium-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

在测试的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出最高的活性，丙烯转化率达到30%，选择性超过90%。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：在MCM-41载体上，铬的性能优于其他金属（V、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni和Ga）。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)（Cr(VI)O4）是活性物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)（Cr(III)O6）活性较低。

3. 氧化还原循环：反应涉及Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环，这对于保持催化剂活性至关重要。

4. 再生能力：催化剂可以使用氧气和二氧化碳进行再生，其中氧气在将Cr(III)重新氧化为Cr(VI)方面更有效。

5. 载体性质：MCM-41作为具有高比表面积的介孔材料，允许铬物种良好分散。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于：

1. 反应条件：在反应过程中，Cr(VI)O4四面体被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。

2. 再生处理：使用O2或CO2的氧化处理可以将Cr(III)O6重新氧化回Cr(VI)O4。

3. 负载量：虽然没有明确说明，但负载量可能会影响铬物种在载体上的分散和性质。

4. 载体相互作用：MCM-41载体似乎能够稳定活性Cr(VI)O4物种并促进氧化还原循环。

理解和控制这些因素对于优化铬基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能和稳定性至关重要。
