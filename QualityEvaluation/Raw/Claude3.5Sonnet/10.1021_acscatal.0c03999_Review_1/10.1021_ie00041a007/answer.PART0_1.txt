The literature provides some insights into how various metal oxide catalysts compare for CO2-ODHP, though it does not specifically focus on this reaction:

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are described as active, selective, and stable for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons, as well as for conversion of CH4 + CO2 to synthesis gas. They do not form carbon layers during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to change their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Increasing Mn content in reduced Ni catalysts decreases CH4 conversion (in absence of CO2).

3. A catalyst composition of 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 was found to be the best among those studied.

4. For Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts, XRD shows MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More specific studies would be needed to fully address this aspect of the question.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to include:
- Catalyst composition and additives
- Metal oxide dispersion
- Interaction between active components and support
- Oxidation state of active components

However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP specifically.

文献提供了一些关于各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的比较信息,尽管它并没有特别关注这个反应:

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被描述为在C2-C7烃类的氧化脱氢以及CH4 + CO2转化为合成气的反应中具有活性、选择性和稳定性。与金属催化剂不同,它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 镍催化剂可以通过添加Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂来改变其在CH4 + CO2转化中的性能。在还原的Ni催化剂中增加Mn含量会降低CH4转化率(在没有CO2的情况下)。

3. 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3的催化剂组成被发现是研究中最好的。

4. 对于Mn-Cr/Al-O催化剂,XRD显示存在MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相,这可能是由于其高度分散性。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。需要更具体的研究才能全面解答这个问题的这一方面。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎包括:
- 催化剂组成和添加剂
- 金属氧化物的分散度
- 活性组分与载体之间的相互作用
- 活性组分的氧化态

然而,该文档并未专门对CO2-ODHP反应的不同金属氧化物催化剂进行全面比较。
