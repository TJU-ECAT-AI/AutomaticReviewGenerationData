[1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[3] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[4] "Further investigation showed that the catalyst can function without any metallic component"

[5] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

[6] "In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst the X-ray diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases are observed before the reaction and MnO and MnC03 are observed during the reaction."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, focusing on manganese and chromium-based catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not form carbon layers during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

2. Modifying nickel catalysts with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides changes their properties in CH4 + CO2 conversion.

3. Manganese as a modifying additive provides the best effect, increasing CO2 conversion and decreasing coking as Mn content increases.

4. Catalysts can function without metallic components, indicating the effectiveness of oxide-based systems.

5. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

   - On Al2O3 supports, MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases are observed. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.
   
   - On SiO2 supports, no direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with SiO2 is observed. Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases are present before the reaction, while MnO and MnCO3 are observed during the reaction.

These findings suggest that the support material and the interaction between manganese and chromium oxides play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance. The high dispersity of chromium species and the formation of different manganese oxide phases on different supports contribute to the catalysts' activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，重点关注锰和铬基催化剂。主要发现包括：

1. 与金属催化剂不同，锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不形成碳层。

2. 用Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂改性镍催化剂会改变其在CH4 + CO2转化中的性能。

3. 锰作为改性添加剂效果最佳，随着Mn含量的增加，CO2转化率增加，结焦减少。

4. 催化剂可以在没有金属成分的情况下发挥作用，表明氧化物基系统的有效性。

5. 负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质：

   - 在Al2O3载体上，观察到MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，可能是由于高度分散性。
   
   - 在SiO2载体上，未观察到锰和铬氧化物与SiO2的直接相互作用。反应前存在Mn3O4和Mn2O3相，反应过程中观察到MnO和MnCO3。

这些发现表明，载体材料以及锰和铬氧化物之间的相互作用在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。铬物种的高度分散性以及在不同载体上形成不同的锰氧化物相，都有助于催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
