[1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[3] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[4] "Further investigation showed that the catalyst can function without any metallic component"

[5] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

[6] "In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst the X-ray diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases are observed before the reaction and MnO and MnC03 are observed during the reaction."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, focusing on manganese and chromium-based catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not form carbon layers during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

2. Modifying nickel catalysts with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides changes their properties in CH4 + CO2 conversion.

3. Manganese as a modifying additive provides the best effect, increasing CO2 conversion and decreasing coking as Mn content increases.

4. Catalysts can function without metallic components, indicating the effectiveness of oxide-based systems.

5. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

   - On Al2O3 supports, MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases are observed. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.
   
   - On SiO2 supports, no direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with SiO2 is observed. Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases are present before the reaction, while MnO and MnCO3 are observed during the reaction.

These findings suggest that the support material and the interaction between manganese and chromium oxides play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance. The high dispersity of chromium species and the formation of different manganese oxide phases on different supports contribute to the catalysts' activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的表现，重点关注锰和铬基催化剂。主要发现包括：

1. 与金属催化剂不同，锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不形成碳层。

2. 用Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂改性镍催化剂会改变其在CH4 + CO2转化中的性能。

3. 锰作为改性添加剂效果最佳，随着Mn含量的增加，CO2转化率增加，结焦减少。

4. 催化剂可以在没有金属成分的情况下发挥作用，表明氧化物基系统的有效性。

5. 负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质：

   - 在Al2O3载体上，观察到MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，可能是由于高度分散性。
   
   - 在SiO2载体上，未观察到锰和铬氧化物与SiO2的直接相互作用。反应前存在Mn3O4和Mn2O3相，反应过程中观察到MnO和MnCO3。

这些发现表明，载体材料以及锰和铬氧化物之间的相互作用在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。铬物种的高度分散性以及在不同载体上形成不同的锰氧化物相，都有助于催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。

The literature provides some insights into how various metal oxide catalysts compare for CO2-ODHP, though it does not specifically focus on this reaction:

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are described as active, selective, and stable for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons, as well as for conversion of CH4 + CO2 to synthesis gas. They do not form carbon layers during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to change their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Increasing Mn content in reduced Ni catalysts decreases CH4 conversion (in absence of CO2).

3. A catalyst composition of 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 was found to be the best among those studied.

4. For Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts, XRD shows MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More specific studies would be needed to fully address this aspect of the question.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to include:
- Catalyst composition and additives
- Metal oxide dispersion
- Interaction between active components and support
- Oxidation state of active components

However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP specifically.

文献提供了一些关于各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的比较信息,尽管它并没有特别关注这个反应:

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被描述为在C2-C7烃类的氧化脱氢以及CH4 + CO2转化为合成气的反应中具有活性、选择性和稳定性。与金属催化剂不同,它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 镍催化剂可以通过添加Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂来改变其在CH4 + CO2转化中的性能。在还原的Ni催化剂中增加Mn含量会降低CH4转化率(在没有CO2的情况下)。

3. 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3的催化剂组成被发现是研究中最好的。

4. 对于Mn-Cr/Al-O催化剂,XRD显示存在MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相,这可能是由于其高度分散性。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。需要更具体的研究才能全面解答这个问题的这一方面。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎包括:
- 催化剂组成和添加剂
- 金属氧化物的分散度
- 活性组分与载体之间的相互作用
- 活性组分的氧化态

然而,该文档并未专门对CO2-ODHP反应的不同金属氧化物催化剂进行全面比较。

The literature provides some insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as being active, selective, and stable for the conversion of CH4 + CO2 mixtures into synthesis gas and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. For propane conversion specifically, a catalyst composition of 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 is identified as the best performing.

3. The oxidation state of manganese plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. Oxidized phases (Mn3O4 and Mn2O3) promote total methane oxidation, reduced phases (MnO and MnCO3) assist methane conversion to synthesis gas, and intermediate phases promote methane oxidative coupling.

4. In Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts, MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases are observed. The chromium-containing phase is not detected, likely due to its high dispersity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst composition and metal loading
- Oxidation state of active metal components
- Support properties and interactions with active components
- Catalyst preparation method and resulting phase composition

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information about how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in XRD due to high dispersity, suggesting that chromium species are highly dispersed on the support at the loadings studied.
