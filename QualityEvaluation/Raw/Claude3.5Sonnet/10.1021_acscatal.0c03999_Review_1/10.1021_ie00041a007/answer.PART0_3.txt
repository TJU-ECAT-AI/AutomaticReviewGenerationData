[1] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs."

[3] "A study of the X-ray structure of the catalyst in situ shows that oxidized Mn phases Mn304 and Mn2O3 promote total methane oxidation (in non-steady-state conditions); reduced phases MnO and MnC03 assist methane conversion into synthesis gas; intermediate phases, where 0- stabilization is possible, promote methane oxidative coupling."

[4] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

The literature provides some insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as being active, selective, and stable for the conversion of CH4 + CO2 mixtures into synthesis gas and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. For propane conversion specifically, a catalyst composition of 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 is identified as the best performing.

3. The oxidation state of manganese plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. Oxidized phases (Mn3O4 and Mn2O3) promote total methane oxidation, reduced phases (MnO and MnCO3) assist methane conversion to synthesis gas, and intermediate phases promote methane oxidative coupling.

4. In Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts, MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases are observed. The chromium-containing phase is not detected, likely due to its high dispersity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst composition and metal loading
- Oxidation state of active metal components
- Support properties and interactions with active components
- Catalyst preparation method and resulting phase composition

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information about how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in XRD due to high dispersity, suggesting that chromium species are highly dispersed on the support at the loadings studied.

文献对CO2-ODHP（烷烃氧化脱氢）的各种金属氧化物催化剂的性能提供了一些见解：

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被强调为在CH4 + CO2混合物转化为合成气以及C2-C7烃和低级醇的氧化脱氢反应中具有活性、选择性和稳定性。与金属催化剂不同，它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 对于丙烷转化，1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2的催化剂组成被确定为性能最佳。

3. 锰的氧化态在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。氧化态（Mn3O4和Mn2O3）促进甲烷完全氧化，还原态（MnO和MnCO3）辅助甲烷转化为合成气，中间态促进甲烷氧化偶联。

4. 在Mn-Cr/Al-O催化剂中，观察到MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，可能是由于其高度分散性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
- 催化剂组成和金属负载量
- 活性金属组分的氧化态
- 载体性质及其与活性组分的相互作用
- 催化剂制备方法和由此产生的相组成

关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，文献并未提供关于铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。唯一提到的是由于高度分散性，XRD中未检测到含铬相，这表明在所研究的负载量下，铬物种在载体上高度分散。
