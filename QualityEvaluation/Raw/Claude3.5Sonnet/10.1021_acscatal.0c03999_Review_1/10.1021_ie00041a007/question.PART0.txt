Reactions of oxidative transformation of organic compounds of different classes (alkanes, alkenes, 
and alcohols) with a nontraditional oxidant, carbon dioxide, were studied on oxide catalysts 
Fe-0, Cr-0, Mn-0 and on multicomponent systems based on manganese oxide. The supported 
manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 
mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c

 hydrocarbons and the 
lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon 
layer during the reaction. 
The great interest displayed lately in heterogeneous 
catalytic reactions of carbon dioxide is caused by two 
reasons: (1) 
the necessity to fight the greenhouse effect 
and 2) the exhaust of carbon raw material sources. 
In 1992 143 
countries signed an agreement in Rio de 
Janeiro on the control of the global increase of tempera- 
ture in the atmosphere and on the necessity to decrease 
COZ 
content in exhaust gases. The increase of the COz 
content in the atmosphere may create an irreversible 
change in the Earths climate in the middle of the 21st 
century. 
Independently of the greenhouse effect C02 can be 
considered as a very important raw material for the 
chemical industry in the future. The sources of coal, 
petroleum, and natural gas are being quickly exhausted. 
The total amount of carbon contained in CO2 in the 
atmosphere and in the hydrosphere is by 1% 
orders of 
magnitude more than that in coal, petroleum, and gas, 
while in the lithosphere it is by about 2 orders of 
magnitude higher. 
The main obstacle to the wide use of C02 is its low 
concentration 
in the atmosphere, comprising only 0.03%. 
In this respect the use of C02 from exhaust gases of 
industry and transport is more attractive. However, 
currently mainly C02 prepared by decomposition of solid 
carbonates is used in industry. At the present time only 
three large-scale processes utilizing C02 have found 
industrial use: the production of calcined soda by the 
Solvay method, the production of urea (carbamide), 
and 
the production of salicylic acid. At the same time 
scientific investigations show that carbon dioxide can 
be involved in numerous reactions and can serve as an 
initial substance for the synthesis of many useful 
chemical products. 
Many papers have been devoted to the introduction 
of COZ 
into complexes of transition metals with organic 
ligands; see reviews by Keim (1983), 
Aresta and Forti 
(19861, and Braunstein et al. (1988). Decomposition of 
these complexes gives organic acids, esters, lactons, etc. 
Bonding of C02 molecules as 
ligands in transition metal 
complexes is also known (Breslow et al., 1981; Fa- 
chinetti et al., 1978). The synthesis of organic carbon-

ates from C02 is a quickly developing field of C02 
chemical use. However, 
the mentioned reactions cannot 
solve the problem of COz emission decrease and cannot 
claim to be a large-scale consumer of COZ as raw 
material. In these cases a large number of another, 
rather expensive, component is necessary for involving 
COZ 
in the reaction. 
Redox reactions with the participation of C02 as an 
oxidant are more representative in this respect for large- 
scale C02 use. Inexpensive reducers, mainly hydrocar- 
bons, can be involved in the reaction with COS. These 
hydrocarbons are contained in the natural sources of 
raw materials (petroleum, natural gas). The best 
reducing agent for C02 is, of course, hydrogen. As was 
recently shown (Rozovskii 
and Lin, 1990), 
the synthesis 
of methanol from CO and HZ 
proceeds not by their direct 
interaction, but by preliminary transformation of CO 
into COZ 
CO + H20 
= 
C02 
+ 
H2 
(1) 
and after that by the interaction of COz with H2: 
C02 
+ 
3Hz = 
CH,OH + 
H20 
(2) 
Direct utilization of reaction 2 now meets with difficul- 
ties because a part of the expensive hydrogen is trans- 
formed into inexpensive water. For this reason hydro- 
carbons are more attractive. 
We have studied (Krylov et al., 1993; 
Mamedov, 1991; 
Mamedov et al., 1990a,b, 1992; Mirzabekova et al., 
1992a-e, 1993a-d) new reactions of C1-C7 alkane 
reduction with COZ 
to olefins and synthesis gas. It was 
found that manganese-containing catalysts are effective 
both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and 
for Cz-C7 alkane dehydrogenation into lower olefins, 
H2, and CO. These systems were found to be effective 
also for C02 interaction with organic compounds of other 
classes, for example, ethylene transformation into buta- 
diene Mirzabekova et al., 1994a,b), the reaction of 
methanol with CO2 for the formation of formaldehyde 
(Mirzabekova 
et al., 1993b), 
and the reaction of ethanol 
with COZ 
for butadiene formation (Mirzabekova et al., 
1994b). The use of manganese-containing catalysts in 
these reactions provides high conversions both of the

SPARG process, in which sulfur vapors are added to the 
reaction gases. The sulfur passivates nickel and pre- 
vents coking (Rostrup-Nielsen, 1988). 
In order to find the most effective catalyst and to 
elucidate the characteristics of catalyst selection, we 
carried out a study of the effect of modifying additives 
on the catalyst (Mamedov, 1991; Mamedov et al., 
1990a,b). 
Modification of nickel by different additives, such as 
Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI 
+ CO2 conversion. 
The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane 
catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect 
was obtained when manganese was used as the modify- 
ing additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree 
of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases. 
With increase of Mn content in the reduced Ni catalyst 
the CHI conversion during CH4 transformation (in the 
absence of CO2) was found to decrease. Therefore, 
modification 
of the Ni catalysts by Mn allows to change 
the reactivity of the C02 + CH4 mixture. 
Further investigation showed that the catalyst can 
function without any metallic component Mamedov, 
1991; Mamedov et al., 1990a,b, 1992, Mirzabekova et 
al., 1992b,c). The catalyst of the composition 5% Ca- 
12% 
MnO/A1203 
was the best one. After initial treating 
of the catalyst by COS 
at 850 "C, ethane and ethylene 
are produced on it in non-stationary-state conditions at 
the same temperature: 
oxidized substance and of C02 with a stable activity 
level during a long period without coke accumulation. 
Many aspects of the reaction mechanism of organic 
substances with COZ are yet unclear. This paper 
represents a review of our work and contains a discus- 
sion of the general characteristics of these reactions over 
manganese-containing catalysts of different composi- 
tions and of the role of manganese oxide in these 
reactions. 
Experimental Section 
The study of catalytic activity was performed in a flow 
system with a silica reactor 7 mm in diameter. The 
length of the catalyst layer was 7-8 cm; the amount of 
the catalyst was 4 cm3, 
the grains were 2-4 mm in size; 
the space velocity was changed from 900 to 12 000 h-l. 
The pulse method was also used; gaseous mixtures were 
analyzed by a gas chromatograph. 
All the catalysts were prepared by impregnation of 
silica, alumina, or zeolite with nitrates of different 
metals, followed by drying at 100-140 "C over 4 h and 
heating at 800-900 "C. The details of the experimental 
procedure are given in papers by Krylov et al. (19931, 
Mamedov (19911, Mamedov et al. (1990a,b, 19921, and 
Mirzabekova et al. (1992a-e, 1993a-d, 1994a,b). 
Most of the catalysts contain manganese and chro- 
mium oxides supported on alumina or silica. The X-ray 
diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 
catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases 
and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO 
with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing 
phase 
is probably due to its high dispersity. During the 
catalytic reaction the total intensity of these phases is 
not changed but an enlargement of A1203 particles is 
observed (from 20-30 to 70-80 nm). The dimension 
of A1203 particles is higher than that of MnAl204 phase. 
In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn 
catalyst the X-ray 
diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of 
manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; 
Mn304 and 
Mn2O3 phases are observed 
before the reaction and MnO 
and MnC03 are observed during the reaction. 
The catalysts prepared on the basis of both A1203 and 
Si02 do not have strongly different surface areas (34 
and 69 m2/g, 
respectively). This shows that the differ- 
ences in catalytic properties of these systems are not 
due to surface area influence. 
The study of the X-ray structure of the catalyst in situ 
is described in the paper of Mamedov et al. (1990b). 
Results and 
Discussion 
Methane Conversion. Methane oxidation 
by carbon 
dioxide is a practically important process for obtaining 
synthesis gas: 
CH4 + CO, = 
2H2 + 
2CO 
(3) 
This 
reaction is known to proceed on Ni and other metal 
catalysts (Ashcroft et al., 1991, 1993; Rostrup-Nielsen 
and Hansen, 1993; Erdohelyi et al., 1993). It also 
proceeds as a side reaction in methane steam reforming. 
The main difficulty 
met with when this reaction is used 
for the practical process of synthesis gas production is 
coking of the presently utilized nickel catalyst. 
Different methods are used for the commercial real- 
ization of synthesis gas production from the CH4 + 
C02 
mixture. The Calcor process of natural or petroleum 
gas conversion 
with C02 is known. Topsoe developed a

In this connection it is worthwhile to mention the 
papers of Aika and Nishiyama (1988) and Nishiyama 
and Aika (19911, who studied oxide catalysts for meth- 
ane oxidative coupling. It turned out that the PbO-MgO 
catalysts with moderate basicity showed a higher C2- 
hydrocarbon yield in the CH4 + 
C02 + 
0 2  
mixture than 
in the CH4 + 
0 2  
mixture. Experiments with 13C02 
and 
13CD4 
showed that all the CO was formed from COZ 
only 
but not as a result of subsequent hydrocarbon oxidation 
in the absence of CH4. The C02 was completely non- 
reactive on the catalyst. On the surface of MgO only 
reaction 3 of synthesis gas formation was observed. 
In our experiments on Ca-Mn-O/AlnOs, in the initial 
non-stationary-state period the C
2
 yield was 9% at 850 
"C. It increased up to 13% with decrease of the 
pretreatment temperature. When the initial oxides 
Mn304 and Mn2O3 are reduced, the formation of C2H6 
and CzH4 decreases and only synthesis gas in stationary 
state conditions is formed; 
that is, reaction 3 takes place. 
An X-ray difiaction (XRD) 
study shows that oxidized 
Mn phases Mn& and Mn2O3 promote total methane 
oxidation (in 
non-steady-state 
conditions); 
reduced phases 
MnO and MnC03 assist methane conversion into syn- 
thesis gas; intermediate phases, where 0- stabilization 
is possible, promote methane oxidative coupling. The 
process on the 5% Ca-12% Mn-O/Al203 catalyst pro- 
ceeds in stationary state conditions without loss of 
activity (Table 1). 
A comparison of H2 formation rates in steady state 
conditions (3 x 
mol/(g-h)) 
and during the reduction 
of the catalyst by methane (1.7 x 
mol/(gh)) 
shows 
that they are close to each other. A study of the 
characteristics of the catalyst reoxidation by COB 
showed 
that the rate of C02 interaction with reduced surface is

higher than the rate of reduction. Thus, unlike metallic 
catalysts (Ashcroft et al., 1991, 1993; Rostrup-Nielsen 
and Hansen, 1993; Erdohelyi et al., 1993), methane 
activation is the rate-controlling step on MnO-contain- 
ing catalysts but not the CO2 activation. The reaction 
does not seem to proceed by a cyclic redox mechanism. 
The stationary MnO phase is not oxidized and is not 
reduced during catalysis, but prevents coking. 
The most probable scheme of CH4 conversion with 
C02 is the following one: 
stepl: 
CH4+MnO-MnO***C+2H2

Kinetic equations for the rate of H2 formation follow 
from scheme 6:

where  c H  ,

constants for the reactions from scheme 6. Expression 
7 is conformed by experimental data and is different 
from the kinetic equations for metallic catalysts (Bodrov 
and Apelbaum, 1967). 
The 1.5% 
K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOn catalyst shows 
very different properties in methane conversion with

The process on K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz 
proceeds probably 
by a cyclic redox mechanism as distinct from the process 
on Ca-Mn-O/AlzOs. 
The oxygen amount of the K-Cr- 
Mn-O/SiOz catalyst participated in such cyclic process 
was considerably (8 
times) 
less than in a similar process 
with oxygen as an oxidant. 
The 1% 
La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz catalyst was 
very selective in Cz-hydrocarbon formation in non- 
steady-state regime (Mirzabekova 
et al., 1993). 
Almost 
100% 
CZ 
hydrocarbons were formed after C02 pretreat- 
ment and subsequent CH4 introduction. At the same 
time no CO is formed after C02 introduction. Thus, the 
process does not proceed by a cyclic redox mechanism

The reaction on La-Na-Mn-O/SiOz 
was studied at 
800 "C, that is, at a higher temperature than the 
temperature of MnC03 decomposition. However, the 
presence of an alkali metal, sodium, allows the support 
of a definite concentration of carbonate during the 
reaction. 
The selectivity of another catalyst studied by us, La- 
Cu-O/Si02, in the transformation into CZ 
hydrocarbons 
was lower. In the non-steady-state-regime 
CO is formed 
upon COZ 
interaction with the catalyst and C
2
 hydro- 
carbons are formed after subsequent methane interac- 
tion with the catalyst. In this case the cyclic redox 
mechanism is more probable. Synthesis gas, but not 
ethane and ethylene, is formed on both catalysts in the 
stationary conditions. 
Ethane Conversion. During ethane conversion 
with C02 a process without coking also takes on 
manganese-containing catalysts (Mamedov, 1991; Ma- 
medov et al., 1990a,b; 
1992; 
Mirzabekova et al., 1992b,c).

Table 2 presents data on ethane conversion on the 
catalysts with different manganese concentration and 
on some more complex systems. It is seen that the C2H4 
selectivity increases with increase of the Mn concentra- 
tion. 
17% 
MnO/SiO2 was the most effective 
catalyst among 
the studied supported manganese oxide systems. A 
similar catalyst supported on A 1 2 0 3  
displayed 
much less 
selectivity. On the nickel catalyst the reaction proceeds 
nonselectively in accordance 
with reactions 10 
with the 
formation of CO, H2, and coke. 
The stable activity of manganese systems and the 
absence of coke formation in the presence of carbon 
dioxide served as a basis for the choice of manganese 
oxide as 
the main component 
of the catalyst for selective 
conversion with carbon dioxide. 
Since ethane conversion to ethylene is a dehydroge- 
nation reaction, we studied the effect as modifying 
additions to manganese oxides of a series of oxides 
which are known as dehydrogenation catalysts. The 
Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., Vol. 34, No. 2, 1995 477 
The rate of the catalyst reduction by ethane (0.6 x 
10-3 mol/(gh) is close to that of the catalyst reoxidation 
by COZ 
(0.7 x 
mol/(gh). 
A study of phase composition 
of the K-Cr-MnO/SiOz 
catalyst in situ (Mamedov et al., 1990b) showed that 
the observed initial MnsO4 phase was reduced with the 
formation of a new phase, MnO. This study in reaction 
conditions was performed in an X-ray chamber- 
catalytic reactor specially constructed by us (Shiryaev 
et al., 1984). This reactor is less than 1 
cm3 
by volume, 
has a beryllium window, and allows performance mea- 
surements at temperatures up to 700 "C. The dispersity 
of the manganese-containing 
phase increased during the 
reaction. 
The mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation by COZ 
on the Mn-Cr-O/SiOz catalyst can be presented by the 
following scheme:

following systems were treated: MnO-FezOa, MnO- 
ZnO, MnO-SbzO,, MnO-Vz05, and MnO-Cr203. The 
most active and selective catalyst for CzH4 production 
was found to be 5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOz. Further 
increase of selectivity is observed after additional 
modification of this system by K. For example, on 
introduction of 1.5% potassium into the 5.5% 
Cr-17% 
Mn-O/SiOz catalyst leads to selectivity increase from 
65.4% up to 76.8% at 830 "C. 
A study of ethane and COZ 
conversion 
when they were 
taken in different proportions showed that C
Z
H
4
 selec- 
tivity at first increased with increase of the COdCzH6 
ratio and then reached a constant value at COdCzH6 > 
2.5. This effect is probably due to the increase of the 
oxidation state of the surface, leading to a decrease of 
the deep cracking of ethane. Such a feature in selectiv- 
ity change is significantly different from the specific 
features of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in the 
presence of 0 2  when olefin selectivity decreases with 
increase of poz. 
Reaction 5 can also be carried out in a cycling redox 
regime, where C
Z
H
6
 is transformed into C2H4 upon 
catalyst reduction and COZ 
is transformed into CO upon 
catalyst reoxidation. 
Taking into account that dehydrogenation and deep 
transformation of ethane proceed on different sites (Mn 
and Cr sites, respectively), the scheme of ethane conver- 
sions can be presented in the following 
form (Mamedov 
et al., 1990b, 1992): 
C2Hs 7 
;" 
-C2H4 
(11) 
2 - 
CO, 
products of cracking 
The direction of ethane transformation is determined 
by the ratio of oxidized and reduced sites (ZO/Z); its 
increase leads to increase of Cz& selectivity. As ethane 
conversion 
and CO accumulation 
in the reaction mixture 
increase, the surface of the catalyst is reduced by CO 
and the reaction switches from route I to route 11. 
In the absence of chromium, both oxidized (ZO) and 
reduced (Z) sites can be attributed to manganese 
oxides: for example, ZO = Mn3+ 
in Mnz03 or Mn304 
and Z = Mn2+ 
in MnO or MnC03. However, in the 
mixed Cr-Mn-0 
catalyst chromium oxides are the 
main phases participating in the redox process: ZO = 
C9+ 
and Z = 
Cr2+. The main role of manganese oxides 
is the formation of intermediate MnC03 which decom- 
poses upon redox interaction with the hydrocarbon. 
Potassium probably increases the stability of this 
intermediate carbonate. 
The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide 
is described by the equation 
where k,, and kred are rate constants of catalyst oxida- 
tion and reduction. Equation 12 explains the observed 
decrease of selectivity with conversion increase: an 
inhibition by COY 
a product of reaction 5, takes place. 
This redox equation differs from the corresponding 
redox equation for alkane oxidation by oxygen, where 
the denominator is represented by the sum kogoz + 
k r e  c ,  ,  
(Krylov, 1993). In the case of the C2Hs +

 was observed. 
Scheme 13 explains the higher yields of CO as 
compared to the reaction with CH4, where the following 
CO/H:! ratios are obtained: 5-8 at 830 "C and 1.5-2 at 
700 "C. This means that the role of thermal dehydro- 
genation, step 7 in scheme 13, is relatively small. 
Activation of the manganese system by chromium and 
the distinctly observed synergism are probably due to 
the fact that manganese oxide (MnO) 
is a mobile phase 
and takes part in reoxidation in the oxygen transfer 
from COZ:

The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate decom- 
position seems to play an important role here. Ethane 
and C02 conversion on the Cr-O/SiOa catalyst not 
containing manganese is very small. 
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) 
data for 
COz desorbed from the Mn-O/SiOz catalyst pretreated 
478 Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., Vol. 34, No. 2, 1995 
by CO2 testifies in favor of scheme 14. Desorption 
maxima at 335,425, and 750 "C which can be explained 
by inhomogeneity of acceptor sites were observed. 
Activation energies for CO2 thermodesorption are close 
to the values observed for oxygen during 0 2  
thermode- 
sorption from the same catalyst. This can point to a 
similarity of sites for C02 and 0 2  
activation and to the 
existence of general principles of reactions on Mn 
catalysts in oxidative transformations with 0 2  
and with 
c02. 
Only one high-temperature peak (at 750 "C) is ob- 
served in the TPD spectrum of the Cr-Mn-O/SiOz 
catalyst after C02 adsorption. Such a change afier 
transition from Cr-0 to Cr-Mn-0 is probably due to 
Cr2+ 
reoxidation by the intermediate Mn-containing 
phase which accepts C02. The observed (Mirzabekova 
et al., 1992b,c) 
decrease of the amount of adsorbed C02 
after prereduction by H
2
 shows that C02 adsorption 
sites are regular lattice surface 02- 
ions of a basic 
nature. The sites adsorbing C02 at high temperature 
(strong sites) are probably less reactive in Cr2+ 
reoxi- 
dation. 
Thus, the site basicity determines the stability of 
carbonate structure and, as consequence, 
the degree of 
redox site reoxidation. Basic sites of moderate basicity 
are necessary for C02 acceptance and Cr2+ 
reoxidation. 
Such sites are located at the surface of moderately basic 
MnO. The interphase boundary between MnO and CrO 
makes the reoxidation of CrO easier. 
The oxygen capacity of the Cr-0 system without Mn 
after reoxidation 
by C02 was found to be essentially less 
as 
compared to Cr-Mn-0. 
The Cr-Mn-0 composition 
can be considered as bifunctional: on the one hand, it 
provides C02 activation on basic sites; on the other it 
performs hydrocarbon transformation with redox site 
participation. The sites adsorbing oxygen and creating 
nucleophilic oxygen ions are sites of C02 transformation 
into an activated state, with the formation of mobile 
oxygen particles. They can be transferred (through the 
interphase boundary) from manganese carbonate to 
redox sites of chromium by a spillover mechanism. 
Propane Conversion. Three reactions proceed dur- 
ing propane conversion with COz, each of them to a 
different extent on different catalysis: propane dehy- 
drogenation by C02 to propylene (151, selective decom- 
position with C2H4 formation (16), 
and deep conversion 
into CO and H

Manganese oxide catalysts were in this case also the 
most active and stable ones. The COS 
conversion in the 
equimolar C3H8 + C02 mixture on the nickel catalyst 
was at 750 "C as high as 80-85%. However, propane 
transforms into CO and H
2
 and the process is charac- 
terized by high coking. 
The best catalyst for selective propane conversion 
with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. 
This catalyst is also effective 
for ethane transformation. 
The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ 
C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion and the 
ratio CO/(C2H4 + 
C3H6) = 1.4. At 890 "C the ratio CO/ 
(C2H4 + C3H6) increases up to 4. The amount of 
hydrogen in the reaction products is 5-8 times less than 
that of CO. With increase of conversion 
of considerable 
olefin selectivity decrease is observed. Such a charac- 
teristic is explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon 
Conversion and by obtaining a more reduced mixture 
than in the case of ethane (Mamedov, 1991; 
Mamedov 
et al., 1992). 
The general trends of propane conversion 
with carbon 
dioxide are similar to those observed for ethane trans- 
formation; see scheme 13. This is probably due to the 
similarity of the primary activation of the C-H bond 
in ethane and propane transformation on the partially 
oxidized Cr-Mn systems. 
After catalyst reduction by propane the rate of CZ- 
C
3
 olefins formation decreases. The rate of C2H4 forma- 
tion on the catalyst preoxidized by C02 is 2-3 times 
higher than on the reduced surface. However, preoxi- 
dation of the catalyst by air results mainly in the 
formation o
f
 total oxidation products-CO and ( 2 0 2 .  This 
is due probably to the formation of higher chromium 
oxides (up to Cr6+) 
afier catalyst oxidation by air instead 
of Cr203 
formation after C02 treatment. Mn-containing 
phase (MnO, according 
to XRD data in situ) takes part 
in oxygen transfer and helps to maintain chromium in 
a higher oxidized state (Cr3+). 
The amount of coke deposits after steady-state reac- 
tion (C3H$C02 = 1:1.2) does not exceed 3.6% (with 
respect to the mass of the catalyst). This coke after 
C3& treatment exists in two forms according 
to electron- 
microscopic data: filament-shaped carbon and small 
scales. However, after C3H8 + COZ treatment no 
filament-shaped coke is formed. The reason for this is 
the absence of metallic inclusions in the catalyst (CrO 
or MnO) and the quick removal of the metal nuclei of 
the carbon phase by the Boudouard reaction 
CO, +

The rate of selective transformation of C3Hs with CO2 
into ethylene is described by the equation 
which is very similar to eq 12. The rate of the catalyst 
reduction by C3H8 is 17 times less than the rate of 
reduction by CO. 
Conversion of n-Butane. The interaction of C02 
with n-butane also proceeds on manganese-containing 
oxide catalysts. n-Butane conversion of 8 1 4 4 %  
and 
C2-C4 olefin production with the selectivity 76-78% 
was observed on the Cr-Mn-La-V-O/AlsOs 
catalysts 
at 630-650 "C and with n-C4H$C02 = 1-1.2. The 
oxidative cracking (reactions 20-22) prevails over the

"C. This results in the formation of a reaction mixture 
containing i-C4H8, CO, and H2 as the main products. 
The side product here is propylene; the selectivity of its 
formation is about 10%. 
The kinetic equation of the process has the form (29), 
similar to the Mars-Van Krevelen equation. It differs 
The selectivity into synthesis gas was 22-24% and 
CO and H2 are obtained in equal amounts, which differs 
from the C02 reactions with ethane and propane. 
The direct cracking 
C4H10 - 
C3H6 - 
CH4 
(25) 
seems to constitute a considerable part of the process. 
The high content of C02 in the products confirms this 
conclusion. However, it is not very clear why such a 
process in the absence of C02 takes place in to a very 
small degree. 
Conversion of Isobutane. In the absence of C02 
the degree of C4Hlo dehydrogenations into C4H8 is 19% 
at 665 "C, but C02 is not involved in the reaction. 
Manganese oxide containing catalysts are active for 
oxidative dehydrogenation by C02 (23) 
(Mirzabekova 
et 
al., 
1993a-d). On the K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz 
catalyst 30- 
35% conversion of i-C4H10 and 5 8 %  
CO2 conversion 
were observed at 670 "C; on the K-Cr-Mn-O/Al203 
catalyst i-C4H8 conversion was 50% 
and CO2 conversion 
was 9-10%. The most effective catalyst was found to 
be Cr-Mn-O/AlzOa 
without potassium: &C4H10 
conver- 
sion was 61-66%, C02 conversion was 20-29.5%, and 
i-C4H8 selectivity 
was 78-81%. CO and H
a
 were formed 
in equal amounts. This is different from the ethane and 
propane conversion where the COM2 ratio was 7-8. 
Pretreatment of the catalyst by hydrogen in reaction 
conditions 
in contrast to ethane and propane conversion 
does not lead to a decrease of the isobutylene formation 
selectivity. The catalyst pretreatment by CO leads to 
characteristics of isobutane conversion which are dif- 
ferent from those observed for ethane and propane: the 
conversion of isobutane and the selectivity here de- 
crease. However, during the reaction an 
increase of the 
catalyst activity and selectivity takes place. 
The interaction of C02 with isobutane was studied 
also in the regime of separate interaction with the 
catalyst. The interaction of isobutane with the surface 
at 670 "C in the absence of C02 gives i-c4H8, C3H6, CH4, 
CO, and H2. The rate of CO formation upon i-C4H10 
interaction with the surface is substantially (12-30 
times) less than the rate of CO formation in the steady- 
state conditions. Only 3-4% is formed in the steady- 
state conditions as a result of regeneration of the coked 
catalyst by reaction 18. 
A study of the H
2
 + 
C02 reaction on the same catalyst 
showed that the rate of CO formation is close to the rate 
of CO formation in steady-state conditions of the C4H10 
+ C02 reaction. The rate of CO formation during CO2 
interaction with the reduced Cr-Mn-O/SiOz catalyst 
KO,] + 
[ 1 - 
co + 
Oads 
(26) 
is also considerably less (10 times) than the rate of CO 
formation in the steady-state conditions. 
Thus the main route of the CO formation is the 
reverse water gas shift (28) while the interaction of 
isobutane with C02 proceeds mainly by two consecutive 
reactions 
(27) 
H2 + 
C02 - 
H20 
+ CO 
(28) 
The hydrogen, formed upon isobutane dehydrogenation, 
is not oxidized completely: only about half of the 
hydrogen participates in the subsequent CO2 reduction 
in accordance 
with the equilibrium of reaction 28 at 660 
from eqs 12 and 19 for ethane and propane reactions 
with CO2. Thus the catalyst reduction by CO formed 
during the reaction is less significant than the catalyst 
reduction by isobutane. A change of kinetics upon 
transition from C2H6 and C3H8 to i-CQH10 is probably 
due to the lesser energy of the C-H bond in isobutane; 
this allows splitting of this bond with participation of 
the less oxidized or carbonate sites. 
The parallel formation of isobutylene and synthesis 
gas (CO + H2) upon isobutane interaction with C02 
allows proposal of a new process for the production of 
an important high-octane gasoline fuel, MTBE (methyl 
tert-butyl ether) by isobutane conversion with COS.

Reaction I is endothermic (AH = 37 kcal/mol), and 
reaction I1 is exothermic (AH = -22 kcaymol). A 
combination of these reactions will allow a decrease of 
the energetic expenditure for reaction I by a factor of 2. 
Conversion of n-Heptane. Heavy alkanes are 
subjected mainly to oxidative cracking upon interaction 
with C02 over manganese oxide catalysts (Mirzabekova 
et al., 1993d). The process can be directed toward the 
formation of light olefins, light alkanes, and isoalkanes 
without accumulation of coke at the surface. 
The reaction n-CTHls + 
C02 proceeds on the catalysts 
K-Mn-O/A1203, 
La-Mn-O/AlzOs, 
and La-Mn-O/ 
NaY at 540-670 "C. Oxidative cracking with the 
formation of H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and C4Hs is 
observed. On the La-Mn-O/NaY 
catalyst 100% n- 
heptane conversion into the cracking products is ob- 
served at 670 "C with small C02 conversion (4.2%) 
and 
with low H2 yield and COM2 = 10. Over La-Mn-O/ 
A1203 and K-Mn-O/Al203 CO and H2 are formed in 
equal amounts; n-heptane conversion on La-Mn-O/ 
A1203 was 86.4% at 670 "C and C02 conversion was 
30.2%. Thus, La-Mn-O/AlzOa 
and K-Mn-O/Al203 
were more active in CO2 activation. 
The rate of CO formation in the reaction H
a
 + C02 
was somewhat lower than the rate of CO formation in 
the reaction C7H16 + 
C02. The rate of CO formation in 
the steady-state conditions at 700 "C was 14 times 
higher than in conditions of the catalyst reoxidation. 
This means that the oxidation of the catalyst

is not the general route of CO formation in the steady- 
state conditions. The process of CO formation takes 
place by interaction of H2 with surface carbonates:

Another source of CO formation is reaction 18, i.e., 
the interaction of COZ 
with carbon-rich deposits. This 
provides selective proceeding of the oxidative (carbon 
dioxide) cracking with a stable activity. 
Thus, the oxidative cracking of n-heptane upon in- 
teraction with COZ can be described by the general 
equations

The mechanism of C4-C7 alkane transformation 
seems to be different from the case of C1-C3 alkanes. 
The general route in the case of CI-C 
alkanes involves 
dissociation of hydrocarbons and subsequent oxidation 
of the carbon fragments; oxidative dehydrogenation of 
ethane and propane proceeds also partially. The cata- 
lysts are in a more reduced state, and activation of the 
hydrocarbon is the rate-controlling step. 
In the case of C4-C7 alkanes the first step of the 
process is direct dehydrogenation of alkanes. Activation 
of COz, but not the activation of hydrocarbon, 
is the rate- 
controlling step. The hydrogen formed interacts with 
COZ 
and shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation 
reaction. 
Coke Gasification. Manganese was also shown to 
play a big role in the interaction of C02 with CH,, i.e., 
during the gasification of surface carbon fragments and 
regeneration of the catalyst (Mirzabekova 
et al., 1992a, 
1993a). 
Interaction of COz with zeolite-containing catalyst 
KNCU-B, coked in the cracking of vacuum gas oil, 
showed COZ 
conversion not more than 1% 
at 680 "C and 
COZ 
space velocity 900 h-l. The rate of CO formation 
was not high and did not change during 100 min. 
A 
considerable increase of the rate of COZ 
interaction 
with carbon fragments was observed on a catalyst 
modified by manganese acetate (5% Mn) after coking. 
The average rate of regeneration of the catalyst modified 
with Mn was 15 
times higher than that of the nonmodi- 
fied catalyst. 
When surface carbon reacts with COz, the formation 
of CO is accompanied 
by the formation of methane with 
a rate that is 1.3 times higher. 
An increase of the rate of CO formation is also 
observed when the coked catalyst is modified by chro- 
mium. However, the relationship between the rates of 
CHI and CO formation is substantially different on the 
catalysts modified with Mn and with Cr. A high CO/ 
CHI ratio equal to 4-5 is characteristic for the Cr- 
containing catalyst, but on the catalyst modified by Mn 
the rates of CH4 and CO formation are the same. 
Modifying additives can be introduced into the cata- 
lyst in the process of its preparation before its use in 
cracking and regeneration. Regeneration of zeolite- 
containing catalyst upon interaction with COS starts 
from 400 "C after introduction of 5% La203 into the 
catalyst. 
A study of the coked catalyst temperature pro- 
grammed heating in COz showed that CO, CH4, and Hz 
were present in the products. Equations for their 
formation can be presented in the form

Carbonate fragments at the surface take part also in 
the reaction. At low temperatures (400-600 "C) oxida- 
tion of CH, by COZ 
corresponds to the scheme 
CH, + 0,'-

With x = 2 the stoichiometric equation will be

(37) 
That is, both the methanation and the Boudouard 
reactions proceed upon oxidation of CH, fragments by 
coz. 
Thus the effective uptake of COZ 
by manganese or 
lanthanum oxides quarantees a high rate of CH, frag- 
ment oxidation on the cracking catalyst in their pres- 
ence. 
Ethylene Conversion. In the absence of a catalyst 
ethylene does not react with COZ. At 750-820 "C some 
conversion of C2H4 (up to 12%) 
was observed with the 
formation of CH4, C3H6, C4H6, and traces of C4H8. On 
nickel catalysts mainly synthesis gas is formed 
C2H4 + 
2C0, = 
4CO + 
2H2 
(38) 
Use of manganese and chromium oxide containing 
catalysts (Mirzabekova et al., 1994a) 
shows that ethyl- 
ene is transformed to butadiene and propylene; CO 
concentration is lower. At 850 "C the 17% MnO/SiOz 
catalyst exhibited the following properties: C

version of 22.3%, c
0
2
 conversion of 11.6%, 
C4H6 selec- 
tivity of 25.0%, and C3H6 selectivity of 18.0%. Although 
the free energy change for the reaction 
2C,H4 + (20, 
= 
C4H6 + co + H, 
(39) 
is positive, nevertheless CH4, C3H8, and C4H8 are also 
formed. It seems that more complex thermodynamic 
relations for the total process description should be 
found. 
Treatment of the MnO/SiOz catalyst by COZ 
leads to 
a decrease of C4H6 and C3H6 selectivities, 
and treatment 
by Hz causes an increase in selectivity. This trend 
differs from the corresponding trends for alkanes. The 
process takes place on the catalyst in the reduced state. 
Mirzabekova (1993a) proposed that the interaction of 
C2H4 with the reduced catalyst leads to its metathesis 
2C,H4 + 
22 - 
2C,H4Z -
+
 C,H,' + 
C2H,' +

whereas the further transformation of the free radicals 
gives coupling products: C4H8, C4H6, and C3H6. 
Addition of the metathesis catalysts WO3 and Cr2O3 
to manganese oxides increases their activity and selec- 
tivity. The 2% WO-5.5 % CrO/SiOz catalyst showed 
the highest conversion and C4H6 selectivity and did not 
coke during catalysis. This showed at 820 "C C2H4 
conversion of 30.5%, COZ conversion of 13.7%, C4Hs

selectivity 
of 50.2%, and C3H6 selectivity 
of 30.6%; 
C4H8, 
C2H6, CO, and CH4 were also formed. The rate of C02 
transformation was 2-3 times less than the rate of C2H4 
conversion. A part of COZ 
is spent in the reaction with 
coke. 
A study of the phase composition of Cr-W-O/SiOz 
during the reaction showed that Wos disappeared and 
most of Cr2.03 was reduced. 
The kinetic equation for butadiene accumulation in 
the reaction is described by 
where k4 is the rate constant of the homogeneous 
pyrolysis of ethylene. The second term here is 5-6 
times less than the first one. 
Equation 40 is very different from eq 7, 12, 19, and 
29 for alkanes. This difference is possibly due to the 
Lewis acidity of the W-Cr-0 
catalysts, which results 
in less accepting ability to accept C02. 
On the K-Cr-MnO/SiOz 
catalyst, probably on its 
oxidized form, 
the reaction of ethylene with COZ 
at 750- 
800 "C results in the formation of CO and H2 as the 
main products and no butadiene is formed. 
The possibility of ethylene transformation into buta- 
diene allows putting forward a new scheme of its 
production from natural gas without the use of crude 
petroleum:

Methanol Conversion. The operation of manganese 
oxide catalysts by the redox mechanism was also shown

Conclusion 
We have shown here the importance of adsorption and 
activation of COZ 
and the conjugation of its reduction 
with conversion of c1-C 
hydrocarbons and alcohols. 
Mn-containing catalysts are the most effective ones in 
these reactions. There are yet many unclear problems 
in the mechanism and kinetics of these reactions. 
However, we can indicate some general conclusions 
concerning the choice of the catalysts. 
The indispensable condition is the selection of a 
system which adsorbs and activates COZ. The acidic 
properties of C02 necessitate the choice of a catalyst

with basic properties. However, alkali metal and 
alkaline earth oxides are ineffective because of strong 
carbonate formation. Oxides of a moderate basicity are 
necessary, and moreover, they must participate in redox 
process with C02 reduction. Manganese oxides satisfy 
this requirement. Redox decomposition of manganese 
carbonate proceeds by the equation 
3MnC0, - 
Mn,O, + 
2C02 + 
CO 
Modification of the Mn-containing catalyst by other 
oxides (for example, by K, Na, Cr, and La) influences 
both its acceptor function and the degree of surface 
oxidation. It controls the mechanisms of hydrocarbons 
or alcohol transformation. 
Rare earth oxides have properties similar to those of 
manganese oxides: lanthanum, praseodymium, and 
cerium oxides can be reduced and oxidized; 
they can also 
form carbonates of moderate stability. We have shown 
that catalysts containing lanthanum can form a catalyst 
for C02 interaction with hydrocarbons and alcohols. 
Bernal et al. (1990) showed that La203 is a catalyst of 
ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by C02.
