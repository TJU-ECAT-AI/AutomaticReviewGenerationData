          [1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols."

[3] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[4] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[5] "The catalyst of the composition 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al203 was the best one."

[6] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs."

[7] "A study of the X-ray structure of the catalyst in situ shows that oxidized Mn phases Mn304 and Mn2O3 promote total methane oxidation (in non-steady-state conditions); reduced phases MnO and MnC03 assist methane conversion into synthesis gas; intermediate phases, where 0- stabilization is possible, promote methane oxidative coupling."

[8] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

[9] "In the case of Mn-Cr-O/SiOn catalyst the X-ray diffraction study did not show a direct interaction of manganese and chromium oxides with Si02; Mn304 and Mn2O3 phases are observed before the reaction and MnO and MnC03 are observed during the reaction."

          The literature provides insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as particularly effective. They are active, selective, and stable for converting CH4 + CO2 mixtures to synthesis gas and for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to alter their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Manganese was found to be the best modifying additive, with increasing Mn content leading to higher CO2 conversion and decreased coking.

3. Specific catalyst compositions were identified as best performing:
   - 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 for general performance
   - 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 for selective propane conversion with CO2

4. The oxidation state of manganese plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance:
   - Oxidized phases (Mn3O4 and Mn2O3) promote total methane oxidation
   - Reduced phases (MnO and MnCO3) assist methane conversion to synthesis gas
   - Intermediate phases promote methane oxidative coupling

5. For Mn-Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, XRD studies show the presence of MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

6. In Mn-Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts, no direct interaction between manganese and chromium oxides with SiO2 was observed. Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases are present before the reaction, while MnO and MnCO3 are observed during the reaction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Catalyst composition and metal loading
- Oxidation state of active metal components
- Support material and its interactions with active components
- Catalyst preparation method and resulting phase composition

Regarding the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the literature does not provide detailed information about how chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in XRD due to high dispersity, suggesting that chromium species are highly dispersed on the support at the loadings studied.

          文献对CO2-ODHP（烷烃氧化脱氢）的各种金属氧化物催化剂的性能提供了一些见解：

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被强调为特别有效。它们在CH4 + CO2混合物转化为合成气以及C2-C7烃和低级醇的氧化脱氢反应中具有活性、选择性和稳定性。与金属催化剂不同，它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 镍催化剂可以通过添加Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂来改变其CH4 + CO2转化的性能。锰被发现是最好的改性添加剂，增加Mn含量会导致更高的CO2转化率和更少的结焦。

3. 特定的催化剂组成被确定为性能最佳：
   - 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 用于一般性能
   - 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 用于CO2选择性丙烷转化

4. 锰的氧化态在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用：
   - 氧化态（Mn3O4和Mn2O3）促进甲烷完全氧化
   - 还原态（MnO和MnCO3）辅助甲烷转化为合成气
   - 中间态促进甲烷氧化偶联

5. 对于Mn-Cr/Al2O3催化剂，XRD研究显示存在MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，可能是由于其高度分散性。

6. 在Mn-Cr-O/SiO2催化剂中，未观察到锰和铬氧化物与SiO2的直接相互作用。反应前存在Mn3O4和Mn2O3相，反应过程中观察到MnO和MnCO3。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
- 催化剂组成和金属负载量
- 活性金属组分的氧化态
- 载体材料及其与活性组分的相互作用
- 催化剂制备方法和由此产生的相组成

关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，文献并未提供关于铬物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。唯一提到的是由于高度分散性，XRD中未检测到含铬相，这表明在所研究的负载量下，铬物种在载体上高度分散。
