[1] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols."

[3] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[4] "With increase of Mn content in the reduced Ni catalyst the CHI conversion during CH4 transformation (in the absence of CO2) was found to decrease."

[5] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

The literature provides some insights into how various metal oxide catalysts compare for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as particularly effective. They are described as active, selective, and stable for converting CH4 + CO2 mixtures to synthesis gas and for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons and lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts, they do not form carbon layers during reactions.

2. Nickel catalysts can be modified with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides to alter their properties for CH4 + CO2 conversion. Increasing Mn content in reduced Ni catalysts decreases CH4 conversion in the absence of CO2.

3. For Mn-Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, XRD studies show the presence of MnO, γ-Al2O3, and MnAl2O4 spinel phases. Chromium-containing phases are not detected, likely due to high dispersity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Catalyst composition and additives
2. Metal oxide dispersion
3. Support material interactions (e.g., formation of spinels)
4. Oxidation state of active components

Regarding chromium species evolution, the literature doesn't provide specific information about how Cr2O3 species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. The only mention is that chromium-containing phases are not detected in Mn-Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, possibly due to high dispersity. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address this aspect of the question.

文献对CO2-ODHP（烷烃的氧化脱氢）的各种金属氧化物催化剂的比较提供了一些见解：

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂被强调为特别有效。它们被描述为活性高、选择性好、稳定性强，可用于将CH4 + CO2混合物转化为合成气，以及C2-C7烃和低级醇的氧化脱氢。与金属催化剂不同，它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 镍催化剂可以通过添加Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂来改变其CH4 + CO2转化的性能。在还原的Ni催化剂中增加Mn含量会降低在没有CO2存在时的CH4转化率。

3. 对于Mn-Cr/Al2O3催化剂，XRD研究显示存在MnO、γ-Al2O3和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，可能是由于其高度分散性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成和添加剂
2. 金属氧化物的分散度
3. 载体材料的相互作用（如尖晶石的形成）
4. 活性组分的氧化态

关于铬物种的演变，文献没有提供关于Cr2O3物种如何随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。唯一提到的是在Mn-Cr/Al2O3催化剂中未检测到含铬相，可能是由于高度分散性。需要更详细的研究才能全面回答这个问题的这一方面。
