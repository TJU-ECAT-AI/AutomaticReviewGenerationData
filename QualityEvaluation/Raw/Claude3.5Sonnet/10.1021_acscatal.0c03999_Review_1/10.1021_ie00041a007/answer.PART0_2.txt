[1] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are active, selective, and stable in conversion of the CHI + C02 mixture into synthesis gas and in oxidative dehydrogenation of c2-c7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols. Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[2] "Modification of nickel by different additives, such as Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn oxides, etc. changes its properties in CHI + CO2 conversion."

[3] "The study of C02 pulse interaction with methane catalysts coked in methane showed that the best effect was obtained when manganese was used as the modifying additive. Upon increase of Mn content the degree of CO2 conversion increases and the coking decreases."

[4] "The catalyst of the composition 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al203 was the best one."

[5] "The X-ray diffraction study of initially prepared Mn-Cr/Al-0 catalysts shows the existence of MnO, y-AlzO3 phases and MnAl204 spinel phase formed by interaction of MnO with Al2O3. The absence of chromium-containing phase is probably due to its high dispersity."

The literature provides some insights into the performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins):

1. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are generally active, selective, and stable for the conversion of CH4 + CO2 mixtures into synthesis gas and for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C7 hydrocarbons. They do not form carbon layers during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

2. Modifying nickel catalysts with additives like Cu, Cr, Fe, and Mn oxides changes their properties in CH4 + CO2 conversion.

3. Manganese was found to be the best modifying additive for methane catalysts. Increasing Mn content leads to higher CO2 conversion and decreased coking.

4. A specific composition of 5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3 was identified as the best catalyst among those studied.

5. For Mn-Cr/Al-O catalysts, X-ray diffraction studies showed the presence of MnO, γ-Al2O3 phases, and MnAl2O4 spinel phase. The chromium-containing phase was not detected, likely due to its high dispersity.

The literature does not provide detailed information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. More specific studies focusing on chromium-based catalysts would be needed to address this aspect of the question.

文献对各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（烷烃氧化脱氢）中的性能提供了一些见解：

1. 锰氧化物基催化剂通常在CH4 + CO2混合物转化为合成气以及C2-C7烃类的氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性、选择性和稳定性。与金属催化剂不同，它们在反应过程中不会形成碳层。

2. 用Cu、Cr、Fe和Mn氧化物等添加剂修饰镍催化剂会改变其在CH4 + CO2转化中的性能。

3. 锰被发现是甲烷催化剂最好的改性添加剂。增加Mn含量会导致更高的CO2转化率和更少的结焦。

4. 特定组成为5% Ca-12% MnO/Al2O3的催化剂被确定为所研究催化剂中最佳的。

5. 对于Mn-Cr/Al-O催化剂，X射线衍射研究显示存在MnO、γ-Al2O3相和MnAl2O4尖晶石相。未检测到含铬相，这可能是由于其高度分散性。

文献没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。需要更多针对铬基催化剂的具体研究来解答这个问题的这一方面。
