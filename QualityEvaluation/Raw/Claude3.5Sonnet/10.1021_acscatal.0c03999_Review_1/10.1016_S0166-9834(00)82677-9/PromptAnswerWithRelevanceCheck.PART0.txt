Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The document discusses the conversion of propane over platinum-loaded H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. It does not mention CO2 dehydrogenation or chromium oxide catalysts at all. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献不包含任何关于CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂或负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的信息。该文档讨论了铂负载H-ZSM-5沸石催化剂上丙烷的转化。它完全没有提到CO2脱氢或氧化铬催化剂。因此,无法根据提供的文本回答这个问题。
