[1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. At low chromium oxide loadings, Cr6+ species are anchored to the alumina support.

2. As loading increases, dispersed Cr6+ and Cr3+ oxide species form.

3. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

4. The catalytic activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings where activity decreases.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the surface area of the alumina support.

6. The support's crystalline structure and surface area influence the distribution of chromium species.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
- Chromium oxide loading
- Support surface area and crystalline structure
- Distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species
- Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings

While the study focuses on dehydrogenation of isobutane rather than CO2-ODHP, these insights into chromium species evolution are likely relevant to other reactions catalyzed by supported chromium oxide catalysts.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。但是，它提供了关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的见解：

1. 在低铬氧化物负载量时，Cr6+物种锚定在氧化铝载体上。

2. 随着负载量增加，形成分散的Cr6+和Cr3+氧化物物种。

3. 结晶态α-Cr2O3仅在更高的铬氧化物负载量下出现。

4. 催化活性通常与总铬含量成正比，但在非常高的负载量时活性下降。

5. 接枝的Cr6+量与氧化铝载体的表面积成正比。

6. 载体的晶体结构和表面积影响铬物种的分布。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
- 铬氧化物负载量
- 载体表面积和晶体结构
- Cr6+和Cr3+物种的分布
- 在高负载量下形成结晶态α-Cr2O3

虽然该研究侧重于异丁烷脱氢而非CO2-ODHP，但这些关于铬物种演变的见解可能与其他由负载铬氧化物催化剂催化的反应相关。

[1] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[2] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[3] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

[4] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts:

1. Activity is generally proportional to the overall chromium content, except at very high loadings where activity decreases.

2. At low loadings (<2 wt% CrO3), all chromium exists as grafted Cr6+ species.

3. As loading increases, Cr3+ species start to form (>4 wt% CrO3) and increase linearly with loading.

4. The amount of grafted Cr6+ reaches a maximum (1.5 wt%) and doesn't increase further at higher loadings.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but doesn't fully cover the surface.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include chromium loading, oxidation state distribution (Cr6+ vs Cr3+), and support properties like surface area. The evolution from predominantly Cr6+ to increasing Cr3+ species with higher loadings likely impacts activity and selectivity.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它提供了有关负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的见解：

1. 活性通常与总铬含量成正比，但在非常高的负载量时活性会下降。

2. 在低负载量时（<2 wt% CrO3），所有铬以接枝Cr6+物种形式存在。

3. 随着负载量增加，Cr3+物种开始形成（>4 wt% CrO3），并随负载量线性增加。

4. 接枝Cr6+的量达到最大值（1.5 wt%）后，在更高负载量时不再增加。

5. 接枝Cr6+的量与载体表面积成正比，但不会完全覆盖表面。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括铬负载量、氧化态分布（Cr6+与Cr3+）以及载体性质如表面积。随着负载量增加，从以Cr6+为主转变为增加Cr3+物种的演变可能会影响活性和选择性。

[1] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 6008C: (i) a Cr31 species; (ii) a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; (iii) a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."

[2] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[3] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP or compare various metal oxide catalysts. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts:

1. Three types of chromium species are present in calcined catalysts: Cr3+, water-soluble Cr6+, and grafted Cr6+.

2. At low loadings (<2 wt% CrO3), all chromium is in the form of grafted Cr6+. This species reaches a maximum of 1.5 wt% and does not increase further with higher loadings.

3. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but does not fully cover the alumina surface.

4. Cr3+ species appear at loadings above 4 wt% CrO3 and increase linearly with higher chromium oxide content.

These findings suggest that the distribution and nature of chromium species change significantly with loading and support properties, which likely influences catalytic performance. However, the document does not provide direct information on activity or selectivity for CO2-ODHP or compare different metal oxide catalysts for this reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP或比较各种金属氧化物催化剂。然而，它提供了有关负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的见解：

1. 焙烧后的催化剂中存在三种铬物种：Cr3+、水溶性Cr6+和接枝Cr6+。

2. 在低负载量（<2 wt% CrO3）时，所有铬以接枝Cr6+形式存在。这种物种达到最大值1.5 wt%，并且在更高负载量下不再增加。

3. 接枝Cr6+的量与载体表面积成正比，但并未完全覆盖氧化铝表面。

4. 当负载量超过4 wt% CrO3时，Cr3+物种开始出现，并随着铬氧化物含量的增加而线性增加。

这些发现表明，铬物种的分布和性质随着负载量和载体特性的变化而显著改变，这可能会影响催化性能。然而，该文档并未提供关于CO2-ODHP活性或选择性的直接信息，也没有比较不同金属氧化物催化剂在该反应中的表现。
