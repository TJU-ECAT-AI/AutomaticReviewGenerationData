[1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does provide insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. At low chromium oxide loadings, Cr6+ species are anchored to the alumina support.

2. As loading increases, dispersed Cr6+ and Cr3+ oxide species form.

3. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

4. The catalytic activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings where activity decreases.

5. The amount of Cr6+ grafted to the surface is proportional to the surface area of the alumina support.

6. The grafted Cr6+ species do not completely cover the alumina surface, even at high loadings.

These findings suggest that the key factors influencing catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include:
- Chromium oxide loading
- Support surface area and crystalline structure
- Distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species
- Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings

However, the document does not provide specific information on CO2-ODHP or comparisons with other metal oxide catalysts for this reaction.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提供了关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的见解：

1. 在低铬氧化物负载量时，Cr6+物种锚定在氧化铝载体上。

2. 随着负载量的增加，形成分散的Cr6+和Cr3+氧化物物种。

3. 结晶态α-Cr2O3仅在较高的铬氧化物负载量下出现。

4. 催化活性通常与铬的总量成正比，但在非常高的负载量下活性会下降。

5. 接枝到表面的Cr6+量与氧化铝载体的比表面积成正比。

6. 即使在高负载量下，接枝的Cr6+物种也不会完全覆盖氧化铝表面。

这些发现表明，影响负载Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：
- 铬氧化物的负载量
- 载体的比表面积和晶体结构
- Cr6+和Cr3+物种的分布
- 在较高负载量下形成结晶态α-Cr2O3

然而，该文档并未提供关于CO2-ODHP反应的具体信息，也未与其他用于该反应的金属氧化物催化剂进行比较。
