[1] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[2] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[3] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

[4] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly compare various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts:

1. Activity is generally proportional to the overall chromium content, except at very high loadings where activity decreases.

2. At low loadings (<2 wt% CrO3), all chromium exists as grafted Cr6+ species.

3. As loading increases, Cr3+ species start to form (>4 wt% CrO3) and increase linearly with loading.

4. The amount of grafted Cr6+ reaches a maximum (1.5 wt%) and doesn't increase further at higher loadings.

5. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but doesn't fully cover the surface.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include chromium loading, oxidation state distribution (Cr6+ vs Cr3+), and support properties like surface area. The evolution from predominantly Cr6+ to increasing Cr3+ species with higher loadings likely impacts activity and selectivity.

该文献并未直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它提供了有关负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的见解：

1. 活性通常与总铬含量成正比，但在非常高的负载量时活性会下降。

2. 在低负载量时（<2 wt% CrO3），所有铬以接枝Cr6+物种形式存在。

3. 随着负载量增加，Cr3+物种开始形成（>4 wt% CrO3），并随负载量线性增加。

4. 接枝Cr6+的量达到最大值（1.5 wt%）后，在更高负载量时不再增加。

5. 接枝Cr6+的量与载体表面积成正比，但不会完全覆盖表面。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括铬负载量、氧化态分布（Cr6+与Cr3+）以及载体性质如表面积。随着负载量增加，从以Cr6+为主转变为增加Cr3+物种的演变可能会影响活性和选择性。
