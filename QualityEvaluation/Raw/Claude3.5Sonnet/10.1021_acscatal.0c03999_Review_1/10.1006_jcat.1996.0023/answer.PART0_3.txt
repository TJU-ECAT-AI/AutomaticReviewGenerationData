[1] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 6008C: (i) a Cr31 species; (ii) a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; (iii) a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."

[2] "At low chromium oxide loading (less than 2 wt% CrO3) all the oxide was in the form of grafted Cr61, not dissolved by the preliminary treatment with water. The amount of this species, however, reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further even at the highest loading of chromium oxide."

[3] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

[4] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

The literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP or compare various metal oxide catalysts. However, it provides insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts:

1. Three types of chromium species are present in calcined catalysts: Cr3+, water-soluble Cr6+, and grafted Cr6+.

2. At low loadings (<2 wt% CrO3), all chromium is in the form of grafted Cr6+. This species reaches a maximum of 1.5 wt% and does not increase further with higher loadings.

3. The amount of grafted Cr6+ is proportional to the support surface area but does not fully cover the alumina surface.

4. Cr3+ species appear at loadings above 4 wt% CrO3 and increase linearly with higher chromium oxide content.

These findings suggest that the distribution and nature of chromium species change significantly with loading and support properties, which likely influences catalytic performance. However, the document does not provide direct information on activity or selectivity for CO2-ODHP or compare different metal oxide catalysts for this reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP或比较各种金属氧化物催化剂。然而，它提供了有关负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的见解：

1. 焙烧后的催化剂中存在三种铬物种：Cr3+、水溶性Cr6+和接枝Cr6+。

2. 在低负载量（<2 wt% CrO3）时，所有铬以接枝Cr6+形式存在。这种物种达到最大值1.5 wt%，并且在更高负载量下不再增加。

3. 接枝Cr6+的量与载体表面积成正比，但并未完全覆盖氧化铝表面。

4. 当负载量超过4 wt% CrO3时，Cr3+物种开始出现，并随着铬氧化物含量的增加而线性增加。

这些发现表明，铬物种的分布和性质随着负载量和载体特性的变化而显著改变，这可能会影响催化性能。然而，该文档并未提供关于CO2-ODHP活性或选择性的直接信息，也没有比较不同金属氧化物催化剂在该反应中的表现。
