[1] "Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina which contained increasing amounts of chromium oxide were prepared and characterized with different techniques: XPS, UVVisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XRD, and chemical analysis."

[2] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

[3] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chomium oxide loading."

[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

[5] "Figure 3 reports the amount of grafted Cr61 determined in a series of samples prepared by impregnation of the same amount of chromium oxide (15.3 wt% CrO3) over aluminas characterized by different crystalline structures and different surface areas."

[6] "It is seen that the amount of Cr61 grafted to the surface was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."

The literature does not directly discuss CO2-ODHP or compare various metal oxide catalysts for this reaction. However, it does provide insights into the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties:

1. At low chromium oxide loadings, Cr6+ species are anchored to the alumina support.

2. As loading increases, dispersed Cr6+ and Cr3+ oxide species form.

3. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 only appears at higher chromium oxide loadings.

4. The amount of Cr6+ grafted to the surface is proportional to the support's surface area.

5. Catalyst activity is generally proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except at very high loadings where activity decreases.

6. The support's crystalline structure and surface area influence the distribution of chromium species.

These factors likely influence catalytic performance, though the specific impact on CO2-ODHP is not discussed in this literature.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP或比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在该反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了关于负载量和载体性质对负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的见解：

1. 在低铬氧化物负载量时，Cr6+物种锚定在氧化铝载体上。

2. 随着负载量的增加，形成分散的Cr6+和Cr3+氧化物物种。

3. 结晶态α-Cr2O3仅在较高的铬氧化物负载量下出现。

4. 固定在表面的Cr6+数量与载体的比表面积成正比。

5. 催化剂活性通常与总铬含量成正比，但在非常高的负载量下活性会下降。

6. 载体的晶体结构和比表面积影响铬物种的分布。

这些因素可能会影响催化性能，尽管该文献中并未讨论它们对CO2-ODHP的具体影响。
