[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "Most of the practical methods reported for the preparation of Cr-loaded catalysts resulted in a variety of chromium species. Chromium can be present as an isolated unit and/or bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms."

[5] "As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies. In the case of 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 sample, the spectra reveal that there might be both 3+ and 6+ states of Cr in isolated and abundant amounts of nanoparticles."

[6] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature and distribution of chromium species: The activity is determined by the types of chromium species present on the support surface. These can exist as isolated units, bulk oxides, or in different agglomeration forms.

2. Oxidation state of chromium: Cr6+ species are crucial for high catalytic activity initially. During the reaction, these are reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance.

3. Chromium loading: Lower loadings (e.g., 3 wt%) tend to have predominantly Cr6+ species, while higher loadings (e.g., 5 wt%) show a mix of Cr3+ and Cr6+ states in both isolated and nanoparticle forms.

4. Support properties: The support material affects the dispersion and nature of chromium species.

5. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 suppresses partial deactivation by coke formation and enhances propylene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is characterized by a transition from predominantly isolated Cr6+ species at lower loadings to a mix of oxidation states and more agglomerated forms at higher loadings. This evolution significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括钒、铬和钼，都被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬氧化物表现出特别有前景的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的性质和分布：活性由支撑表面上存在的铬物种类型决定。这些物种可以以孤立单元、块状氧化物或不同的聚集形式存在。

2. 铬的氧化态：Cr6+物种对初始高催化活性至关重要。在反应过程中，这些物种被还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表现出高催化性能。

3. 铬负载量：较低的负载量（如3 wt%）倾向于以Cr6+物种为主，而较高的负载量（如5 wt%）在孤立和纳米粒子形式中都显示出Cr3+和Cr6+状态的混合。

4. 载体性质：载体材料影响铬物种的分散和性质。

5. 反应条件：CO2的存在抑制了因焦炭形成导致的部分失活，并通过去除脱氢过程中形成的H2来增强丙烯的产率。

随着负载量的增加和载体性质的变化，铬物种的演变特征是从低负载时以孤立的Cr6+物种为主，过渡到高负载时氧化态混合和更多聚集形式的混合。这种演变显著影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
