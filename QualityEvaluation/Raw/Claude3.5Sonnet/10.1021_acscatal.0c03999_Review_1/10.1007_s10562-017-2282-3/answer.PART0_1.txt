[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[2] "As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins"

[3] "The catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "Among four catalysts investigated, the 7 wt% catalyst showed highest propane conversion. The propylene selectivity was also increased with loading due to the decrease in the amount of exposed support surface."

[5] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Chromium oxide catalysts demonstrate promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2, which helps suppress coke formation and enhance propylene yield. Titanium-containing catalysts, like Ti-TUD-1, also exhibit excellent catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of chromium species on the support surface
2. Chromium loading 
3. Support properties
4. Presence of CO2

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial. Higher chromium loading (up to 7 wt%) generally increases propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This is due to a decrease in the amount of exposed support surface and an increase in active chromium species.

The oxidation state of chromium plays a significant role. A high number of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity. During the reaction, Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance. The support material (in this case, TUD-1) also influences the dispersion and stability of chromium species, affecting overall catalyst performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下表现出良好的催化活性，有助于抑制积碳形成并提高丙烯产率。含钛催化剂，如Ti-TUD-1，在氧化反应中也表现出优异的催化活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体表面铬物种的性质
2. 铬的负载量
3. 载体特性
4. CO2的存在

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体特性的演变至关重要。较高的铬负载量（高达7 wt%）通常会增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这是由于暴露的载体表面减少和活性铬物种增加所致。

铬的氧化态起着重要作用。焙烧后催化剂中高含量的Cr6+物种对高催化活性至关重要。在反应过程中，Cr6+物种迅速还原为分散的Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表现出高催化性能。载体材料（在本例中为TUD-1）也影响铬物种的分散性和稳定性，从而影响整体催化剂性能。
