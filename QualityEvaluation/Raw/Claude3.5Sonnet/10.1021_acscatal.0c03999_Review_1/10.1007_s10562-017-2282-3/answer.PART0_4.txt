[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins"

[5] "Generally, the UV bands at around 268 and 370 nm are assigned to the charge transfer bands between O2− → Cr6+, and the bands at 460 and 600 nm are attributed to the presence of an octahedral Cr3+ in the Cr2O3 or CrOx."

[6] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures. As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with Cr–O–Cr framework species."

[7] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum supported on different carriers have been investigated for CO2-ODHP. Among these, chromium oxide catalysts have shown promising activity, with CO2 helping to suppress coke formation and enhance propylene yield.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of chromium species on the support surface
2. Preparation method (e.g. microwave irradiation)
3. Support properties (e.g. surface area, pore structure)
4. Chromium loading

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is as follows:

- At low loadings (e.g. 3 wt%), Cr6+ species predominate with Cr-O-Cr framework structures
- As loading increases, there is a mix of Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ species
- Higher loadings lead to more polymeric Cr2O3 species

The Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts are crucial for high activity. During the reaction, Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance. The support properties influence the dispersion and nature of these chromium species.

Overall, optimizing the balance of different chromium oxidation states and their dispersion on the support is key to achieving high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括钒、铬和钼等负载在不同载体上的催化剂，都被用于研究CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物催化剂表现出了很有前景的活性，CO2的存在有助于抑制积碳形成并提高丙烯的产率。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体表面铬物种的性质
2. 制备方法（如微波辐射）
3. 载体特性（如比表面积、孔结构）
4. 铬的负载量

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变如下：

- 在低负载量（如3 wt%）时，以Cr6+物种为主，形成Cr-O-Cr骨架结构
- 随着负载量增加，出现Cr6+、Cr3+和Cr2+物种的混合
- 更高的负载量导致更多的多聚Cr2O3物种形成

煅烧后催化剂中的Cr6+物种对高活性至关重要。在反应过程中，Cr6+迅速还原为分散的Cr3+和Cr2+物种，这些物种表现出高催化性能。载体特性影响这些铬物种的分散程度和性质。

总的来说，优化不同铬氧化态的平衡及其在载体上的分散是实现CO2-ODHP反应高活性和高选择性的关键。
