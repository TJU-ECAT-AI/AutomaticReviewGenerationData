[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "The catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "Most of the practical methods reported for the preparation of Cr-loaded catalysts resulted in a variety of chromium species. Chromium can be present as an isolated unit and/or bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms."

[5] "The degree of crystallization of the chromium species is also considered to be another important factor in the dehydrogenation reactions. It has been reported in the literature that isolated chromium species are more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than crystalline α-Cr2O3 when SBA-15 was used as the support. On the contrary, oligomeric chromium species were more active than isolated chromium species when γ-Al2O3 was used as the support"

[6] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of chromium species: The activity is determined by the type of chromium species present on the support surface. These can exist as isolated units, bulk oxides, or in different agglomeration forms.

2. Degree of crystallization: The crystallization of chromium species plays an important role. Isolated chromium species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3 on SBA-15 support, while oligomeric species are more active on γ-Al2O3 support.

3. Oxidation state: A high number of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts is crucial for high catalytic activity. These Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species during the reaction, which exhibit high catalytic performance.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., SBA-15, γ-Al2O3) influences the activity of different chromium species.

5. Chromium loading: The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading amount. Higher loadings tend to result in more polymeric or bulk chromium oxide species.

6. Presence of CO2: CO2 suppresses partial deactivation by coke formation and enhances propylene yield by removing H2 formed during dehydrogenation.

The interplay of these factors determines the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括钒、铬和钼，已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬氧化物表现出特别有前景的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的性质：活性取决于支撑表面上存在的铬物种类型。这些物种可以以孤立单元、块状氧化物或不同的聚集形式存在。

2. 结晶度：铬物种的结晶度起着重要作用。在SBA-15支撑上，孤立的铬物种比晶态α-Cr2O3更活跃，而在γ-Al2O3支撑上，寡聚铬物种比孤立铬物种更活跃。

3. 氧化态：焙烧催化剂中高数量的Cr6+物种对高催化活性至关重要。这些Cr6+物种在反应过程中迅速还原为分散的Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表现出高催化性能。

4. 支撑性质：支撑的性质（如SBA-15、γ-Al2O3）影响不同铬物种的活性。

5. 铬负载量：铬物种的演变取决于负载量。较高的负载量往往会导致更多的聚合物或块状铬氧化物物种。

6. CO2的存在：CO2抑制了焦炭形成导致的部分失活，并通过去除脱氢过程中形成的H2来增强丙烯产率。

这些因素的相互作用决定了CO2-ODHP反应中的整体催化性能。
