Abstract
A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant. The microwave irradiation reduced the synthesis time and the resulting Cr-TUD-1 catalysts exhibited a high specific surface area of more than 600 m2 g1. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution to understand the physicochemical properties, and to correlate with the catalytic activity. Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%). The Cr-TUD-1 catalyst was also found to be quite stable up to 8 h of time-on-stream investigated. As revealed by the characterization techniques, the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials. The TUD-1 enables to encapsulate the chromium nanoparticles in the porous silica structure with high dispersion which help in maintaining the better catalytic performance.

1 Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints). It is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation [1,2,3]. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. This reaction thus provides a promising option to serve as a great example for CO2 utilization. As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry. Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse watergas shift reaction [8,9,10,11,12]. However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation.
A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane [2, 10, 13,14,15]. Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [10, 13]. Of course, chromium is one of the key components in various commercial catalysts, including polymerization catalysts (Phillips catalyst) [16, 17], oxidation catalysts [18], and photocatalysts [19, 20]. It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface [21,22,23,24,25,26]. Extensive investigations have been carried out to correlate the catalytic performance with the physicochemical properties of the active catalysts. Nevertheless, there have been ongoing debates about the catalytic role of Cr species, because the identification of Cr species has been proven to be challenging. Most of the practical methods reported for the preparation of Cr-loaded catalysts resulted in a variety of chromium species. Chromium can be present as an isolated unit and/or bulk oxide with different agglomeration forms. Further, the redox properties of chromium catalysts are governed by the Cr valence state, coordination number, molecular structure, bulk oxide feature, active phase density, and other. There properties are highly dependent on the preparation method adopted, nature of the support employed, and the pretreatment conditions applied. The degree of crystallization of the chromium species is also considered to be another important factor in the dehydrogenation reactions. It has been reported in the literature that isolated chromium species are more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than crystalline α-Cr2O3 when SBA-15 was used as the support. On the contrary, oligomeric chromium species were more active than isolated chromium species when γ-Al2O3 was used as the support [24].
The TUD-1 (Technische Universiteit Delft), a unique three dimensional mesoporous network structure, synthesized by an unconventional non-templating method employing a cheap structure directing agent, namely, triethanolamine (TEA) has attracted a lot of attention recently as an interesting porous material [27]. It is one of the few mesoporous materials having three-dimensional intersecting pores as well as high specific surface area with tunable porosity and pore size. The properties of the three-dimensional mesoporous structure could be modified by introducing various active metals like Ti, Al, Fe, and Ga for different catalytic applications [28,29,30,31,32]. The Ti-containing mesoporous silica materials such as Ti-MCM-41 or Ti-SBA-15, which exhibit a well-defined mesoporous structure (i.e., with 20100 Å pore size), are known to exhibit a great catalytic activity for certain oxidation reactions [33, 34]. However, their thermal stability is weaker than TUD-1. To the best of our knowledge, the transition metal containing TUD-1 materials were not explored properly for the ODH of propane. As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins [28, 35]. The better catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 originates from both high accessibility of the substrate to the catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system, and from the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls.
The MW irradiation has received a tremendous interest, and it has been regarded as a novel synthesis tool for making of different materials owing to several advantages such as homogeneous nucleation to provide smaller and uniform crystals having rather larger external surfaces, rapid decrease in the synthesis time, phase controlled synthesis, facile morphology control, greener synthesis by energy efficient way, and so on [36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. Further, the use of MW technique for the synthesis of nanoporous materials allows relatively facile incorporation of hetero-atoms into the zeolitic frameworks, more hydrophobicity, and higher thermal stability than those of hydrothermally synthesized materials. The MW synthesized micro porous materials were also found to show superior catalytic performance for certain important reactions [40,41,42]. Therefore, synthesis of porous materials by MW technique has been extensively explored, and reported to show many advantages, such as fast synthesis, increased phase purity and phase selectivity, narrow pore size distribution, and facile morphology control [37].
The present study was undertaken against the aforesaid background. In this investigation, chromium containing Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various Cr loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by MW irradiation and characterized by different techniques. Finally, the synthesized catalysts were investigated to understand the influence of dispersed nano-chromium species in the TUD-1 matrix for propane ODH to propylene with CO2 as the soft oxidant.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
The typical chemicals employed in this study, namely, tetraethylortosilane (TEOS; Aldrich, USA), triethanolamine (TEA; Aldrich, USA), quaternary ammonium hydroxide (Aldrich, USA), chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were procured from various commercial suppliers and used without further purification.
An appropriate amount of water and TEA were mixed together and stirred for few minutes to obtain a homogeneous solution. To this solution, the desired quantity of TEOS and the chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Cr (NO3)3·9H2O) were added, and then a solution of quaternary ammonium hydroxide was mixed under vigorous stirring. Different amounts of chromium nitrate were added to obtain various loadings of Cr (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) in the final catalysts. The resulting mixture was aged at room temperature for 24 h and then subjected to microwave treatment in a Teflon vessel at 180 C for 2 h. The obtained products were oven dried at 120 C for 12 h and finally calcined in air atmosphere at 600 C for 10 h. The Cr-containing TUD-1 materials were denoted as x wt% Cr-TUD-1, where x is the weight percent of the metal oxide.
2.2 Catalyst Characterization
The crystalline nature of materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction technique on a Rigaku Multiflex with CuKα radiation source in the 2θ range of 0.7880 with a 2θ step size of 0.02 and a step time of 2.4 s at ambient temperature. The XRD phases present in the samples were identified with the help of Powder Diffraction File-International Centre for Diffraction Data (PDF-ICDD). The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at liquid-N2 temperature. Before each measurement, the sample was degassed at 150 C for 5 h. The specific surface areas were calculated by BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method from the desorption data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range=0.0400.25. The total pore volumes were estimated from the amount of adsorbed nitrogen at the relative pressure of 0.98. The pore size distribution was calculated by using BarretJoynerHalenda (BJH) method from desorption branches. The TEM images were obtained on a JEM-2010 (JEOL) instrument at 400 kV. The preparation of samples for TEM analysis involved sonication in ethanol for 25 min followed by deposition of a drop of solution on a copper grid followed by drying and evacuation. The specimen was examined under vacuum at room temperature. Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra were collected at ambient temperature by using a Solidspec-3700 spectrometer with BaSO4 as the reference material. The UVvis spectral data were converted to RubellaMonk units. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were made on a Thermo Scientific Instrument with monochromated Al Kα radiation source. The analysis was done at room temperature and the pressures were maintained in the order of less than 108 Pa. Survey and multi-region spectra were recorded at C 1s photoelectron peaks.
2.3 Catalytic Activity
The catalytic activity for the ODH of propane with CO2 as the soft oxidant was carried out in a fixed-bed micro reactor with the reactor outlet pressure being atmospheric. The reaction temperature was measured by a thermocouple inserted into the reactor near to the catalyst bed and connected to a temperature indicator-cum-controller. The reactor effluents were analyzed by well-calibrated Intelligent Gas Chromatograph (Model No. iGC7200A) equipped with TCD (Alltech Porapak Q 80/100, 6×1/8×0.085 SS column) and FID (Agilent Technologies Inc., GS-Alumina 30 m×0.530 mm column). The catalyst (200 mg) was loaded into the reactor and secured between quartz wool plugs and treated under N2 atmosphere (50 ml min1) for 1 h at 400 C at the ramping rate of 5 C min1. The reactant mixture consisted of propane (10.5 ml min1), CO2 (2.55 ml min1), and an inert gas at a constant 1020 h1 gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was flown over the catalyst bed. The conversion of propane during the reaction was calculated by measuring the inlet and outlet concentrations of the propane. The selectivity of the products was estimated based on the overall carbon numbers present in the reaction products. The carbon balance was within 95% that indicated some coke accumulation on the catalyst surface.
3 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the low angle XRD patterns of various Cr-containing TUD-1 samples at the diffraction angles between 1 and 5. As can be noted from this figure, there is a variation in the peak positions based on the Cr content in the samples. Of course, the observed XRD peaks were very broad. The samples with 3 and 5 wt% chromium loadings showed broad peaks at lower than 1, but the 7 wt% sample showed a broad peak at around 1.2 revealing mesoporosity. On the other hand, the 9 wt% sample showed no significant peaks. The wide angle XRD patterns (Fig. 1, inset) of all the investigated samples showed only broad diffraction lines due to amorphous silica background at around 23. No significant peaks pertaining to the crystalline phases of chromium oxide were observed except a small peak at around 36.2 and other one at around 52 corresponding to the Cr2O3 with insignificant intensity. The absence of crystalline peaks pertaining to chromium oxide could be attributed to several factors, such as incorporation of Cr ions into the silica matrix, amorphous nature of the chromium oxide or a high dispersion of Cr species in the TUD-1 matrix.

As show in Fig. 2, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of various Cr-TUD-1 samples exhibit the typical type IV reversible isotherms as per the IUPAC classification [43], which unequivocally indicate the meso-structure of the materials with a narrow pore size distribution. Hysteresis loops of all the samples showed H3-type behavior. The hysteresis loops were found to increase sharply at a relative pressure P/P0=0.40.8 due to the capillary condensation of the nitrogen inside the mesopores of the TUD-1. With increasing chromium content, the pore structure appears to transform from one form to another form. Interestingly, relatively high specific surface areas were observed for all the samples ranging from 600 to 1100 m2 g1 as presented in Table 1. With increase in the chromium loading from 3 to 9 wt%, the surface area was found to increase, and reached more than 1000 m2 g1 at the highest loading of 9% investigated in this study. This observation is in line with an earlier reported concept that as long as the silica to the metal ratio remains at 50, there is every possibility that the metal will be incorporated into the porous structure [44]. Interestingly, the investigated Cr-TUD-1 catalysts showed smaller pore size when moved to higher loadings indicating pore-filling of the metal oxides thereby narrowing the pore size as evidenced by the pore size distribution measurements (Fig. 2). The low angle XRD results as shown in Fig. 1 and the pore size distribution measurements could be corroborated where higher loading Cr sample shows narrowed pore diameter as low as 3 nm and lowest loading sample (3 wt%) shows 7 nm.

The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra are found to be complex with several overlapping bands. However, some of the prominent bands were distinguishable at around 268, 370, 460, and 600 nm. Generally, the UV bands at around 268 and 370 nm are assigned to the charge transfer bands between O2   Cr6+, and the bands at 460 and 600 nm are attributed to the presence of an octahedral Cr3+ in the Cr2O3 or CrOx. Particularly, the bands at around 270 and 360 nm are the result of the charge transfer transitions 1A1  1T2 (1t1  7t2 and 6t2  2e) and 1A1  1T2 (1t1  2e), respectively [45, 46]. An additional shoulder band at around 455 nm, typical for dichromates, is also present and its intensity increased gradually with the Cr content indicating an increase in the polymerization degree of the Cr6+ species. The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures. As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies. In the case of 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 sample, the spectra reveal that there might be both 3+ and 6+ states of Cr in isolated and abundant amounts of nanoparticles. In the case of higher loadings up to 7 wt%, the phenomenon of Cr states is similar to that of 5 wt% sample. The absorption feature at 600 nm is characteristic of transitions centered on the octahedral coordinated Cr3+ ions specifically, between its occupied and unoccupied 2d orbitals. The higher loading samples (above 7 and 9%) show polymeric Cr2O3 species. The presence of the Cr3+ species in the catalysts with higher Cr loading was also confirmed from XRD studies. In the 2θ range of 570, the broad diffraction lines corresponding to the crystalline phase of the α-Cr2O3 were detected.

The XP spectra of various samples are shown in Fig. 4. As known, the XPS analysis of Cr6+ is complex owing to the reduction of Cr6+ under the X-ray irradiation [47]. Therefore, we have analyzed the presence of Cr3+ sites, which are known to be active for the stable production of propylene. The XP spectra of the Cr 2p region with two characteristic peaks centered at around 577.4 and 587.4 eV, corresponding to the Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2 spinorbit components, respectively, are marked and shown in Fig. 4 [21]. According to the literature, the binding energy of Cr 2p3/2 signals observed at around 577.4 eV could be assigned to the Cr3+ state and that of 575.9 eV signal to the Cr2+ state [47]. The intensity ratio of Cr 2p3/2 to Cr 2p1/2 was typical of hexavalent chromium. When the experiment was done with a higher chromium loading almost three times greater, but still below the saturation coverage, nearly identical results were obtained. Fitting parameters for Cr(0), Cr(III) oxide, Cr(III) hydroxide, and Cr(VI) components were determined and these take into account the asymmetry in the metal peak, a broader envelope of peaks attributed to multiplet splitting of the Cr(III) compounds and a single peak (no unpaired electrons) for Cr(VI) compounds [47]. The Cr(III) oxide shows discrete multiplet structure whereas the hydroxide shows only a broad peak shape. The asymmetry determined for the metal peak is based on the spectra from an argon ion sputter cleaned pure metal surface. Quantification of the Cr(VI) species (single peak at 579.5 eV from the average of literature data, FWHM of 1.31.5 eV to incorporate a variety of Cr(VI) species; or 579.6 eV for a standard CrO3, FWHM of 1.31.4 eV) is complicated by the overlap with the multiplet splitting of Cr(III) species. This is likely to result in an increase in the detection limit for Cr(VI), when present in a matrix dominated by Cr(III), to around 10% of the total Cr. Any contribution attributed to Cr(VI) below this value should be treated as below detection limits. The XPS results fairly corroborated well with the XRD and UVvis DRS results.

The representative TEM images of various samples are shown in Fig. 5. As can be noted from this figure, with increasing chromium content the particle sizes of the CrOx have been observed to increase as expected. At the low loading of Cr (3 wt%), the particle size ranged between 4 and 7 nm and at the highest Cr loading of 9 wt% the particle sizes were as large as 2530 nm. The particle size and shape were found to vary with the chromium loading in the samples. Some rod like structures were also observed in case of 5 and 9 wt% samples.

The influence of reaction temperature on the ODH of propane with CO2 as the soft oxidant was investigated thoroughly over the 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst to optimize the reaction conditions. As noted from this exercise (shown in Fig. 6), the initial catalytic activity was found to be low at 425 C, and with the raise in the temperature the conversion increased with concomitant decrease in the selectivity towards propylene. At 550 C reaction temperature, the same trend of activity and selectivity were followed and reached to 70% selectivity at 650 C with a high conversion of 48%. The CO2 conversion at 550 C was observed to be 3.5%, and increased to 5.5% at 650 C. Therefore, further reactions were carried out at 550 C as the temperature did not show much impact on the CO2 conversion. The catalytic activity of various Cr-loaded samples was evaluated under identical optimized conditions. As presented in Fig. 7, various catalysts exhibited different catalytic activities based on the availability of the active Cr species. As can be observed from Fig. 7, the propane conversion increased with loading up to 7 wt% and thereafter there was a decrease with further loading of Cr to 9 wt%. Among four catalysts investigated, the 7 wt% catalyst showed highest propane conversion. The propylene selectivity was also increased with loading due to the decrease in the amount of exposed support surface. It appears that a constant fraction of surface chromium oxide sites are active for the ODH of propane reaction. Interestingly, the 7 wt% catalyst did not shown much drop in the catalytic activity even after 8 h of reaction time. The CO2 conversions are shown in the brackets next to the conversion line in Fig. 7. As can be noted from this figure, the CO2 conversions were initially high but decreased along with the drop in the activity in the course of time-on-stream. Interestingly, the 7 wt% catalyst showed reasonably good stability with a small decrease in the activity which can be attributed to the effect of CO2 on the catalytic activity and stability. However, in the case of other samples the decrease in the activity was found to be more than 40%. The product selectivity at <60 min of reaction time was relatively low for lower loading samples (3 and 5% Cr) that may be due to a highly isolated Cr6+ species which might produce more COx than propene. However, the higher loading catalysts (7 and 9%) showed higher selectivities because of the presence of Cr6+ polymeric species. When the reaction was performed at 600 C over the 9% catalyst, a high conversion of propane with more CO2 were noted (Fig. S1). A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance. In the presence of CO2, the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate both in oxidative and non-ODH of propane. The characterization studies suggest that the surface chromia species are predominantly present as Cr6+ species (monomeric or polymeric) depending on the amount used and the surface area of the support. The prepared samples were observed to be chemically active for the ODH of propane.

The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts along with the amount of coke formed is displayed in Table 2. The coke formation was calculated by measuring the weight gain of the catalysts after the reaction as well as by TGA measurements of the used catalysts. All catalysts showed a decrease in the surface area and pore volume after the use mainly due to coke formation on the catalyst surface and in the pores. The decrease in the surface area as well as pore volume is more in case of higher Cr loading samples (7 and 9%) where the pores are assumed to have coke deposits on the metal surfaces which are trapped in the pores. The amount of coke in the case of 7% used catalyst where helium was used as the carrier gas has a higher amount of coke than in case of CO2 as the carrier gas. Similarly, the decrease in the surface area and pore volume are more in the case of 7% used catalyst where He was used the carrier gas. The used catalysts exhibited an unclear UV spectrum which could be attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

To understand the significance of CO2 in the ODH of propane over Cr-TUD-1 catalysts, the reaction was performed at 550 C on 7 wt% catalyst in the presence and absence (with He) of CO2 under identical conditions. Figure 8 shows the results pertaining to the reaction that was performed in CO2 and He streams, where the amount of propylene product was found to decrease substantially within 4 h of reaction time under helium stream. The substantial decrease in the activity of the catalyst under He stream could be attributed to the amount of coke formed and complete reduction of the Cr species. As can be noted from Table 2, the amount of coke in the case of used catalyst under helium stream shows more coke formation compared to the other catalysts where CO2 was used as the reaction medium. The decrease in the coke amount during CO2 stream could be attributed to the ODH process and the ability of CO2 to increase the dehydrogenation product than cracking products. The simultaneous reduction with H2 and oxidation with CO2 were done on a 9% Cr catalyst and the results are shown in Fig. S2. Initially, the catalyst was reduced under H2 stream with increasing temperature (H2-TPR) stimulating the direct dehydrogenation process where hydrogen is released as by-product during the dehydrogenation reaction followed by CO2 treatment for 30 min, and finally the catalyst was reduced again with H2. The H2-1 run and H2-2 run shows similar pattern indicating that the CO2 successfully oxidized the reduced Cr species.

Based on the present study and in line with earlier reported literature, the mechanism of propane ODH over metal-oxide surfaces under CO2 atmosphere could be tentatively proposed in the following equations [10]:
A weak associative adsorption of propane on the lattice oxygen
$${{\text{C}}_3}{{\text{H}}_8}+{{\text{O}}*} \Leftrightarrow {{\text{C}}_3}{{\text{H}}_8}{{\text{O}}*}$$
CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighbouring lattice oxygen
$${{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{8}}}{{\text{O}}*}+{{\text{O}}*} \to {{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{7}}}{{\text{O}}*}+{\text{O}}{{\text{H}}*}$$
Desorption of propylene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
$${{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{7}}}{{\text{O}}*} \to {{\text{C}}_{\text{3}}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{6}}}+{\text{O}}{{\text{H}}*}$$
Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M (metal) center (*)
$${\text{O}}{{\text{H}}*}+{\text{O}}{{\text{H}}*} \Leftrightarrow {{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}+{{\text{O}}*}{+*}$$
Re-oxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of CO2
$${\text{2C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}{+*}{+*} \Leftrightarrow {\text{2CO}}+{\text{2}}{{\text{O}}*}$$
To understand the deactivation of the catalysts due to coke formation under the influence of CO2, the deactivation parameter, as defined bellow (Eq. 1), was estimated and the results are shown in Fig. S3:
$${\text{Deactivation parameter}}\,\left( \% \right) = {\text{conversion of propane}}\left( {{\text{initial}} - {\text{final}}} \right)/\left( {{\text{initial}}} \right) \times 100$$ (1)
As can be noted from Fig. S3, the deactivation rate was more in the case of 3 and 5% samples, in comparison to higher loading samples, where the independent Cr6+ species are deactivated by reduction to lower inactive oxidation states along with coke formation. The reasons for deactivation could be either the agglomeration of Cr species or reduction of the active species or coke formation. The coke formation is generally low as the precursors of coke are in gaseous state. The rate of Cr species reduction by H2 that is released from simple dehydrogenation is faster than the rate of CO2 ability to re-oxidize the reduced Cr species which causes the deactivation faster though CO2 is able to oxidize. Further studies are highly essential to understand the role of each mechanism to account the deactivation of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts under the CO2 atmosphere.
4 Conclusions
Highly dispersed Cr species in high surface area TUD-1 catalysts were prepared by microwave irradiation method. This approach resulted in Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with surface specific area of more than 600 m2 g1 and well distributed Cr species. Low temperature activation of propane and CO2 were achieved using the thermally stable Cr-TUD-1 samples. Stable conversion of propane to propylene was observed where the deactivation rate is lower in the case of higher loading Cr-TUD-1 catalysts that showed very stable activity during the 8 h time-on-stream study. A high conversion of propane up to 45% with a good selectivity of 75% propylene was observed at 600 C reaction temperature. The role of CO2 in the ODH of propane has been addressed. The ODH of propane with CO2 is a challenging catalytic technology and further studies are highly essential to make it commercially viable.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
