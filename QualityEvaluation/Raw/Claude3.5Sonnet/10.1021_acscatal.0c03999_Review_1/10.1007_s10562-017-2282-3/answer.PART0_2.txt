[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane"

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide was found to show a promising catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 that suppressed the partial deactivation by coke formation, and enhanced the yield of propylene by removing H2 formed in the dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface"

[4] "As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins"

[5] "With increase in the chromium loading from 3 to 9 wt%, the surface area was found to increase, and reached more than 1000 m2 g1 at the highest loading of 9% investigated in this study."

[6] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures. As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species."

[7] "A high number of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2. In the presence of feed (propane+CO2), the Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to the dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit a high catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts including vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum supported on different carriers have been investigated for CO2-ODHP. Among these, chromium oxide catalysts have shown promising activity, with CO2 helping to suppress coke formation and enhance propylene yield.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of chromium species on the support surface
2. Preparation method (e.g. microwave irradiation)
3. Support properties (e.g. surface area, pore structure)
4. Chromium loading

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is as follows:

1. At lower loadings (e.g. 3 wt%), Cr6+ species predominate with CrOCr framework structures.
2. As loading increases (up to 9 wt%), surface area increases, reaching over 1000 m2/g.
3. Higher loadings lead to more polymeric Cr2O3 species.
4. Calcination produces Cr6+ species, which are crucial for high catalytic activity.
5. Under reaction conditions, Cr6+ rapidly reduces to dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, which exhibit high catalytic performance.

The interplay between these factors determines the overall catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括钒、铬和钼等负载在不同载体上的催化剂，已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物催化剂表现出了promising的活性，CO2的存在有助于抑制积碳形成并提高丙烯产率。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体表面铬物种的性质
2. 制备方法（如微波辐射）
3. 载体特性（如比表面积、孔结构）
4. 铬的负载量

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，随着负载量和载体特性的变化，铬物种的演变如下：

1. 在较低负载量（如3 wt%）时，以Cr6+物种为主，形成CrOCr骨架结构。
2. 随着负载量增加（最高到9 wt%），比表面积增加，可达1000 m2/g以上。
3. 较高负载量会导致更多的多聚Cr2O3物种形成。
4. 焙烧过程产生Cr6+物种，这对于高催化活性至关重要。
5. 在反应条件下，Cr6+迅速还原为分散的Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表现出高催化性能。

这些因素之间的相互作用决定了CO2-ODHP反应的整体催化活性和选择性。
