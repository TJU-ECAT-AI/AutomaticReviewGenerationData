[1] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[2] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[3] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[4] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

[6] "In recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements."

[7] "With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides often perform better than single metal oxides. For example, a 20% In2O3 - 80% Al2O3 mixed oxide showed the highest propylene yield among tested indium-based catalysts.

2. Active species: The nature of the active sites is crucial. For chromium catalysts, dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are believed to be the most active. For indium catalysts, small metallic In particles formed by reduction of In2O3 clusters are thought to be the active species.

3. CO2 addition: CO2 in the feed generally improves olefin yield through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. It can also help decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption.

4. Loading: For chromium catalysts, activity increases with loading up to a point, after which it drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. This highlights the importance of maintaining a highly dispersed active phase.

5. Support properties: The support can influence the dispersion and reducibility of the active phase. For example, the interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports results in better dispersion of small In nanoparticles compared to SiO2 supports.

6. Oxidation state: The oxidation state of the metal is crucial. For chromium, Cr3+ is generally considered the active species, while for indium, metallic In0 is believed to be active.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated Cr3+ species predominate. As loading increases, polymeric species form, and eventually, at high loadings, crystalline Cr2O3 starts to appear. The support can influence this evolution by affecting the dispersion and stability of the chromium species. The optimal catalyst typically has a high dispersion of Cr3+ species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 组成：混合氧化物通常比单一金属氧化物表现更好。例如，20% In2O3 - 80% Al2O3混合氧化物在测试的铟基催化剂中显示出最高的丙烯产率。

2. 活性物种：活性位点的性质至关重要。对于铬催化剂，分散的和配位不饱和的Cr3+物种被认为是最活跃的。对于铟催化剂，由In2O3簇还原形成的小金属In颗粒被认为是活性物种。

3. CO2添加：料流中的CO2通常通过逆水气变换反应提高烯烃产率。它还可以帮助减少积碳沉积并辅助产物脱附。

4. 负载量：对于铬催化剂，活性随负载量增加而增加，直到达到一个临界点，之后当结晶Cr2O3开始形成时活性下降。这突出了保持高度分散活性相的重要性。

5. 载体性质：载体可以影响活性相的分散性和可还原性。例如，In2O3与Al2O3或ZrO2载体的相互作用比与SiO2载体相比，可以更好地分散小In纳米颗粒。

6. 氧化态：金属的氧化态至关重要。对于铬，Cr3+通常被认为是活性物种，而对于铟，金属In0被认为是活性的。

负载的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，以分离的Cr3+物种为主。随着负载量的增加，聚合物种形成，最终在高负载量时，结晶Cr2O3开始出现。载体可以通过影响铬物种的分散性和稳定性来影响这种演变。最佳催化剂通常具有高度分散的Cr3+物种，而不形成块状Cr2O3。
