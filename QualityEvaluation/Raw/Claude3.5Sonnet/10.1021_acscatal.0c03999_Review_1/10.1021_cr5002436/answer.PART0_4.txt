[1] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[2] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[3] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[4] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[5] "Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation."

[6] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

[7] "Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Zirconia-supported catalysts are more active than silica or alumina-supported ones for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This is due to increased surface Cr5+ during regeneration, which forms active Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

2. Metal-support interaction: The strong interaction between chromia and basic zirconia support leads to higher amounts of Cr5+, improving activity.

3. Coking resistance: While Cr2O3/ZrO2 is more active, it deactivates faster due to higher coking rates compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3. Mesoporous supports like GaAl mixed oxides show increased resistance to coking.

4. Formation of inactive species: Chromiazirconia catalysts favor the formation of inactive chromium carbides, causing deactivation.

5. CO2 addition: Adding CO2 to the feed improves olefin yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

1. Higher loadings and basic supports (like zirconia) promote the formation of Cr5+ species during regeneration.

2. These Cr5+ species then form catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

3. However, the support also influences deactivation mechanisms, with some supports promoting faster coking or formation of inactive species like chromium carbides.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：与二氧化硅或氧化铝相比，二氧化锆负载的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中更活跃。这是由于再生过程中表面Cr5+增加，在反应条件下形成活性Cr3+。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：氧化铬与碱性二氧化锆载体之间的强相互作用导致更高含量的Cr5+，提高了活性。

3. 抗结焦能力：虽然Cr2O3/ZrO2活性更高，但由于结焦速率更快，其失活速度比Cr2O3/Al2O3更快。像GaAl混合氧化物这样的介孔载体表现出更高的抗结焦能力。

4. 无活性物种的形成：铬-锆催化剂有利于形成无活性的碳化铬，导致失活。

5. CO2的添加：向反应物料中添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质：

1. 更高的负载量和碱性载体(如二氧化锆)促进再生过程中Cr5+物种的形成。

2. 这些Cr5+物种随后在反应条件下形成具有催化活性的单核Cr3+。

3. 然而，载体也影响失活机制，某些载体促进更快的结焦或形成无活性物种，如碳化铬。
