[1] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[2] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[3] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[4] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."

[5] "At first, the selectivity toward alkenes is fairly low and the catalyst produces mainly carbon oxides, as is shown in Figure 17. This is attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%."

[6] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved performance, as seen with In2O3-Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Active species: For In2O3-based catalysts, small metallic In particles formed under reaction conditions are believed to be the active species.

3. CO2 effect: CO2 can have a beneficial effect through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by retarding catalyst deactivation at sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios.

4. Support material: The choice of support affects the nature of active species. For chromium catalysts, γ-alumina favors oligomeric chromium oxide species, while SBA-15 favors isolated chromia species with higher coordination numbers.

5. Oxidation state: For chromium catalysts, there is an induction period where highly oxidized, inactive species are reduced to active lower oxidation states. This affects initial selectivity.

6. Conversion level: High selectivity (93.6%) can be achieved at moderate conversion levels (55%) for some chromium catalysts.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on:

1. Loading: Higher loadings tend to favor oligomeric species over isolated species.

2. Support properties: Different supports (e.g., γ-alumina vs. SBA-15) promote the formation of different types of chromium species, affecting activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: The oxidation state and nature of chromium species change during the reaction, with an initial reduction of highly oxidized species to more active forms.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP(使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢)中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 组成：混合氧化物可以显示出更好的性能，如In2O3-Al2O3催化剂所示。

2. 活性物种：对于基于In2O3的催化剂，在反应条件下形成的小金属In颗粒被认为是活性物种。

3. CO2效应：CO2可以通过逆水气变换反应产生有益效果，并在足够高的CO2:碳氢化合物比例下延缓催化剂失活。

4. 载体材料：载体的选择影响活性物种的性质。对于铬催化剂，γ-氧化铝有利于寡聚铬氧化物种，而SBA-15有利于具有较高配位数的孤立铬氧化物种。

5. 氧化态：对于铬催化剂，存在一个诱导期，高度氧化的非活性物种被还原为活性较低的氧化态。这影响初始选择性。

6. 转化水平：对于某些铬催化剂，在适度的转化水平(55%)下可以实现高选择性(93.6%)。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于：

1. 负载量：较高的负载量倾向于形成寡聚物种而非孤立物种。

2. 载体性质：不同的载体(如γ-氧化铝vs. SBA-15)促进不同类型铬物种的形成，影响活性和选择性。

3. 反应条件：在反应过程中，铬物种的氧化态和性质发生变化，高度氧化的物种最初被还原为更活跃的形式。
