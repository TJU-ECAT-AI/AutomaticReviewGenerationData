[1] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[2] "The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "Notably, at loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity. (218, 219)"

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques. (145-148) The relative concentration of these species seems to be dependent on a number of factors, such as chromium loading (relative to the surface area), the calcination treatment used during catalyst preparation, and the support employed."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals several key factors influencing their catalytic performance:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved activity compared to single metal oxides. For example, a mixed oxide of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 demonstrated the highest propylene yield in propane dehydrogenation.

2. Acidity: The presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface can be crucial for activity. However, the effect of acidity can change in the presence of CO2, leading to different performance trends among catalysts.

3. Metal oxide loading: The activity of catalysts is influenced by the loading of the metal oxide. Loadings above monolayer coverage can lead to easier reduction of the catalyst, resulting in decreased activity.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support material affects the dispersion and interaction of the metal oxide, which in turn influences catalytic performance.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is complex and depends on several factors:

1. Loading: The chromium loading relative to the surface area of the support affects the distribution of different chromium species.

2. Calcination treatment: The heat treatment during catalyst preparation influences the formation of various chromium species.

3. Support material: Different supports can lead to varying interactions with chromium, affecting the distribution and stability of chromium species.

4. Surface species: Freshly prepared catalysts can contain a variety of chromium species including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, as well as chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia, and amorphous chromia.

The relative concentrations of these chromium species are determined by the interplay of these factors, which ultimately affects the catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

对各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较揭示了几个影响其催化性能的关键因素：

1. 组成：混合氧化物可能比单一金属氧化物表现出更好的活性。例如，由20% In2O3和80% Al2O3组成的混合氧化物在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出最高的丙烯产率。

2. 酸度：催化剂表面中等强度酸性位的存在对活性可能至关重要。然而，在CO2存在的情况下，酸度的影响可能会改变，导致催化剂之间的性能趋势不同。

3. 金属氧化物负载量：催化剂的活性受金属氧化物负载量的影响。高于单层覆盖的负载可能导致催化剂更容易被还原，从而降低活性。

4. 载体性质：载体材料的性质影响金属氧化物的分散和相互作用，进而影响催化性能。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变是复杂的，取决于几个因素：

1. 负载量：相对于载体表面积的铬负载量影响不同铬物种的分布。

2. 焙烧处理：催化剂制备过程中的热处理影响各种铬物种的形成。

3. 载体材料：不同的载体可能导致与铬的相互作用不同，影响铬物种的分布和稳定性。

4. 表面物种：新制备的催化剂可能含有多种铬物种，包括Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+，以及铬酸盐、多铬酸盐、结晶α-氧化铬和无定形氧化铬。

这些铬物种的相对浓度由这些因素的相互作用决定，最终影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。
