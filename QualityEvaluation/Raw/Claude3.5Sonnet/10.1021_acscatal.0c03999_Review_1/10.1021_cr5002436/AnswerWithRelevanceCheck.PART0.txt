          [1] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[2] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[3] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[4] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[5] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[6] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[7] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[8] "At low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak."

[9] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[10] "In recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements."

[11] "With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16."

          Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Zirconia-supported catalysts are more active than silica or alumina-supported ones for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This is due to increased surface Cr5+ during regeneration, which forms active Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

2. Metal-support interaction: The strong interaction between chromia and basic zirconia support leads to higher amounts of Cr5+, improving activity. However, different supports can favor different types of active species. For example, γ-alumina favors oligomeric chromium oxide species, while SBA-15 favors isolated chromia species with higher coordination numbers.

3. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved performance, as seen with In2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. A mixed oxide of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield among tested indium-based catalysts.

4. Active species: The nature of the active sites is crucial. For chromium catalysts, dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are believed to be the most active. For indium catalysts, small metallic In particles formed by reduction of In2O3 clusters are thought to be the active species.

5. Loading: For chromium catalysts, activity increases with loading up to a point, after which it drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. This highlights the importance of maintaining a highly dispersed active phase.

6. CO2 effect: CO2 can have a beneficial effect through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by retarding catalyst deactivation at sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

1. At low loadings, isolated CrO42- species predominate.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric CrOCr species become prevalent.
3. At higher loadings, Cr2O3 crystallites form, which can lead to decreased activity.
4. The support influences this evolution, with weaker interactions (e.g., with SBA-15) promoting easier crystallite formation compared to stronger interactions (e.g., with alumina).
5. The optimal catalyst typically has a high dispersion of Cr3+ species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

These factors highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP(使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢)中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：与二氧化硅或氧化铝相比，二氧化锆负载的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中更活跃。这是由于再生过程中表面Cr5+增加，在反应条件下形成活性Cr3+。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：氧化铬与碱性二氧化锆载体之间的强相互作用导致更高含量的Cr5+，提高了活性。然而，不同的载体可能有利于不同类型的活性物种。例如，γ-氧化铝有利于寡聚铬氧化物种，而SBA-15有利于具有较高配位数的孤立铬氧化物种。

3. 组成：混合氧化物可以显示出更好的性能，如In2O3-Al2O3催化剂所示。20% In2O3和80% Al2O3的混合氧化物在测试的铟基催化剂中显示出最高的丙烯产率。

4. 活性物种：活性位点的性质至关重要。对于铬催化剂，分散的和配位不饱和的Cr3+物种被认为是最活跃的。对于铟催化剂，由In2O3簇还原形成的小金属In颗粒被认为是活性物种。

5. 负载量：对于铬催化剂，活性随负载量增加而增加，直到达到一个临界点，之后当结晶Cr2O3开始形成时活性下降。这突出了保持高度分散活性相的重要性。

6. CO2效应：CO2可以通过逆水气变换反应产生有益效果，并在足够高的CO2:碳氢化合物比例下延缓催化剂失活。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质：

1. 在低负载量时，以分离的CrO42-物种为主。
2. 随着负载量的增加，寡聚CrOCr物种变得普遍。
3. 在更高的负载量下，Cr2O3晶体形成，可能导致活性降低。
4. 载体影响这种演变，较弱的相互作用（例如与SBA-15）比较强的相互作用（例如与氧化铝）更容易促进晶体的形成。
5. 最佳催化剂通常具有高度分散的Cr3+物种，而不形成块状Cr2O3。

这些因素突出了催化剂组成、载体性质和反应条件之间复杂的相互作用，这些相互作用决定了金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的整体性能。
