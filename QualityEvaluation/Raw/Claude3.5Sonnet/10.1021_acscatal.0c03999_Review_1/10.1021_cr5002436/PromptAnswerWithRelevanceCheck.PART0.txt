[1] "To summarize, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."

[2] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[3] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[4] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[5] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[6] "At low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals several key factors influencing their catalytic performance:

1. Catalyst composition and operating conditions play crucial roles in achieving high activity and selectivity for Cr-based catalysts.

2. Support material significantly impacts catalyst performance. Zirconia-supported catalysts show higher activity in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation compared to silica or alumina-supported catalysts.

3. The amount of surface Cr5+ species, which form catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, is a key factor. Zirconia supports promote the formation of these Cr5+ species due to strong chromia-support interactions.

4. However, faster deactivation is observed for Cr2O3/ZrO2 compared to less active catalysts like Cr2O3/Al2O3, partly due to higher coking rates.

5. Chromium species evolution depends on loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated CrO42- species dominate, while higher loadings lead to CrOCr species and Cr2O3 crystallites.

6. Support-chromium oxide interaction strength affects crystallite formation. Weaker interactions (e.g., with SBA-15) promote easier crystallite formation compared to stronger interactions (e.g., with alumina).

These factors highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较揭示了几个影响其催化性能的关键因素：

1. 催化剂组成和操作条件对于实现基于Cr的催化剂的高活性和选择性起着至关重要的作用。

2. 载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。与二氧化硅或氧化铝载体相比，氧化锆载体的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性。

3. 表面Cr5+物种的数量是一个关键因素，这些物种在反应条件下形成具有催化活性的单核Cr3+。氧化锆载体由于与氧化铬之间的强相互作用，促进了这些Cr5+物种的形成。

4. 然而，与活性较低的催化剂（如Cr2O3/Al2O3）相比，Cr2O3/ZrO2的失活速度更快，部分原因是较高的结焦率。

5. 铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，以分离的CrO42-物种为主，而高负载量导致CrOCr物种和Cr2O3晶体的形成。

6. 载体与氧化铬的相互作用强度影响晶体的形成。较弱的相互作用（例如与SBA-15）比较强的相互作用（例如与氧化铝）更容易促进晶体的形成。

这些因素突出了催化剂组成、载体性质和反应条件之间复杂的相互作用，这些相互作用决定了金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的整体性能。

[1] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[2] "The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "Notably, at loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity. (218, 219)"

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques. (145-148) The relative concentration of these species seems to be dependent on a number of factors, such as chromium loading (relative to the surface area), the calcination treatment used during catalyst preparation, and the support employed."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals several key factors influencing their catalytic performance:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved activity compared to single metal oxides. For example, a mixed oxide of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 demonstrated the highest propylene yield in propane dehydrogenation.

2. Acidity: The presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface can be crucial for activity. However, the effect of acidity can change in the presence of CO2, leading to different performance trends among catalysts.

3. Metal oxide loading: The activity of catalysts is influenced by the loading of the metal oxide. Loadings above monolayer coverage can lead to easier reduction of the catalyst, resulting in decreased activity.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support material affects the dispersion and interaction of the metal oxide, which in turn influences catalytic performance.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is complex and depends on several factors:

1. Loading: The chromium loading relative to the surface area of the support affects the distribution of different chromium species.

2. Calcination treatment: The heat treatment during catalyst preparation influences the formation of various chromium species.

3. Support material: Different supports can lead to varying interactions with chromium, affecting the distribution and stability of chromium species.

4. Surface species: Freshly prepared catalysts can contain a variety of chromium species including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, as well as chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia, and amorphous chromia.

The relative concentrations of these chromium species are determined by the interplay of these factors, which ultimately affects the catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

对各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较揭示了几个影响其催化性能的关键因素：

1. 组成：混合氧化物可能比单一金属氧化物表现出更好的活性。例如，由20% In2O3和80% Al2O3组成的混合氧化物在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出最高的丙烯产率。

2. 酸度：催化剂表面中等强度酸性位的存在对活性可能至关重要。然而，在CO2存在的情况下，酸度的影响可能会改变，导致催化剂之间的性能趋势不同。

3. 金属氧化物负载量：催化剂的活性受金属氧化物负载量的影响。高于单层覆盖的负载可能导致催化剂更容易被还原，从而降低活性。

4. 载体性质：载体材料的性质影响金属氧化物的分散和相互作用，进而影响催化性能。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变是复杂的，取决于几个因素：

1. 负载量：相对于载体表面积的铬负载量影响不同铬物种的分布。

2. 焙烧处理：催化剂制备过程中的热处理影响各种铬物种的形成。

3. 载体材料：不同的载体可能导致与铬的相互作用不同，影响铬物种的分布和稳定性。

4. 表面物种：新制备的催化剂可能含有多种铬物种，包括Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+，以及铬酸盐、多铬酸盐、结晶α-氧化铬和无定形氧化铬。

这些铬物种的相对浓度由这些因素的相互作用决定，最终影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。

[2] "Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation."

[3] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[4] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."

[5] "At first, the selectivity toward alkenes is fairly low and the catalyst produces mainly carbon oxides, as is shown in Figure 17. This is attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%."

[6] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides can show improved performance, as seen with In2O3-Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Active species: For In2O3-based catalysts, small metallic In particles formed under reaction conditions are believed to be the active species.

3. CO2 effect: CO2 can have a beneficial effect through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by retarding catalyst deactivation at sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios.

4. Support material: The choice of support affects the nature of active species. For chromium catalysts, γ-alumina favors oligomeric chromium oxide species, while SBA-15 favors isolated chromia species with higher coordination numbers.

5. Oxidation state: For chromium catalysts, there is an induction period where highly oxidized, inactive species are reduced to active lower oxidation states. This affects initial selectivity.

6. Conversion level: High selectivity (93.6%) can be achieved at moderate conversion levels (55%) for some chromium catalysts.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on:

1. Loading: Higher loadings tend to favor oligomeric species over isolated species.

2. Support properties: Different supports (e.g., γ-alumina vs. SBA-15) promote the formation of different types of chromium species, affecting activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: The oxidation state and nature of chromium species change during the reaction, with an initial reduction of highly oxidized species to more active forms.

1. 组成：混合氧化物可以显示出更好的性能，如In2O3-Al2O3催化剂所示。

2. 活性物种：对于基于In2O3的催化剂，在反应条件下形成的小金属In颗粒被认为是活性物种。

3. CO2效应：CO2可以通过逆水气变换反应产生有益效果，并在足够高的CO2:碳氢化合物比例下延缓催化剂失活。

4. 载体材料：载体的选择影响活性物种的性质。对于铬催化剂，γ-氧化铝有利于寡聚铬氧化物种，而SBA-15有利于具有较高配位数的孤立铬氧化物种。

5. 氧化态：对于铬催化剂，存在一个诱导期，高度氧化的非活性物种被还原为活性较低的氧化态。这影响初始选择性。

6. 转化水平：对于某些铬催化剂，在适度的转化水平(55%)下可以实现高选择性(93.6%)。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于：

1. 负载量：较高的负载量倾向于形成寡聚物种而非孤立物种。

2. 载体性质：不同的载体(如γ-氧化铝vs. SBA-15)促进不同类型铬物种的形成，影响活性和选择性。

3. 反应条件：在反应过程中，铬物种的氧化态和性质发生变化，高度氧化的物种最初被还原为更活跃的形式。

[1] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[2] "Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27."

[4] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

[6] "In recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements."

[7] "With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Composition: Mixed oxides often perform better than single metal oxides. For example, a 20% In2O3 - 80% Al2O3 mixed oxide showed the highest propylene yield among tested indium-based catalysts.

2. Active species: The nature of the active sites is crucial. For chromium catalysts, dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are believed to be the most active. For indium catalysts, small metallic In particles formed by reduction of In2O3 clusters are thought to be the active species.

3. CO2 addition: CO2 in the feed generally improves olefin yield through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. It can also help decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption.

4. Loading: For chromium catalysts, activity increases with loading up to a point, after which it drops when crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming. This highlights the importance of maintaining a highly dispersed active phase.

5. Support properties: The support can influence the dispersion and reducibility of the active phase. For example, the interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports results in better dispersion of small In nanoparticles compared to SiO2 supports.

6. Oxidation state: The oxidation state of the metal is crucial. For chromium, Cr3+ is generally considered the active species, while for indium, metallic In0 is believed to be active.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated Cr3+ species predominate. As loading increases, polymeric species form, and eventually, at high loadings, crystalline Cr2O3 starts to appear. The support can influence this evolution by affecting the dispersion and stability of the chromium species. The optimal catalyst typically has a high dispersion of Cr3+ species without the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

2. 活性物种：活性位点的性质至关重要。对于铬催化剂，分散的和配位不饱和的Cr3+物种被认为是最活跃的。对于铟催化剂，由In2O3簇还原形成的小金属In颗粒被认为是活性物种。

3. CO2添加：料流中的CO2通常通过逆水气变换反应提高烯烃产率。它还可以帮助减少积碳沉积并辅助产物脱附。

4. 负载量：对于铬催化剂，活性随负载量增加而增加，直到达到一个临界点，之后当结晶Cr2O3开始形成时活性下降。这突出了保持高度分散活性相的重要性。

5. 载体性质：载体可以影响活性相的分散性和可还原性。例如，In2O3与Al2O3或ZrO2载体的相互作用比与SiO2载体相比，可以更好地分散小In纳米颗粒。

6. 氧化态：金属的氧化态至关重要。对于铬，Cr3+通常被认为是活性物种，而对于铟，金属In0被认为是活性的。

负载的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，以分离的Cr3+物种为主。随着负载量的增加，聚合物种形成，最终在高负载量时，结晶Cr2O3开始出现。载体可以通过影响铬物种的分散性和稳定性来影响这种演变。最佳催化剂通常具有高度分散的Cr3+物种，而不形成块状Cr2O3。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: Zirconia-supported catalysts are more active than silica or alumina-supported ones for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This is due to increased surface Cr5+ during regeneration, which forms active Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

2. Metal-support interaction: The strong interaction between chromia and basic zirconia support leads to higher amounts of Cr5+, improving activity.

3. Coking resistance: While Cr2O3/ZrO2 is more active, it deactivates faster due to higher coking rates compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3. Mesoporous supports like GaAl mixed oxides show increased resistance to coking.

4. Formation of inactive species: Chromiazirconia catalysts favor the formation of inactive chromium carbides, causing deactivation.

5. CO2 addition: Adding CO2 to the feed improves olefin yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties:

1. Higher loadings and basic supports (like zirconia) promote the formation of Cr5+ species during regeneration.

2. These Cr5+ species then form catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions.

3. However, the support also influences deactivation mechanisms, with some supports promoting faster coking or formation of inactive species like chromium carbides.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：与二氧化硅或氧化铝相比，二氧化锆负载的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中更活跃。这是由于再生过程中表面Cr5+增加，在反应条件下形成活性Cr3+。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：氧化铬与碱性二氧化锆载体之间的强相互作用导致更高含量的Cr5+，提高了活性。

3. 抗结焦能力：虽然Cr2O3/ZrO2活性更高，但由于结焦速率更快，其失活速度比Cr2O3/Al2O3更快。像GaAl混合氧化物这样的介孔载体表现出更高的抗结焦能力。

4. 无活性物种的形成：铬-锆催化剂有利于形成无活性的碳化铬，导致失活。

5. CO2的添加：向反应物料中添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质：

1. 更高的负载量和碱性载体(如二氧化锆)促进再生过程中Cr5+物种的形成。

2. 这些Cr5+物种随后在反应条件下形成具有催化活性的单核Cr3+。

3. 然而，载体也影响失活机制，某些载体促进更快的结焦或形成无活性物种，如碳化铬。
