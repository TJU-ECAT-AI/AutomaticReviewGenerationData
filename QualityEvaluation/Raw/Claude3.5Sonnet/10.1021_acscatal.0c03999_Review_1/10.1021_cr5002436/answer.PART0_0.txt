[1] "To summarize, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."

[2] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."

[3] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."

[4] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."

[5] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[6] "At low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals several key factors influencing their catalytic performance:

1. Catalyst composition and operating conditions play crucial roles in achieving high activity and selectivity for Cr-based catalysts.

2. Support material significantly impacts catalyst performance. Zirconia-supported catalysts show higher activity in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation compared to silica or alumina-supported catalysts.

3. The amount of surface Cr5+ species, which form catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, is a key factor. Zirconia supports promote the formation of these Cr5+ species due to strong chromia-support interactions.

4. However, faster deactivation is observed for Cr2O3/ZrO2 compared to less active catalysts like Cr2O3/Al2O3, partly due to higher coking rates.

5. Chromium species evolution depends on loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated CrO42- species dominate, while higher loadings lead to CrOCr species and Cr2O3 crystallites.

6. Support-chromium oxide interaction strength affects crystallite formation. Weaker interactions (e.g., with SBA-15) promote easier crystallite formation compared to stronger interactions (e.g., with alumina).

These factors highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较揭示了几个影响其催化性能的关键因素：

1. 催化剂组成和操作条件对于实现基于Cr的催化剂的高活性和选择性起着至关重要的作用。

2. 载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。与二氧化硅或氧化铝载体相比，氧化锆载体的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性。

3. 表面Cr5+物种的数量是一个关键因素，这些物种在反应条件下形成具有催化活性的单核Cr3+。氧化锆载体由于与氧化铬之间的强相互作用，促进了这些Cr5+物种的形成。

4. 然而，与活性较低的催化剂（如Cr2O3/Al2O3）相比，Cr2O3/ZrO2的失活速度更快，部分原因是较高的结焦率。

5. 铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，以分离的CrO42-物种为主，而高负载量导致CrOCr物种和Cr2O3晶体的形成。

6. 载体与氧化铬的相互作用强度影响晶体的形成。较弱的相互作用（例如与SBA-15）比较强的相互作用（例如与氧化铝）更容易促进晶体的形成。

这些因素突出了催化剂组成、载体性质和反应条件之间复杂的相互作用，这些相互作用决定了金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的整体性能。
