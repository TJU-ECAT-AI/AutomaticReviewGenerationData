If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information specifically about CO2-ODHP reactions or comparisons of different metal oxide catalysts for this reaction. The document focuses on general characterization techniques like Raman and IR spectroscopy for supported metal oxide catalysts, but does not discuss catalytic performance or activity/selectivity comparisons for CO2-ODHP. There is also no specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The literature lacks the relevant details needed to answer the posed question about catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.
