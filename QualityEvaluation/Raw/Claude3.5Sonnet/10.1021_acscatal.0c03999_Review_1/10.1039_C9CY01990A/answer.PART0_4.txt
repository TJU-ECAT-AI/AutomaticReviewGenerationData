[1] "Takahara et al. discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."

[2] "Although there is an open debate on the enhancement mechanism of SiO2-supported chromium oxides—many different redox mechanisms including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed—all of the investigations indicate that CO2 exhibits limited oxidative ability since it is quite inert and not easily activated by chromium oxides."

[3] "The catalytic activity of the optimized catalyst (1% Ru loading) is double that of unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide. The origin of the altered catalytic behaviour is analysed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed-mass spectrometry measurements (TP-MS), and three-step H2-TPR (temperature programmed reduction)."

[4] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction. The Ru 3d5/2 peak of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 sample (Fig. S2(b), middle) was missing after 50 min of reaction, which could be caused by coke accumulated onto the catalyst surface."

[5] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary significantly depending on several key factors:

1. Support material: SiO2-supported chromium oxides show improved activity when CO2 is added, while Al2O3-supported chromium oxides experience reduced activity.

2. Metal loading: For Ru-modified chromium catalysts, there is an optimal loading around 1 wt% Ru that doubles the catalytic activity compared to unmodified chromium oxide catalysts.

3. Redox properties: Different redox mechanisms (Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+) have been proposed for SiO2-supported chromium oxides, but CO2 activation remains limited due to its inert nature.

4. Catalyst structure and characterization: The evolution of chromium species is analyzed using various techniques like XRD, TEM, XPS, TP-MS, and H2-TPR. These methods reveal that Ru modification only slightly enhances the redox properties of the catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions and time: XPS analysis shows similar chromium species after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction, but coke accumulation can affect the catalyst surface over time.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the support material, metal loading, redox properties, catalyst structure, and reaction conditions. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is complex and depends on the interplay of these factors, with the addition of promoters like Ru playing a crucial role in enhancing CO2 activation and overall catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性存在显著差异，这取决于几个关键因素：

1. 载体材料：当添加CO2时，SiO2负载的铬氧化物表现出活性提高，而Al2O3负载的铬氧化物则活性降低。

2. 金属负载量：对于Ru改性的铬催化剂，约1 wt%的Ru负载量是最佳的，与未改性的铬氧化物催化剂相比，催化活性提高了一倍。

3. 氧化还原性质：对于SiO2负载的铬氧化物，已提出不同的氧化还原机理（Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+），但由于CO2的惰性特征，其活化仍然有限。

4. 催化剂结构和表征：使用各种技术如XRD、TEM、XPS、TP-MS和H2-TPR分析铬物种的演变。这些方法揭示了Ru改性仅略微增强了催化剂的氧化还原性质。

5. 反应条件和时间：XPS分析显示，反应5分钟和50分钟后的铬物种相似，但随时间推移，焦炭积累可能会影响催化剂表面。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体材料、金属负载量、氧化还原性质、催化剂结构和反应条件。负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变是复杂的，取决于这些因素的相互作用，而添加如Ru等助剂在增强CO2活化和整体催化性能方面起着关键作用。
