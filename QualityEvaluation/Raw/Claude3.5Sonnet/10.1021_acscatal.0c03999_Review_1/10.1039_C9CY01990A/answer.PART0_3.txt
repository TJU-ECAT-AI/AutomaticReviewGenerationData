[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[3] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced, but CO2 conversion, CO and H2 production rate kept rising with increasing Ru loading"

[4] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[5] "For all three samples, the reduction peaks at high temperature in the 3rd-TPR, which are assigned to the reduction of Cr6+, become very small. This suggests that Cr6+ is not the main chemical species recovered by CO2 oxidation."

[6] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

The study compares the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts supported on SiO2 with varying amounts of Ru loading for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). 

Key findings include:

1. The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%.

2. Adding 1 wt% Ru doubled the C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Increasing Ru loading beyond 1 wt% led to decreased C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while CO2 conversion and CO/H2 production increased.

4. The chemical state of Cr species remained similar during the reaction, as evidenced by XPS spectra.

5. Cr6+ was not the main species recovered by CO2 oxidation, based on TPR results.

6. The enhancement in catalytic activity with Ru modification was not solely due to improved redox properties.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Ru loading: Optimal performance at 1 wt%, with decreased performance at higher loadings.
2. CO2 activation ability: Ru improved CO2 activation, enhancing the reverse water-gas shift reaction.
3. Balance between dehydrogenation and reforming: Higher Ru loadings favored reforming reactions over dehydrogenation.
4. Chromium species evolution: While Cr6+ was initially reduced, the overall chemical state of Cr remained relatively stable during the reaction.

The study highlights the importance of optimizing promoter loading and understanding the interplay between different reaction pathways in developing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

这项研究比较了在SiO2上负载不同量Ru的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的性能。

主要发现包括：

1. 未经修饰的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂显示出79%的C3H6选择性。

2. 添加1 wt%的Ru使C3H6产率比未修饰的催化剂提高了一倍。

3. 将Ru负载量增加到1 wt%以上导致C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性降低，而CO2转化率和CO/H2产率增加。

4. 根据XPS光谱，Cr物种的化学状态在反应过程中保持相似。

5. 基于TPR结果，Cr6+不是CO2氧化恢复的主要物种。

6. Ru修饰带来的催化活性增强不仅仅是由于氧化还原性能的改善。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Ru负载量：1 wt%时性能最佳，更高负载量时性能下降。
2. CO2活化能力：Ru改善了CO2活化，增强了逆水气变换反应。
3. 脱氢和重整反应之间的平衡：更高的Ru负载量有利于重整反应而非脱氢反应。
4. 铬物种的演变：虽然Cr6+最初被还原，但在反应过程中Cr的整体化学状态保持相对稳定。

这项研究强调了在开发有效的CO2-ODHP催化剂时，优化助剂负载量和理解不同反应途径之间相互作用的重要性。
