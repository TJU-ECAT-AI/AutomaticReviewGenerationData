Catalytic
oxidative
dehydrogenation
of
lower
alkanes
with
CO2
is
an
attractive
alternative
for
commercialized dehydrogenation processes not only due to its higher thermodynamic limit but also
because it could help reduce anthropogenic CO2. Here, we studied the catalytic behavior of a Ru-
modified conventional SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst and obtained insights into the structure
property relationship for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The catalyst exhibits a
volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%. The optimal
catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared
with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate
CO2
and
remove adsorbed H2
on
the catalyst
surface to
shift
the equilibrium
of the
direct
dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. Higher
loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2
that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene
and CO2. This work demonstrates a new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for the
ODP reaction and its effects on catalytic performance.
Introduction
Propylene (C3H6) is a main petrochemical building block used
to
produce a
wide range
of
industrial chemicals
(e.g.,
polypropylene, propylene oxide, cumene, and acrylonitrile),
with an annual production rate of 80 million tons.13 Current
conventional manufacturing methods for C3H6 production
from steam and fluidized cracking, which produce C3H6 as a
by-product,
are
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
increasing
requirements of the market.46 The direct dehydrogenation of
propane (C3H8) into C3H6,
C3H8 C3H6 + H2
(1)
can
provide
additional
avenues
to
supplement
C3H6
production.79 However, the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8
(DDP) into C3H6 is highly endothermic and needs high
temperatures
to
overcome
equilibrium
limitations
for
commercially
feasible
conversions.
Additionally,
high
reaction
temperatures
favor
thermal
cracking
of
hydrocarbons,
leading
to
low
selectivity
to
C3H6
and
accelerated
catalyst
deactivation.1013
In
principle,
these
problems can be overcome by introducing an oxidant to
lower the reaction temperatures and significantly decrease
thermal cracking and the formation of coke.1416 However,
using
strong
oxidants
(e.g.
O2)
frequently
promotes
overoxidation of the alkane, resulting in an unsatisfactory
selectivity to C3H6.17,18 A good soft oxidant could potentially
overcome these drawbacks.19
CO2 has received considerable interest as a soft oxidant
for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (ODP). CO2 can not
only
improve
the
equilibrium
conversion
of
the
C3H8
dehydrogenation reaction but also effectively prevent the
deep
oxidation
of
products.2025
Additionally,
the
CO
products from the ODP reaction can convert to fuels via
FischerTropsch synthesis, which provides an attractive way
to reduce detrimental CO2 greenhouse gas.2628 Up to now,
two possibilities have been proposed for the promoting
effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8. One is a
one-step pathway in which CO2 participates directly in
oxidative
dehydrogenation
by
donating
oxygen
species
through a redox mechanism:29

One-step pathway:
C3H8 + CO2 C3H2 + H2O + CO
(2)
The other possibility is a two-step pathway in which the H2
adsorbed on the catalyst surface is consumed through the
reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction to shift the equilibrium
of the DDP reaction:30
Two-step pathway:
C3H8 C3H6 + H2
(1)
H2 + CO2 H2O + CO, RWGS
(3)
Two undesired reforming reaction can also occur due to the
input of CO2,
Dry reforming reaction (DRR):
C3H8 + 3CO2 6CO + 4H2
(4)
Non-selective reforming reaction (NSR):
C3H8 + 7CO2 10CO + 4H2O
(5)
Both reforming reactions cleave CC bonds and thus lead to
reduced selectivity to C3H6.22 To develop an efficient catalyst
for the ODP reaction with CO2, the key challenge is finding a
suitable catalyst that can activate CO2 with high activity and
cleave the CH bonds of C3H8 without breaking CC bonds.
Chromium oxide-based catalysts are promising catalysts
for the ODP reaction with CO2 since they are active for the
direct dehydrogenation reaction of lower alkanes with a high
selectivity to corresponding alkenes.3134 Takahara et al.
discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium
oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of
lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a
small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction,
whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could
be promoted by CO2.35 Shishido et al. further confirmed this
phenomenon and found that the negative effect of CO2 on the
dehydrogenation reaction over Al2O3-supported chromium
oxides was caused by strongly adsorbed CO2 on Al2O3, which
inhibited
the
adsorption
of
C3H8
and
reduced
C3H8
conversion.29 Although there is an open debate on the
enhancement
mechanism
of
SiO2-supported
chromium
oxidesmany different redox mechanisms including Cr6+/
Cr3+,36,37 Cr5+/Cr3+,38 and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed39,40
all of the investigations indicate that CO2 exhibits limited
oxidative ability since it is quite inert and not easily activated
by chromium oxides.40 One possible solution to this problem
is to incorporate another metal such as ruthenium (Ru) into
the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst to promote CO2
activation in the bifunctional catalyst. Ru has been widely
used in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and is considered
one of the most active and stable CO2 methanation catalyst,
due to its excellent ability to activate CO2, even at low
temperature.4143 However, the activity and selectivity of Ru
for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru
catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). Kwak's
group
found
that
high
Ru
loading
produced
methane
selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.44
Zeng et al. demonstrated the crystallite sizes could affect the
CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm)
favoured methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13
nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.45 Cargnello and coworkers
switched the pathway of Ru/CeO2 from methanation to RWGS
by oxidizing metallic Ru nanoparticles to single-site RuOx/
CeO2.46 Although Ru catalysts are reported to be active for the
dry reforming reaction,4749 considering the high tunability of
Ru reported, it is highly possible that the incorporation of Ru
into the chromium catalyst can promote CO2 activation, and
in turn promote the ODP reaction pathway.
Here, we report an efficient SiO2-supported chromium oxide
catalyst modified with Ru for the ODP reaction with high ability
to activate CO2. The results show that the catalytic behaviour of
these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The catalytic
activity of the optimized catalyst (1% Ru loading) is double that
of unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide. The origin of
the altered catalytic behaviour is analysed using X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
X-ray
photoelectron
spectroscopy
(XPS),
temperature
programmed-mass spectrometry measurements (TP-MS), and
three-step H2-TPR (temperature programmed reduction). The
Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts reported
in this work demonstrates great advantages over conventional
chromium oxide-based catalysts for the ODP reaction.

Catalyst synthesis
Silica gel-supported Cr and Ru catalysts were prepared by the
co-impregnation method with a fixed Cr loading of 10 wt%
(support weight basis). 1 g silica gel was rinsed in an
appropriate amount of CrNO3)3·9H2O and RuCl3 aqueous
solution. The slurry was slowly stirred and dried overnight at
room temperature and then further dried in an oven for 24 h
at 60 C. The samples were then heated to 650 C in air with
a ramp rate of 10 C min1 and held at 650 C for 4 h. The
prepared catalysts are denoted as RuyCr10Ox/SiO2, where Ruy
represents the weight loading amount of Ru is y% (support
weight basis). Ru1/SiO2 was synthesized with the same
strategy by using unmodified silica gel as the support.

Catalyst testing
The ODP reaction was performed in a flow-type quartz reactor
under atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 496  3 C.
The
reactor
itself
started
to
show
activity
when
the
temperature is higher than 500 C. 150 mg of the catalyst
was loaded into a vertical quartz tube (i.d. 3.5 mm) and the
catalyst pellets were supported by quartz wool. The reaction
gas stream consisted of C3H8, CO2, and N2 in a ratio of 1 : 1 :
1 and the total flow rate was set to 30 mL min1. The DDP
reaction
was
performed
under
similar
condition
with
reaction mixtures of C3H8 and N2 in a ratio of 1 : 2 (total flow
rate: 30 ml min1).The products were analysed by an online
gas
chromatograph
(Agilent
7890)
equipped
with
a
Carboxen 1010 PLOT capillary column and a TCD detector
after 50 min of reaction for all the tests. The outlet gas flow
rate was determined by the internal standard method, in
which the C3H8, CO2, C3H6, CO, and H2 flow rates were
calculated based on the flow rate of inert gas (N2). CO2 and
C3H8 conversion were calculated by the difference between
the inlet concentrations of CO2 and C3H8 and the outlet
concentrations
of
CO2
and
C3H8
divided
by
the
inlet
concentration of each gas, respectively. The C3H6 selectivity
was calculated by the outlet concentration of C3H6 divided by
the difference between the inlet concentration and the outlet
concentration of C3H8. The corresponding equations are as
shown below:

The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was performed in the same
flow-type quartz reactor used for the ODP reactions. 25 mg of
the catalyst was loaded into the vertical quartz tube. A gas
mixture of CO2 (20%), H2 (1%), N2 (5%) and Ar (74%) was
introduced at a flow rate of 30 mL min1 at atmospheric
pressure
and
the
products
were
analyzed
by
gas
chromatography. The CH4, CO, and H2 flow rates were also
determined by using N2 as an internal standard gas. H2
conversion
was
calculated
from
the
measured
H2
concentration using the formula H2 conversion = [(H2in 
H2out)/H2in], where H2in and H2out represent the inlet and
outlet H2 concentration, respectively.
Catalyst structure characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was measured on a
Bruker DaVinci Advanced D8 powder X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopic
(TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL-2011 microscope with
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The XPS spectra were
recorded on a PHI Versa Probe II instrument equipped with a
monochromatic Al Kα source and binding energy calibration
was based on C1s at 284.5 eV. Inductively coupled plasma

measurements
were
carried
out
with
an
online

experiments, we pretreated 75 mg of catalysts in a gas
mixture of C3H8 (5 ml min1), CO2 (5 ml min1) and Ar (5 mL
min1) for 50 minutes at 496  3 C. After the samples were
cooled down to room temperature, a gas mixture of C3H8 (2.5
ml min1), CO2 (2.5 mL min1) and Ar (10 mL min1) was
introduced, and the samples were heated to 500 C at a ramp
rate of 10 C min1. Signals of C3H6 (m/z = 41), H2O (m/z =
18), and H2 (m/z = 2) were recorded as a function of
temperature.
For the C3H8-TP-MS experiments, we pretreated 100 mg of
catalysts in Ar flow at 650 C for 2 h. After the samples were
cooled down to room temperature, a gas mixture composed
of C3H8 (2 mL min1) and Ar (20 mL min1) was introduced,
and the samples were heated to 500 C at a ramp rate of 10
C min1. Signals of C3H8 (m/z = 29) and C3H6 (m/z = 41) were
recorded as a function of temperature.

the samples were cooled to room temperature, the gas line
was switched to CO2 (20 mL min1) for 1 h and then switched
to Ar (27 mL min1) for another 1 h to remove the residual
CO2. Then, the samples were heated to 500 C at a ramp rate

reduction of the sample, the same H2-TPR process was
repeated with the reduced samples from the first TPR. The
samples were then treated under a flow of CO2 (20 mL min1)

Results and discussion
Catalytic performance evaluation
To determine the effect of Ru loading on the activity and
selectivity of the SiO2-supported chromium oxide (Cr10Ox/
SiO2) catalyst for ODP, the ODP reaction was performed at
496  3 C over Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalysts with Ru loadings of 0,
0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 3 wt%. The results are shown in Fig. 1
with numerical values of production rates, conversion and
selectivity summarized in Table S1 (only trace amounts of
CH4, C2H6 and C2H4 were observed during all experiments,
which were not quantifiable). The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by
itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of
C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79% (Fig. 1(a)).
C3H8 conversion was determined to be 4.9% (Fig. 1(b)),
whereas CO2 conversion was much lower at 1.1% (Fig. 1(c)).
The H2 production rate (Table S1) was 6.5 mmol gcatal
1 h1,
which was approximately equal to the C3H6 production rate
(6.8 mmol gcatal
1 h1, Fig. 1(a)), which indicates that most of
the C3H6 was derived from the DDP reaction (see eqn (1)).
The control experiment performed without CO2 (see Table
S1) shows that that the addition of CO2 to the reactant
mixture doesn't change the C3H8 conversion or C3H6 yield,
which further demonstrates that the DDP reaction is the
main pathway for this catalyst. These results also show that
CO2 activation is difficult with the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst, which
agrees well with previous reports.50
To enhance CO2 activation over Cr10Ox/SiO2, the Cr10Ox/
SiO2 catalyst was modified by Ru. After the modification, we
observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a
volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a
maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading. The
C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of
13.6 mmol gcatal
1 h1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-
fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2
catalyst, which was also superior to the Cr-based catalysts
reported in the literature (see Table S2). In contrast to the
volcano-like trend in the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversion
(Fig.
1(c))
increased
monotonically
with
increasing
Ru
amount. The H2 production rate (9.5 mmol gcatal
1 h1, Table
S1) with the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was lower than the C3H6
production rate (13.6 mmol gcatal
1 h1), which suggests that
C3H6 was not only derived from the DDP reaction, but also
from the ODP reaction. The control experiment performed
without CO2 (see Table S1) demonstrates that the addition of
CO2 to the reactant mixture increases the C3H8 conversion
and C3H6 yield over Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 by a factor of 2, proving
that the presence of 1 wt% Ru effectively improved the
catalyst's ability to activate CO2, and in turn promote the ODP
reaction pathway. Of note, in the absence of Cr (Ru1/SiO2), no
C3H6 product was formed, only reforming reaction products
were
observed,
which
is
consistent
with
the
literature
reports.4749 This implies that the observed promoted ODP
reaction is caused by the synergetic effect between Ru and Cr,
not a simple additive effect.
When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up
to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to
drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly
reduced, but CO2 conversion, CO and H2 production rate
kept rising with increasing Ru loading (Fig. 1(d) and Table
S1). When the Ru loading reached 3 wt%, C3H8 conversion
was reduced to 4.5% with a selectivity of 39% to C3H6. The
production rate ratio of CO to H2 was determined to be 2.76,
which suggests that the reforming reaction (eqn (4) and (5))
of C3H8 with CO2 became dominant. The control experiment
performed without CO2 (see Table S1) shows that the
addition of CO2 to the reactant mixture slightly increased the
C3H8
conversion
but
significantly
reduced
the
C3H6
selectivity, which was caused by the promoted reforming
reaction over the Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst.

catalysts after 50 min of reaction, the samples were analysed

This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020
by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The XRD patterns of the three catalysts
after 50 min of reaction are similar, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The broad peaks between 15 and 30 2θ can be assigned to
amorphous silica gel.51 The weak diffraction peaks from 20
to 60 2θ can be indexed to α-Cr2O3 (JCPDS card No. 38-
1479).52,53 No peaks associated with Ru or RuO2 were
observed in the Ru-modified samples. A TEM image of the
SiO2 gel support (Fig. S1) shows that it has a typical porous
structure,
which
is
beneficial
for
metal
loading.
After
impregnating the metal followed by calcining, small α-Cr2O3
particles with irregular shape were observed in all three
samples (Fig. 2(bd)). It has been demonstrated that the CrOx
species
on
SiO2
supports
have
many
different
species
depending on the coverage of Cr. For example, Cavani et al.
showed that the structure of Cr evolves from grafted Cr6+ 
dispersed
Cr6+
oxide
microcrystalline
Cr3+
oxide
crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading.54 Crystalline
α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium
oxide phase and inactive species for catalysis due to its high
resistance to reduction from hydrogen and oxidation from
oxygen, and would typically form after the complete coverage
of the support.55
To gain more information about the catalyst's chemical
states, the samples were analysed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) after 5 min of reaction to minimize the
amount of coke accumulated onto the catalyst surface which
could negatively affect the quality of the XPS spectra. The Ru
3d
and
Cr
2p
regions
of
the
spectra
are
shown
in
Fig. 2(e) and (f), respectively. The Ru 3d XPS spectrum of
Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 shows two peaks at 280.9 eV and 285.5 eV,
which can be assigned to the Ru 3d5/2 of partially oxidized Ru
and C 1s, respectively. There should be a peak at 284 eV
associated with Ru 3d3/2 of oxidized Ru, which is difficult to
observe due to the overlap with the C 1s peak. The Ru 3d XPS
spectrum of the Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 sample also has a peak at
280.9 eV, demonstrating that the Ru species are partially
oxidized in both Ru modified samples.56 Fig. 2(f) displays the
Cr 2p XPS spectra of the three catalysts after 5 min of
reaction. All the catalysts show two characteristic peaks
around 577 and 586 eV, proving the coexistence of Cr2+ and
Cr3+ during the reaction.36 No Cr6+ was detected in any of the
three samples,57 demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+
species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period
of reaction, which is consistent with the XAFS results
achieved by Shishido et al.29 The XPS results of the samples
after 50 min on stream are also shown in Fig. S2 for
comparison. All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the
three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak
positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction. The Ru 3d5/2
peak of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 sample (Fig. S2(b), middle) was
missing after 50 min of reaction, which could be caused by
coke accumulated onto the catalyst surface. The Ru 3d XPS
spectrum of Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. S2(b), top) has two peaks
similar to the peaks observed after 5 min of reaction (-
Fig. 2(e), top), proving the same electronic state of Ru after 5
min and 50 min of reaction.
To investigate the textural properties of our catalysts, N2
adsorption and desorption analysis has been performed as
shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3. The BET surface area and
pore volume of silica gel support were determined to be
511.3 m2 g1 and 0.81 cm3g1, respectively, with a wide pore-
size distribution in the 210 nm range. After the addition of
Cr, the porous structure was maintained, but the surface area
and pore volume decrease to 400.2 m2 g1 and 0.72 cm3 g1,
respectively. Further adding and changing the Ru content
had a negligible effect on the surface area and pore volume,
indicating that the addition of Ru didn't severely change the
construction of the Cr catalysts.

results are shown in Fig. 3(a). For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), top),
C3H6 production began at 390 C and H2 production began
at the same temperature. This indicates that the DDP
reaction is the preferred reaction pathway with this catalyst.
H2O (only produced from reactions (2), (3), and (5) that
involve CO2) production began at temperatures higher than
420 C and only a small amount of H2O was formed,
indicating that CO2 can only be activated at very high
temperatures and the DDP reaction was the dominant
pathway over Cr10Ox/SiO2.
For Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), middle), C3H6 production
began at 360 C, which is 30 C lower than with the
Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst. The amount of C3H6 produced over the
Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was about 2× that produced over the
Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst at 500 C. Additionally, H2O and H2
appeared almost at the same temperature, demonstrating
that CO2 is participating in the dehydrogenation reaction.
The reaction pathway changed from exclusively the DDP
reaction over the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst to both DDP and ODP
reactions over Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 since CO2 could be activated at
low temperature over Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2.
For Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), bottom), the amount of C3H6
produced was much smaller than with Cr10Ox/SiO2 and
Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2, and there was a large amount of H2O and H2
produced starting around 360 C, indicating that another
reaction
pathway
(reforming
reaction,
eqn
(4)
and
(5))
happened over this catalyst with a low selectivity to C3H6.
These results agree well with the results shown in Fig. 1 and
Table S1.
To study the effect of Ru loading on C3H8 activation, we
performed
C3H8-TP-MS
experiments
over
Cr10Ox/SiO2,
Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2, and Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalysts. The results are
shown in Fig. 3(b). Clearly, increasing the loading of Ru
results in an increase in the amount of C3H8 consumed and
the amount of C3H6 produced, which suggests that Ru
improves the ability of the catalyst to activate C3H8. However,
the high C3H6 yield from dehydrogenation of C3H8 over
Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2
was
unexpected
given
the
low
C3H8
conversion and C3H6 selectivity observed during the CO2
assisted dehydrogenation process (Fig. 3(a)).
To gain more insight into the reaction pathways occurring
during CO2-assisted C3H8 dehydrogenation over the different
catalysts, we carried out C3H6 + CO2-TP-MS experiments
(Fig. 3(c)) and CO2-TPD experiments (Fig. 3(d)). The C3H6 +
CO2-TP-MS results showed that Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalysts only
produced a very small amount of CO, H2O and H2, indicating
that no reaction occurred between C3H6 and CO2. For
Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2, the amount of CO produced was higher than
with Cr10Ox/SiO2, indicating that a small amount of the
reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2 had occurred. For
Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2, however, a large amount of CO was produced
which demonstrates that this catalyst is highly active for the
reforming reaction of C3H6 with CO2. These results suggest
that the C3H6 product from dehydrogenation of C3H8 over
Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst could react with CO2 to form CO via
the reforming reaction, resulting in a low selectivity to C3H6.
CO2-TPD profiles of these catalysts (Fig. 3(d)) showed that the
amount of CO2 adsorbed on Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 was larger than
that on Cr10Ox/SiO2 and Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2. According to the
literature, large amounts of adsorbed CO2 on the catalyst
surface could inhibit the adsorption of C3H8, resulting in
reduced conversion of C3H8.29

Role of Ru in the reaction mechanism
To gain insight into the mechanism of the Ru promoting
effect on the C3H6 production rate, the redox ability of three
as-prepared catalysts was studied by a three-step H2-TPR
analysis. For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 4(a)), there was one broad peak
in the 1st-TPR, which can be attributed to the reduction of
Cr6+ to a lower oxidation state of Cr (i.e., Cr3+ and Cr2+).29 In
the
2nd-TPR,
no
H2
consumption
peak
was
observed,
indicating full
reduction
of
Cr6+
in
the
1st-TPR.
After
treatment under CO2 for 2 h at 496  3 C, a very small
amount of low valence species was recovered as shown in the
3rd-TPR. For Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2, two overlapping peaks were
observed in the 1st-TPR. The smaller peak at low temperature
is likely associated with the reduction of some easily reduced
species formed due to the addition of Ru. In the 2nd-TPR, the
reduction peak was also negligible, proving that all the Cr and
Ru with high oxidation states were totally reduced in the 1st-
TPR. After the treatment of CO2, a slightly larger reduction
peak was found compared with the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst as
shown in the 3rd-TPR. For Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2, the magnitude of
the lower temperature peak in the 1st-TPR, and the reduction
peak observed in the 3rd-TPR, increased even further. For all
three samples, the reduction peaks at high temperature in the
3rd-TPR, which are assigned to the reduction of Cr6+, become
very small. This suggests that Cr6+ is not the main chemical
species recovered by CO2 oxidation. The strongest reduction
peaks were located at the low temperature region, which
means that the main species recovered by CO2 exposure at
high temperature could be associated with the reduction of
RuO2 or some easily reduced Cr species (like rutile CrO2).
CrO2 is a metastable phase at room temperature and ambient
pressure,58 but the presence of Ru could stabilize rutile CrO2
due to the formation of RuO2CrO2 solid solution.59 Based on
the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude
that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly
enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the
sole
reason
for
enhancing
catalytic
activity
with
Ru
modification.
To identify the two-step pathway for the promoting effect
of Ru, CO2 hydrogenation was performed over these three
catalysts
at
various
temperatures
in
the
200500
C
temperature range. The results are shown in Fig. 4(d). For
Cr10Ox/SiO2, H2 conversion was zero at 300 C and then
increased with increasing temperature to 20.7% at 500 C.
In contrast, H2 conversion over the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst
started at 300 C (17.1%) and increased with increasing
temperature to 84.4% at 500 C. Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 showed even
higher activity with a H2 conversion of 35.3% at 300 C and
84.8% at 500 C. The similar H2 conversion for Ru1Cr10Ox/
SiO2 and Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 observed at temperatures greater
than 350 C is likely due to equilibrium conversion. The CO
selectivity for all three catalysts (Fig. 4(e)) was higher than
99% and no other by-products were detected. The RWGS rate
over Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 is 27.9 molCO2 gcatal
1 h1 at 500 C,
which is much higher than that of Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (5.5
molCO2 gcatal
1 h1). The CO2 hydrogenation experiments
demonstrated
that
the
activities
of
silica
supported
chromium oxide catalysts towards the RWGS reaction (eqn
(3)) were dramatically improved by the modification of Ru.
Based on the above results, we propose the reaction
pathways of the catalysts with different Ru loading amounts
in Fig. 5. For all the catalysts, the Cr6+ could be reduced to
Cr3+ quickly under the reaction condition, which are believed
to
be
the
active
sites
for
the
direct
non-oxidative
dehydrogenation reaction according to the literature.29 The
Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst has a poor ability to activate CO2 and
therefore
the
C3H6
product
mainly
results
from
direct
dehydrogenation of C3H8 at 496  3 C (Fig. 5, top). When the
catalyst is modified by a small amount of Ru (1 wt%), C3H8
conversion significantly increases, as well as CO2 conversion.
Three-step H2-TPR and RWGS experiments (Fig. 4) suggest
that there is no major change in the redox property of the
catalysts after modification with Ru, but its ability to catalyze
CO2 hydrogenation to CO is greatly increased. The H2
products from the direct dehydrogenation reaction could be
easily removed by the RWGS reaction, and the main reaction
pathway changes from direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation
over
the
Cr10Ox/SiO2
catalyst
to
the
two-step
oxidative
dehydrogenation (Fig. 5, middle) over the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2
catalyst. When the catalyst is modified with a large amount
of Ru (3 wt%), CO2 conversion increases, but both C3H8
conversion and C3H6 selectivity decreased. The presence of a
large amount of Ru enables the reforming reaction of C3H6
and CO2, resulting in a low selectivity to C3H6, and the
reforming
reaction
is
the
main
reaction
pathway
(Fig. 5, bottom).
Catalyst stability and regeneration
The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As
shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time
on stream. However, the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed the
highest C3H8 conversion, C3H6 production rate and C3H6
selectivity the entire time. The C3H6 production rate was

determined to be 10.3 mmol gcatal
1 h1 with a selectivity of
90% after about 7.3 h. ICP-OES analysis showed that there
was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time
test. The regenerative property of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst
was also tested in this work. After the long-time experiment,
the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours.
However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in
Fig. S4. We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but
the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered.
Moreover, its activity after the reaction stabilized (after 50
min of reaction) was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated
cycle. This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was
probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased
dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation.60
Conclusions
In conclusion, silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts with
different Ru loadings were utilized as catalysts for oxidative
dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2. The C3H8 conversion
showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru
loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, which
resulted in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate
compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium
oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of
C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct
dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst
surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However,
large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor
selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and
high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2. The
main
reaction
pathway
evolves
from
one-step
direct
dehydrogenation of C3H8 to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation
of C3H8, and to the reforming reaction of C3H8 with CO2 with
increasing Ru loading. This work provides a basis for the
investigation of Ru-modified chromium-based catalyst and their
structureproperty relationships for CO2-participated oxidative
dehydrogenation of C3H8. This offers a new concept to design
efficient
catalysts
for
oxidative
dehydrogenation
of
lower
alkanes with CO2: a promoter with high CO2 activation ability
can significantly improve the activity of Cr-based catalyst for
ODP reaction, and this concept is very likely to be extended to
non-precious metal promoters with high CO2 activation ability.
