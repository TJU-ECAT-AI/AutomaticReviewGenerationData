[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), top), C3H6 production began at 390 °C and H2 production began at the same temperature. This indicates that the DDP reaction is the preferred reaction pathway with this catalyst."

[6] "For Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), middle), C3H6 production began at 360 °C, which is 30 °C lower than with the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst."

[7] "For all three samples, the reduction peaks at high temperature in the 3rd-TPR, which are assigned to the reduction of Cr6+, become very small. This suggests that Cr6+ is not the main chemical species recovered by CO2 oxidation."

[8] "Based on the above results, we propose the reaction pathways of the catalysts with different Ru loading amounts in Fig. 5. For all the catalysts, the Cr6+ could be reduced to Cr3+ quickly under the reaction condition, which are believed to be the active sites for the direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction according to the literature."

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP of propane. Key findings include:

1. The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%, with the direct dehydrogenation pathway being dominant.

2. Ru modification significantly affected catalyst performance, with a volcano-shaped activity trend observed as a function of Ru loading. The optimal 1 wt% Ru loading resulted in a two-fold enhancement in C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Ru promotion lowered the C3H6 production onset temperature by 30°C, indicating improved catalyst activity.

4. Higher Ru loadings (>1 wt%) led to decreased C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, likely due to increased CO2 adsorption and promotion of unwanted reforming reactions.

5. The evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Cr6+ species are quickly reduced to Cr3+ under reaction conditions, with Cr3+ believed to be the active sites for direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

6. The addition of Ru alters the reaction pathway from direct dehydrogenation to a two-step oxidative dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall catalyst performance at optimal loadings.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include Ru loading, CO2 activation ability, and the balance between desired dehydrogenation and undesired reforming reactions. The study highlights the importance of optimizing promoter loading and understanding the evolution of active species in developing efficient CO2-ODHP catalysts.

该研究比较了各种Ru改性的SiO2负载的氧化铬催化剂在丙烷CO2氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中的活性和选择性。主要发现包括：

1. 未改性的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂显示出79%的C3H6选择性，直接脱氢途径占主导地位。

2. Ru改性显著影响了催化剂性能，随Ru负载量的变化观察到火山形活性趋势。最佳的1 wt% Ru负载使C3H6产率比未改性催化剂提高了两倍。

3. Ru促进作用将C3H6产生的起始温度降低了30°C，表明催化剂活性得到改善。

4. 更高的Ru负载量(>1 wt%)导致C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性降低，这可能是由于CO2吸附增加和不需要的重整反应促进所致。

5. 铬物种的演变在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。Cr6+物种在反应条件下快速还原为Cr3+，Cr3+被认为是直接非氧化脱氢的活性位点。

6. Ru的添加将反应途径从直接脱氢改变为两步氧化脱氢过程，在最佳负载量下提高了催化剂的整体性能。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括Ru负载量、CO2活化能力以及所需脱氢反应和不需要的重整反应之间的平衡。该研究强调了在开发高效CO2-ODHP催化剂时，优化促进剂负载量和理解活性物种演变的重要性。
