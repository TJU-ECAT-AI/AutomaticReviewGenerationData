[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[6] "No Cr6+ was detected in any of the three samples, demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period of reaction"

The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary significantly based on their composition and structure. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: The study shows a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. The optimal loading was 1 wt% Ru, which doubled the C3H6 production rate compared to unmodified Cr2O3/SiO2.

2. Catalyst composition: Small amounts of Ru promote C3H8 and CO2 activation, while large amounts lead to low C3H8 conversion and poor C3H6 selectivity.

3. Reaction pathways: The main reaction pathway evolves from direct dehydrogenation to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to reforming as Ru loading increases.

4. Oxidation state of chromium: The evolution of chromium species is crucial. Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial reaction period, which are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation.

5. Support properties: While not extensively discussed in this study, the support (SiO2 in this case) plays a role in dispersing the active metal species and influencing their reducibility.

6. Reaction conditions: Temperature and reactant composition affect the catalyst performance and the evolution of chromium species.

These factors collectively determine the catalyst's ability to activate C3H8 and CO2, remove adsorbed H2, and maintain selectivity towards C3H6 production.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性因其组成和结构而有显著差异。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属负载量：研究显示，Ru在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的负载量呈火山形活性趋势。最佳负载量为1 wt% Ru，与未改性的Cr2O3/SiO2相比，C3H6产率提高了一倍。

2. 催化剂组成：少量Ru促进C3H8和CO2的活化，而大量Ru导致C3H8转化率低和C3H6选择性差。

3. 反应路径：随着Ru负载量的增加，主要反应路径从直接脱氢演变为两步氧化脱氢，然后转变为重整反应。

4. 铬的氧化态：铬物种的演变至关重要。Cr6+物种在反应初期迅速还原为Cr3+或Cr2+，这些被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

5. 载体性质：虽然本研究没有详细讨论，但载体（本例中为SiO2）在分散活性金属物种和影响其还原性方面发挥作用。

6. 反应条件：温度和反应物组成影响催化剂性能和铬物种的演变。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂活化C3H8和CO2、去除吸附H2以及维持C3H6产物选择性的能力。
