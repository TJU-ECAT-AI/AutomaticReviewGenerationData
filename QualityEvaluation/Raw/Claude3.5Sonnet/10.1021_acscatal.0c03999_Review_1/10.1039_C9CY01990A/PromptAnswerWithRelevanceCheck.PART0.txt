[1] "The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), top), C3H6 production began at 390 °C and H2 production began at the same temperature. This indicates that the DDP reaction is the preferred reaction pathway with this catalyst."

[6] "For Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), middle), C3H6 production began at 360 °C, which is 30 °C lower than with the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst."

[7] "For all three samples, the reduction peaks at high temperature in the 3rd-TPR, which are assigned to the reduction of Cr6+, become very small. This suggests that Cr6+ is not the main chemical species recovered by CO2 oxidation."

[8] "Based on the above results, we propose the reaction pathways of the catalysts with different Ru loading amounts in Fig. 5. For all the catalysts, the Cr6+ could be reduced to Cr3+ quickly under the reaction condition, which are believed to be the active sites for the direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction according to the literature."

The study compares the activity and selectivity of various Ru-modified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP of propane. Key findings include:

1. The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of 79%, with the direct dehydrogenation pathway being dominant.

2. Ru modification significantly affected catalyst performance, with a volcano-shaped activity trend observed as a function of Ru loading. The optimal 1 wt% Ru loading resulted in a two-fold enhancement in C3H6 production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Ru promotion lowered the C3H6 production onset temperature by 30°C, indicating improved catalyst activity.

4. Higher Ru loadings (>1 wt%) led to decreased C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, likely due to increased CO2 adsorption and promotion of unwanted reforming reactions.

5. The evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Cr6+ species are quickly reduced to Cr3+ under reaction conditions, with Cr3+ believed to be the active sites for direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

6. The addition of Ru alters the reaction pathway from direct dehydrogenation to a two-step oxidative dehydrogenation process, enhancing overall catalyst performance at optimal loadings.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include Ru loading, CO2 activation ability, and the balance between desired dehydrogenation and undesired reforming reactions. The study highlights the importance of optimizing promoter loading and understanding the evolution of active species in developing efficient CO2-ODHP catalysts.

该研究比较了各种Ru改性的SiO2负载的氧化铬催化剂在丙烷CO2氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中的活性和选择性。主要发现包括：

1. 未改性的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂显示出79%的C3H6选择性，直接脱氢途径占主导地位。

2. Ru改性显著影响了催化剂性能，随Ru负载量的变化观察到火山形活性趋势。最佳的1 wt% Ru负载使C3H6产率比未改性催化剂提高了两倍。

3. Ru促进作用将C3H6产生的起始温度降低了30°C，表明催化剂活性得到改善。

4. 更高的Ru负载量(>1 wt%)导致C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性降低，这可能是由于CO2吸附增加和不需要的重整反应促进所致。

5. 铬物种的演变在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。Cr6+物种在反应条件下快速还原为Cr3+，Cr3+被认为是直接非氧化脱氢的活性位点。

6. Ru的添加将反应途径从直接脱氢改变为两步氧化脱氢过程，在最佳负载量下提高了催化剂的整体性能。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括Ru负载量、CO2活化能力以及所需脱氢反应和不需要的重整反应之间的平衡。该研究强调了在开发高效CO2-ODHP催化剂时，优化促进剂负载量和理解活性物种演变的重要性。

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies significantly, with key factors influencing their activity and selectivity:

1. Chromium loading: The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed moderate activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Ruthenium modification: Adding Ru to the Cr catalyst significantly impacts performance. A volcano-shaped activity trend was observed with increasing Ru loading, with optimal performance at 1 wt% Ru.

3. Optimal catalyst composition: The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt% Ru) showed the highest propane conversion and propylene production rate, doubling the activity compared to the unmodified chromium catalyst.

4. Overloading effect: Increasing Ru loading beyond the optimal amount (e.g., to 3 wt%) led to decreased propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. Evolution of chromium species: The chromium species evolve during the reaction, with Cr6+ being reduced to lower oxidation states (Cr3+ or Cr2+) in the initial reaction period. This evolution occurs regardless of Ru loading.

6. Stability of reduced chromium species: The reduced chromium species remain stable throughout the reaction, as evidenced by similar XPS peak positions after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction.

These factors demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, metal oxidation states, and catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing catalyst formulations for improved activity and selectivity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能差异显著，影响其活性和选择性的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：未经修饰的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出中等的活性和选择性。

2. 钌修饰：向铬催化剂中添加钌对性能有显著影响。随着钌负载量的增加，观察到火山形状的活性趋势，在1 wt%钌时性能最佳。

3. 最佳催化剂组成：Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂（1 wt%钌）表现出最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，其活性是未经修饰的铬催化剂的两倍。

4. 过度负载效应：将钌负载量增加到最佳量以上（如3 wt%）会导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性下降。

5. 铬物种的演变：在反应初期，铬物种会发生演变，Cr6+被还原为较低的氧化态（Cr3+或Cr2+）。这种演变与钌负载量无关。

6. 还原态铬物种的稳定性：还原态的铬物种在整个反应过程中保持稳定，这从反应5分钟和50分钟后XPS峰位置相似可以得到证实。

这些因素表明了催化剂组成、金属氧化态和CO2-ODHP反应催化性能之间复杂的相互作用，突出了优化催化剂配方以提高活性和选择性的重要性。

The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary significantly based on their composition and structure. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: The study shows a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. The optimal loading was 1 wt% Ru, which doubled the C3H6 production rate compared to unmodified Cr2O3/SiO2.

2. Catalyst composition: Small amounts of Ru promote C3H8 and CO2 activation, while large amounts lead to low C3H8 conversion and poor C3H6 selectivity.

3. Reaction pathways: The main reaction pathway evolves from direct dehydrogenation to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to reforming as Ru loading increases.

4. Oxidation state of chromium: The evolution of chromium species is crucial. Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial reaction period, which are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation.

5. Support properties: While not extensively discussed in this study, the support (SiO2 in this case) plays a role in dispersing the active metal species and influencing their reducibility.

6. Reaction conditions: Temperature and reactant composition affect the catalyst performance and the evolution of chromium species.

These factors collectively determine the catalyst's ability to activate C3H8 and CO2, remove adsorbed H2, and maintain selectivity towards C3H6 production.

1. 金属负载量：研究显示，Ru在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的负载量呈火山形活性趋势。最佳负载量为1 wt% Ru，与未改性的Cr2O3/SiO2相比，C3H6产率提高了一倍。

2. 催化剂组成：少量Ru促进C3H8和CO2的活化，而大量Ru导致C3H8转化率低和C3H6选择性差。

3. 反应路径：随着Ru负载量的增加，主要反应路径从直接脱氢演变为两步氧化脱氢，然后转变为重整反应。

4. 铬的氧化态：铬物种的演变至关重要。Cr6+物种在反应初期迅速还原为Cr3+或Cr2+，这些被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

5. 载体性质：虽然本研究没有详细讨论，但载体（本例中为SiO2）在分散活性金属物种和影响其还原性方面发挥作用。

6. 反应条件：温度和反应物组成影响催化剂性能和铬物种的演变。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂活化C3H8和CO2、去除吸附H2以及维持C3H6产物选择性的能力。

[1] "Takahara et al. discovered that the activity of Al2O3-supported chromium oxides (commercial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes) was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."

[2] "Although there is an open debate on the enhancement mechanism of SiO2-supported chromium oxides—many different redox mechanisms including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed—all of the investigations indicate that CO2 exhibits limited oxidative ability since it is quite inert and not easily activated by chromium oxides."

[3] "The catalytic activity of the optimized catalyst (1% Ru loading) is double that of unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide. The origin of the altered catalytic behaviour is analysed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed-mass spectrometry measurements (TP-MS), and three-step H2-TPR (temperature programmed reduction)."

[4] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction. The Ru 3d5/2 peak of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 sample (Fig. S2(b), middle) was missing after 50 min of reaction, which could be caused by coke accumulated onto the catalyst surface."

[5] "Based on the reduction peak in the 3rd-TPR results, we can conclude that the redox properties of catalysts could only be slightly enhanced by Ru modification, so this enhancement is not the sole reason for enhancing catalytic activity with Ru modification."

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary significantly depending on several key factors:

1. Support material: SiO2-supported chromium oxides show improved activity when CO2 is added, while Al2O3-supported chromium oxides experience reduced activity.

2. Metal loading: For Ru-modified chromium catalysts, there is an optimal loading around 1 wt% Ru that doubles the catalytic activity compared to unmodified chromium oxide catalysts.

3. Redox properties: Different redox mechanisms (Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+) have been proposed for SiO2-supported chromium oxides, but CO2 activation remains limited due to its inert nature.

4. Catalyst structure and characterization: The evolution of chromium species is analyzed using various techniques like XRD, TEM, XPS, TP-MS, and H2-TPR. These methods reveal that Ru modification only slightly enhances the redox properties of the catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions and time: XPS analysis shows similar chromium species after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction, but coke accumulation can affect the catalyst surface over time.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the support material, metal loading, redox properties, catalyst structure, and reaction conditions. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is complex and depends on the interplay of these factors, with the addition of promoters like Ru playing a crucial role in enhancing CO2 activation and overall catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性存在显著差异，这取决于几个关键因素：

1. 载体材料：当添加CO2时，SiO2负载的铬氧化物表现出活性提高，而Al2O3负载的铬氧化物则活性降低。

2. 金属负载量：对于Ru改性的铬催化剂，约1 wt%的Ru负载量是最佳的，与未改性的铬氧化物催化剂相比，催化活性提高了一倍。

3. 氧化还原性质：对于SiO2负载的铬氧化物，已提出不同的氧化还原机理（Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+），但由于CO2的惰性特征，其活化仍然有限。

4. 催化剂结构和表征：使用各种技术如XRD、TEM、XPS、TP-MS和H2-TPR分析铬物种的演变。这些方法揭示了Ru改性仅略微增强了催化剂的氧化还原性质。

5. 反应条件和时间：XPS分析显示，反应5分钟和50分钟后的铬物种相似，但随时间推移，焦炭积累可能会影响催化剂表面。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体材料、金属负载量、氧化还原性质、催化剂结构和反应条件。负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变是复杂的，取决于这些因素的相互作用，而添加如Ru等助剂在增强CO2活化和整体催化性能方面起着关键作用。
