[1] "Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst by itself (0% Ru loading) could catalyze dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 with a selectivity of 79%"

[2] "After the modification, we observed that the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) showed a volcano-like tendency as a function of Ru amount, with a maximum C3H8 conversion of 9% at 1 wt% Ru loading."

[3] "The C3H6 production rate (Fig. 1(a)) also reached a maximum of 13.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 at 1 wt% Ru loading, showing a two-fold enhancement compared with the unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst"

[4] "When we further increased the loading amount of Ru up to 3 wt%, we found that C3H8 conversion (Fig. 1(b)) started to drop and C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 1(a)) was also significantly reduced"

[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."

[6] "No Cr6+ was detected in any of the three samples, demonstrating that the majority of Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ during the initial period of reaction"

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies significantly, with key factors influencing their activity and selectivity:

1. Chromium loading: The unmodified Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed moderate activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Ruthenium modification: Adding Ru to the Cr catalyst significantly impacts performance. A volcano-shaped activity trend was observed with increasing Ru loading, with optimal performance at 1 wt% Ru.

3. Optimal catalyst composition: The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt% Ru) showed the highest propane conversion and propylene production rate, doubling the activity compared to the unmodified chromium catalyst.

4. Overloading effect: Increasing Ru loading beyond the optimal amount (e.g., to 3 wt%) led to decreased propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. Evolution of chromium species: The chromium species evolve during the reaction, with Cr6+ being reduced to lower oxidation states (Cr3+ or Cr2+) in the initial reaction period. This evolution occurs regardless of Ru loading.

6. Stability of reduced chromium species: The reduced chromium species remain stable throughout the reaction, as evidenced by similar XPS peak positions after 5 and 50 minutes of reaction.

These factors demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, metal oxidation states, and catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing catalyst formulations for improved activity and selectivity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能差异显著，影响其活性和选择性的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：未经修饰的Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出中等的活性和选择性。

2. 钌修饰：向铬催化剂中添加钌对性能有显著影响。随着钌负载量的增加，观察到火山形状的活性趋势，在1 wt%钌时性能最佳。

3. 最佳催化剂组成：Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂（1 wt%钌）表现出最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，其活性是未经修饰的铬催化剂的两倍。

4. 过度负载效应：将钌负载量增加到最佳量以上（如3 wt%）会导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性下降。

5. 铬物种的演变：在反应初期，铬物种会发生演变，Cr6+被还原为较低的氧化态（Cr3+或Cr2+）。这种演变与钌负载量无关。

6. 还原态铬物种的稳定性：还原态的铬物种在整个反应过程中保持稳定，这从反应5分钟和50分钟后XPS峰位置相似可以得到证实。

这些因素表明了催化剂组成、金属氧化态和CO2-ODHP反应催化性能之间复杂的相互作用，突出了优化催化剂配方以提高活性和选择性的重要性。
