<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or discussing factors influencing their catalytic performance. The text appears to be about pore size engineering and mechanical stability of cubic mesoporous molecular sieves, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
