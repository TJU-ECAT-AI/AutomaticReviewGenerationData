[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature primarily compares Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key findings include:

1. Catalyst activity: Cr/SiO2 activity increases with CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 activity decreases significantly with small CO2 additions.

2. Redox cycle: Both catalysts involve a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 species, which plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 effect: CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) under reaction conditions. For Cr/SiO2, this leads to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species, alongside simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

4. Support influence: The support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly affects the catalyst's response to CO2, suggesting that support properties are a key factor in determining catalytic performance.

5. Chromium species evolution: The oxidation state of chromium changes during the reaction, with Cr(III) being oxidized to Cr(VI) by CO2. This evolution of chromium species is crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism and performance.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on various other metal oxide catalysts or detailed insights into the effect of chromium loading. However, it highlights the importance of support choice, CO2 partial pressure, and the dynamic nature of chromium oxidation states in determining catalyst activity and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODHP.

文献主要比较了Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）中的表现。主要发现包括：

1. 催化剂活性：随着CO2分压增加，Cr/SiO2的活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性在添加少量CO2时显著降低。

2. 氧化还原循环：两种催化剂都涉及Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4物种之间的氧化还原循环，这在丙烷脱氢中起着关键作用。

3. CO2的影响：在反应条件下，CO2可以将Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)。对于Cr/SiO2，这导致了Cr(VI)物种上额外的氧化脱氢反应，同时Cr(III)物种上仍进行简单脱氢。

4. 载体影响：载体材料（SiO2与Al2O3）显著影响催化剂对CO2的响应，表明载体特性是决定催化性能的关键因素。

5. 铬物种演变：反应过程中铬的氧化态发生变化，CO2将Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)。这种铬物种的演变对理解催化机理和性能至关重要。

文献没有提供关于其他各种金属氧化物催化剂的综合信息，也没有详细介绍铬负载量的影响。然而，它强调了载体选择、CO2分压以及铬氧化态动态性质在决定CO2-ODHP催化剂活性和反应机理中的重要性。
