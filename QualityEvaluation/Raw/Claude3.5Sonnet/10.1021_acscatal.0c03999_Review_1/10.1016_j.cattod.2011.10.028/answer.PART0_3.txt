[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature primarily focuses on Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key findings include:

1. Activity differences: Cr/SiO2 showed enhanced activity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 experienced reduced activity even with small amounts of CO2.

2. Redox cycle importance: The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process for both catalysts, regardless of the support material.

3. CO2 oxidation effect: CO2 could oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. This led to oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species for Cr/SiO2.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be:
1. Support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
2. CO2 partial pressure
3. Chromium oxidation state and its ability to undergo redox cycling

The evolution of chromium species depends on the support and reaction conditions, with CO2 promoting the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) on SiO2 support, leading to enhanced activity through additional oxidative dehydrogenation pathways.

该文献主要关注Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的表现。主要发现包括：

1. 活性差异：随着CO2分压增加，Cr/SiO2的活性得到提高，而Cr/Al2O3即使在少量CO2存在下活性也显著降低。

2. 氧化还原循环的重要性：无论载体材料如何，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在两种催化剂的脱氢过程中都起着关键作用。

3. CO2氧化效应：在反应条件下，CO2能将Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。这导致Cr/SiO2上除了Cr(III)物种的简单脱氢外，还发生了Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是：
1. 载体材料（SiO2与Al2O3）
2. CO2分压
3. 铬的氧化态及其进行氧化还原循环的能力

铬物种的演变取决于载体和反应条件，在SiO2载体上，CO2促进Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)，通过额外的氧化脱氢途径提高活性。
