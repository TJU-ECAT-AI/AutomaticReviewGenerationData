[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature primarily focuses on Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key findings include:

1. Catalyst activity differences: Cr/SiO2 showed enhanced activity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 activity was significantly reduced with even small amounts of CO2.

2. Redox cycle importance: For both catalysts, the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 species plays a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation, regardless of the support material.

3. CO2 influence on chromium species: CO2 can oxidize some Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) under reaction conditions. This leads to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species in Cr/SiO2, alongside simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

4. Support influence: The support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3) significantly affects the catalyst's interaction with CO2 and its overall performance in the reaction.

The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the CO2 partial pressure and the nature of the support material, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction.

该文献主要关注Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的表现。主要发现包括：

1. 催化剂活性差异：随着CO2分压的增加，Cr/SiO2的活性得到增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性即使在添加少量CO2的情况下也显著降低。

2. 氧化还原循环的重要性：对于两种催化剂，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4物种之间的氧化还原循环在丙烷脱氢反应中起着关键作用，这与载体材料无关。

3. CO2对铬物种的影响：在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。这导致在Cr/SiO2上，除了Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢反应外，还发生了Cr(VI)物种上的额外氧化脱氢反应。

4. 载体的影响：载体材料（SiO2与Al2O3）显著影响催化剂与CO2的相互作用及其在反应中的整体性能。

铬物种的演变受CO2分压和载体材料性质的影响，这反过来又影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
