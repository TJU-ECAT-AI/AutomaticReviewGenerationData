[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[2] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[3] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature primarily focuses on comparing Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). Key findings include:

1. Activity differences: Cr/SiO2 showed enhanced activity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 experienced reduced activity with even small amounts of CO2.

2. Redox cycle importance: For both catalysts, the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation, regardless of the support material.

3. CO2 oxidation effect: CO2 could oxidize some Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. This led to additional oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species for Cr/SiO2, alongside simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance appear to be:
1. Support material (SiO2 vs Al2O3)
2. CO2 partial pressure
3. Chromium oxidation state and its ability to undergo redox cycling

The evolution of chromium species is characterized by the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the presence of CO2, which affects the reaction mechanism and overall catalyst performance. The support material plays a significant role in determining how this evolution impacts catalyst activity.

该文献主要比较了Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）中的表现。主要发现包括：

1. 活性差异：随着CO2分压增加，Cr/SiO2的活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3即使在少量CO2存在下活性也显著降低。

2. 氧化还原循环的重要性：对于两种催化剂，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在丙烷脱氢中起着关键作用，这与载体材料无关。

3. CO2氧化效应：在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。对于Cr/SiO2，这导致了Cr(VI)物种上额外的氧化脱氢反应，同时Cr(III)物种上仍进行简单脱氢。

影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是：
1. 载体材料（SiO2 vs Al2O3）
2. CO2分压
3. 铬的氧化态及其进行氧化还原循环的能力

铬物种的演变特征是在CO2存在下Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)，这影响了反应机理和整体催化剂性能。载体材料在决定这种演变如何影响催化剂活性方面起着重要作用。
