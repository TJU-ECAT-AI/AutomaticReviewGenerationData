[1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP differs significantly. Key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide favors a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects catalytic properties. SiO2-supported chromium catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, while Al2O3-supported catalysts experience decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium content leads to a greater difference between yields in He vs CO2 environments. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

4. Acidic properties of CO2: The acidic nature of CO2 plays an important role in determining reaction yields.

5. Redox properties: Both acidic and redox properties of catalysts are important for CO2-ODHP reactions.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the support and loading. On SiO2, increasing Cr content enhances the promoting effect of CO2, while on Al2O3, it mitigates CO2's poisoning effect. This suggests different chromium species or interactions form depending on the support material and loading level.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能存在显著差异。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂倾向于遵循氧化途径，而镓氧化物则倾向于非氧化还原途径。

2. 载体材料：氧化物载体的酸碱性强烈影响催化性质。SiO2负载的铬催化剂在CO2存在下表现出增强的丙烯产率，而Al2O3负载的催化剂则产率和选择性下降。

3. 铬负载量：对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，随着铬含量的增加，He和CO2环境下产率的差异增大。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，更高的负载量减少了CO2的毒化效应。

4. CO2的酸性：CO2的酸性在决定反应产率方面起着重要作用。

5. 氧化还原性质：催化剂的酸性和氧化还原性质对CO2-ODHP反应都很重要。

铬物种的演变取决于载体和负载量。在SiO2上，增加Cr含量会增强CO2的促进作用，而在Al2O3上，则减轻CO2的毒化作用。这表明根据载体材料和负载水平，会形成不同的铬物种或相互作用。
