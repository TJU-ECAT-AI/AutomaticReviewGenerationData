[1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) vary significantly based on the metal and support used. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide follows a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The choice of support greatly affects catalyst performance. For example, CrOx/SiO2 shows enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 experiences decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Acidity/basicity of the support: This property strongly influences the catalytic behavior of supported chromium catalysts.

4. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2, increasing chromium content leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

5. Acidic properties of CO2: The acidic nature of CO2 plays a role in determining reaction product yield.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by both the loading level and support properties. On SiO2 supports, increasing chromium content enhances the catalyst's ability to utilize CO2 for dehydrogenation. On Al2O3 supports, higher chromium loading mitigates the negative impact of CO2 on the reaction. These differences likely stem from the distinct interactions between chromium species and the support materials, as well as their responses to the presence of CO2 in the reaction environment.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的活性和选择性因所使用的金属和载体而有显著差异。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂倾向于遵循氧化途径，而镓氧化物则遵循非氧化还原途径。

2. 载体材料：载体的选择极大地影响催化剂性能。例如，CrOx/SiO2在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而CrOx/Al2O3的产率和选择性则下降。

3. 载体的酸碱性：这一性质强烈影响负载型铬催化剂的催化行为。

4. 铬的负载量：对于CrOx/SiO2，随着铬含量的增加，He中产率与CO2中产率的比值（YHe/YCO2）增高。相反，对于CrOx/Al2O3，更高的负载量减少了CO2的毒化效应。

5. CO2的酸性：CO2的酸性在决定反应产物产率方面起着重要作用。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。在SiO2载体上，增加铬含量可以增强催化剂利用CO2进行脱氢的能力。在Al2O3载体上，较高的铬负载量可以减轻CO2对反应的负面影响。这些差异可能源于铬物种与载体材料之间的不同相互作用，以及它们对反应环境中CO2存在的不同响应。
