[1] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product [16]."

[2] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) varies significantly based on the metal and support used. Key factors influencing their performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide catalysts likely follow a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects the catalytic properties of supported chromium catalysts. SiO2-supported chromium catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, while Al2O3-supported catalysts experience decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium loading leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, increasing loading decreases the poisoning effect of CO2.

4. Acidic properties of CO2: The acidic nature of CO2 plays an important role in determining the yield of reaction products.

5. Redox properties: Both acidic and redox properties of CO2 are important for the dehydrogenation process.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by the loading level and support properties. On SiO2 supports, increasing chromium loading appears to enhance the catalyst's resistance to CO2, while on Al2O3 supports, higher loading reduces the negative impact of CO2 on the catalyst's performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行的丙烷氧化脱氢）中的催化性能因所使用的金属和载体而有显著差异。影响其性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂倾向于遵循氧化途径，而氧化镓催化剂可能遵循非氧化还原途径。

2. 载体材料：氧化物载体的酸碱性强烈影响负载铬催化剂的催化性能。SiO2负载的铬催化剂在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而Al2O3负载的催化剂则出现产率和选择性下降。

3. 铬负载量：对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬负载量会导致He中产率与CO2中产率的比值（YHe/YCO2）升高。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，增加负载量会减少CO2的毒化效应。

4. CO2的酸性特性：CO2的酸性在决定反应产物产率方面起重要作用。

5. 氧化还原特性：CO2的酸性和氧化还原特性对脱氢过程都很重要。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。在SiO2载体上，增加铬负载量似乎可以增强催化剂对CO2的抗性，而在Al2O3载体上，更高的负载量可以减少CO2对催化剂性能的负面影响。
