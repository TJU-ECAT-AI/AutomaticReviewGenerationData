The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) vary significantly. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Vanadium, chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts tend to follow an oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide follows a non-redox pathway.

2. Support material: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects catalytic properties. For example, CrOx/SiO2 shows enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 exhibits decreased yield and selectivity.

3. Chromium loading: For CrOx/SiO2, increasing chromium content leads to a higher ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2). For CrOx/Al2O3, higher loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

4. Role of CO2: It generally removes hydrogen and suppresses coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by both loading and support properties. On SiO2 support, higher chromium loading increases the catalyst's sensitivity to CO2, while on Al2O3 support, it decreases CO2's poisoning effect. This suggests that the interaction between chromium species and the support material plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's behavior in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的活性和选择性存在显著差异。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂倾向于遵循氧化途径，而镓氧化物则遵循非氧化还原途径。

2. 载体材料：氧化物载体的酸碱性强烈影响催化性能。例如，CrOx/SiO2在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而CrOx/Al2O3则表现出产率和选择性的下降。

3. 铬负载量：对于CrOx/SiO2，随着铬含量的增加，He中产率与CO2中产率的比值（YHe/YCO2）升高。对于CrOx/Al2O3，更高的负载量减少了CO2的毒化效应。

4. CO2的作用：它通常可以去除氢气并抑制催化剂表面的积碳。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变受到负载量和载体性质的影响。在SiO2载体上，更高的铬负载量增加了催化剂对CO2的敏感性，而在Al2O3载体上，它降低了CO2的毒化效应。这表明铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用在决定催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的行为方面起着关键作用。
