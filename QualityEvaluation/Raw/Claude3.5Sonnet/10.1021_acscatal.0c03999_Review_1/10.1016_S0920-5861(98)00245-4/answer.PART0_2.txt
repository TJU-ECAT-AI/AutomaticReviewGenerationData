[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon (AC), and SiO2 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity and selectivity: SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation. Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC activity was unaffected by CO2.

2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance:
   a) Support material: SiO2 was crucial for CO2 promotion.
   b) Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 resulted in better CO2 promotion, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
   c) Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active than reduced catalyst.

3. Evolution of chromium species:
   a) CO2 could partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst.
   b) The presence of CO2 maintained Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is believed to be more active for propane dehydrogenation.

The study emphasizes the importance of the support material, Cr2O3 loading, and the oxidation state of chromium in determining the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP. The unique interaction between Cr2O3 and SiO2, particularly at their interface, appears to be crucial for the observed CO2 promotion effect.

该研究比较了以Al2O3、活性炭（AC）和SiO2为载体的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。主要发现如下：

1. 活性和选择性：SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2提高了C3H6产率40%，并抑制了催化剂失活。Cr2O3/Al2O3在CO2存在下活性降低，而Cr2O3/AC的活性不受CO2影响。

2. 影响催化性能的关键因素：
   a) 载体材料：SiO2对CO2促进作用至关重要。
   b) Cr2O3负载量：SiO2上较低的Cr2O3含量导致更好的CO2促进效果，表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。
   c) 铬的氧化态：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2比还原态催化剂更活跃。

3. 铬物种的演变：
   a) CO2可以部分氧化催化剂中Cr2O3的表面。
   b) CO2的存在使Cr2O3在反应过程中保持部分氧化状态，这被认为对丙烷脱氢更有活性。

研究强调了载体材料、Cr2O3负载量和铬的氧化态在决定CO2-ODHP催化性能中的重要性。Cr2O3和SiO2之间的独特相互作用，特别是在它们的界面处，似乎对观察到的CO2促进效应至关重要。
