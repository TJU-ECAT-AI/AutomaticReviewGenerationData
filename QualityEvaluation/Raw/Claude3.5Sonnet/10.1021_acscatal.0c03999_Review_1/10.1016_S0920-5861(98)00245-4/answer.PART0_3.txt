[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compares the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts showed lower activity in the presence of CO2, while Cr2O3/AC catalysts were unaffected by CO2.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content, suggesting that the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a crucial role in the CO2 promotion effect.

4. CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation than the reduced state.

5. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the support material, Cr2O3 loading, and the oxidation state of the chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction of Cr2O3 in H2 stream.
2. Partial re-oxidation of reduced Cr2O3 by CO2.
3. Maintenance of a partially oxidized state during the reaction in the presence of CO2, which contributes to higher activity and stability.

该研究比较了Cr2O3负载在不同材料（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上的催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的催化性能。主要发现如下：

1. SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2的存在使C3H6产率提高40%，并抑制了催化剂失活。

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下活性降低，而Cr2O3/AC催化剂不受CO2影响。

3. CO2对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的促进作用随Cr2O3含量的增加而减弱，这表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面在CO2促进效应中起关键作用。

4. CO2有助于维持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这种状态比还原态更有利于丙烷脱氢。

5. 影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体材料、Cr2O3负载量和铬物种的氧化状态。

负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. Cr2O3在H2气流中被还原。
2. 还原态的Cr2O3被CO2部分再氧化。
3. 在CO2存在下的反应中，催化剂保持部分氧化状态，这有助于提高活性和稳定性。
