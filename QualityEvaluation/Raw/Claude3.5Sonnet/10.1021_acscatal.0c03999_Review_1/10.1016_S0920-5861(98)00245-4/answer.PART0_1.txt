[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study compares the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different metal oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed lower activity in the presence of CO2, while active carbon-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed no significant change.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 was most pronounced at lower Cr2O3 loadings on SiO2, suggesting that the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a crucial role.

4. The key factor influencing catalytic performance appears to be the ability of CO2 to maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction.

5. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support material and Cr2O3 loading. On SiO2, lower Cr2O3 loadings lead to better dispersion and more interface sites, which are crucial for the CO2 promoting effect.

These findings highlight the importance of support choice and chromium loading in designing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP, with SiO2-supported Cr2O3 at lower loadings showing the most promise due to the synergistic effects at the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

该研究比较了Cr2O3负载在不同金属氧化物（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上的催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。主要发现包括：

1. SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2的存在使C3H6产率提高40%，并抑制了催化剂失活。

2. Al2O3负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下活性降低，而活性炭负载的Cr2O3催化剂则没有显著变化。

3. CO2的促进效果在SiO2上Cr2O3负载量较低时最为显著，表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面起着关键作用。

4. 影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是CO2能够在反应过程中将Cr2O3表面保持在部分氧化状态。

5. 铬物种的演变受到载体材料和Cr2O3负载量的影响。在SiO2上，较低的Cr2O3负载量导致更好的分散和更多的界面位点，这对CO2的促进效果至关重要。

这些发现强调了在设计有效的CO2-ODHP催化剂时，选择合适的载体和铬负载量的重要性。其中，低负载量的SiO2负载Cr2O3由于Cr2O3-SiO2界面的协同效应而显示出最大的潜力。
