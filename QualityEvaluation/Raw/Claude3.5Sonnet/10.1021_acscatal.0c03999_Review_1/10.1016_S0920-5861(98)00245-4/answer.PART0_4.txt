[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study compared Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon (AC), and SiO2 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings were:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed the best performance, with CO2 enhancing C3H6 yield by 40% and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts showed lower activity in the presence of CO2, while Cr2O3/AC catalysts were unaffected by CO2.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content, suggesting that the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface plays a crucial role.

4. The key factor influencing catalytic performance appears to be the oxidation state of chromium. Partially oxidized Cr2O3 on SiO2 is active for propane dehydrogenation, and CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction.

5. The study suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles are important for the CO2 promoting effect, indicating that the support properties and chromium loading significantly influence the catalyst's performance.

In summary, the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the support material and chromium loading, with SiO2 providing the best environment for CO2-assisted ODHP by maintaining partially oxidized chromium species at the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

该研究比较了在Al2O3、活性炭（AC）和SiO2上负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）反应中的性能。主要发现如下：

1. SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现最佳，CO2能够提高C3H6产率40%，并抑制催化剂失活。

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下活性降低，而Cr2O3/AC催化剂不受CO2影响。

3. CO2对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的促进作用随Cr2O3含量增加而降低，表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面起关键作用。

4. 影响催化性能的关键因素似乎是铬的氧化态。SiO2上部分氧化的Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢反应活性高，而CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态。

5. 研究表明，Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面对CO2的促进作用很重要，这说明载体性质和铬负载量显著影响催化剂的性能。

总之，负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与载体材料和铬负载量密切相关。SiO2通过在Cr2O3-SiO2界面维持部分氧化的铬物种，为CO2辅助ODHP反应提供了最佳环境。
