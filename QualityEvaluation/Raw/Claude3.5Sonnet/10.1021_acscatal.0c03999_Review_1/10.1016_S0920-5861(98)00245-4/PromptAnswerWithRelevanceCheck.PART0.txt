[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compared the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity: Cr2O3/SiO2 showed the highest activity in the presence of CO2, with a 40% increase compared to the absence of CO2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC showed no change.

2. Selectivity: All catalysts showed high selectivity for C3H6 (>90%), with Cr2O3/SiO2 demonstrating the best performance in maintaining selectivity across different C3H6 yields.

3. Deactivation: CO2 suppressed catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.

2. Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed a higher promoting effect of CO2, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active than the reduced form. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction.

4. Cr2O3-SiO2 interface: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles play a crucial role in the CO2 promoting effect.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction during the dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of CO2.
2. Partial oxidation by CO2 during the reaction, maintaining an active state.
3. The ability to be re-oxidized by CO2 after reduction, which contributes to sustained catalytic activity.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

4. The key factor influencing catalytic performance appears to be the ability of CO2 to maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction.

5. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support material and Cr2O3 loading. On SiO2, lower Cr2O3 loadings lead to better dispersion and more interface sites, which are crucial for the CO2 promoting effect.

These findings highlight the importance of support choice and chromium loading in designing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP, with SiO2-supported Cr2O3 at lower loadings showing the most promise due to the synergistic effects at the Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.
