[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The study compared the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 supported on different materials (SiO2, Al2O3, and active carbon) for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key findings are:

1. Activity: Cr2O3/SiO2 showed the highest activity in the presence of CO2, with a 40% increase compared to the absence of CO2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed lower activity with CO2, while Cr2O3/AC showed no change.

2. Selectivity: All catalysts showed high selectivity for C3H6 (>90%), with Cr2O3/SiO2 demonstrating the best performance in maintaining selectivity across different C3H6 yields.

3. Deactivation: CO2 suppressed catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 was crucial for the promoting effect of CO2.

2. Cr2O3 loading: Lower Cr2O3 content on SiO2 showed a higher promoting effect of CO2, suggesting the importance of Cr2O3-SiO2 interface.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 was more active than the reduced form. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction.

4. Cr2O3-SiO2 interface: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles play a crucial role in the CO2 promoting effect.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Reduction during the dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of CO2.
2. Partial oxidation by CO2 during the reaction, maintaining an active state.
3. The ability to be re-oxidized by CO2 after reduction, which contributes to sustained catalytic activity.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

该研究比较了Cr2O3负载在不同材料（SiO2、Al2O3和活性炭）上的催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的催化性能。主要发现如下：

1. 活性：在CO2存在下，Cr2O3/SiO2表现出最高的活性，比无CO2时提高40%。Cr2O3/Al2O3在CO2存在下活性降低，而Cr2O3/AC活性不变。

2. 选择性：所有催化剂对C3H6的选择性都很高（>90%），其中Cr2O3/SiO2在不同C3H6产率下保持选择性的能力最佳。

3. 失活：CO2抑制了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的失活。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2对CO2的促进作用至关重要。

2. Cr2O3负载量：SiO2上较低的Cr2O3含量显示出CO2更高的促进作用，表明Cr2O3-SiO2界面的重要性。

3. 铬的氧化态：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2比还原态更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态。

4. Cr2O3-SiO2界面：Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面在CO2促进作用中起着关键作用。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 在无CO2的脱氢反应中被还原。
2. 在反应过程中被CO2部分氧化，维持活性状态。
3. 还原后能被CO2重新氧化，有助于保持催化活性。

这些因素共同促成了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的优异性能。
