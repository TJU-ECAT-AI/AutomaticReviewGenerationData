[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "It is found that when the propane conversion increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed. Nevertheless, a high selectivity towards propene (>80.0%) was obtained for all the studied catalysts."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

[5] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R3c."

[6] "This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]. Therefore, it could be concluded that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based samples."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-based catalysts showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt%, which provided the best balance of activity and selectivity. 

2. Dispersion of active phase: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for good catalytic performance. As loading increases beyond the optimal level, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support played an important role in achieving high activity, likely due to its high surface area and presence of oxygen-containing surface groups.

4. Reaction conditions: Higher temperatures increased conversion but decreased selectivity to propene. The presence of CO2 improved both conversion and selectivity compared to inert atmosphere.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from highly dispersed Cr at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings (>5 wt%). This transition correlates with a decrease in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining high Cr dispersion for optimal performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn已被用于CO2-ODHP测试,其中Cr基催化剂显示出特别高的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 金属负载量:对于Cr催化剂,最佳负载量约为5 wt%,在活性和选择性之间提供了最佳平衡。

2. 活性相的分散度:高度分散的铬物种对于良好的催化性能至关重要。当负载量超过最佳水平时,会形成结晶α-Cr2O3相,这对脱氢反应的活性较低。

3. 载体性质:活性炭载体在实现高活性方面起着重要作用,这可能是由于其高比表面积和含氧表面基团的存在。

4. 反应条件:较高的温度会增加转化率但降低丙烯的选择性。与惰性气氛相比,CO2的存在改善了转化率和选择性。

随着负载量的变化,铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高度分散Cr到高负载时(>5 wt%)的结晶α-Cr2O3的转变。这种转变与催化活性的降低相关,突出了保持高Cr分散度对于最佳性能的重要性。

The literature provides some insights into metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP:

Various metal oxides including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn were studied as active components for CO2-ODHP catalysts. Potassium oxide was used as a promoter.

For chromium-based catalysts, the key factors influencing performance were:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 5 wt%, then declined slightly at higher loadings. 

2. Chromium species: Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings led to decreased activity, as this phase is less active for alkane dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support provided high surface area and microporous structure.

The 5 wt% Cr/AC catalyst showed very high activity compared to other reported catalysts. However, deactivation was observed over time, which was studied using thermal analysis methods.

The evolution of chromium species appears to be from highly dispersed CrOx at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings, with the dispersed species being more active. Support properties like high surface area likely helped maintain high dispersion up to the optimal ~5 wt% loading.

文献对CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂提供了一些见解：

研究了包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn在内的各种金属氧化物作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的活性组分。氧化钾被用作促进剂。

对于铬基催化剂，影响性能的关键因素是：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而增加，直到5 wt%，然后在更高负载时略有下降。

2. 铬物种：在更高负载时形成结晶α-Cr2O3导致活性降低，因为这种相对烷烃脱氢的活性较低。

3. 载体特性：活性炭载体提供了高比表面积和微孔结构。

5 wt% Cr/AC催化剂与其他报道的催化剂相比显示出很高的活性。然而，随时间推移观察到失活，这是通过热分析方法研究的。

铬物种的演变似乎是从低负载时的高度分散CrOx到高负载时的结晶α-Cr2O3，其中分散物种更活跃。载体的高比表面积等特性可能有助于在最佳的~5 wt%负载量之前保持高度分散。

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with potassium oxide used as a promoter. For chromium-based catalysts, key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal level (around 5 wt% in this study), then declines with further loading.

2. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings, Cr exists in an amorphous state. As loading increases, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support provides high surface area and likely contributes to activity through surface oxygen groups.

4. Dispersion: High dispersion of chromium species is important for maximizing activity.

The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst showed very high activity compared to other reported catalysts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the active carbon support for this reaction. However, the optimal Cr loading and dispersion is crucial, as excess Cr leads to inactive crystalline phases and reduced performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物已被用于CO2-ODHP测试,同时使用氧化钾作为助剂。对于铬基催化剂,影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 铬负载量:活性随铬含量增加而提高,达到最佳水平(本研究中约为5 wt%)后,进一步增加负载量会导致活性下降。

2. 铬物种演变:在低负载量时,铬以无定形状态存在。随着负载量增加,形成结晶α-Cr2O3相,该相对脱氢反应的活性较低。

3. 载体性质:活性炭载体提供高比表面积,其表面含氧基团可能对活性有贡献。

4. 分散度:铬物种的高度分散对最大化活性很重要。

Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂显示出比其他报道的催化剂更高的活性,证明了活性炭载体对该反应的有效性。然而,最佳铬负载量和分散度至关重要,因为过量的铬会导致无活性的结晶相形成,从而降低性能。

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising results. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal oxide loading: For Cr2O3/AC catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt% Cr. Higher loadings led to decreased activity.

2. Dispersion of active phase: Highly dispersed chromium species are more active than crystalline Cr2O3. At higher loadings, formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 decreases activity.

3. Support properties: Various supports including inorganic oxides, mesoporous materials, and carbonaceous materials affect the dispersion and activity of the metal oxide. For Cr2O3/AC, the chromium species deposit mainly on the external surface.

4. Pore accessibility: At higher loadings, Cr2O3 clusters can partially block micropores, affecting catalyst performance.

The evolution of chromium species with loading involves a transition from highly dispersed active species at low loadings to less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. The support properties influence this evolution by affecting the dispersion and accessibility of the active sites.

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on activated carbon (AC) are emphasized.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr/AC catalysts, performance improves with increasing Cr content up to 5 wt%, beyond which activity declines.

2. Dispersion and phase of active component: At low loadings, Cr species are highly dispersed and amorphous. Higher loadings lead to crystalline α-Cr2O3 formation, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: Activated carbon provides high surface area and favorable interaction with Cr species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is critical:
- Low loadings: Highly dispersed, amorphous Cr species
- Increasing loading: Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase
- Optimal loading (~5 wt%): Balance between high dispersion and sufficient active sites

The 5 wt% Cr/AC catalyst showed superior activity compared to previously studied catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, highlighting the importance of optimizing metal loading and maintaining high dispersion on the support.

文献比较了多种用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物。重点研究了负载在活性炭（AC）上的铬氧化物催化剂。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属负载量：对于Cr/AC催化剂，性能随Cr含量增加而提高，直至5 wt%，之后活性下降。

2. 活性组分的分散度和相态：低负载时，Cr物种高度分散且无定形。高负载导致结晶α-Cr2O3的形成，其脱氢活性较低。

3. 载体性质：活性炭提供高比表面积和与Cr物种的有利相互作用。

铬物种随负载量的演变至关重要：
- 低负载：高度分散的无定形Cr物种
- 负载量增加：形成结晶α-Cr2O3相
- 最佳负载量（~5 wt%）：高分散度和足够活性位点之间的平衡

5 wt% Cr/AC催化剂与先前研究的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢催化剂相比，显示出优越的活性，突出了优化金属负载量和保持载体上高分散度的重要性。
