[1] "Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2"

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn oxides. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on activated carbon (AC) are emphasized.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr/AC catalysts, performance improves with increasing Cr content up to 5 wt%, beyond which activity declines.

2. Dispersion and phase of active component: At low loadings, Cr species are highly dispersed and amorphous. Higher loadings lead to crystalline α-Cr2O3 formation, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: Activated carbon provides high surface area and favorable interaction with Cr species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is critical:
- Low loadings: Highly dispersed, amorphous Cr species
- Increasing loading: Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase
- Optimal loading (~5 wt%): Balance between high dispersion and sufficient active sites

The 5 wt% Cr/AC catalyst showed superior activity compared to previously studied catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, highlighting the importance of optimizing metal loading and maintaining high dispersion on the support.

文献比较了多种用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物。重点研究了负载在活性炭（AC）上的铬氧化物催化剂。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属负载量：对于Cr/AC催化剂，性能随Cr含量增加而提高，直至5 wt%，之后活性下降。

2. 活性组分的分散度和相态：低负载时，Cr物种高度分散且无定形。高负载导致结晶α-Cr2O3的形成，其脱氢活性较低。

3. 载体性质：活性炭提供高比表面积和与Cr物种的有利相互作用。

铬物种随负载量的演变至关重要：
- 低负载：高度分散的无定形Cr物种
- 负载量增加：形成结晶α-Cr2O3相
- 最佳负载量（~5 wt%）：高分散度和足够活性位点之间的平衡

5 wt% Cr/AC催化剂与先前研究的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢催化剂相比，显示出优越的活性，突出了优化金属负载量和保持载体上高分散度的重要性。
