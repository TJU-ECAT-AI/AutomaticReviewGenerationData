[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2"

The literature provides some insights into metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP:

Various metal oxides including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn were studied as active components for CO2-ODHP catalysts. Potassium oxide was used as a promoter.

For chromium-based catalysts, the key factors influencing performance were:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 5 wt%, then declined slightly at higher loadings. 

2. Chromium species: Formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings led to decreased activity, as this phase is less active for alkane dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support provided high surface area and microporous structure.

The 5 wt% Cr/AC catalyst showed very high activity compared to other reported catalysts. However, deactivation was observed over time, which was studied using thermal analysis methods.

The evolution of chromium species appears to be from highly dispersed CrOx at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings, with the dispersed species being more active. Support properties like high surface area likely helped maintain high dispersion up to the optimal ~5 wt% loading.

文献对CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂提供了一些见解：

研究了包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn在内的各种金属氧化物作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的活性组分。氧化钾被用作促进剂。

对于铬基催化剂，影响性能的关键因素是：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而增加，直到5 wt%，然后在更高负载时略有下降。

2. 铬物种：在更高负载时形成结晶α-Cr2O3导致活性降低，因为这种相对烷烃脱氢的活性较低。

3. 载体特性：活性炭载体提供了高比表面积和微孔结构。

5 wt% Cr/AC催化剂与其他报道的催化剂相比显示出很高的活性。然而，随时间推移观察到失活，这是通过热分析方法研究的。

铬物种的演变似乎是从低负载时的高度分散CrOx到高负载时的结晶α-Cr2O3，其中分散物种更活跃。载体的高比表面积等特性可能有助于在最佳的~5 wt%负载量之前保持高度分散。
