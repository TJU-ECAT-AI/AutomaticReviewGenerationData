[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "It is found that when the propane conversion increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed. Nevertheless, a high selectivity towards propene (>80.0%) was obtained for all the studied catalysts."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

[5] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R3c."

[6] "This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]. Therefore, it could be concluded that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based samples."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-based catalysts showing particularly high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal loading: For Cr catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt%, which provided the best balance of activity and selectivity. 

2. Dispersion of active phase: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for good catalytic performance. As loading increases beyond the optimal level, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support played an important role in achieving high activity, likely due to its high surface area and presence of oxygen-containing surface groups.

4. Reaction conditions: Higher temperatures increased conversion but decreased selectivity to propene. The presence of CO2 improved both conversion and selectivity compared to inert atmosphere.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from highly dispersed Cr at low loadings to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher loadings (>5 wt%). This transition correlates with a decrease in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of maintaining high Cr dispersion for optimal performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn已被用于CO2-ODHP测试,其中Cr基催化剂显示出特别高的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 金属负载量:对于Cr催化剂,最佳负载量约为5 wt%,在活性和选择性之间提供了最佳平衡。

2. 活性相的分散度:高度分散的铬物种对于良好的催化性能至关重要。当负载量超过最佳水平时,会形成结晶α-Cr2O3相,这对脱氢反应的活性较低。

3. 载体性质:活性炭载体在实现高活性方面起着重要作用,这可能是由于其高比表面积和含氧表面基团的存在。

4. 反应条件:较高的温度会增加转化率但降低丙烯的选择性。与惰性气氛相比,CO2的存在改善了转化率和选择性。

随着负载量的变化,铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高度分散Cr到高负载时(>5 wt%)的结晶α-Cr2O3的转变。这种转变与催化活性的降低相关,突出了保持高Cr分散度对于最佳性能的重要性。
