[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."

[2] "The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]."

[4] "It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been tested for CO2-ODHP, with potassium oxide used as a promoter. For chromium-based catalysts, key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal level (around 5 wt% in this study), then declines with further loading.

2. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings, Cr exists in an amorphous state. As loading increases, crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase forms, which is less active for dehydrogenation.

3. Support properties: The active carbon support provides high surface area and likely contributes to activity through surface oxygen groups.

4. Dispersion: High dispersion of chromium species is important for maximizing activity.

The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst showed very high activity compared to other reported catalysts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the active carbon support for this reaction. However, the optimal Cr loading and dispersion is crucial, as excess Cr leads to inactive crystalline phases and reduced performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物已被用于CO2-ODHP测试,同时使用氧化钾作为助剂。对于铬基催化剂,影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 铬负载量:活性随铬含量增加而提高,达到最佳水平(本研究中约为5 wt%)后,进一步增加负载量会导致活性下降。

2. 铬物种演变:在低负载量时,铬以无定形状态存在。随着负载量增加,形成结晶α-Cr2O3相,该相对脱氢反应的活性较低。

3. 载体性质:活性炭载体提供高比表面积,其表面含氧基团可能对活性有贡献。

4. 分散度:铬物种的高度分散对最大化活性很重要。

Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂显示出比其他报道的催化剂更高的活性,证明了活性炭载体对该反应的有效性。然而,最佳铬负载量和分散度至关重要,因为过量的铬会导致无活性的结晶相形成,从而降低性能。
