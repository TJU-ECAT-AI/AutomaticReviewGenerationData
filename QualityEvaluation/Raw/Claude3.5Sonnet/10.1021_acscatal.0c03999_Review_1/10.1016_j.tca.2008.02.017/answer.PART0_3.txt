[1] "Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter. Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."

[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr."

[3] "It should therefore be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support. The formed clusters and crystallites of Cr2O3 partially block an access to the micropores."

[4] "The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation."

Various metal oxide catalysts including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn oxides have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide showing particularly promising results. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal oxide loading: For Cr2O3/AC catalysts, the optimal loading was found to be around 5 wt% Cr. Higher loadings led to decreased activity.

2. Dispersion of active phase: Highly dispersed chromium species are more active than crystalline Cr2O3. At higher loadings, formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 decreases activity.

3. Support properties: Various supports including inorganic oxides, mesoporous materials, and carbonaceous materials affect the dispersion and activity of the metal oxide. For Cr2O3/AC, the chromium species deposit mainly on the external surface.

4. Pore accessibility: At higher loadings, Cr2O3 clusters can partially block micropores, affecting catalyst performance.

The evolution of chromium species with loading involves a transition from highly dispersed active species at low loadings to less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. The support properties influence this evolution by affecting the dispersion and accessibility of the active sites.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr和Zn氧化物，都被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬氧化物显示出特别有promising的结果。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物负载量：对于Cr2O3/AC催化剂，最佳负载量约为5 wt% Cr。更高的负载量会导致活性降低。

2. 活性相的分散度：高度分散的铬物种比晶态Cr2O3更活跃。在更高的负载量下，晶态-Cr2O3的形成会降低活性。

3. 载体性质：各种载体，包括无机氧化物、介孔材料和碳质材料，会影响金属氧化物的分散性和活性。对于Cr2O3/AC，铬物种主要沉积在外表面。

4. 孔隙可及性：在更高的负载量下，Cr2O3团簇可能会部分阻塞微孔，影响催化剂性能。

随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变过程涉及从低负载量时的高度分散活性物种，到高负载量时较不活跃的晶态Cr2O3的转变。载体性质通过影响活性位点的分散性和可及性来影响这一演变过程。
