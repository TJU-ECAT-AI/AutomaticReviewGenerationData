[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) is strongly influenced by the nature of the support and chromium loading. Key factors include:

1. Support material: Siliceous supports (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) enhance propene yield, while Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports inhibit the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Chromium loading: Lower chromium content generally leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: The evolution of chromium species depends on loading and support properties. On silica supports:
   - At low Cr content: Deep reduction to Cr2+ is promoted, as Cr3+ migration to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow.
   - At higher Cr content: Reduction produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its stability.

4. Redox behavior: The ability of chromium species to undergo redox cycles (e.g., Cr3+ to Cr2+ and back) appears to be important for catalytic activity, especially at lower chromium loadings.

These factors collectively influence the activity and selectivity of supported Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, with silica-supported low-loading catalysts generally showing better performance due to their enhanced redox properties and interaction with CO2.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的催化性能受到载体性质和铬含量的强烈影响。关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：硅质载体（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）能提高丙烯产率，而Al2O3或ZrO2载体则抑制脱氢反应。

2. 铬含量：较低的铬含量通常导致CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用更大。

3. 铬的氧化态：铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在硅质载体上：
   - 低铬含量时：由于Cr3+迁移形成稳定Cr2O3簇的速度较慢，促进了深度还原至Cr2+。
   - 高铬含量时：还原产生Cr2O3后停止，因为Cr2O3很稳定。

4. 氧化还原行为：铬物种进行氧化还原循环（如Cr3+到Cr2+再返回）的能力似乎对催化活性很重要，特别是在低铬含量时。

这些因素共同影响了负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，其中硅质载体上低负载量的催化剂由于其增强的氧化还原性质和与CO2的相互作用，通常表现出更好的性能。
