[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) vary significantly depending on the type of support and chromium loading:

1. Support effects: Chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience an inhibiting effect from CO2.

2. Chromium loading: The promoting effect of CO2 increases with decreasing chromium content on silica-supported catalysts. This is attributed to the evolution of chromium species at different loadings.

3. Evolution of chromium species: At low Cr content on silica, deep reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ is promoted due to slow migration and formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters. At higher Cr contents, reduction primarily produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its stability.

4. Role of CO2: In CO2-ODHP, CO2 acts as a diluent, heating medium, and oxidant, influencing the catalytic performance.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the support, chromium loading, and the resulting chromium species formed on the catalyst surface. The interplay between these factors determines the overall activity and selectivity of the catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的活性和选择性因支撑体类型和铬负载量而显著不同：

1. 支撑体效应：在含二氧化硅材料（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）上负载的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下表现出增强的丙烯产率。相比之下，在Al2O3或ZrO2上负载的铬氧化物催化剂受到CO2的抑制作用。

2. 铬负载量：在硅支撑的催化剂上，CO2的促进作用随着铬含量的降低而增加。这归因于不同负载量下铬物种的演变。

3. 铬物种的演变：在硅上低铬含量时，由于Cr2O3稳定簇的缓慢迁移和形成，Cr3+到Cr2+的深度还原得到促进。在较高铬含量下，还原主要生成Cr2O3，然后由于其稳定性而停止。

4. CO2的作用：在CO2-ODHP中，CO2作为稀释剂、加热介质和氧化剂，影响催化性能。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括支撑体的性质、铬负载量以及由此在催化剂表面形成的铬物种。这些因素之间的相互作用决定了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体活性和选择性。

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) is strongly influenced by the nature of the support and chromium loading. Key factors include:

1. Support material: Siliceous supports (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) enhance propene yield, while Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports inhibit the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Chromium loading: Lower chromium content generally leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield.

3. Oxidation state of chromium: The evolution of chromium species depends on loading and support properties. On silica supports:
   - At low Cr content: Deep reduction to Cr2+ is promoted, as Cr3+ migration to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow.
   - At higher Cr content: Reduction produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its stability.

4. Redox behavior: The ability of chromium species to undergo redox cycles (e.g., Cr3+ to Cr2+ and back) appears to be important for catalytic activity, especially at lower chromium loadings.

These factors collectively influence the activity and selectivity of supported Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, with silica-supported low-loading catalysts generally showing better performance due to their enhanced redox properties and interaction with CO2.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的催化性能受到载体性质和铬含量的强烈影响。关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：硅质载体（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）能提高丙烯产率，而Al2O3或ZrO2载体则抑制脱氢反应。

2. 铬含量：较低的铬含量通常导致CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用更大。

3. 铬的氧化态：铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在硅质载体上：
   - 低铬含量时：由于Cr3+迁移形成稳定Cr2O3簇的速度较慢，促进了深度还原至Cr2+。
   - 高铬含量时：还原产生Cr2O3后停止，因为Cr2O3很稳定。

4. 氧化还原行为：铬物种进行氧化还原循环（如Cr3+到Cr2+再返回）的能力似乎对催化活性很重要，特别是在低铬含量时。

这些因素共同影响了负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，其中硅质载体上低负载量的催化剂由于其增强的氧化还原性质和与CO2的相互作用，通常表现出更好的性能。

1. Nature of support: Siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) as supports for chromium oxide catalysts enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports have an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Chromium loading: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as chromium content decreases. This is related to the evolution of chromium species at different loadings.

These factors influence the catalytic performance by affecting the oxidation state and dispersion of chromium species, which in turn impacts the catalyst's ability to activate CO2 and facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. The balance between these factors determines the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst for CO2-ODHP.

这些因素通过影响铬物种的氧化态和分散度来影响催化性能，进而影响催化剂活化CO2和促进脱氢反应的能力。这些因素之间的平衡决定了催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的整体活性和选择性。

3. 氧化还原行为：负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在硅胶表面，特别是在低铬含量时，铬物种到Cr2+的深度还原被促进。这是因为Cr3+物种迁移形成稳定Cr2O3团簇的过程较慢，允许进一步还原为Cr2+。在较高的铬含量下，还原产生Cr2O3后就会停止，这是由于Cr2O3的高稳定性。
