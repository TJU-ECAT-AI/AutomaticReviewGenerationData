[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) varies significantly based on several key factors:

1. Nature of support: Chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience an inhibiting effect from CO2.

2. Chromium loading: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as chromium content decreases. This is measured by the ratio of propene yield in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere.

3. Redox behavior: The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. On silica surfaces, especially at low Cr content, deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. This is because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, allowing further reduction to Cr2+. At higher Cr contents, reduction produces Cr2O3 and then stops due to its high stability.

These factors collectively influence the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP. The ability of CO2 to act not only as a diluent and heating medium but also as an oxidant plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, particularly for silica-supported chromium catalysts with low Cr content.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的催化性能因几个关键因素而显著不同：

1. 载体性质：在二氧化碳存在下，负载在含硅材料（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）上的铬氧化物催化剂显示出增强的丙烯产率。相比之下，负载在Al2O3或ZrO2上的铬氧化物催化剂受到CO2的抑制作用。

2. 铬负载量：对于硅胶负载的铬氧化物催化剂，随着铬含量的降低，CO2的促进作用增强。这是通过CO2中丙烯产率与惰性气体氛围中丙烯产率的比值来衡量的。

3. 氧化还原行为：负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在硅胶表面，特别是在低铬含量时，铬物种到Cr2+的深度还原被促进。这是因为Cr3+物种迁移形成稳定Cr2O3团簇的过程较慢，允许进一步还原为Cr2+。在较高的铬含量下，还原产生Cr2O3后就会停止，这是由于Cr2O3的高稳定性。

这些因素共同影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。CO2不仅作为稀释剂和加热介质，还作为氧化剂的能力在反应机理中起着关键作用，特别是对于低铬含量的硅胶负载铬催化剂。
