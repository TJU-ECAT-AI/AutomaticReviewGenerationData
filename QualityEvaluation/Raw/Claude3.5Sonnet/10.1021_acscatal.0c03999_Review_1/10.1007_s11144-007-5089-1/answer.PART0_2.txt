[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) varies significantly based on several key factors:

1. Nature of support: Siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) as supports for chromium oxide catalysts enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports have an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Chromium loading: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as chromium content decreases. This is related to the evolution of chromium species at different loadings.

3. Redox behavior: At low chromium content on silica, deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. This is because the migration of Cr3+ to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, allowing further reduction to Cr2+. At higher chromium loadings, reduction stops at Cr2O3 due to its stability.

These factors influence the catalytic performance by affecting the oxidation state and dispersion of chromium species, which in turn impacts the catalyst's ability to activate CO2 and facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. The balance between these factors determines the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst for CO2-ODHP.

金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行的丙烷氧化脱氢）中的活性和选择性因几个关键因素而显著变化：

1. 载体性质：以硅质材料（硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体，可在CO2存在下提高丙烯产率。相反，Al2O3或ZrO2载体对脱氢反应有抑制作用。

2. 铬负载量：对于硅胶负载的铬氧化物催化剂，随着铬含量的减少，CO2的促进作用增强。这与不同负载量下铬物种的演变有关。

3. 氧化还原行为：在硅胶上低铬含量时，促进铬物种深度还原为Cr2+。这是因为Cr3+迁移形成稳定Cr2O3簇的过程较慢，允许进一步还原为Cr2+。在高铬负载量时，由于Cr2O3的稳定性，还原在Cr2O3停止。

这些因素通过影响铬物种的氧化态和分散度来影响催化性能，进而影响催化剂活化CO2和促进脱氢反应的能力。这些因素之间的平衡决定了催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的整体活性和选择性。
