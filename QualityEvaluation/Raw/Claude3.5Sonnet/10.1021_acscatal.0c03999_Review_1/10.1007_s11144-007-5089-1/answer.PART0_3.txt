[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."

[2] "Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]."

[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]."

The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2) varies significantly depending on the support material and chromium loading:

1. Support material effect: Chromium oxide catalysts supported on siliceous materials (e.g., silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2. In contrast, Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience an inhibiting effect from CO2.

2. Chromium loading effect: For silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 increases as the chromium content decreases. This is related to the evolution of chromium species on the support surface.

3. Evolution of chromium species: At low Cr content on silica, deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted. This is because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, allowing further reduction to Cr2+. At higher Cr contents, reduction stops at Cr2O3 due to its high stability.

4. Role of CO2: In this process, CO2 acts not only as a diluent and heating medium but also as an oxidant, influencing the redox behavior of the catalyst.

These factors collectively contribute to the catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP, with the nature of the support and the chromium loading being key determinants of the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的活性和选择性因载体材料和铬负载量的不同而显著变化：

1. 载体材料效应：负载在含硅材料（如硅胶、MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）上的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下表现出增强的丙烯产率。相比之下，负载在Al2O3或ZrO2上的铬氧化物催化剂受到CO2的抑制作用。

2. 铬负载量效应：对于负载在二氧化硅上的铬氧化物催化剂，CO2的促进作用随着铬含量的降低而增加。这与载体表面铬物种的演变有关。

3. 铬物种的演变：在二氧化硅上铬含量低时，铬物种深度还原为Cr2+的过程得到促进。这是因为Cr3+物种迁移形成稳定的Cr2O3簇的过程较慢，允许进一步还原为Cr2+。在较高的铬含量下，由于Cr2O3的高稳定性，还原过程在Cr2O3阶段停止。

4. CO2的作用：在这个过程中，CO2不仅作为稀释剂和加热介质，还作为氧化剂，影响催化剂的氧化还原行为。

这些因素共同影响CO2-ODHP的催化性能，其中载体的性质和铬的负载量是决定催化剂活性和选择性的关键因素。
