Highly dispersed chromium oxide-modiﬁed mesoporous ZrO2 (xCrAZrO2) was prepared via an acid–base
pair pathway and evaporation-induced self-assembly method for the dehydrogenation of propane reac-
tion with CO2. The resulting materials exhibit mesoporous structure and different zirconia crystals with
doped chromium species. Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abun-
dant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity
among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained. The following conclu-
sions were drawn by utilizing the in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy and discrete Fourier transform
calculations to investigate the structure of chromium species, the redox reaction path, and the formation
of coke under real reaction conditions. The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are
denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction. The fore-
most effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation
route is proposed.

1. Introduction
The selective oxidation of light alkanes is of fundamental and
industrial signiﬁcance because they provide a potential route for
effectively transforming alkanes into value-added and useful
chemicals for effective utilization of abundant natural gas and
shale gas resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODHP) to propylene has attracted considerable attention [1–5].
The activation of inert CAH bonds of propane requires energy-
intensive conditions, which easily lead to combustion pathways
of more reactive oleﬁns to COx during the ODHP [5–8]. Recently,
carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for
catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to oleﬁns,
has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the
lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction
toward more oleﬁn production, which means that more reactive
oleﬁns are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2
[9,10]. Meanwhile, the effective utilization of greenhouse gases
(CO2) has a positive effect on the global ecosystem and climate
because it offers the potential to create new commercially viable
products from renewable carbon feedstock in a sustainable
manner.
A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reac-
tion with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and
chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides
have been veriﬁed to have especially high activity [11–15]. Fur-
thermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsat-
urated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more
active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]. Wu
et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally pre-
pared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+
species. On the other hand, the nature of CO2 interaction with dis-
persed chromium species on different supports (SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2,
zeolites, etc.) is obviously different. But for the mixed Cr2O3AZrO2
oxide catalysts, CO2 has positive effect on the DHP reaction [17–
21]. This can be attributed to the higher density of surface basicity
due to the terminal hydroxyl groups (the strong Lewis acidity of
Zr4+ and the Lewis basicity of O2 pairs) on the ZrO2 structure,
which results in CO2 adsorption. CO2 consumes hydrogen species
through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is ben-
eﬁcial for enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion.
CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by elim-

inating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction [22,23]. It is
now generally considered that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+
sites act as active sites in the dehydrogenation of propane without
oxygen [7], while Tatiana et al. proposed that surface coordina-
tively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) of bulk binary CrZrOx
catalysts are also active sites for nonoxidative PDH [24–26]. But
no research has demonstrated that Zrcus are also responsible for
DHP with CO2.
The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it
possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions.
Michorczyk et al. [27] investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through
in situ UV–vis DRS. Pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and
Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important
role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The
Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at
the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C [15,28]. The Cr3+
and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative
oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. [21] pro-
posed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the
redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. At present, the valence of chromium
species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and
there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under
the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for
the ZrO2-based catalysts.
Here, we demonstrate a novel direct and facile method for
preparing
a
highly
dispersed
chromium
oxide-species-
incorporated mesoporous tetragonal ZrO2. The general synthesis
strategy is based on an acid–base pair pathway combined with
evaporation-induced self-assembly [29,30]. The objective of the
present study was to investigate the relationships between Cr con-
tent, structural changes, and catalytic performance for DHP with
CO2. The reaction path and the source of byproducts were
researched. As in situ Raman spectroscopy can study the molecular
structures of active sites and the surface coking dynamically
responds to reaction environments [5,31–34], we used in situ/-
operando Raman spectroscopy to investigate other important
issues: the real state, redox properties, and structural changes of
the active sites under different reaction conditions. The foremost
effect of CO2 for inhibiting deactivation under real reaction condi-
tions was preventing reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke
formation rather than eliminating coke. A new coke formation
route was also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis method
A simple way in which the self-adjusted inorganic–inorganic
(II) interplay between two inorganic precursors is guided by
acid–base chemistry considerations [29,30]. Here triblock copoly-
mers (Pluronic P123, Mav = 5800, EO20PO70EO20, Aldrich) were
used as templates to prepare highly ordered mesoporous minerals
with much smaller pore sizes and thinner pore walls. Then quanti-
tative Cr(CH3COO)3 (99%, Beijing Chem. Corp., China) and ZrOCl2-
8H2O (99%, Beijing Chem. Corp., China) were added into alcohol
solution with P123 (total amount of Cr and Zr is 10 mmol). All
the chemicals were commercially available and used without fur-
ther puriﬁcation. After being stirred at least 2 h at 50 C, the homo-
geneous sol was transferred to an oven at the desired temperature
and humidity for solvent evaporation. After 24 h aging, the gel pro-
duct was dried at 80 C for 24 h. Calcination was carried out by
slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 550 C
and heating at 550 C in air for 6 h. The samples were labeled as
xCrAZrO2 (xCr), where  denotes the Cr content (Cr:(Cr + Zr)
= x:100, molar ratio).
2.2. Catalyst general characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical
Empyrean power diffraction system using CuKa radiation (40 kV,
30 mA) in the 2h interval 5–90 for wide angle analysis with a step
size of 0.02. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 196 C
were recorded using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 porosimeter. The
speciﬁc surface area was calculated by the BET (Brunauer–Emme
tt–Teller) method; the pore-size distribution was calculated from
the desorption branch of the isotherm using the BJH (Barett–Joy
ner–Halenda) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope.
To explore the element distribution mapping on the samples, an
analytical high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) scanning trans-
mission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-
ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used. X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS) were recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrome-
ter using MgKa (hv = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.603  1019 J) X-ray
source. The fresh catalyst undergoes OPH with CO2 (550 C) for
5 h or exposure to H2 (H2/N2 = 1:9, total ﬂow 5 ml/min) at 550 C
for 1 h, denoted as spent and reduced catalyst, respectively.
Temperature-programmed
reduction
with
H2
(H2
TPR)
and
temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3 TPD) were car-
ried out on a Quantachrome apparatus. H2 and the NH3 desorption
signal was monitored by TCD.
2.3. In situ Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectra were obtained using a high-resolution
Raman spectrometry system (Renishaw inVia Reﬂex, excitation
wavelength at 532 nm). The sample was mounted in an in situ cell
with a quartz window (Xiamen Tops Instrument Co.), which allows
treatments at a desired temperature and gas ﬂow. The samples
were taken at 550 C for 1 h in 10% O2/Ar. The sample was then
cooled to room temperature in O2/Ar for Raman measurement. This
process is called pretreatment.
In situ Raman spectra under reduction and oxidation atmo-
spheres at 550 C were obtained in sequence as follows. The sam-
ples were kept at 550 C under pure Ar after pretreatment.
Subsequently, the gas was switched to 0.1% H2/Ar for the required
time as the A step. In the B step, the CO2 gas ﬂow was opened and
the 2% H2/4%CO2/Ar gas was kept ﬂowing. Then CO2 gas was closed
and the gas ﬂow was switched to 5% H2/Ar for required time as the
C step. Finally, in the D step, H2 gas ﬂow was closed and the gas
ﬂow was switched to 2% O2/Ar. At every stage (the total ﬂow was
50 ml min1), the spectra were recorded at relevant time intervals.
For further investigation of coke formation of trace CO2 under
H2, 5% H2/Ar was continued after pretreatment and small amounts
of CO2 were pulsed at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 550 C. We recorded
the spectrum at each temperature after 1 h.
For operando Raman spectra under real reaction conditions as a
function of time on stream, the samples were purged with O2 and
Ar at 550 C for 30 min sequentially. The 2% CO2/1% C3H8/Ar mix-
ture gases were introduced into the cell and then held at a constant
ﬂow rate during spectral acquisition. To research the elimination of
coke under CO2, 5% CO2/Ar and 10% CO2/Ar ﬂows were introduced
into the cell with the spent catalysts.
2.4. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic performance of the catalysts was tested in a ﬁxed-
bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and at 550 C. The par-
ticle size of the catalysts was 60–80 mesh. Then 200 mg of the cat-
alyst was placed in the reactor tube (internal diameter 6 mm) and
pretreated with O2/N2 gas at 550 C for 30 min, followed by purg-
ing with pure N2 at the same temperature. The composition of the
Z. Xie et al. / Journal of Catalysis 372 (2019) 206–216
207
reactant gas mixture was C3H8/CO2/N2 = 1:2:37, and the total ﬂow
was 20 ml min1. The reactants and products were analyzed by on-
line gas chromatographs equipped with two ﬂame ionization
detectors (FID). A Porapak Q column (3 m) was used for the sepa-
ration of acrolein, propanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, C3H6, C3H8,
C2H4, C2H6, and CH4. Separation of other components, such as
HCHO, CO, and CO2, was carried out in a TDX-01 column, and then
in a nickel-based high-temperature furnace (turning the oxide into
CH4) before the detector.
3. Results
3.1. Highly dispersed chromium oxide-modiﬁed ZrO2 materials with
mesoporous structure
The wide-angle XRD patterns of xCrAZrO2 are represented in
Fig. 1. Both monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO2) phases
were identiﬁed in the samples with Cr loading below 5%. However,
the increasing chromium content resulted in an increase in the
fraction of t-ZrO2, and the only XRD visible phase in 7Cr-ZrO2
was t-ZrO2. Heteroatom oxide dopants in ZrO2 are well known to
distinctly improve the stabilization effect of crystallization in sev-
eral previous studies [35–36]. This is related to the formation of
oxygen vacancies for charge compensation or the distortion of
the ZrO2 lattice. More Cr species incorporated into ZrO2 lattice
may lead to destroying the tetragonal crystalline form and forming
disordered ZrO2, which was conﬁrmed by the weakening of the
characteristic peak of the t-ZrO2 phase. No diffraction peaks
related to separate CrOx-based phase(s) were found in any incorpo-
rated samples, which indirectly conﬁrms the incorporation of chro-
mium ions into the zirconia lattice, the low quantity of chromium
oxide, and/or its high dispersion on the support.
Furthermore, we utilized Raman spectroscopy in combination
with the XRD patterns to determine the surface structure and mor-
phology of xCrAZrO2 samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the m-ZrO2 pre-
sents very well deﬁned peaks compared with t-ZrO2, and the
intense peaks for m-ZrO2 are located at 178, 189, and 476 cm1
(characteristic peak of the monoclinic phase), while weak peaks
of xCrAZrO2 (x > 3) are located at 146, 262, 313, 459, and
630 cm1, plus one shoulder at ca. 560 cm1, which can be
assigned to the characteristic peaks of tetragonal-phase ZrO2. With
increasing chromium content, more chromium was incorporated
into the ZrO2 phase to form CrZrOx solid solutions, resulting in
phase transformation from m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2 [37–39]. For the
Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface, only
two surface Cr6+ species were observed without Cr2O3 crystal clus-
ters: a polymeric species (possessing a Cr@O stretching frequency
at 1009 cm1 and a CrAOACr bending mode at 885 cm1) and a
monomeric species (characterized by a Cr@O stretching frequency
at 1033 cm1) [40–41]. The peak intensities of these two kinds of
Cr6+ species increase with increasing chromium content, but the
peak intensities become weaken and move to low Raman shift
when the Cr content exceeds 7%, probably indicating the formation
of more polymeric Cr6+ species on the disordered ZrO2.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribu-
tion of the xCrAZrO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3. The isotherms of
the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are more similar to a type IV isotherm and
exhibit a type H2 hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop shifted to
low pressure of the relative pressure range as more doping chro-
mium was introduced into the ZrO2. The pore size distribution of
xCrAZrO2 samples becomes more concentrated and the average
pore size decreases with increasing chromium content. The incor-
poration of chromium into zirconia distinctly improves the surface
area, pore volume, and pore-size distribution, as summarized in
Table 1. Well-developed mesoporous structures with tetragonal
crystalline walls and pore necking in the 3D faulted structure are
expected to provide enhanced catalytic performance due to high
surface area and proper ZrO2 crystallization [30].
The TEM images in Fig. 4 conﬁrm that the xCrAZrO2 (x > 3) sam-
ples contains three-dimensional wormhole-like channels. The pore
size, as determined from TEM images, is in good agreement with
the average pore size from the BJH result. To examine the disper-
sion of chromium oxide, TEM images and EDS elemental line and
mapping analyses of the 7CrAZrO2 were used (Fig. S1 in the Sup-
plementary Material). From these 2D atomic mapping images, we
can conﬁrm that the chromium oxide is highly dispersed through-
out mesoporous t-ZrO2 structure without the formation of a large
bulk state of chromium oxide. This is also consistent with the
XRD and Raman results for 7CrAZrO2. As the HR-TEM image
(Fig. S2) shows, the dominant exposed planes of the t-ZrO2 support
are 111 and 220 facets, which further conﬁrms the single tetrago-
nal crystal form [42].
The XPS spectra of xCrAZrO2 are shown in Fig. 5. The Cr/(Zr + Cr)
atomic ratios of xCrAZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts were deter-
mined by XPS in the near-surface region. It was from 0.05 to 0.21
for xCrAZrO2 and enormously different from the corresponding
nominal values of 0.01 to 0.1 (Table 1). The concentration of Cr
on the surface of xCrAZrO2 is all higher than that in the bulk phase.
The XPS results indicate the enrichment of Cr on the surface, and
some parts of Cr are incorporated into the ZrO2 structure to form

a solid solution, which transfers the crystalline phase of ZrO2. Two
peaks occurred for Cr2p3/2 spectra on all catalysts, one at 577 eV
and the other at 579 eV, which can be assigned to Cr3+ and
Cr6+, respectively [43]. The binding energy (BE) values of Cr2p3/2
peaks were obtained by applying a peak-ﬁtting program and the
peak area ratio of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is given in Table 1. The
BE values for Cr3+ and Cr6+ on all catalysts were very similar. The
Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the
increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio.
3.2. Redox and acidic/basic properties
Fig. 6 shows the H2 TPR proﬁles of xCr ZrO2 samples. The tem-
perature (TmaxH2) of maximal consumption of hydrogen for each
catalyst is listed in Table 1. Bare zirconia [44] demonstrated only
a small hydrogen uptake above 620 C. This can be ascribed to
hydrogen reaction with lattice oxygen of zirconia. The strong sig-
nals of hydrogen consumption are around 330 C and the intensity
of the peak increases with chromium content, which should be
related to the reduction of Cr6+. There are weak peaks of hydrogen
consumption between 400 and 450 C. The position of the peak
shifts to lower temperatures with chromium content. Hence, the
second peak can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface
lattice oxygen of zirconia [26]. Removal of lattice oxygen from zir-
conia forms Zrcus.
NH3 TPD experiments were carried out to investigated the acid
properties of the series of xCrAZrO2, catalysts and the results are
shown in Fig. 7. For all the samples, a broad desorption peak of
NH3 was observed in a temperature range between 120 and
500 C. The weak, medium, and strong acidic sites characterized
by NH3 desorption maxima at 202–231, 235–304, and 317–
403 C, respectively, could be identiﬁed for all ZrO2-based materi-
als according to several previous studies [45]. Bare ZrO2 had large
fractions of strong and medium acidic sites characterized by
ammonia desorption above 230 C. With increasing of chromium
doping amount, the main peak shifted to lower temperatures. This
is because the surface polymerized chromium species covers the
strong acid sites of zirconia, generating weak acid sites by itself.
As shown in Fig. S11, the amount of CO2 adsorption increased
with the doping of Cr species and with increasing Cr content.
Moreover, the desorption temperature of the CO2 peak shifted to
higher temperature. So surface basic sites increased with Cr species
doping. From calculated apparent TOF results, TOF(CO2) and TOF
(C3O8) both increased with the Cr content (x < 10, xCrAZrO2). The
basic site facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2, thereby
promoting propane dehydrogenation.
3.3. Catalytic performance
The results of time on stream for propane conversion, CO2 con-
version, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield are given in
Fig. 8. The propane and CO2 conversion both increased as the chro-
mium content (x) of xCrAZrO2 was raised from 1 to 7, but
decreased when  increased further from 7 to 10 at the same
stream time. All the xCrAZrO2 (x > 1) catalysts gave an initial con-
version above 65%. For the 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst, the deactivation rate
was lowest and the highest propane conversion was maintained
for the entire reaction time.

The regenerative cycles of the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are repre-
sented in Fig. S3. The propylene yield on the catalyst decreased
from 40% to 27% after 300 min on stream in the ﬁrst cycle. The
regeneration step was carried out with an O2 stream at 550 C
for 0.5 h to reoxidize the reduced active chromium species and
combust deposited carbon. After the second and third regenera-
tion, the propylene yield returned to 40%, indicating that the orig-
inal activity of the catalyst was fully recovered.
Fig. 8C and Fig. S4A and B show propylene, methane, and CO
selectivity versus reaction time for the series of xCrAZrO2 catalysts.
In the same initial reaction time, the selectivity for propylene
increased ﬁrst and then decreased as the chromium species
increased, while the methane selectivity was just the opposite. It
is interesting that CH4 was the main cracking product over all
the xCrAZrO2 catalysts in the DHP reaction with CO2, while the
total selectivity for C2H6 and C2H4 was below 2%. The selectivity
for CO was almost the same for all xCrAZrO2 catalysts, around
20% at the initial reaction time, and basically did not change with
the reaction time.
3.4. In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements
In situ techniques for the characterization of catalysts can pro-
vide information on the structure of surface species by probing the
vibrational properties of different bonds under in situ conditions.
Therefore, direct correlations can be established between the
structures of active sites and active performance under different
conditions.33
Fig. S5A gives the Raman spectra of the 7CrAZrO2 sample col-
lected at 550 C under 0.1% H2/Ar gas ﬂows. The extent of reduction
of the surface chromium species is reﬂected in the Raman intensity
of the Cr@O bonds [46]. The bands at 871 and 1007 cm1 disap-
pear more quickly than the bands at 1031 cm1. This indicates
that the polymeric Cr6+ species are reduced more easily and rapidly
than the monomeric Cr6+ species. This result is consistent with the
results reported by Baek et al. that polymeric Cr6+ species, which
are more easily reducible to oligomeric Cr3+ species than isolated
Cr6+ species, exhibits a higher turnover frequency than isolated
Cr3+ sites [16,32,33].3
To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas ﬂow-
ing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when
CO2 gas ﬂow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up
to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned
to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [46–48]), and they
become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C. These
results demonstrate that the trace amount of adsorbed CO2 reacted
with abundant adsorbed atomic hydrogen species to become coke
species. But the large amount of CO2 reacted with hydrogen spe-
cies, and no coke species formed.

The reoxidation of the reduced chromium oxide species and the
elimination of coke can easily be realized in the presence of low
concentrations of oxygen. As Fig. S5D shows, the intensities of
the bands at about 1395 and 1595 cm1 decrease ﬁrst; then the
bands at 871, 1007, and 1031 cm1 appear, and their intensities
increase after 7 min at 550 C under 2% O2/Ar gas ﬂows. This indi-
cates that the presence of oxygen ﬁrst eliminates the coke and then
regenerates reduced chromium oxide species back to the initial
oxidized state, probably because the coke species cover the
reduced chromium oxide species. Moreover, the intensity of the
bands at 1030 cm1 increases more quickly than that of the
bands at 871 and 1007 cm1. Especially at 10 min, the peak area
of isolated Cr6+ species is larger than that of polymeric Cr6+ species.
This indicates that some monomeric Cr6+ species are oxidized more
easily and rapidly than the polymeric Cr6+ species.
4. Discussion
4.1. The relationship of the structural changes and the catalytic
performance of DHP to CO2
According to the above XPS, BET, Raman, and other characteri-
zation results, on one hand, the surface area of xCrAZrO2 and the
proportion of tetragonal crystals gradually increase along with
the doping Cr content, both of which are favorable for exposing
and dispersing reactive sites. On the other hand, more oligomeric
Cr6+ species are dispersed on the surface of t-ZrO2, and there are
also some isolated chromium species doped into the zirconia lat-
tice (change of zirconia crystalline phase) and supported on the
surface of t-ZrO2. Jayeon et al. [16] reported that the coordinatively
unsaturated Cr3+ species from the reduction of initial polymeric
Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of the initial isolated
Cr6+ species, in accordance with the activity performance of
xCrAZrO2. The further increasing of the doping amount of chro-
mium species leads to excessive polymerization of chromium spe-
cies (fewer active pseudo-Cr2O3 species) on the surface of zirconia,
according to Raman characterization analysis. It is also certiﬁed by
the calculated apparent TOFs for the yield of propylene as function
of Cr surface density (Fig. 9). The highest TOF (C3H6) is obtained on
7CrAZrO2.
With chromium species increasing, the strong acid sites of zir-
conia carriers were covered, while the numbers of weak acid sites
of surface oligochromium species and isolated chromium species
are increased, which is beneﬁcial to inhibiting coke and converting
propane. For the 1CrAZrO2 catalyst with less chromium doping,
the selectivity of propylene increases ﬁrst and then decreases with
the reaction time. This is due to the fact that the chromium species
ﬁrst deactivates for coke and for abundant exposed zirconia with
low DHP activity. Moreover, its intrinsic propene selectivity is
lower [26]. For all the xCrAZrO2 (x > 1) catalysts, propylene selec-
tivity increases with reaction time, because the overactive chro-
mium species are gradually covered by coke with time on
stream. This is illustrated by the results of the increasing coke
selectivity of all xCrAZrO2 catalysts with reaction time in Fig. S4C.
4.2. The main structure of active sites under real reaction condition
and the redox reaction path
According to a previous report, this promoting effect can be
rationalized by CO2 play some role in three aspects [6]: (1) the con-
sumption of H2 produced by the dehydrogenation of propane via a
reverse water-gas shift reaction, (2) the direct participation of CO2
in the ODP reaction, and (3) the elimination of coke to stabilize the
catalysts. The reactions are as follows:
C3H8 $ C3H6 + H2,
ð1Þ
CO2 + H2 $ CO + H2O,

C3H8 + CO2 $ C3H6 + CO + H2O,
ð3Þ
CO2 + C $ 2CO.
ð4Þ
To investigate the role of CO2 in the DHP reaction, the catalytic
tests on fresh 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst using C3H8/N2 and C3H8/CO2/N2
feeds were compared. The results, shown in Fig. 10, clearly demon-
strate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the conversion
of propane, but slightly reduced the selectivity of propylene after
1 h reaction. The catalyst was deactivated more slowly in the pres-
ence of CO2, which proves that CO2 plays a promoting role in the
ODP reaction over the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. There are few
reports about the structure of chromium species under the real
reaction conditions of DHP with CO2 reaction. So we used operando
Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations to identify the possible
Cr species under real reaction conditions and designed experi-
ments to investigate the redox reaction path on the active sites.

4.2.1. Operando Raman spectroscopic studies of Cr species
To investigate the change of the catalyst surface under real
reaction conditions with time on stream, the operando Raman
spectra were recorded. Fig. 11 shows the in-site Raman spectra
of a 7CrAZrO2 sample collected at 550 C under 1% C3H8/2% CO2/
Ar gas ﬂow, which is very similar to the real reaction conditions.
The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced during the
induction period than the monomeric Cr6+ species, which is consis-
tent with the reduction process under 0.1% H2/Ar gas ﬂow
(Fig. S5A). Fig. S7 shows the XPS characterization results, con-
trasted with the Cr2p(3/2) peak of Cr3+. The binding energy shift from
Cr3+ to Cr2+ was 1.0 eV, the peak of the reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst
at 575.5 eV can be assigned to the Cr2p(3/2) of Cr2+. So most of the
Cr6+ species of the fresh 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst was reduced to the
Cr3+ species during DHP with CO2, but it was not further reduced
to the Cr2+ species [49,50]. Michorczyk et al. [27] have shown
through in situ UV–vis DRS that pure CO2 was able to oxidize
Cr2+ to Cr3+ in a wide range of temperatures. So the coordinatively
unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalyt-
ically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no
Raman peaks of the Cr6+ species were detected after the induction
period.
Although CO2 can indeed oxidize Cr3+ to Cr6+, it takes a much
longer time and a relatively higher concentration of CO2 than the
reduction of Cr6+ species under real reaction conditions (Figs. 11
and 12). For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability
of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane. Interestingly,
some isolated Cr3+ sites are more easily oxidized to Cr6+ sites than
oligomeric Cr3+ sites under CO2/Ar, which is consistent with the
oxidation process under O2/Ar.
4.2.2. DFT calculations of Cr species
A surface model is built according to the experimental observa-
tions and DFT calculations. The most probable structures of Cr spe-
cies under real reaction conditions and redox process were
researched [51]. Fig. S8 shows side view and top view structures
of ZrO2. ZrO2 unit cells can cut out three crystal facets; we used
the dominant exposed crystal facet with the lowest surface energy
of ZrO2(1 1 1). It can be seen that the surface of ZrO2 (1 1 1)
exposes by pentacoordinated Zr atoms, dicoordinated oxygen
atoms, and tricoordinated oxygen atoms. Fig. 13 shows ZrO2 doped
with a chromium atom (ZrO2ACr, representative of isolated Cr3+
species), ZrO2 loaded with a layer of Cr2O3 (ZrO2ACr2O3, represen-
tative of oligomeric Cr3+ species), ZrO2 with an oxygen vacancy,
ZrO2ACr with an oxygen vacancy, and ZrO2ACr2O3 with an oxygen
vacancy. We found that the oxygen vacancy formation energy of
ZrO2 is 5.09 eV, but the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ZrO2-
ACr is 1.54 eV, while the oxygen vacancy formation energy of
ZrO2ACr2O3 is only 0.42 eV. This shows that doping with chro-
mium atoms facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies on
ZrO2, because electrons are more easily transferred from chro-
mium atoms to oxygen atoms. It is consistent with this the
removal of lattice oxygen from zirconia (forming Zrcus) could take
place at lower temperatures with chromium doping (Fig. 7).
The above calculation can also explain the different catalytic
performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species
and
oligomeric
Cr3+
species.
So
a
fundamental
relationship
between the physicochemical properties of 7CrAZrO2 catalysts
and the catalytic performance for the DHP reaction with CO2 is
established on the atomic and molecular level.
To compare the oxygen-getting ability of chromium atoms in
ZrO2ACr and ZrO2ACr2O3, the process of oxygen adsorption on
the oxygen vacancies (Fig. S9) was calculated. The initial bond
length of oxygen is 1.24 Å, and it is 1.34 Å after adsorption, indicat-
ing that O2 is reduced to O2
2 by Cr. To analyze the bonding nature
of the different states, a crystal orbital Hamilton population
(COHP) analysis was conducted. The bond length of Zr and O is
1.86 Å in ZrO2ACr and 1.93 Å in ZrO2ACr2O3. As the ZrAO bond
strength in ZrO2ACr is greater than that of ZrO2ACr2O3, Zr4+
cus of
ZrO2ACr chemically absorbs O2
2 and then oxidizes Cr3+ more easily.
This is consistent with the Raman results for O2 and CO2 oxidation of

reduced Cr species. From investigation of the Zrcus in Fig. S7, the Zr3d
spectrum of spent/reduced 7CrAZrO2 can be well resolved, as in the
fresh counterpart. This may further illustrate that Zr4+
cus can easily be
oxidized in the ambient environment.
According to theoretical calculations [24,52], the excess elec-
tron density is mainly localized in the anion vacancy. Thus, for
the CO2 oxidation process, ZrO2ACr and ZrO2ACr2O3 with oxygen
vacancies are likely to adsorb CO2 chemically, and then dissociate
CO2 to CO and activated oxygen. Here, the oligomeric and isolated
Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are donated as active oxidative
chromium species.
4.2.3. Redox reaction at active oxidative chromium sites under real
reaction conditions
Propane was excessively oxidized to CO (Fig. S4B), which
demonstrates that CO2 not only enhanced the equilibrium conver-
sion of propane by removing hydrogen through the RWGS reaction,
but also dissociated on the catalyst surface to generate active oxy-
gen, which participates in the redox reaction. For the apparent TOF
of 7CrAZrO2 in Fig. 9, the apparent TOF (CO2) value is almost the
same as TOF (C3H8), meaning that the rate of CO2 consuming H
species is comparable to the formation rate of H species from
DHP. So CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chro-
mium species by excessive hydrogen species.
In contrast with the reduced 7CrAZrO2 sample, the extra 30%
higher propane conversion of the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst can be
attributed to the contribution of active oxidative chromium species
(Fig. 10). The corresponding lower propylene selectivity of the
fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst can also prove that more propylene reacts
further on more active oxidative chromium species than on
reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst.
It is generally accepted that the acid sites on the surface of the
catalyst are the main factors responsible for propane cracking.
Compared with 10CrAZrO2, 7CrAZrO2 possesses a lower total den-
sity of acidic sites, but higher selectivity for CH4, which is charac-
terized by NH3 TPD (Fig. 7) and Fig. S4A. So methane is not from
simple propane cracking. To further investigate the source of CH4
and CO, we designed a catalytic performance evaluation experi-
ment in which propane was replaced by propylene under the same
reaction conditions. The results are shown in Fig.S6A. CO2 and C3H6
conversion by fresh 7CrAZrO2 is higher than that by reduced
7CrAZrO2 at initial time on-stream. This is due to propylene’s
easily reacting with active oxygen on active oxidative chromium
species. For the reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst, propylene is relatively
inert on reduced chromium species; meanwhile, the oxidation of
the reduced chromium species by CO2 to the active oxidative state
was slow under the reaction conditions, resulting in consumption
of less carbon dioxide. The conversion of propane and carbon diox-
ide on both the fresh and reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalysts at the later
time on stream is very low, mainly due to the coverage of the
active sites with coke.
To explore the sources and reaction paths of its byproducts, we
analyzed the products distribution of propylene reacted with car-
bon dioxide on the fresh and reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalysts. As
shown in Fig. 6B, the methane and CO selectivity of the reduced
7CrAZrO2 catalyst ARE about 4% and 96%, respectively, but the
selectivity FOR methane is as high as 20% on the fresh 7CrAZrO2
catalyst at the initial reaction time. It is conﬁrmed that by-
products of methane and CO in the DHP reaction with CO2 are from
the reaction of propylene and CO2 on the active oxidative chro-
mium sites, as in the equation
C3H6 + 3CO2 $ CH4 + 5CO + H2O.
ð5Þ
4.3. The effect of CO2 on the formation and elimination of coke
As we know, alkanes and corresponding alkenes are carbon
sources for coke species. We also found that CO2 is a source of coke
as well (Fig. S5C). Especially for anaerobic DHP, CO2 is produced in
the initial induction period and adsorbed on the surface of the cat-
alyst, where it reacts with abundant H species to produce coke spe-
cies.
To
further
investigate
the
generation
temperature
of
deposited carbonaceous species on the surface of the catalyst, the
in situ Raman spectra of 7CrAZrO2 in ﬂowing 5% H2/Ar as a func-
tion of different temperatures with CO2 impulse were recorded
and the results are shown in Fig. 14. The surface Cr6+ species began
to be reduced at 200 C under 5% H2/Ar gas ﬂow and was reduced
completely at 300 C. Meanwhile, the peak of coke species
appeared at 300 C and their intensity increased remarkably above
500 C.
There are two conditions for the formation of coke from COx.
The ﬁrst is the reduced Cr species with abundant H species to ﬁx
carbon dioxide. The second is the carbon chain growth and arom-
atization reaction when temperature exceeds 300 C. But a large
amount CO2 in the feed atmosphere can inhabit the formation of
coke (Fig. S5B). A large amount of CO2 consumed dissociated

atomic hydrogen species on the surface, so that there are not
enough hydrogen species to further deoxygenate the carbon–oxy-
gen species to form hydrocarbon species for coupling chain growth
and aromatization.
The Raman peaks assigned to the coke species appear after the
induced reduction period, which is partially responsible for the
catalyst deactivation (Fig. 11). Cr6+ species are the main active sites
for the propane combustion reaction, whereas the Cr2+ species is
active for light alkene polymerization [53–56]. So CO2 can main-
tain Cr3+ species during DHP to inhabit coke formation on the
Cr2+ species (Fig. S7).
The elimination rate of coke under 5% CO2 was very low, which
is similar to the real reaction conditions. The intensity of coke spe-
cies peaks is almost unchanged after 80 min (Fig. S10). When the
ﬂow of CO2 is increased twice, the peaks of coke species disappear
slowly and completely disappear after 180 min (Fig. 12). So the
existence of CO2 is beneﬁcial for eliminating coke and inhibiting
the formation of coke. The latter effect may play a more important
role in maintaining high reaction performance for DHP with CO2.
Based on the above discussion, the main reaction networks and
the active sites of DHP with CO2 over 7CrAZrO2 sample are pro-
posed (Fig. 15). The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric/isolated
Cr3+ sites with oxygen vacancies and active oxidative chromium
sites are the main catalytically active sites under real reaction con-
ditions. The H species from DHP consumed the active oxygen on
active oxidative Cr3+ species and created oxygen vacancies; then
O species from CO2 dissociation ﬁlled the oxygen vacancies to com-
plete the redox process. The Cr2+ or Cr6+ species will exist when the
7CrAZrO2 sample is under pure reductive (H2/C3H8) or pure oxida-
tive conditions (O2/CO2) at 550 C, respectively.
5. Conclusions
We have demonstrate a novel direct and reproducible method
(evaporation-induced self-assembly combined with an acid–base
pair pathway) for preparing a highly dispersed chromium oxide
species incorporated into mesoporous ZrO2. The resulting materi-
als exhibit a mesoporous structure resembling 3D wormholes with
doping of chromium species, and the crystalline zirconia support
changes from a monoclinic to a tetragonal and disordered crystal.
Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area,
crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr
species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts
with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%). Catalytic
performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with a
large amount of dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated
Cr6+ species on t-ZrO2 showed the highest catalytic activity among
the catalysts studied: initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5%. Com-
bining catalytic results with in situ Raman spectroscopy results
under real reaction conditions with time on stream, we investi-
gated the structure of chromium species by DFT calculations, redox
reaction path, and the formation of coke and reached the following
conclusions: (1) The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and
isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehy-
drogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ spe-
cies were observed after the induction period. (2) The oligomeric
and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen from CO2 dissocia-
tion under the real reaction condition are donated as active oxida-
tive chromium species. (3) CO2 prevents the reduction of Cr3+
species to Cr2+ species. Methane and CO byproducts are mainly
generated from the reaction of propylene and CO2 on the active
oxidative chromium sites. (4) The foremost effect of the presence
of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke, since the rate of
CO2 elimination of coke is pretty low. We propose a new coke for-
mation route, which is trace CO2 reacting with large H species on
the Cr2+ species.
