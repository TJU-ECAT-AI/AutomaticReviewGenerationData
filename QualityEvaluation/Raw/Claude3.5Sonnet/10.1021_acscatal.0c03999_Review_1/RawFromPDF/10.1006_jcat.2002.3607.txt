Iron-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (Fe–MCM-41)
synthesized by both direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion
exchange (TIE) methods have been characterized and used as cata-
lysts for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with diluted H2O2.
The characterizations with XRD, diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis, ESR,
and EXAFS suggest that iron cations are highly dispersed and tetra-
hedrally coordinated with oxygen in the DHT samples with iron
content lower than ca. 0.9–1.1 wt% (Si/Fe = 105–86). This coordina-
tion environment is similar to that in a ferrisilicate zeolite with MFI
structure and contributes to the increase in relative strong acidic
sites, as indicated by NH3-TPD studies. On the other hand, the
TIE samples mainly contain small iron oxide clusters. The conver-
sion of styrene over the DHT catalyst increases signiﬁcantly with
increasing iron content up to 1.1 wt%. The selectivity to styrene
oxide and the efﬁciency of H2O2 for the epoxidation can be im-
proved by adding H2O2 slowly to keep the H2O2 concentration low
during the reaction. As compared with the DHT catalyst, the TIE
catalyst shows a much poorer performance for the epoxidation of
styrene. It is suggested that the atomically isolated iron sites ac-
count for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The
iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 do not
leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters
leach out into the liquid phase and do not contribute to the catalytic
reaction.

INTRODUCTION
Iron is known to be the active center in monooxygenase
enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and methane monooxy-
genase, which catalyze the selective oxidation of methane
or several other hydrocarbons (1, 2). Many iron-containing
compounds and solid catalysts have been reported to
catalyze the selective oxidation of benzene or alkanes.
Fenton’s reagent containing Fe2+ and H2O2 is a well-known
homogenous system for generating the hydroxyl radical

responsible for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol (3).
An iron-containing microporous amorphous silica synthe-
sized by a sol–gel method was reported to catalyze the
conversion of benzene to phenol with H2O2(4). Fe–ZSM-5
catalyzed the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol with
N2O (5). Fe-containing Y zeolite modiﬁed with Pd was
effective in the oxidation of alkanes such as hexane to
oxygenates with a H2O2 or O2–H2 gas mixture (6). Iron
phosphate catalyzed the partial oxidation of methane and
ethane to their alcohols with an O2–H2 gas mixture (7, 8).
However, to our knowledge, no iron-containing heteroge-
neous catalyst has been reported to show signiﬁcant activity
for the epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2, although sub-
stituted iron(III) porphyrin chlorides, typical biomimetic
model complexes, are effective for epoxidation reactions
with organic hydroperoxide (9).
On the other hand, metal ion-containing MCM-41, which
possesses uniform nano-order mesopores and high con-
centrations of isolated active sites, has attracted much at-
tention as a new type of oxidation catalyst, especially for
liquid-phase oxidation reactions since facile diffusion of
relatively large molecules can be expected. Many studies
contributed to the syntheses and characterizations of metal
ion-containing MCM-41, and some of these materials, e.g.,
Ti–MCM-41 and V–MCM-41, showed unique catalytic
properties for the reactions of larger molecules (10–20).
A few studies have been reported on the syntheses and
characterizations of Fe–MCM-41 using different methods
(21–23), but the details about the location and the coordi-
nation environment of iron and the amount of iron cations
incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 are still not
clear. An iron-immobilized MCM-41 modiﬁed with organic
silane exhibited activity in the oxidation of cyclohexane
to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone at 373 K with H2O2,
but the leaching of active sites was unavoidable (24). The
leaching of active components is a common problem in
liquid-phase oxidation reactions. For example, the leach-
ing of V and Cr was observed from V– and Cr–MCM-41,
respectively, during oxidation with H2O2 (25). The leach-
ing of Ti from TS-1, Ti–Alβ, Ti–MCM-41, and Ti–xerogel

Fe–MCM-41 FOR EPOXIDATION OF STYRENE WITH H2O2

was reported in the epoxidation of crotylalcohol with H2O2
(26). The understanding of the nature of such leach-
ing is vital for designing stable catalysts for liquid-phase
oxidation.
It can be expected that the metal cations with different
environments in mesoporous material would result in dif-
ferent catalytic properties and leaching behavior. Recently,
we communicated that Fe–MCM-41 prepared by direct hy-
drothermal synthesis exhibited good performance for the
epoxidation of styrene with H2O2 (27). In the present pa-
per, we introduce iron into MCM-41 using two different
methods, i.e., direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-
ion exchange (TIE) methods. Iron cations are added into
the synthesis gel before hydrothermal synthesis in the for-
mer method, while the exchanging of Fe3+ in the ethanol
solution with the template cations contained in the as-
synthesized MCM-41 is carried out in the latter method.
The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to
gain insight into the coordination environments of the in-
troduced iron cations. The inﬂuence of the environment
of iron on its catalytic properties and leaching features in
the epoxidation of styrene with H2O2 are investigated in
detail.
EXPERIMENTALS AND METHODS
Synthesis
Iron was introduced into MCM-41 by two different meth-
ods. Fe–MCM-41-DHT was prepared by direct hydrother-
mal synthesis. Ferric nitrate, sodium silicate, and hexade-
cyltrimethylammonium bromide were used as the sources
of iron, silicon, and template, respectively. The molar ratio
of template to Si source in the synthesis gel was 0.5, which
was the same as that used for the synthesis of purely sili-
cious MCM-41. After adjustment of the pH to 10.8 with
4 N HCl, the mixture was stirred for 1 h and then trans-
ferred to a Teﬂon bottle placed in a stainless-steel autoclave.
After hydrothermal synthesis at 423 K for 48 h, the resul-
tant solid was recovered by ﬁltration, thoroughly washed
with deionized water (ca. 20 dm3), dried at 313 K in a vac-
uum, and ﬁnally calcined in a ﬂow of air at 823 K for 6 h.
Fe–MCM-41-TIE was prepared using the template-ion ex-
change method, i.e., by exchanging the template cations
contained in the as synthesized MCM-41 (uncalcined) with
the Fe3+ ions in an ethanol solution. Bourlinos and cowork-
ers (22) reported the possibility of ion exchange between
the template cations and Fe3+ ions. In our experiment, 2 g
of the as-synthesized MCM-41 comprising a ca. 50 wt%
template was added to an ethanol solution of iron nitrate
and stirred vigorously at 333 K for 3 h. After the ion-
exchange procedure, the solid was recovered by ﬁltration
and then washed with deionized water, followed by drying
at 313 K in vacuum and calcination in a ﬂow of air at 823 K
for 6 h.
Ferrisilicate with MFI structure and Fe2O3/Cab–O–Sil
were also prepared for comparison. Ferrisilicate was pre-
pared following the procedure of Ratnasami and Kumar
(28) by hydrothermal synthesis at 443 K for 72 h us-
ing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ferric nitrate, and
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide as the silicon and iron
sources and the template, respectively. The posttreatment
for the as-synthesized ferrisilicate was the same as that for
the Fe–MCM-41-DHT samples. XRD measurement con-
ﬁrmed the MFI zeolite structure. Fe2O3/Cab–O–Sil was
prepared by a conventional impregnation method using
an aqueous solution of ferric nitrate and Cab–O–Sil (M5,
ACROS ORGANICS), a nonporous fumed silica with high
speciﬁc surface area.
Characterization
The content of iron in each sample was determined by
ICP after the sample was completely dissolved using diluted
hydrochloric acid and a small amount of hydroﬂuoric acid.
The ICP measurements were carried out using a Perkin–
Elmer OPTIMA 3000.
XRD measurements were performed with a SRA
M18XHF diffractometer (MAC Science Co., Ltd., Japan)
with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 300 mA). Small divergent
and scattering slits (0.05 mm) were selected to avoid a high
background at low diffraction angle.
N2-adsorption (77 K) studies carried out with Bel-
sorp 18SP equipment (volumetric) were used to exam-
ine the properties of mesopores of each synthesized sam-
ple. The pore size distribution was evaluated from the
adsorption isotherm by the DH (Dollimore and Heal)
method.
The diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were recorded on
a Perkin–Elmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer.
The powdery sample was loaded into a quartz cell, and the
spectra were collected at 200–700 nm referenced to BaSO4.
ESR spectra were measured at X-band (∼9 GHz) using a
JEOLREseriesJES-RE1XESRspectrometer.Thesample
was placed in a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 3 mm
and measured at ambient temperature.
X-ray absorption measurements were carried out with
synchrontron radiation by using the EXAFS facilities in-
stalledatbeamlineBL9AofthePhotonFactory,intheHigh
Energy Accelerator Research Organization (Tsukuba,
Japan), operated at 2.5 GeV with about 350–380 mA of
ring current. All the data were recorded in X-ray ﬂuores-
cence mode at room temperature using a Si(111) double-
crystal monochromator. Ion chambers were equipped for
measuring the incident beam intensity (I0), and a lytle de-
tector was used for measuring ﬂuorescene yield using a Z-1
ﬁlter. Energy was calibrated with Cu K-edge absorption
(8981.0 eV) and the energy resolution was 0.3 eV. The ab-
sorption was normalized to 1.0 at an energy of 30 eV higher
than the absorption edge. Data analyses were performed

with the FACOM M1800 computer system at the Data Pro-
cessing Center of Kyoto University (29).
NH3-TPD measurements were carried out to obtain in-
formation about the acidic property of each catalyst us-
ing BEL JAPAN TPD-1-AT equipment. After pretreat-
ment in a gas ﬂow of He and O2 at 823 K, the sample
(0.2 g) was degassed in vacuum. The adsorption of NH3
was carried out at 393 K and a pressure of 2.67 kPa for
1 h, and then the gaseous and weakly adsorbed NH3 was
purged with He. TPD was performed in He ﬂow by raising
the temperature to 873 K at a rate of 10 K min−1, and the
desorbed NH3 was detected by a mass spectrometer. The
fragment with m/e = 16 was used to quantify the amount
of NH3 desorbed because the parent peak with m/e = 17
was affected by the desorbed water. A known amount of
NH3 was used to calibrate the intensity of the signal with
m/e = 16.
Catalytic Reaction
The epoxidation of alkene (styrene) was carried out us-
ing a batch-type reactor. In a typical reaction, 0.2 g of sam-
ple was added to a glass ﬂask precharged with the desired
amount of reactant and solvent at the desired temperature.
The reaction was started after adding 30 wt% H2O2 aque-
ous solution. The H2O2 was added either all at one time
at the starting point, in several batches, or continuously
throughout the reaction. The reactant mixture was stirred
vigorously during the reaction. After the reaction, the cata-
lyst was ﬁltrated and a small part of the dried catalyst was
subjected to ICP measurement. All the liquid organic prod-
ucts were identiﬁed by GC–MS (Shimazu GCMS-QP5050)
and were quantiﬁed using a gas chromatograph with a cap-
illary column (BPX-5, 30 M×0.25 mm) and a FID detector
using toluene as an internal standard. The consumption of
H2O2 was determined by iodometric titration.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mesoporous Structure of Materials
The porous properties obtained from N2 adsorption mea-
surements at 77 K are shown in Table 1. All the Fe–MCM-41
samples exhibited large surface areas of ca. 1000–1200 m2
g−1 and pore volumes of ca. 0.75–1.0 ml g−1. The pore dis-
tributions determined by the Dollimore and Heal (DH)
method for the Fe–MCM-41 synthesized by both DHT
(Si/Fe = 105) and TIE (Si/Fe = 102) methods along with the
purely silicious MCM-41 are shown in Fig. 1. Narrow pore
distributionaround2.5–3.0nmwasobservedforallthesam-
ples.
XRD measurements showed that the diffraction lines of
(100), (110), (200), and (210) at 2θ degrees of ca. 2.2, 3.6,
4.3, and 5.7◦indexed to the hexagonal regularity of MCM-
41 were observed for all the Fe–MCM-41 samples shown in
Table 1, suggesting that the hexagonal array of mesopores
in MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of iron
with both methods. The unit cell parameter (a0), calculated
from 2d(100)/√3, increased with the introduction of iron
into MCM-41 by the DHT method up to Fe content of ca.
0.9–1.1 wt% and remained almost unchanged or slightly de-
creased with a further increase in Fe content, as shown in
Table 1. On the other hand, the a0 did not change signiﬁ-
cantly on introduction of iron into MCM-41 with the TIE
method. Generally, it is expected that the unit cell parame-
ter will be enlarged after the incorporation of metal cations
with ionic radius larger than Si4+. Since the ionic radius of
Fe3+ is larger than that of Si4+, the increase in the a0 may
indicate that Fe3+ cations are incorporated into the frame-
work of MCM-41 to replace Si4+ in the DHT samples. The
result that the a0 did not increase as Fe content exceeded
0.9–1.1 wt% might suggest that there existed an upper limit
of iron content which could be incorporated inside the
framework. That there was no signiﬁcant change in the a0

in the case of the TIE method suggests that no such substi-
tution occurs or that the substitution amount is very small
in the TIE samples.
Coordination Environment of Iron
The color of the Fe-containing samples synthesized in this
work is also shown in Table 1 since it is a simple indication of
whether bulk iron oxide exists (28). All the as-synthesized
Fe–MCM-41-DHT samples exhibited a white color, sug-
gesting that no bulk iron oxide existed and all the iron
cations were probably incorporated inside the framework
after hydrothermal synthesis. The white color was kept af-
ter calcination for the DHT samples with Fe content lower
than 0.9 wt%. As Fe content exceeded 0.9 wt%, the calcined
DHT sample became off-white in color, possibly suggest-
ing the presence of the extraframework iron. On the other
hand, the brown color of each TIE sample suggests that
these samples may contain aggregated iron oxide clusters.
Figure 2 shows the diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra.
TheDHTsampleswithironcontentsof0.9,1.1,and1.8wt%
exhibited a peak at ca. 265 nm (Figs. 2b–2d), which was
similar to that for ferrisilicate (Fig. 2e, peak at 260 nm) con-
taining tetrahedrally coordinated iron species. This band
could be assigned to the dπ–pπ charge transfer between
the Fe and O atoms in the framework of Fe–O–Si in the ze-
olite (30). The contribution at long wavelength to this band
became larger with an increase in Fe content in the DHT
sample, indicating the presence of extraframework iron or
aggregated Fe oxide clusters at high Fe content. These re-
sults further suggest that there exists an upper limit of iron
content incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41. On
the other hand, in addition to the peak at 265 nm, bands
at ca. 385 and 510 nm, which were mainly observed for
Fe2O3/Cab–O–Sil (Fig. 2h), also appeared for the TIE sam-
ples (Figs. 2f and 2g), and both bands became stronger with
an increase in Fe content.
Two signals, g = 2.0 and 4.3, were mainly detected for the
Fe-containing samples in Table 1. It was reported that the
signal at g = 4.3 could be attributed to Fe(III) in tetrahe-
dral coordination with strong rhombic distortion and that
at g = 2.0 was Fe(III) in octahedral coordination (31, 32).
However, such assignments seem not unambiguous, partic-
ularly for the signal at g = 2.0. Catana and coworkers (33)
suggested that g = 2.0 could also be partly due to Fe(III) in
a tetrahedral site although iron oxide clusters gave a large
g = 2.0 signal. In our case (27), Fe2O3/Cab–O–Sil showed
almost no peak at g = 4.3 but a strong and broad signal
at g = 2.0. It could be considered that almost no tetrahe-
drally coordinated iron existed on Cab–O–Sil. The signal at
g = 4.3 was observed for the Fe–MCM-41 prepared by the
TIE method, but the relative intensity was much lower com-
pared with that from the ferrisilicate and the Fe–MCM-41
synthesized by the DHT method. In spite of the complexity
of the assignment of ESR signals, such a result still implies
that iron cations are easily incorporated into the frame-
work of MCM-41 in the DHT sample, while the number of

tetrahedrally coordinated iron sites in the TIE sample was
very small.
It is expected that the incorporation of Fe3+ into the
framework of MCM-41 would lead to strong Brønsted acid
sites, as in the case of zeolite. Two ammonia desorption
peaks at ca. 550 and 700 K were reported for the ferrisili-
cate with MFI structure, and these two desorptions were re-
gardedastheweaklyheldammonia,i.e.,ammoniaadsorbed
on weak Lewis acid sites or hydrogen-bonded ones, and
the strong chemisorbed ammonia or ammonium cations on
the Brønsted acid sites which were related to the frame-
work iron, respectively (34). NH3-TPD proﬁles obtained
over Fe–MCM-41 are shown in Fig. 3. MCM-41 without
iron exhibited a main peak at ca. 500 K along with a very
weak shoulder at ca. 700 K (Fig. 3a). We ascribed these
minor strong acid sites to the silanol groups on defective
sites (35). After introducing iron with the TIE method,
both peaks were increased slightly, and there was almost
no difference between the samples with Si/Fe ratios of 102
and 70 (Figs. 3b and 3c). On the other hand, the intensity
of the peak at high temperature was remarkably increased
by introducing iron with the DHT method (Fig. 3d). The
peak at 500–520 K also became notably larger as Fe con-
tent became higher (Si/Fe = 86 (Fig. 3f) and 50 (Fig. 3g)).
A similar phenomenon was observed over ferrisilicate with
MFI structure, and such weak acidity was believed to arise
from the extraframework iron but not the incorporated iron
site (34).

Table 2 summarizes the amount of NH3 desorbed from
each DHT sample. Table 2 shows that the desorption in the
high-temperature region with a peak at 650–700 K increases
with Fe content and remains almost unchanged as Fe con-
tent exceeds 1.1 wt% (Si/Fe = 86), whereas that in the low-
temperature region with a peak at 480–500 K still increases
with Fe content. If we consider that the strong acid sites
are due to the iron species located in the framework, the
limit amount of 0.16 mmol g−1 corresponds to ca. 0.9 wt%
iron. Thus, the results here strongly suggest that the
content of iron, which can enter the framework to replace
Si4+, is limited to ca. 0.9–1.1 wt%, and a further increase
in Fe content will result in extraframework iron species.
It should be noted that the introduction of iron with the
TIE method did not lead to signiﬁcant increases not only
for the strong acidic sites but also for the peak of weakly
adsorbed NH3. Thus, the extraframework iron in the DHT
sample may be different in chemical environment from the
iron in the TIE sample.
The coordination environment of iron species has fur-
ther been investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy,
which has proven to be a powerful tool for characteriz-
ing the metal ions in molecular sieves (14). Figure 4 shows
the XANES spectra of Fe–MCM-41 prepared by both
TIE and DHT methods together with the reference com-
pounds, ferrisilicate with MFI structure and α-Fe2O3. Iron
atoms in ferrisilicate are mainly in tetrahedral coordina-
tion, whereas those in α-Fe2O3 are in octahedral coordi-
nation. A characteristic feature of these XANES spectra
can be seen in the preedge peak at ca. 7112 eV, attributed
to the so-called 1s–3d dipolar forbidden transition. Prin-
cipally, this 1s–3d forbidden transition gains additional in-
tensity when the iron center is in a noncentral symmet-
ric environment or through mixing of 3d and 4p orbitals
caused by the breakdown of inversion symmetry due to
the structure distortion. Since the local symmetry around
the iron is lowered from octahedral to tetrahedral coordi-
nation, the intensity (denoted as I) of this peak tends to

increase, i.e., Itetrahedral > Isquare pyramidal > Ioctahedral (36). The
absorption in Fig. 4 has been normalized, and thus the in-
tensity of the preedge peak could be compared among dif-
ferent samples. As shown in Fig. 4, ferrisilicate which pos-
sessed a regular tetrahedral coordination structure showed
the largest intensity (peak height, 0.12), whereas α-Fe2O3
with distorted octahedral coordination structure showed
very weak absorption. The peak intensities of Fe–MCM-
41-DHT samples (peak heights, 0.082 and 0.080 for Figs. 4b
and 4c, respectively) were lower than that of ferrisilicate.
We think that this could be explained by the difference in
theframeworkstructureofMCM-41andthatofsilicaliteze-
olite; silicalite zeolite is crystalline, while the wall of MCM-
41 is essentially amorphous. The Si–O–Fe bonds sitting in
the amorphous framework of Fe–MCM41 prepared by the
DHT method may thus be connected with more relaxing
angles than those in ferrisilicate. Fe–MCM-41-TIE gave a
smaller pre-K edge peak (peak height, 0.061) compared to
the DHT samples.

with a tetrahedral coordination structure can be inferred,
since both the Fe–O distance (1.85 ˚
A) and the coordina-
tion number (4.2–4.5) are closely similar to those for the
ferrisilicate with MFI structure. The slightly higher coordi-
nation number of iron in the Fe–MCM-41-DHT than that
in ferrisilicate may arise from the amorphous framework
of MCM-41, which is not as rigid as in the case of silicalite.
On the other hand, two Fe–O bonds, with lengths of 1.85
and 1.99 ˚
A and coordination numbers of 3.2 and 3.2, re-
spectively, were obtained in the case of Fe–MCM-41-TIE.
Iron in α-Fe2O3 possessed two kinds of Fe–O bonds, with
lengths of 1.91 and 2.04 ˚
A and coordination numbers of 3.0
and 2.9, respectively. All these results are consistent with
those obtained from UV–vis and ESR and strongly sug-
gest that most of the iron species exist in the form of oxide
clusters in the Fe–MCM-41-TIE sample. This conclusion
was much different from that reported by Bourlinos and
coworkers (22), who suggested that iron was incorporated
into the network of MCM-41 with the TIE method. The
EXAFS data in Table 3 further informed us that the coor-
dination number of Fe–O–Fe of the Fe–MCM-41-TIE with
Si/Fe ratio of 70 was 2.1, notably lower than the value (7.0)
reported for α-Fe2O3 (37). Such a deviation might suggest
that iron oxide clusters with small size exist in the channel
of MCM-41.
Catalytic Properties in Epoxidation of Styrene
Styrene oxide and benzaldehyde were two main prod-
ucts in the epoxidation of styrene with H2O2 over Fe–
MCM-41. Styrene glycol and benzoic acid were also formed
with low selectivity, probably from the hydrolysis of styrene
oxide and the consecutive oxidation of benzaldehyde, re-
spectively, along with minor mandelic acid. Figure 6 shows
the change of catalytic performances with Fe content over
Fe–MCM-41 synthesized by the DHT method. The increase

in Fe content up to 1.1 wt% increased the conversion of
styrene remarkably. As Fe content exceeded 1.1 wt%, the
conversion of styrene rather slightly decreased although the
conversion of H2O2 still went up. The introduction of iron
into MCM-41 raised the selectivity to styrene oxide, but
the selectivity was not signiﬁcantly changed with a further
increase in iron content. These results indicate that an ap-
propriate content of iron (lower than 1.1 wt%) in the DHT
sample catalyzes the epoxidation of styrene, but the extra
iron only enhances the decomposition of H2O2.
The catalytic performances of several different kinds of
catalysts are compared in Table 4. Fe2O3/Cab–O–Sil and
Fe–ZSM-5 prepared by an ion-exchange method showed
medium conversion of styrene and low selectivity to styrene

oxide, but the consumption of H2O2 was high. Although the
selectivity to styrene oxide was high over ferrisilicate with
MFI structure, the conversion of styrene was very low. Fe–
MCM-41 synthesized by the TIE method also showed low
conversion of styrene despite high consumption of H2O2,
while Fe–MCM-41 synthesized by the DHT method exhib-
ited notably high styrene conversion and moderate con-
sumption of H2O2, and the highest turnover frequency for
styrene oxide formation. Thus, the coordination environ-
ment of iron is crucial for the epoxidation of styrene with
H2O2. The results shown in Table 4 and Fig. 6 combined
with the characterization results described above suggest
that the iron sites incorporated inside the framework of
MCM-41 probably account for the epoxidation of styrene
with H2O2, whereas the iron oxide clusters or iron species
in the extraframework positions seem to accelerate the de-
composition of H2O2. TS-1, a well-known epoxidation cata-
lyst, gave very low selectivity to styrene oxide due to its
isomerization to phenylacetaldehyde (38). A Ti–SiO2 with
highly isolated titanium cations implanted to silica synthe-
sized by an ion-beam implantation method showed rela-
tively high selectivity to styrene oxide, but the conversion
was low (<5%) and the product shifted to benzaldehyde
when the conversion was increased by increasing the tem-
perature (39). Therefore, the iron site incorporated inside
the framework of MCM-41 is very unique for epoxidation
of styrene with H2O2.
Figure 7 shows the effect of H2O2 amount on the cat-
alytic performances for the epoxidation of styrene over the
Fe–MCM-41-DHT catalyst (Si/Fe = 86). In the absence of
H2O2,verylowconversionofstyrene(0.13%)wasobserved
due to the reaction with the remaining air in the reactor,
and the product was only benzaldehyde. With the addition
of a small amount of H2O2, the conversion of styrene in-
creased sharply, and a high selectivity to styrene oxide (ca.
60%) was obtained. Although the conversion of styrene in-
creased with an increase in the amount, or, in other words,
the concentration, of H2O2, the selectivity to styrene oxide
decreased and that to benzaldehyde and other by-products
increased. More signiﬁcantly, the efﬁciency of H2O2 for the
epoxidation of styrene calculated by the following equation
decreased drastically with an increase in H2O2 concentra-
tion:
H2O2 efﬁciency
=
amount of styrene oxide formed (mol)
amount of hydrogen peroxide consumed (mol)×100(%).
The efﬁciency of H2O2 was the highest (ca. 30%) at the
lowest H2O2 concentration. Thus, in order to obtain both
high conversion of styrene and high H2O2 efﬁciency, we at-
tempted to add a certain amount of H2O2 (9.8 mmol) either
in several batches or continuously to the reactant to keep
the concentration of H2O2 low during the reaction. Table 5
shows the effect of the method of H2O2 addition on cata-

lytic performances of the Fe–MCM-41-DHT (Si/Fe = 86).
The addition of four equal batches of H2O2 (entry no. 2)
resulted in remarkably higher selectivity to epoxide and
higher H2O2 efﬁciency for epoxidation than did addition of
all the H2O2 at the starting point. The continuous addition
of H2O2 with a rate of 0.0735 mmol/min (entry no. 3) during
the reaction further increased the selectivity to styrene ox-
ide. The consumption of H2O2 was also inhibited to some
extent at the same time, and thus the H2O2 efﬁciency for
epoxidation increased from 7.8 to 17.4%.
Figure 8 shows the change of catalytic performances with
reaction time over the Fe–MCM-41-DHT (Si/Fe = 144).
H2O2 decomposed very quickly at the initial stage and
its conversion reached ca. 60% after 10 min of reaction.
Styrene conversion also went up very sharply in the ini-
tial 10 min. The increase in styrene conversion continued
and reached a steady state after the initial 10 min, and the
consumption of H2O2 was very limited during this period.
The selectivity to styrene oxide was almost unchanged with
reaction time, and that to benzaldehyde slightly decreased
along with a slight increase in that to benzoic acid. This
result suggests that the epoxidation proceeds in parallel
with the formation of benzaldehyde through the cleavage
of the C=
=C bond. The consecutive oxidation of benzalde-
hyde gave benzoic acid.

To get insight into the nature of the active oxygen species
for the conversion of styrene, the inﬂuences of a radical
scavenger, butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT), on catalytic per-
formances over the Fe–MCM-41-DHT (Si/Fe = 86) have
been investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The
conversion of H2O2 was almost unchanged after the addi-
tion of BHT up to 2 mmol but decreased from ca. 80 to
59% after the addition of 5 mmol BHT. The conversion
of styrene to either styrene oxide or benzaldehyde, how-
ever, decreased drastically with an increase in the amount
of BHT. Thus, the oxygen species for the formation of either
styrene oxide or benzaldehyde probably possessed a radi-
cal nature. Since the selectivity to styrene oxide increased
and that to benzaldehyde decreased with an increase in the

one with iron content lower than 0.8 wt%, where no de-
crease in iron content occurs. In other words, the leaching
of iron did not take place for the DHT sample with iron
content lower than 0.8 wt%, whereas the excess iron above
ca. 0.8 wt% would leach out to the liquid phase during the
epoxidation of styrene with H2O2. On the other hand, the
iron content dropped drastically from 0.9 to 0.2 wt% after
the reaction for the TIE sample.

ter each cycle was recovered by ﬁltration and drying. The
amount of the catalyst used for the second and third cycle
decreased because of the use of a small part for ICP detec-
tion and the slight loss during the recovery. This led to some
decreases in the conversions of both H2O2 and styrene. The
selectivity to styrene oxide was almost unchanged after the
ﬁrst reaction cycle. The iron content decreased remarkably
after the ﬁrst reaction cycle, from 1.4 to 0.8 wt%. However,
the activity for the second reaction cycle only decreased
slightly compared with the ﬁrst reaction cycle, supporting
the consideration that the excess iron in the fresh catalyst

did not signiﬁcantly contribute to the conversion of styrene.
It is interesting that the iron content after the ﬁrst reac-
tion cycle (0.8 wt%) is almost unchanged after the second
and the third cycles. The results of Tables 6 and 7 indicate
that the iron sites with an upper limit content of 0.8 wt% in
MCM-41 introduced by the DHT method are stable toward
leaching during the reaction.
The content of iron remaining after leaching was only
slightly lower than the amount of iron (0.9–1.1 wt%)
which existed with tetrahedral coordination with oxygen
and was generally regarded to be incorporated inside the
framework of MCM-41, as indicated by the characteri-
zation results. Figure 10 shows the ESR spectra of the
Fe–MCM-41-DHT (Si/Fe = 65) before and after reaction.
The relative strength of the signal at g = 4.3 which could
be ascribed to the iron species with distorted tetrahe-
dral coordination increased drastically after the ﬁrst re-
action cycle and almost remained constant after further
reaction. This result conﬁrms the fact that the remaining
iron species, which is stable toward leaching and accounts
for the epoxidation of styrene, is mainly tetrahedrally co-
ordinated with oxygen and located in the framework of
MCM-41.

CONCLUSIONS
The iron cations with an upper limit of ca. 0.9–1.1 wt%
could exist in a tetrahedrally coordinated environment and
probably could be incorporated inside the framework of
MCM-41 in the Fe–MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrother-
mal synthesis. On the other hand, the exchanging of Fe3+
ions in the ethanolic solution with the template cations em-
braced in the uncalcined MCM-41 mainly resulted in small
iron oxide clusters after calcination. The tetrahedrally coor-
dinated and atomically isolated iron sites were responsible
for the conversion of styrene with H2O2 aqueous solution.
The selectivity to styrene oxide and the efﬁciency of H2O2
for epoxidation could be raised by keeping a low concentra-
tion of hydrogen peroxide during the reaction. The active
oxygen species responsible for the epoxidation of styrene
and for the formation of the main by-product, benzalde-
hyde,maybedifferent,butitseemsthatbothoxygenspecies
possess a radical nature. The iron located inside the frame-
work of MCM-41 was stable toward leaching, whereas the
iron in extraframework position leached out to the liquid
phase during the reaction.
