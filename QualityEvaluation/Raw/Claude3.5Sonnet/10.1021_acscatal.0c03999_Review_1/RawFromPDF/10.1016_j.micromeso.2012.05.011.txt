A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal)
were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1. The obtained catalysts were characterized
with various physicochemical techniques (chemical composition, low-temperature adsorption of N2,
H2–TPR, XRD, UV–vis DRS, Raman, and EPR) and tested in dehydrogenation of propane to propene in
the presence of CO2. Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were
found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples. Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and
dichromates, despite the Cr loading. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in
the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content. Cr5+ species were found in the samples con-
taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with
Crtotal content above 5 wt.%. All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high
selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro-
pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal. For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane
remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac-
tive in the test reaction. Operando UV–vis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of
propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox
sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process. The dispersed
Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in
all of the studied feed compositions.

1. Introduction
Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the
catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [1–3], oxida-
tion of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydroge-
nation of hydrocarbons [3–5] and to a lesser degree in many other
processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective
catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]. Recently, it has been
found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent
catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane
[8–11],
propane
[12–21],
isobutane
[22],
and
ethylbenzene
[23,24]. The ODH process is considered as an improvement of the
traditional dehydrogenation as well as a new attractive pathway
for CO2 utilization. Because of the fact that in reaction conditions
CO2 is reduced to CO, together with hydrogen (synthesis gas) or
separately, it has many applications in the chemical industry.
The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as
propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the
yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting
role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties.
CO2 participates in the process as an oxidant and allows for regen-
eration of the reduced chromium sites generated during the dehy-
drogenation of propane (1) as well as a consecutive reduction with
H2 (2). CrOx and CrOx1 stand for the oxidized and reduced form of
the catalyst, respectively.

and
Cr3+/Cr2+
[18,23,24] have been proposed. All of these investigations indicate
that CO2 exhibits very weak oxidative properties mainly because it
is thermodynamically stable and is a kinetically inert molecule.

Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate
in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the acti-
vation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chro-
mium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed. As it has already
been established, several factors inﬂuence the concentration of
these species on the surface of supports. They include the type of
the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination tempera-
ture), Cr content and properties of the support (e.g. isoelectric
point, speciﬁc surface area). The high-surface-area supports pro-
vide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr spe-
cies. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to
various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number
of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared
by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated
as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to pro-
pene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,17–20,22,23].
In a recent study, we have explored SBA-1 mesoporous silica as
a support for a Cr-containing catalyst obtained by one-pot method
(direct synthesis) for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [19]. The
study showed that due to the strongly acidic conditions needed for
SBA-1 preparation, the dispersion of the Cr species in the SBA-1
matrix is limited and has a negative impact on the catalytic perfor-
mance of the resultant system. This observation remains in agree-
ment with the results obtained by Zhao and Wang [12], who
concluded that during the direct synthesis of the Cr/SBA-1 cata-
lysts the pH was low enough to convert [Cr2O7]2– (precursor) into
the more polymerized chromium oxide species, e.g. [Cr4O13]2–,
resulting in poor chromium dispersion in the SBA-1 matrix.
In the present work, we report the strategy for preparation of
the very efﬁcient Cr/SBA-1 catalyst. A series of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts
with Cr content in the range of 1–15 wt.% were obtained by the
incipient wetness impregnation, characterized with various physi-
cochemical techniques and tested in the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane in the presence of CO2. In particular, the catalyst behavior
during the process, both in the presence and absence of CO2, was
investigated using in situ UV–vis diffuse reﬂectance probe.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of support and catalysts
Parent, unmodiﬁed SBA-1 was prepared under acidic conditions
using cetyltriethylammonium bromide (CTEABr) as the surfactant
and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source. In a typical
synthesis, 10 g of CTEABr, 1157 cm3 of distilled water and
566 cm3 of hydrochloric acid (37%, Chempur) were combined to
form a homogeneous solution, which was cooled to 0 C and stirred
(400 rpm) for 30 min. Finally, 27.90 cm3 of TEOS, (98%, Aldrich) pre-
cooled to 0 C was added while vigorous stirring. The molar compo-
sition
of
the
reaction
mixture
was
TEOS:CTEABr:HCL:H2O =
1:0.2:56:700. Stirring was continued for 5 h until the precipitation
of the silica-surfactant assemblies was completed. After that perci-
pient formed at 0 C was aged in the reaction mixture for 1 h at
100 C to improve cross-linking of the silica framework. The resul-
tant precipitate was ﬁltered off and dried (without washing) at
60 C overnight. The dried material was than calcined in air by
rising temperature from ambient to 550 C over 9 h and keeping
it at 550 C for another 12 h.
In a next step, a series of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts were prepared by
the incipient wetness method using Cr(NO3)39H2O (99.6% Polish
Chemical Reagents, POCH) as a chromium source. Before the
impregnation the SBA-1 support was dried for 12 h at 120 C. Typ-
ically, 1 g of the mesoporous support was treated with 4.0 cm3 of
an aqueous solution containing the desired amount of Cr(NO3)3.
The concentration of Cr(NO3)3 in solution was matched so as to
obtain 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% of total Cr content (Crtotal) in
the ﬁnal catalysts. The impregnated samples were dried at room
temperature overnight, then for 6 h at 60 C and ﬁnally all dry
materials were calcined at 550 C for 6 h in air. The catalysts were
denoted as Crx/SBA-1, where x stands for nominal Crtotal given in
wt.% of Cr.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of mesoporous materi-
als were collected on a Panalytical X’Pert Pro instrument operated
at 40 kV and 30 mA, equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray (k = 0.154 nm)
radiation source. The diffractograms were recorded in the 2h range
between 0.5 and 70 with a 2h step size 0.0167.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at
196 C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The sam-
ples were degassed at 250 C before measurements for 12 h in
the degas port of the sorption analyzer. Speciﬁc surface areas were
calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method with-
in the relative pressure P/P0 = 0.05–0.15. Pore size distributions
were calculated from the branch of the adsorption curve using
the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method taking into account cor-
rected form of Kelvin equation proposed by Kruk et al. [25]. Total
pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen ad-
sorbed at P/P0 = 0.95 or in vicinity.
Total Cr content (Crtot) in the catalysts was determined by ICP
spectrometry (Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100). The catalysts samples
were dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis (UV–vis DR) spectra were measured
with an Ocean Optics HR2000 + instrument (integration time
400 ms) equipped with an Ocean Optics DH-2000 BAL halogen-
deuterium light source. The spectra were recorded at room tem-
perature within the wavelength range of 200–850 nm. In all cases
40 scans were accumulated to ensure a sufﬁcient signal-to-noise
ratio. BaSO4 was used as a standard.
The Raman spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 cm–1 at
room temperature using a Renishaw InVia dispersive spectrome-
ter. The system is equipped with a 360 mW laser operating at
the wavelength of 785 nm, a Leica DMLM confocal microscope,
and a CCD detector. Depending on the sample, the spectra were re-
corded using 0.5–10% of total power of laser at a sample position.
The Raman scattered light was collected in the spectral range 150–
1200 cm–1. Nine scans were accumulated to ensure a sufﬁcient sig-
nal-to-noise ratio.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded
at room temperature with a X-band Bruker ELEXSYS-580 spec-
trometer operating at 100 kHz ﬁeld modulation with 1–5 G modu-
lation amplitude. The samples were sealed in quartz tubes and
were not evacuated prior the measurements.
Operando measurements combining temperature-programmed
reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) coupled with in situ UV–vis
DR spectroscopy were carried out in a modiﬁed gas chromatograph
with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Puriﬁed mixture of N2/
H2 (95/5 vol.%, Air Liquide) served as a simultaneous carrier and
reducing gas at a total ﬂow rate of 40 cm3min–1. Before experiment
a catalyst sample (100 mg) was preheated in air for 30 min at
550 C and then in dry He stream for another 30 min. After that
the sample was cooled down to room temperature and TPR exper-
iment was started. The sample was heated at 10 Cmin–1 to the ﬁ-
nal temperature of 650 C. The H2 consumption was measured by a
TCD against NiO (99.999%, Aldrich) used for calibration of H2 con-
sumption. During reduction the UV–vis DR spectra were collected
in the range of 225–1050 nm (integration time 20 ms, 20 scans)
with a high temperature reﬂection probe (FCR-7UV400–2-ME-
HTX, 7 x 400 lm ﬁbers). The probe was attached at the top of

the quartz microreactor within the distance of 2–3 mm from the
catalyst bed of 4–5 mm thickness.
2.3. Catalytic test
The catalytic tests were carried out in a ﬂow-type quartz reactor
packed with 200 mg of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–0.3 mm). The
feed was composed of gas mixture of CO2:C3H8:He = 10:1:4,
CO2:C3H8:He = 5:1:9 or N2:C3H8:He = 5:1:9 (molar ratio). In all
cases the total ﬂow rate was 30 cm3 min1. Before the catalytic
tests, the samples were preheated in a stream of dry argon for
0.5 h at 550 C. The reaction was carried out in steady-state condi-
tions at 550 C under atmospheric pressure. The reactants and
products were analyzed on-line using an Agilent 6890 N gas chro-
matograph (GC) equipped with two columns (Hayesep Q and
molecular sieve 5A) and a thermal conductivity detector. The col-
umn packed with Hayesep Q was used for the quantiﬁcation of
H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8, while the molecular sieve 5A
was used for the quantiﬁcation of CH4 and CO.
Reaction rate normalized per Crtotal weight in catalyst (Speciﬁc
activity), conversion of propane, yield of propene, selectivity to
all hydrocarbon products as well as CO formation rate were calcu-
lated as described below.

their moles, respectively.
The calculations did not take into account the conversion of
propane to coke that was estimated independently from the
amounts of CO and CO2 evolved during oxidative regeneration of
the catalysts as reported previously [13]. These results indicate
that the percent of propane converted to coke did not exceed
0.5 mol%.
During selected catalytic tests the oxidation state of chromium
species on the surface of SBA-1 was monitored by operando UV–vis
DR spectroscopy using the same setup and conditions as in the case
of UV–vis/TPR experiments described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
3.1.1. Structure and chemical composition of calcined Crx/SBA-1
catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for SBA-1-supported chromium
oxide catalysts with different Crtotal content. In the 2h range of
1–6 all of the samples exhibit three diffraction lines indexed to
the (200), (210), and (211) reﬂections, characteristic of the cubic
silica phase (space group pm3n) [26]. The intensity of all of the
reﬂections decreases together with the increase of the total Cr con-
tent in the catalysts. However, even at the highest Cr content
(15 wt.% of Cr) three well resolved diffraction lines are observed
what clearly indicates that the well-organized mesoporous struc-
ture of SBA-1 is preserved after impregnation by the incipient wet-
ness method followed by calcination.
The maintenance of ordered cubic arrangement of SBA-1 frame-
works upon deposition of chromium is further supported by the
low-temperature N2 adsorption data. The textural parameters such
as the speciﬁc surface area (SBET), average pore diameter (DBJH), and
total pore volume (VP) are collected in Table 1.
It is clear that the speciﬁc surface area (SBET) decreases gradu-
ally with the increase in the Crtotal loading. The deposition of
15 wt.% of Cr results in a decrease of SBET by about 30% in compar-
ison to the parent SBA-1 (SBET = 1181 m2g1). Presumably, this ef-
fect is due to a partial pore blocking with increasing size of the
chromium oxide agglomerates. In contrast, Cr deposition has only
a small impact on an average pore size and a total pore volume. Up
to 7 wt.% of Crtotal the average pore diameter decreases slightly
from 2.16 to 2.13 nm and the total pore volume decreases from
0.57 to 0.47 cm3 g–1 conﬁrming the negligible impact of the incip-
ient wetness impregnation on the SBA-1 structure. Similar small
effect was reported previously for the MCM-41 and SBA-15 sup-
ported chromium oxide-based catalysts obtained by impregnation
[18,27].
3.1.2. Oxidation state of Cr species in calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts
The spectroscopic and XRD results for calcined Crx/SBA-1 cata-
lysts (x = 1–15 wt.%) are presented in Fig. 2A–D.
Fig. 2A displays the UV–vis DR spectra obtained for the calcined
Crx/SBA-1 with an increasing chromium loading (spectra from a to
g). In all of the cases absorption bands at 270 nm and 360 nm were
assigned to the O ? Cr6+ charge transfer transitions of monochro-
mate species. Speciﬁcally, the bands at 270 nm and 360 nm are
due to the transitions
1A1 ? 1T2 (1t1 ? 7t2 and 6t2?2e) and
1A1 ? 1T2 (1t1 ? 2e), respectively [3]. Additionally, in all of the
spectra, a broad shoulder at around 455 nm is visible. The position
of this shoulder band was assigned to the dichromate/polychro-
mate species [28]. Moreover, the spectra of the catalysts with the
Fig. 1. XRD patterns of SBA-1 and its modiﬁcations with different Cr content in the
small angle range. (a) Cr1/SBA-1, (b) Cr2/SBA-1, (c) Cr3/SBA-1, (d) Cr5/SBA-1, (e)

Cr content above 7 wt.% (spectrum e, Fig. 2A) shows an additional
broad band located at around 600 nm which is due to d–d transi-
tions of Cr3+ (4A2g ? 4T2g) in octahedral symmetry indicating the
presence of Cr2O3 particles.
The formation of crystalline Cr2O3 in the samples with the Cr
content higher or equal to 7 wt.% was conﬁrmed by XRD as well
(Fig. 2B). In the 2h range of 6–70 the diffraction lines correspond-
ing to the crystal phase of a-Cr2O3 are detected. This is in good
agreement with the results reported for other Cr-containing meso-
porous sieves including MCM-41 [18] and MSU-x [20]. It should be
pointed out that in the case of Cr-containing catalysts supported on
commercial silicas, formation of a-Cr2O3 has been observed for a
much lower Cr content. Typically, the crystalline a-Cr2O3 is de-
tected in the Cr/SiO2 materials containing less than 3 wt.% of Cr
[29–32]. This clearly conﬁrms that the application of mesoporous
materials as the supports enhances Cr dispersion.
More insight into the molecular nature of supported chromium
species was obtained from Raman spectroscopy which is a sensi-
tive technique toward the extended crystalline structures as well
as smaller entities (isolated surface complexes, surface polymers,
or oxide nanoclusters) with short-range order and molecular struc-
tures. Thanks to the use of a 785 nm laser line, the possible ﬂuores-
cence from the silica support is signiﬁcantly suppressed and the
signal due to the supported species is easily recorded. For a series
of catalysts with an increasing chromium loading, Raman spectra
(Fig. 2C) show the bands located at 942, 900, 850, 366, and
220 cm–1 present simultaneously already at the lowest Cr content.
Their positions are indicative of the presence of the monochromate
and dichromate surface species [3,32,33]. The intensity of these
bands rises while Cr content increases up to 7 wt.% (spectrum
e, Fig. 2C), and then, for higher Crtotal, it drops. In the case of
Cr10/SBA-1 sample the Raman spectrum shows a new band, lo-
cated at about 987 cm–1 which is attributed to the trichromate spe-
cies [32] and two other bands at 609 and 553 cm–1 characteristic of
distorted octahedral Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 [3,32].
These bands are also present in the spectrum of the catalyst with
the highest Crtotal content. In addition, in the spectrum of Cr15/
SBA-1 (spectrum g, Fig. 2C), a broad band located at around
873 cm–1, characteristic of polymeric Cr6+ species, is present.
As a result, the microRaman measurements indicated the pres-
ence of mono- and dichromate surface species which with an
increasing Cr loading tended to agglomerate to form trichromates.
For the catalysts with the Cr content about 7 wt.% and higher, these
processes led to the formation of Cr2O3 clusters evidenced also by
UV–vis and XRD measurements.
Apart from the nuclearity deduced from Raman data, EPR spec-
troscopy provides clear information about the oxidation state (Cr5+
and Cr3+ species) of chromium sites. Fig. 2D shows the EPR spectra
of the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts. In general, in the case of
silica-supported chromium oxide materials, three EPR signals are
reported [3,32,34]. Two of them, denoted as b- and d-signals, are
indicative for Cr3+ species, while the third one, namely the c-signal,
is characteristic of dispersed, isolated Cr5+ species. The narrow c-
signal with a linewidth of about 3.5–6.0 mT at around g = 1.97 orig-
inates from the isolated Cr5+ species either in tetrahedral or
square-pyramidal coordination. Contrarily to the sharp c-signal,
the b-signal which is assigned to Cr3+ species in nearly octahedral
coordination in small clusters has the form of a broad isotropic sig-
nal with a linewidth of about 78–85 mT and g = 1.99. The third d-
signal that originates from the isolated Cr3+ species is more com-
plex. Typically, it consist of a broad line centered at about
g = 1.9–2.2 and a positive lobe at about g = 2.5–4.5 [34].
In the case of the calcined Crx/SBA-1 materials, the c-signal
indicative for Cr5+ species with the position of g = 1.97–1.98 and
a linewidth in the range of 4–7 mT was observed. This sharp signal
is present in the spectra of the catalysts containing from 1 to 10
wt.% (calculation of the third derivative of the spectrum f,
Fig. 2D, obtained for 10 wt.% of Cr, shows the presence of the c
component as well). Its intensity rises together with the increase
of Crtotal content up to 5 wt.%, and then, at higher contents, it de-
creases rapidly. In the sample with the highest Crtotal content
(Cr15/SBA-1) the c-signal was not observable. Similar correlation
between the concentration of the Cr5+ species and total Cr loading
were reported for the Cr/AlMCM-41 system [34]. Moreover, in the
samples with the Cr content starting from 7 wt.%, the additional
broad b-signal originating from the agglomerated Cr3+ species ap-
pears. For the same samples the presence of diffraction lines char-
acteristic of a-Cr2O3 conﬁrms the EPR ﬁndings.
The spectroscopic data obtained for the calcined Crx/SBA-1 cat-
alysts are summarized in Table 2.
These results indicate that even if a chromium(III) precursor is
used for the impregnation, the calcination of the samples in air
leads to a partial oxidation of the chromium species present on
the surface of SBA-1 support into the higher-valent states (Cr6+
and Cr5+). For the investigated materials the oxidation state and
structure of Cr species vary in the total Cr content. The Cr6+ species
are present at any Cr content. At low loadings (below 5 wt.%), the
Cr6+ species are found mainly in the form of dichromates, while
at higher loadings, polychromates and crystalline Cr2O3 are addi-
tionally observed. The above ﬁndings concerning Crx/SBA-1 cata-
lysts are in good agreement with the general model proposed for
the supported chromium oxide materials. Below monolayer satu-
ration level Cr6+ and Cr5+ species dominate on the surface of the
oxide supports such as SiO2 or ZrO2, while above this limit the
agglomerated Cr2O3 species are formed. Moreover, our results con-
ﬁrmed the well known tendency to form a-Cr2O3 particles over sil-
ica supports. However, in the case of the SBA-1-support, the
crystalline a-Cr2O3 (detected by XRD) are formed at a higher total
Cr content than in the case of the commercially available silica gels
reported in literature [15]. This effect proﬁts mainly from a much

of surface hydroxyl groups which react with chromium ions. More-
over, the spectroscopic data clearly indicates that the incipient
wetness technique provides a high Cr dispersion preserved up to
5 wt.% of Cr. Above this loading the crystalline Cr2O3 particles are
formed what indicates that the saturation coverage is exceed. It
should be pointed out that a similar situation is observed over
other Cr-containing mesoporous silicas with a high surface area
(1000 m2g–1 or higher) such as MCM-41 or MSU-x [18,20].
3.1.3. Redox properties of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts
The redox properties of the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts were
investigated by H2-TPR and the resulting proﬁles are shown in
Fig. 3A. A sharp reduction peak with the maximum in the temper-
ature range of 410–461 C was observed for all of the investigated
samples. The shapes of the proﬁles closely resembled those previ-
ously reported for Cr/MCM-41 [18], Cr-SBA-1 [20] or Crx/SiO2
[15,29]. Based on these works, the reduction peak at 410–461 C
was ascribed to the reduction of the Cr6+ species which are directly

attached with the siliceous support. Moreover, in the case of the
Cr15/SBA-1 sample an additional small maximum appeared at
about 310 C. The location of this maximum coincided with the
low-temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined a-
Cr2O3, which is assigned to the reduction of surface Cr6+ to Cr3+
or Cr2+ species [29].
During the H2-TPR experiments, the oxidation state of chro-
mium species was simultaneously monitored using the UV–vis
DR spectroscopy. Fig. 3B depicts the spectra recorded during the
reduction of the Cr1/SBA-1 sample with a 25 C interval. It is clear
that two intense bands characteristic of the O ? Cr6+ charge trans-
fer transitions (at 270 and 360 nm) disappear gradually together
with the increase of the temperature, while at the same time a
new broad band located at 780 nm appears (inset to Fig. 3B). The
latter band is a superposition of two bands characteristic of d-d
transitions of pseudo-tetrahedral Cr2+ (5Tg ? 5E2g) and pseudo-
octahedral Cr2+/3+ (5Tg ? 5E2g/4Tg ? 4E2g) species [35]. This clearly
indicates that the reduction with H2 produced both Cr3+ and Cr2+
species. Fig. 3C shows the spectra of the catalysts reduced at
600 C in the region from 500 to 1000 nm, where the d–d transi-
tions of the Cr3+ and Cr2+ species appear. With an increasing Cr
content the maximum of the band shifts from 780 nm to 630 nm.
The position of the latter maximum is very close to that reported
for the spin allowed d-d transition (4A2g ? 4T2g) of Cr3+ ions in
octahedral coordination. Such a signiﬁcant batochromic shift sug-
gests that the Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio species increases together with Crtotal
content increase. A similar observation based on the quantitative
H2-TPR data reported for Crx/SiO2 was made by Hakuli et al. [29].
For the investigated samples, the quantitative data derived from
the reduction proﬁles are summarized in Table 1. H2 consumption
increases rapidly with the Crtotal content up to 5 wt.% and then
only slightly when it changes to 7 wt.% of Cr., whereas remains
almost constant for higher Crtotal loadings (10 and 15 wt.%). The
quantitative H2-TPR data indicate that the maximum number of

redox (reducible) Cr sites (Crred) is achieved in the case of the Cr7/
SBA-1 sample. The samples with higher Crtotal contents (Cr10/SBA-
1 and Cr15/SBA-1) possess almost similar Crred concentration what
clearly indicates that after exceeding the saturation of SBA-1, non-
redox Cr species are produced. According to the EPR and XRD re-
sults we can attribute the nonredox Cr species to a-Cr2O3.
Furthermore, progressive formation of nonredox species leads to
the decrease of the H2/Crtotal ratio (the last column in Table 1).
The calculated H2/Crtotal ratio, decreases from 1.59 to 0.49 as the
Crtotal content in the catalysts increases from 1.01 to 14.5 wt.%.
To sum up, the combination of TPR with in situ UV–vis DR inves-
tigations indicates that in the case of impregnated Crx/SBA-1,
reduction with hydrogen leads to the formation of Cr3+ and par-
tially of Cr2+ species. The presence of the strongly reduced Cr2+ spe-
cies depends critically on chromium dispersion. A high dispersion
allows for a deep reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+ species, while at a lower
dispersion (higher concentration) Cr3+ species are the primary spe-
cies formed during the reduction with H2.
3.2. Catalytic performance of Crx/SBA-1
The catalytic performance of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts was inves-
tigated in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2
(DHP–CO2). The initial speciﬁc activity, conversions of propane
and carbon dioxide, selectivity to propene, ethane, ethene, meth-
ane as well as the ratio of the byproducts (CO/H2) are summarized
in Table 3.
In general, the conversion of propane over Crx/SB-1 catalysts
rises sharply with the Crtotal content increasing up to 5 wt.%. For
the Cr7/SBA-1 catalyst only a small ramp of conversion is observed
to reach its maximum (37.7%). A further increase of the Cr content
(>7 wt.% Cr) leads to a small decrease of propane conversion. Anal-
ogous changes were observed for the H2 consumption during TPR
measurements. Therefore, this unfavorable effect observed at high
Cr total content is caused mainly by the formation of crystalline
Cr2O3. In many reactions, including dehydrogenation of hydrocar-
bons, a-Cr2O3 particles were found to be less active than the dis-
persed Cr species, mainly because not all Cr atoms in the a-Cr2O3
particles are accessible to the reactants. The XRD, Raman, and
EPR show that crystalline a-Cr2O3 is produced predominantly with
increasing Crtotal. The formation of crystalline Cr2O3 particles ex-
plains also a monotonic decrease of the speciﬁc activity values
with the Crtotal content.
The primary product, propene, is produced over all examined
Crx/SBA-1 materials with high selectivity in the range between
85 and 93%. In addition to propene, a small amount of lighter
hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and ethene are produced.
In the investigated conditions, these byproducts are formed with
equal selectivity in the presence and absence of CO2 what suggests
their similar origin. According to the recent investigations of Frid-
man [36], in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the main
source of byproducts is propene which is converted by the hydro-
cracking reaction to ethene and methane (Scheme 1).
Next, newly formed ethene is further converted to ethane and
methane by hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions, respec-
tively. The contribution of the direct conversion of propane to light
hydrocarbons is much smaller.
Fig. 4A displays the variation of propene yield with the Crtotal
content. The catalytic performance of the Crx/SBA-1 samples
was compared with the results obtained for the Cr/SBA-1 catalysts
prepared by the direct method and reported by us previously [19].
In both cases the yield rises sharply at a low Cr content and re-
mains almost constant for the catalysts obtained by impregnation,
whereas in the case of the catalysts obtained by the direct method
the yield of propene drops rapidly above 3.5 wt.% of Cr. This
clearly
illustrates
that
the
Crx/SBA-1
catalysts
obtained
by
impregnation exhibit better catalytic performance than those ob-
tained by the direct method. The reason for this is connected with
the higher number of the redox Cr species (Crred) obtained by the
impregnation method. This can be clearly evidenced by the
inspection of Fig. 4B which presents the correlation between the
yield of propene and the H2 consumption (from H2-TPR measure-
ments) tantamount with the number of Crred species. In the series
of the Crx/SBA-1 samples the maximum H2 consumption is
achieved for the sample containing 7 wt.% (1413 lmolH2 g–1
cat),
while in the series of the Cr/SBA-1 materials the maximum value
is already obtained for the sample containing only 3.5 wt.% of
Crtotal (663 lmolH2 g1
cat) [19].
From the UV–vis results (Fig. 2A) it is clear that Cr6+ species are
the main redox sites present on the surface of calcined Crx/SBA-1
catalysts. To trace the redox behavior of these species during the
dehydrogenation process, in situ UV–vis DR spectroscopy was ap-
plied. Fig. 5A–C displays the spectra collected during the ﬁrst min-
ute of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of
CO2.
These results clearly indicate that, in the initial step of the pro-
cess, Cr6+ species potentially active in the ODP–CO2 are reduced
rapidly to Cr3+ and Cr2+ states. Such a fast reduction occurs at
any feed composition what clearly indicates that CO2 is a very
weak oxidizing agent and under reaction conditions it does not

suppress the Cr6+ species reduction. With an increasing time-on-
stream (TOS) the intensity of the background grows progressively
(Fig. 5D–F). Such difference of intensity can be caused by coke for-
mation (see Section 3.3). In the whole investigated range the spec-
tra intensity is higher in the process carried out in the presence of
CO2 as shown in Fig. 5G. A comparison of the spectra recorded
in situ after 10 min on-stream additionally indicate some small dif-
ferences in the shape as a function of CO2 content (Fig. 5G and in-
set). A careful investigation of the d-d region indicates a small shift
of the maximum at about 750 nm into the lower wavelengths sug-
gesting a variation of the Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio with the feed composition.
During the process carried out in the presence of CO2 the band
maximum is shifted to a lower wavelength (about 50 nm) that
may indicate the higher Cr3+/Cr2+ ratio in the dehydrogenation of
propane as compared to the CO2-free reaction.
The results of the in situ UV–vis DR measurements obtained
during the ﬁrst 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the
dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species
play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they
are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit
high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
[29,37,38]. In the presence of CO2 an additional oxidative pathway
of propene formation is activated. As it was pointed out in the
introduction several oxidative pathways between different Cr spe-
cies have been proposed in literature. Our in situ UV–vis DRS re-
sults, however, indicate only very small differences between the
oxidation state of chromium species during the process carried
out in the presence and absence of CO2 showing its very weak oxi-
dative ability. Because in reaction conditions both types of Cr3+ and
Cr2+ species coexist, it cannot be excluded that these species may
also participate in the Cr3+/Cr2+ redox cycle. Such redox cycle be-
tween Cr3+ and Cr2+ species was ﬁrstly reported in the ODH of eth-
ylbenzene in the presence of CO2 [23,24].
Scheme 2 summarizes the conclusions concerning the role of
the chromium sites identiﬁed on the surface of SBA-1 during the
dehydrogenation of propane. The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materi-
als is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites
forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites).
This type of cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation. The re-
duced forms identiﬁed as Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in the
nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Presumably, also non-
redox Cr3+ species (CrOy) forming chromium(III) oxide agglomer-
ates may participate in the nonoxidative pathway. However, the
contribution of nonredox Cr sites in propane conversion is much
smaller.
In addition, it is known that the reverse water–gas shift reaction
(RWGS) can proceed over redox and nonredox Cr sites [18,23,39].
This reaction enhances the yield of propene by consumption of
hydrogen which is produced in the nonoxidative pathway (in equi-
librium propane dehydrogenation, Scheme 1). To explore the pos-
sible inﬂuence of the RWGS reaction on propane dehydrogenation
over the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts the reaction with gas mixture of
CO2:H2:He = 5:1:9 was monitored. Fig. 6 displays the variation of
the formation rate of carbon monoxide with the Crtotal content.
The values obtained at the same conditions in the CO2-assisted
propane dehydrogenation are reported for comparison.
In both, the RWGS and DHP–CO2, the variation of the initial CO
formation rate with Crtotal has a similar trend: the rate increases to-
gether with the Crtotal content increase up to about 5 wt.% and
then, only slightly at higher Crtotal loadings. Moreover, the trends
reported in Fig. 6 resemble the relationship between the propene
yield and Crtotal content (Fig. 4A). Taking these observations and
the relationship between Crtotal content and the concentration of
redox Cr species into consideration, it may be concluded that in
the RWGS reaction the CO formation rate rises together with the
concentration of Cr redox species in CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts similar
as in the case of DHP–CO2. This conclusion is in agreement with
previously reported results [18,23]. Ohishi et al. [23] reported that
over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction occurs via the
redox mechanism in which Cr3+ species are successively reduced to
Cr2+ ones by H2 and then reoxidized by CO2. The presence of both
species during the RWGS reaction was conﬁrmed by operando UV–
vis DR measurements (not show).
To sum up, dispersed Cr redox species exhibit high activity in
the RWGS reaction what presumably additionally promotes the
dehydrogenation of propane.
3.3. Catalyst deactivation
Part of the reactivity of the active sites described above may be
lost by coke formation resulting from excessive cracking and
carbonization of propane. This process leads to a darkening of

the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts what can be followed with in situ UV–vis
DR spectra as an increase of the background intensity in the whole
spectral range (Fig. 5D–F). Taking similar observations into ac-
count, several researches successively applied UV–vis DR spectros-
copy for tracking/controlling coke formation and burning over
chromium oxide-based catalysts during dehydrogenation and
regeneration steps, respectively [40–43]. The intensity of the UV–
vis DR signal at 1000 nm has been proposed for monitoring the
darkening of the sample because at this wavelength no speciﬁc
absorption bands are present [40]. Fig. 5H shows the variation of
the yield of propene with TOS for the exemplary case of the Cr5/
SBA-1 catalyst which indicates its progressive decrease for all of
the studied gas compositions. The concomitant changes of the
intensity of the UV–vis spectra at 1000 nm are depicted in Fig. 5I.
The correlated decrease of the yield of propene and increase of
the signal intensity at 1000 nm indicates that the loss of the cata-
lytic activity is caused by coke formation. Similar progressive in-
creases of the intensity with TOS were reported previously over
CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst commercially applied in dehydrogenation of
light hydrocarbons without CO2 [42,43]. Moreover, it is clear that
the darkening of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst proceed with different
rates depending on the CO2 concentration. The slowest changes

of the signal are observed in the dehydrogenation of propane in the
absence of CO2, while during the process with CO2 the increase of
the signal is much faster. In addition, the darkening rate grows to-
gether with the concentration of CO2 in the feed. These spectro-
scopic observations are in good agreement with the TPO and TG
analysis data reported for various Cr-containing siliceous materi-
als, such as Cr/MCM-41 [13,23], Cr/SiO2 [13], and Cr/SBA-1 system
obtained by the direct method [19]. In all of these cases, larger
amounts of coke are produced in the CO2-assisted processes. The
observed changes can be explained by a higher reactivity of pro-
pene than that of propane. Therefore, the higher conversion of pro-
pane to more reactive propene results in a larger amount of coke.
The difference in the signal intensity at 1000 nm observed for var-
ious CO2/C3H8 ratios in the feed can be explained likewise.
Coke deposition is not the only way of chromium oxide-based
catalysts deactivation. The formation of inactive Cr species and
even a possible collapse of the pore structure (in the case of sili-
ceous mesoporous materials) could be the additional reasons. To
get more insight into the observed deactivation process, the stabil-
ity of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst in 4 consecutive dehydrogenation-
regeneration-puriﬁcation cycles was investigated (Fig. 7).
During the dehydrogenation step (DH) the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst
gradually lost its activity with the time-on-stream. This negative
effect is eliminated by air treatment in the regeneration step (R).
During this step the coke is removed and the reduced Cr species
are oxidized (regeneration of the precursors of the active sites).
Ancillary TG-DTA analysis indicates that in the case of used Cr5/
SBA-1 catalyst coke reacts with oxygen in the temperature range
between 320 and 450 C. At higher temperatures there are no more
changes in the sample mass what indicates that the regeneration of
the catalyst at 550 C is sufﬁcient for complete coke burning. How-
ever, a comparison of the propane conversion in consecutive DH
steps reveals a small irreversible deactivation which cannot be
eliminated by air treatment. To unravel this type of deactivation
of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst, low temperature N2-physisorption and
H2-TPR was performed after 4 DH cycles, as these two methods
give basic information about the changes in the texture and the
number of redox Cr species, respectively. Table 4 lists the quantita-
tive information about the fraction of loss of the speciﬁc surface
area (DSBET), total pore volume (DVP), average pore diameter
(DDBJH), and hydrogen consumption (DH2-consumption).
Inspection of the obtained results indicates that there are no
signiﬁcant differences in the texture and the redox properties be-
tween the fresh and the regenerated Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst after 4
DH cycles. SBET, VP, and DBJH values decrease slightly what indicates
that in general, the cubic pore structure of the SBA-1 is preserved
during the process. The slight decrease of the H2-consumption
shows that a small fraction (7.4%) of Cr redox species is lost.
The results of post-mortem characterization of the Cr5/SBA-1
catalyst as well as the in situ UV–vis DR experiments led to the con-
clusion that the primary reason of deactivation during the propane
dehydrogenation reaction is indeed coke formation. Irreversible
deactivation of the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst caused by either pore struc-
ture destruction and/or inactive species formation has a smaller
impact. Similar good thermal stability has been reported in the
case of other mesoporous chromium catalysts for dehydrogenation
of alkanes in the presence and absence of CO2 [13,19,38].
4. Conclusions
Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dis-
persed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were pre-
pared by simple incipient wetness impregnation. The oxidation
state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of
SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content. In the calcined catalysts chro-
mium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and
agglomerated Cr3+ species. Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent
species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates
dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of

dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystal-
line a-Cr2O3, coexist. As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/
SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of
high-valent Cr species. The in situ UV–vis DR results obtained dur-
ing dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of
CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly
already at the beginning of the process. The resultant Cr2+ and
Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles responsible for high catalytic
activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials. The observed partial deactiva-
tion of the catalysts can be quantiﬁed and accounted for by exces-
sive coke formation.
