          [1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

          Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance, particularly when supported on SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond. The optimal Cr loading range appears to be 1.7-8.0 wt%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, the species evolve from mono- and dichromates to polychromates and eventually Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) at loadings above 3.0 wt%.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: More dispersed chromates correlate with higher catalyst activity.

3. Support properties: SiO2 and diamond supports have shown promising results, likely due to their ability to stabilize and disperse chromium species effectively.

4. Presence of oxygen: Adding up to 5.0 vol% O2 to the reaction mixture significantly increases catalyst activity and stability, while also improving total olefin selectivity despite some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The interaction between chromium species and the support material affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，铬基催化剂表现出最佳性能，特别是当它们负载在SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石上时。最佳的Cr负载范围似乎是1.7-8.0 wt%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的演变：随着Cr负载量的增加，物种从单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐演变为多铬酸盐，最终在负载量超过3.0 wt%时形成Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

2. 铬物种的分散程度：更分散的铬酸盐与更高的催化剂活性相关。

3. 载体性质：SiO2和金刚石载体显示出有前景的结果，可能是由于它们能够有效地稳定和分散铬物种。

4. 氧气的存在：向反应混合物中添加最多5.0 vol%的O2显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性，同时也提高了总烯烃选择性，尽管丙烯和异丁烯的选择性有所下降。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和载体性质的函数在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
