Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on SiO2 and diamond, have shown the best performance. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have yielded the most promising results.

2. Chromium loading: Effective catalysts typically contain 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr.

3. Chromium species: The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates are present. For loadings higher than 3.0 wt%, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) is also observed.

4. Dispersion: More dispersed chromates appear to correlate with higher catalyst activity.

These factors contribute to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of various chromium species and their dispersion on the support play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，铬基催化剂，特别是以SiO2和金刚石为载体的催化剂，表现出最佳性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石获得了最有前景的结果。

2. 铬负载量：有效催化剂通常含有1.7-8.0 wt%的铬。

3. 铬物种：铬物种的演变取决于负载量。在所有负载量下，都存在以单铬酸盐、重铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式的Cr(VI)离子。对于高于3.0 wt%的负载量，还观察到Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

4. 分散度：更分散的铬酸盐似乎与更高的催化剂活性相关。

这些因素共同影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体活性和选择性。各种铬物种的存在及其在载体上的分散对确定催化剂的性能起着至关重要的作用。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance among these. Specifically, chromium supported on SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have yielded the most promising results, with optimal chromium loadings ranging from 1.7 to 8.0 wt%.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the support, chromium loading, and the evolution of chromium species. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions are present in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates. However, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) only appears when the chromium loading exceeds 3.0 wt%.

The catalytic activity appears to be correlated with more dispersed chromate species. This suggests that the dispersion of chromium on the support plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance. The support material (e.g., SiO2 or diamond) and its properties likely influence this dispersion, thereby affecting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被测试用于CO2-ODHP反应，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，铬基催化剂在这些催化剂中表现最佳。特别是，负载在SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石上的铬催化剂产生了最有希望的结果，最佳铬负载量范围为1.7至8.0 wt%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体的性质、铬的负载量以及铬物种的演变。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的变化而演变。在所有负载量下，都存在以单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式的Cr(VI)离子。然而，只有当铬负载量超过3.0 wt%时，才会出现Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

催化活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐物种相关。这表明铬在载体上的分散程度在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。载体材料（如SiO2或金刚石）及其性质可能会影响这种分散，从而影响CO2-ODHP反应中的整体催化活性和选择性。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts supported on different materials have shown the best performance. Among supported systems, SiO2 and diamond with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr loading have yielded the most promising results.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the support, chromium loading, and the evolution of chromium species. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is closely related to the loading amount and support properties. 

At lower loadings, Cr(VI) species in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates are predominant. As the loading increases beyond 3.0 wt%, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) begins to form. The catalyst activity appears to be correlated with more dispersed chromate species, suggesting that the distribution and oxidation state of chromium play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

The support material also influences the dispersion and nature of chromium species, with SiO2 and diamond supports showing particularly promising results. The interaction between the chromium species and the support material likely affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，负载在不同材料上的铬基催化剂表现出最佳性能。在负载系统中，负载1.7-8.0 wt%铬的SiO2和金刚石取得了最有前景的结果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体的性质、铬的负载量以及铬物种的演变。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关。

在较低负载量时，以单铬酸盐、重铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr(VI)物种占主导地位。当负载量超过3.0 wt%时，开始形成Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。催化剂活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐物种相关，这表明铬的分布和氧化态在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。

载体材料也影响铬物种的分散和性质，其中SiO2和金刚石载体显示出特别有前景的结果。铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用可能影响催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance, particularly when supported on SiO2, mesoporous SiO2, and diamond. The optimal Cr loading range appears to be 1.7-8.0 wt%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, the species evolve from mono- and dichromates to polychromates and eventually Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) at loadings above 3.0 wt%.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: More dispersed chromates correlate with higher catalyst activity.

3. Support properties: SiO2 and diamond supports have shown promising results, likely due to their ability to stabilize and disperse chromium species effectively.

4. Presence of oxygen: Adding up to 5.0 vol% O2 to the reaction mixture significantly increases catalyst activity and stability, while also improving total olefin selectivity despite some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity.

These factors highlight the importance of controlling chromium species distribution, maximizing dispersion, and optimizing reaction conditions to achieve high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions using supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. 铬物种的分散程度：更分散的铬酸盐与更高的催化剂活性相关。

3. 载体性质：SiO2和金刚石载体显示出有前景的结果，可能是由于它们能够有效地稳定和分散铬物种。

4. 氧气的存在：向反应混合物中添加最多5.0 vol%的O2显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性，同时也提高了总烯烃选择性，尽管丙烯和异丁烯的选择性有所下降。

这些因素突出了控制铬物种分布、最大化分散度以及优化反应条件的重要性，以在使用负载型Cr2O3催化剂进行CO2-ODHP反应时实现高活性和选择性。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts supported on different materials have shown the best performance. Among supported systems, chromium on silica (SiO2) and diamond have yielded the most promising results.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Optimal performance was observed with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr loading.

2. Support material: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have been particularly effective.

3. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, different chromium species form on the support surface.

4. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher activity correlates with more dispersed chromates.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is as follows:

1. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions are present as mono-, di-, and polychromates.
2. Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) forms only at Cr loadings higher than 3.0 wt%.

The support properties influence the dispersion and nature of chromium species, which in turn affects catalytic performance. More dispersed chromates appear to contribute to higher catalyst activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，负载在不同材料上的铬基催化剂表现出最佳性能。在负载型体系中，负载在二氧化硅（SiO2）和金刚石上的铬催化剂取得了最有前景的结果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：在1.7-8.0 wt%的铬负载量范围内观察到最佳性能。

2. 载体材料：SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石特别有效。

3. 铬物种演变：随着铬负载量的增加，不同的铬物种在载体表面形成。

4. 铬物种的分散度：更高的活性与更分散的铬酸盐相关。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量的演变如下：

1. 在所有负载量下，Cr(VI)离子以单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在。
2. 只有在铬负载量高于3.0 wt%时，才会形成Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

载体性质影响铬物种的分散度和性质，进而影响催化性能。更分散的铬酸盐似乎有助于提高催化剂活性。
