[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts supported on different materials have shown the best performance. Among supported systems, chromium on silica (SiO2) and diamond have yielded the most promising results.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Optimal performance was observed with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr loading.

2. Support material: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have been particularly effective.

3. Chromium species evolution: As Cr loading increases, different chromium species form on the support surface.

4. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher activity correlates with more dispersed chromates.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is as follows:

1. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions are present as mono-, di-, and polychromates.
2. Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) forms only at Cr loadings higher than 3.0 wt%.

The support properties influence the dispersion and nature of chromium species, which in turn affects catalytic performance. More dispersed chromates appear to contribute to higher catalyst activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，负载在不同材料上的铬基催化剂表现出最佳性能。在负载型体系中，负载在二氧化硅（SiO2）和金刚石上的铬催化剂取得了最有前景的结果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：在1.7-8.0 wt%的铬负载量范围内观察到最佳性能。

2. 载体材料：SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石特别有效。

3. 铬物种演变：随着铬负载量的增加，不同的铬物种在载体表面形成。

4. 铬物种的分散度：更高的活性与更分散的铬酸盐相关。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量的演变如下：

1. 在所有负载量下，Cr(VI)离子以单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在。
2. 只有在铬负载量高于3.0 wt%时，才会形成Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

载体性质影响铬物种的分散度和性质，进而影响催化性能。更分散的铬酸盐似乎有助于提高催化剂活性。
