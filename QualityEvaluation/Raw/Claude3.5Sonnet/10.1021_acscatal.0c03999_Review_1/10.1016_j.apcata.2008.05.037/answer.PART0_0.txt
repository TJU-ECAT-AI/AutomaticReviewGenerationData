[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on SiO2 and diamond, have shown the best performance. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Support material: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have yielded the most promising results.

2. Chromium loading: Effective catalysts typically contain 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr.

3. Chromium species: The evolution of chromium species depends on the loading. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates are present. For loadings higher than 3.0 wt%, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) is also observed.

4. Dispersion: More dispersed chromates appear to correlate with higher catalyst activity.

These factors contribute to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of various chromium species and their dispersion on the support play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，铬基催化剂，特别是以SiO2和金刚石为载体的催化剂，表现出最佳性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石获得了最有前景的结果。

2. 铬负载量：有效催化剂通常含有1.7-8.0 wt%的铬。

3. 铬物种：铬物种的演变取决于负载量。在所有负载量下，都存在以单铬酸盐、重铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式的Cr(VI)离子。对于高于3.0 wt%的负载量，还观察到Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

4. 分散度：更分散的铬酸盐似乎与更高的催化剂活性相关。

这些因素共同影响了催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体活性和选择性。各种铬物种的存在及其在载体上的分散对确定催化剂的性能起着至关重要的作用。
