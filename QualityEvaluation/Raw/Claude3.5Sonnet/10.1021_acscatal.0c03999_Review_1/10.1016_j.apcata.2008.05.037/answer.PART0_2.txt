[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts supported on different materials have shown the best performance. Among supported systems, SiO2 and diamond with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr loading have yielded the most promising results.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the support, chromium loading, and the evolution of chromium species. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is closely related to the loading amount and support properties. 

At lower loadings, Cr(VI) species in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates are predominant. As the loading increases beyond 3.0 wt%, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) begins to form. The catalyst activity appears to be correlated with more dispersed chromate species, suggesting that the distribution and oxidation state of chromium play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

The support material also influences the dispersion and nature of chromium species, with SiO2 and diamond supports showing particularly promising results. The interaction between the chromium species and the support material likely affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被用于CO2-ODHP测试，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，负载在不同材料上的铬基催化剂表现出最佳性能。在负载系统中，负载1.7-8.0 wt%铬的SiO2和金刚石取得了最有前景的结果。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体的性质、铬的负载量以及铬物种的演变。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关。

在较低负载量时，以单铬酸盐、重铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr(VI)物种占主导地位。当负载量超过3.0 wt%时，开始形成Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。催化剂活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐物种相关，这表明铬的分布和氧化态在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。

载体材料也影响铬物种的分散和性质，其中SiO2和金刚石载体显示出特别有前景的结果。铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用可能影响催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性和选择性。
