[1] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[2] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-ODHP, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides. However, chromium-based catalysts have shown the best performance among these. Specifically, chromium supported on SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond have yielded the most promising results, with optimal chromium loadings ranging from 1.7 to 8.0 wt%.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the support, chromium loading, and the evolution of chromium species. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the chromium species evolve as a function of loading and support properties. At all loadings, Cr(VI) ions are present in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates. However, Cr(III) oxide (α-Cr2O3) only appears when the chromium loading exceeds 3.0 wt%.

The catalytic activity appears to be correlated with more dispersed chromate species. This suggests that the dispersion of chromium on the support plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance. The support material (e.g., SiO2 or diamond) and its properties likely influence this dispersion, thereby affecting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被测试用于CO2-ODHP反应，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀土金属氧化物。然而，铬基催化剂在这些催化剂中表现最佳。特别是，负载在SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石上的铬催化剂产生了最有希望的结果，最佳铬负载量范围为1.7至8.0 wt%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括载体的性质、铬的负载量以及铬物种的演变。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的变化而演变。在所有负载量下，都存在以单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式的Cr(VI)离子。然而，只有当铬负载量超过3.0 wt%时，才会出现Cr(III)氧化物（α-Cr2O3）。

催化活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐物种相关。这表明铬在载体上的分散程度在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。载体材料（如SiO2或金刚石）及其性质可能会影响这种分散，从而影响CO2-ODHP反应中的整体催化活性和选择性。
