[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[5] "Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table. The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

The Cr/MSU-x catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr loading: Lower Cr loading produces higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loading leads to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading range: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%, with maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occurring between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Trade-off between conversion and selectivity: As Cr loading increases, propane conversion increases but propylene selectivity decreases slightly.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous MSU-x support likely contributes to the catalyst's high activity compared to other reported catalysts.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from dispersed, higher oxidation state species at low loadings to bulk Cr2O3 crystals at higher loadings. This evolution affects the balance between activity and selectivity, with an optimal range for overall performance.

Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性，丙烷转化率为36.8%，丙烯选择性为89.1%。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：较低的Cr负载产生较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的负载导致表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。

2. 最佳负载范围：丙烷转化率和CO2转化率随Cr含量增加而增加，直至5 wt%，最大丙烷转化率和丙烯产率出现在5-12 wt% Cr2O3负载范围内。

3. 转化率和选择性的权衡：随着Cr负载量增加，丙烷转化率增加，但丙烯选择性略有下降。

4. 载体性质：介孔MSU-x载体可能是该催化剂比其他报道的催化剂具有更高活性的原因。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变呈现从低负载时分散的高氧化态物种到高负载时块状Cr2O3晶体的转变。这种演变影响了活性和选择性之间的平衡，存在一个整体性能最佳的范围。
