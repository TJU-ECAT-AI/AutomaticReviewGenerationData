[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[5] "Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, including catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."

The Cr/MSU-x catalyst shows excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Lower loadings produce higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading range: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%. Maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occur between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Trade-off between conversion and selectivity: As Cr loading increases, propane conversion increases but propylene selectivity decreases slightly.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous MSU-x support likely contributes to the catalyst's high performance compared to other catalysts in literature.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from dispersed, high oxidation state species at low loadings to bulk Cr2O3 crystals at high loadings. This affects the balance between activity and selectivity, with an optimal range for overall performance.

Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性，丙烷转化率为36.8%，丙烯选择性为89.1%。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：较低的负载量产生较高氧化态的铬物种，而较高的负载量导致表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。

2. 最佳负载范围：丙烷转化率和CO2转化率随铬含量增加而增加，直至5 wt%。在5-12 wt% Cr2O3负载范围内达到最大丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

3. 转化率和选择性之间的权衡：随着铬负载量增加，丙烷转化率增加，但丙烯选择性略有下降。

4. 载体性质：介孔MSU-x载体可能是该催化剂相比文献中其他催化剂具有高性能的原因之一。

铬物种随负载量的演变显示，从低负载量时的分散、高氧化态物种过渡到高负载量时的块状Cr2O3晶体。这影响了活性和选择性之间的平衡，存在一个整体性能最佳的范围。

The study primarily focuses on chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on mesoporous silica (MSU-x) for CO2-ODHP. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr loading: Lower loadings result in higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%, with maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occurring between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Selectivity vs. conversion trade-off: As Cr loading increases, propylene selectivity decreases from 95.3% to about 89%, while conversion increases.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous structure of MSU-x is preserved after Cr loading, which likely contributes to the catalyst's high activity.

5. Performance comparison: Cr/MSU-x shows higher propane conversion compared to most other catalysts reported in literature, demonstrating its effectiveness for CO2-ODHP.

The evolution of Cr species as a function of loading appears to be critical, with an optimal range balancing the formation of active Cr species and avoiding excessive bulk Cr2O3 formation. The mesoporous support likely plays a role in dispersing Cr species and facilitating reactant access to active sites.

该研究主要关注了以中孔二氧化硅(MSU-x)为载体的氧化铬(Cr2O3)催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：较低的负载量会形成较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的负载量会导致表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。

2. 最佳负载量：随着Cr含量增加到5 wt%，丙烷转化率和CO2转化率都会增加，在5-12 wt% Cr2O3负载量之间达到最大丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

3. 选择性与转化率的权衡：随着Cr负载量的增加，丙烯选择性从95.3%下降到约89%，而转化率增加。

4. 载体性质：MSU-x的中孔结构在Cr负载后得以保存，这可能有助于催化剂的高活性。

5. 性能比较：与文献报道的大多数其他催化剂相比，Cr/MSU-x显示出更高的丙烷转化率，证明了其在CO2-ODHP反应中的有效性。

Cr物种随负载量的演变似乎至关重要，需要在形成活性Cr物种和避免过多块状Cr2O3形成之间找到最佳平衡。中孔载体可能在分散Cr物种和促进反应物接触活性位点方面发挥作用。
