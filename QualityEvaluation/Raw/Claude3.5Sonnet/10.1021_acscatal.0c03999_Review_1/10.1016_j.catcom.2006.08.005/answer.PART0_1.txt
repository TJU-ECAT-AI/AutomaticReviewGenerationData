[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation. Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly."

[4] "Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, including catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."

Chromium-based catalysts, particularly Cr/MSU-x, show excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Lower loadings result in higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading range: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%, with maximum conversions and propylene yield obtained between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Support properties: The mesoporous structure of MSU-x provides high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, contributing to the catalyst's performance.

4. Oxidation state of chromium: The balance between different Cr species affects activity and selectivity.

5. Reaction conditions: Temperature and reactant ratios influence conversion and selectivity.

Cr/MSU-x catalysts show higher propane conversion compared to most other catalysts reported in literature, highlighting the importance of the mesoporous support and optimized Cr loading in enhancing catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP.

铬基催化剂，尤其是Cr/MSU-x，在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：较低的负载量导致形成较高氧化态的铬物种，而较高的负载量导致表面形成块状氧化铬（Cr2O3）晶体。

2. 最佳负载范围：丙烷转化率和CO2转化率随铬含量增加而增加，直至5 wt%，在5-12 wt% Cr2O3负载量之间获得最大转化率和丙烯产率。

3. 载体性质：MSU-x的介孔结构提供了高比表面积和均匀的纳米孔道，有助于催化剂的性能提升。

4. 铬的氧化态：不同铬物种之间的平衡影响活性和选择性。

5. 反应条件：温度和反应物比例影响转化率和选择性。

与文献报道的大多数其他催化剂相比，Cr/MSU-x催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率，突显了介孔载体和优化铬负载量在提高CO2-ODHP催化性能方面的重要性。
