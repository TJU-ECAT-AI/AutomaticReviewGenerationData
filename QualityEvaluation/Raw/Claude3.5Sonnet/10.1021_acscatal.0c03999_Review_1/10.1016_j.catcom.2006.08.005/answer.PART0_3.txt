[1] "Excellent results in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selectivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[4] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[5] "Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table. The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

The study primarily focuses on chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on mesoporous silica (MSU-x) for CO2-ODHP. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr loading: Lower loadings result in higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loadings lead to bulk Cr2O3 crystals on the surface. 

2. Optimal loading: Propane conversion and CO2 conversion increase with Cr content up to 5 wt%, with maximum propane conversion and propylene yield occurring between 5-12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

3. Selectivity vs. conversion trade-off: As Cr loading increases, propylene selectivity decreases from 95.3% to about 89%, while conversion increases.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous structure of MSU-x is preserved after Cr loading, which likely contributes to the catalyst's high activity.

5. Performance comparison: Cr/MSU-x shows higher propane conversion compared to most other catalysts reported in literature, demonstrating its effectiveness for CO2-ODHP.

The evolution of Cr species as a function of loading appears to be critical, with an optimal range balancing the formation of active Cr species and avoiding excessive bulk Cr2O3 formation. The mesoporous support likely plays a role in dispersing Cr species and facilitating reactant access to active sites.

该研究主要关注了以中孔二氧化硅(MSU-x)为载体的氧化铬(Cr2O3)催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：较低的负载量会形成较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的负载量会导致表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。

2. 最佳负载量：随着Cr含量增加到5 wt%，丙烷转化率和CO2转化率都会增加，在5-12 wt% Cr2O3负载量之间达到最大丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

3. 选择性与转化率的权衡：随着Cr负载量的增加，丙烯选择性从95.3%下降到约89%，而转化率增加。

4. 载体性质：MSU-x的中孔结构在Cr负载后得以保存，这可能有助于催化剂的高活性。

5. 性能比较：与文献报道的大多数其他催化剂相比，Cr/MSU-x显示出更高的丙烷转化率，证明了其在CO2-ODHP反应中的有效性。

Cr物种随负载量的演变似乎至关重要，需要在形成活性Cr物种和避免过多块状Cr2O3形成之间找到最佳平衡。中孔载体可能在分散Cr物种和促进反应物接触活性位点方面发挥作用。
