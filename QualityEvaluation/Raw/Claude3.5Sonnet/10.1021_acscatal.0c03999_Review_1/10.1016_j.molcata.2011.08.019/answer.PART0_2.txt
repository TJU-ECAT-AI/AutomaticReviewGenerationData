[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."

[3] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point - IEP) [29-31]."

[4] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,32-35]."

[5] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. 

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the support: The support material significantly affects catalyst performance. For example, CO2 has a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 but a negative effect on Cr2O3/Al2O3.

2. Oxidation states of chromium: Higher oxidation states, particularly Cr6+ species, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

3. Structure of chromium species: Mono- and polychromates are the dominant forms of Cr6+ species below monolayer coverage.

4. Chromium-silica interaction: This is influenced by factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions, Cr content, and properties of the silica support.

5. Chromium loading: Below monolayer coverage, highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate. Above this threshold, less active amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 forms.

6. Preparation conditions: Factors like calcination temperature affect the final state of chromium species.

7. Accessibility of chromium sites: Highly dispersed species are more accessible to reactants, while crystalline α-Cr2O3 reduces accessibility and negatively impacts catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to loading and support properties. At low loadings, highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate, which are believed to be catalytically active. As loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, less active α-Cr2O3 forms, reducing overall catalytic performance. The properties of the support material, such as surface area and interactions with chromium, play a crucial role in determining the dispersion and oxidation state of the chromium species.

文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的性能，其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体的性质：载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。例如，CO2对Cr2O3/SiO2有促进作用，但对Cr2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。

2. 铬的氧化态：较高的氧化态，特别是Cr6+物种，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

3. 铬物种的结构：在单层覆盖度以下，单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐是Cr6+物种的主要形式。

4. 铬-硅相互作用：这受到诸如Cr前体类型、制备条件、Cr含量和硅载体性质等因素的影响。

5. 铬负载量：在单层覆盖度以下，高度分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位。超过这个阈值，会形成活性较低的无定形和结晶α-Cr2O3。

6. 制备条件：如煅烧温度等因素影响铬物种的最终状态。

7. 铬位点的可及性：高度分散的物种更容易被反应物接触，而结晶α-Cr2O3降低了可及性，对催化活性产生负面影响。

支持的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关。在低负载量时，高度分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位，被认为具有催化活性。随着负载量增加超过单层覆盖度，形成活性较低的α-Cr2O3，降低了整体催化性能。载体材料的性质，如比表面积和与铬的相互作用，在决定铬物种的分散度和氧化态方面起着至关重要的作用。
