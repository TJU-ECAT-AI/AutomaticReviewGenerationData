[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity"

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP, with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Oxidation states of chromium species
2. Structure of chromium species
3. Chromium-silica interaction
4. Chromium loading

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is as follows:

1. At low loadings (below monolayer coverage), highly dispersed Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates dominate. These species are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

2. As loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 begin to form. The presence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 negatively impacts catalytic activity.

3. The concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts is directly proportional to the rate of propene formation, indicating their importance in the catalytic process.

4. Support properties, such as surface area and pore structure, influence the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active chromium species.

The catalytic performance is optimized when there is a high dispersion of Cr6+ species on the support surface, without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases. This is typically achieved at lower chromium loadings on high surface area supports.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP，其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的氧化态
2. 铬物种的结构
3. 铬-二氧化硅相互作用
4. 铬的负载量

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变如下：

1. 在低负载量（单层覆盖以下）时，高度分散的Cr6+物种以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式占主导地位。这些物种被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

2. 当负载量超过单层覆盖时，无定形和结晶态α-Cr2O3开始形成。结晶态α-Cr2O3的存在会对催化活性产生负面影响。

3. 焙烧催化剂中Cr6+物种的浓度与丙烯生成速率成正比，表明它们在催化过程中的重要性。

4. 载体性质，如比表面积和孔结构，影响铬物种的分散性和可接近性。通常，高比表面积的载体能够更好地分散活性铬物种。

当载体表面上有高度分散的Cr6+物种，同时没有形成体相Cr2O3时，催化性能达到最佳。这通常在高比表面积载体上使用较低铬负载量时实现。
