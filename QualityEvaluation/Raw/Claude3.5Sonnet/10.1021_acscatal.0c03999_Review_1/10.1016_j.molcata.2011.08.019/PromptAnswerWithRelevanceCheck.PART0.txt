[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-containing catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium: Cr6+ species, present as mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure of Cr species: Highly dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline -Cr2O3, which has a negative influence on catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms to reactants.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: The interaction between chromium species and the silica support affects the dispersion and stability of active sites.

4. Loading: As chromium loading increases, the formation of less active crystalline -Cr2O3 becomes more likely, potentially reducing overall catalyst performance.

5. Support properties: The surface area and pore structure of the support influence the dispersion of Cr species. Mesoporous supports with higher surface areas can achieve better dispersion of chromium species compared to conventional silicas.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In-situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已经被研究用于CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷脱氢），其中含铬和镓的催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

1. 铬的氧化态：Cr6+物种，以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。丙烯生成速率几乎与焙烧催化剂中Cr6+物种的浓度成正比。

2. Cr物种的结构：高度分散的Cr物种比晶态-Cr2O3更活跃，后者由于Cr原子对反应物的可及性降低而对催化活性产生负面影响。

3. 铬-硅相互作用：铬物种与硅载体之间的相互作用影响活性位点的分散和稳定性。

4. 负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，形成活性较低的晶态-Cr2O3的可能性增大，可能降低整体催化剂性能。

5. 载体性质：载体的比表面积和孔结构影响Cr物种的分散。与传统硅胶相比，具有更高比表面积的介孔载体可以实现铬物种的更好分散。

铬物种在反应过程中的演变也很重要。原位测量表明，在CO2和丙烷存在的情况下，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，这表明Cr6+物种作为活性位点的前体，而不是活性位点本身。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP, with chromium and gallium-based catalysts demonstrating the highest performance. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Oxidation states of chromium species
2. Structure of Cr species
3. Chromium-silica interaction
4. Cr loading and dispersion

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely related to loading and support properties:

1. At low loadings (below monolayer coverage), highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate, which are believed to be active sites or precursors.
2. As loading increases, less active α-Cr2O3 crystals may form, reducing overall catalyst accessibility and activity.
3. The concentration of Cr6+ species is proportional to propene formation rate.
4. During the reaction, Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, suggesting they act as precursors rather than direct active sites.

Support properties, particularly surface area and pore structure, influence Cr dispersion and the formation of active species. Mesoporous supports with high surface areas can achieve higher Cr dispersion, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

2. 随着负载量的增加，可能形成活性较低的α-Cr2O3晶体，降低整体催化剂的可接近性和活性。
3. Cr6+物种的浓度与丙烯生成速率成正比。
4. 在反应过程中，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表明它们更可能作为前体而非直接的活性位点。

载体性质，特别是比表面积和孔结构，影响Cr的分散和活性物种的形成。具有高比表面积的介孔载体可以实现更高的Cr分散度，可能导致更好的催化性能。

[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."

[3] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point - IEP) [29-31]."

[4] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,32-35]."

[5] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. 

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the support: The support material significantly affects catalyst performance. For example, CO2 has a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 but a negative effect on Cr2O3/Al2O3.

2. Oxidation states of chromium: Higher oxidation states, particularly Cr6+ species, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

3. Structure of chromium species: Mono- and polychromates are the dominant forms of Cr6+ species below monolayer coverage.

4. Chromium-silica interaction: This is influenced by factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions, Cr content, and properties of the silica support.

5. Chromium loading: Below monolayer coverage, highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate. Above this threshold, less active amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 forms.

6. Preparation conditions: Factors like calcination temperature affect the final state of chromium species.

7. Accessibility of chromium sites: Highly dispersed species are more accessible to reactants, while crystalline α-Cr2O3 reduces accessibility and negatively impacts catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to loading and support properties. At low loadings, highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate, which are believed to be catalytically active. As loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, less active α-Cr2O3 forms, reducing overall catalytic performance. The properties of the support material, such as surface area and interactions with chromium, play a crucial role in determining the dispersion and oxidation state of the chromium species.

文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中的性能，其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 载体的性质：载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。例如，CO2对Cr2O3/SiO2有促进作用，但对Cr2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。

2. 铬的氧化态：较高的氧化态，特别是Cr6+物种，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

3. 铬物种的结构：在单层覆盖度以下，单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐是Cr6+物种的主要形式。

4. 铬-硅相互作用：这受到诸如Cr前体类型、制备条件、Cr含量和硅载体性质等因素的影响。

5. 铬负载量：在单层覆盖度以下，高度分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位。超过这个阈值，会形成活性较低的无定形和结晶α-Cr2O3。

6. 制备条件：如煅烧温度等因素影响铬物种的最终状态。

7. 铬位点的可及性：高度分散的物种更容易被反应物接触，而结晶α-Cr2O3降低了可及性，对催化活性产生负面影响。

支持的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关。在低负载量时，高度分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位，被认为具有催化活性。随着负载量增加超过单层覆盖度，形成活性较低的α-Cr2O3，降低了整体催化性能。载体材料的性质，如比表面积和与铬的相互作用，在决定铬物种的分散度和氧化态方面起着至关重要的作用。

4. Support properties: The type of silica support influences the dispersion and accessibility of Cr species.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

These factors collectively determine the overall catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

1. Oxidation states of chromium species
2. Structure of chromium species

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is as follows:

1. At low loadings (below monolayer coverage), highly dispersed Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates dominate. These species are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

2. As loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 begin to form. The presence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 negatively impacts catalytic activity.

3. The concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts is directly proportional to the rate of propene formation, indicating their importance in the catalytic process.

4. Support properties, such as surface area and pore structure, influence the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active chromium species.

The catalytic performance is optimized when there is a high dispersion of Cr6+ species on the support surface, without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases. This is typically achieved at lower chromium loadings on high surface area supports.
