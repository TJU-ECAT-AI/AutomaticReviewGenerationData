[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium–silica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UV–vis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP, with chromium and gallium-based catalysts demonstrating the highest performance. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Oxidation states of chromium species
2. Structure of Cr species
3. Chromium-silica interaction
4. Cr loading and dispersion

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely related to loading and support properties:

1. At low loadings (below monolayer coverage), highly dispersed Cr6+ species dominate, which are believed to be active sites or precursors.
2. As loading increases, less active α-Cr2O3 crystals may form, reducing overall catalyst accessibility and activity.
3. The concentration of Cr6+ species is proportional to propene formation rate.
4. During the reaction, Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, suggesting they act as precursors rather than direct active sites.

Support properties, particularly surface area and pore structure, influence Cr dispersion and the formation of active species. Mesoporous supports with high surface areas can achieve higher Cr dispersion, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性，其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的性能。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的氧化态
2. Cr物种的结构
3. 铬-硅相互作用
4. Cr负载量和分散度

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和载体性质密切相关：

1. 在低负载量（单层覆盖以下）时，高分散的Cr6+物种占主导地位，被认为是活性位点或前体。
2. 随着负载量的增加，可能形成活性较低的α-Cr2O3晶体，降低整体催化剂的可接近性和活性。
3. Cr6+物种的浓度与丙烯生成速率成正比。
4. 在反应过程中，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表明它们更可能作为前体而非直接的活性位点。

载体性质，特别是比表面积和孔结构，影响Cr的分散和活性物种的形成。具有高比表面积的介孔载体可以实现更高的Cr分散度，可能导致更好的催化性能。
