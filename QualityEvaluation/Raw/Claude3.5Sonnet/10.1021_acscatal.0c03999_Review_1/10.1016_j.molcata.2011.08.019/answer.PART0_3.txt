[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium–silica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UV–vis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP, with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium species: Cr6+ species, in the form of mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure and dispersion of Cr species: Highly dispersed and accessible Cr species, particularly below monolayer coverage, contribute to higher catalytic activity.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: This affects the stability and distribution of different Cr species on the support surface.

4. Support properties: The type of silica support influences the dispersion and accessibility of Cr species.

5. Cr loading: Higher loadings can lead to the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which negatively impacts catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

These factors collectively determine the overall catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

1. 铬物种的氧化态：Cr6+物种，以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。丙烯生成速率几乎与焙烧催化剂中Cr6+物种的浓度成正比。

2. Cr物种的结构和分散度：高度分散和易接触的Cr物种，特别是在单层覆盖度以下，有助于提高催化活性。

3. 铬-硅相互作用：这影响了不同Cr物种在载体表面的稳定性和分布。

4. 载体性质：硅胶载体的类型影响Cr物种的分散和可接触性。

5. Cr负载量：较高的负载量可能导致结晶α-Cr2O3的形成，由于Cr原子可接触性降低，对催化活性产生负面影响。

铬物种在反应过程中的演变也很重要。原位测量表明，在CO2和丙烷存在下，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，这表明Cr6+物种作为活性位点的前体，而不是活性位点本身。

这些因素共同决定了负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体催化性能。
