[1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UVvis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-containing catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium: Cr6+ species, present as mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure of Cr species: Highly dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline -Cr2O3, which has a negative influence on catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms to reactants.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: The interaction between chromium species and the silica support affects the dispersion and stability of active sites.

4. Loading: As chromium loading increases, the formation of less active crystalline -Cr2O3 becomes more likely, potentially reducing overall catalyst performance.

5. Support properties: The surface area and pore structure of the support influence the dispersion of Cr species. Mesoporous supports with higher surface areas can achieve better dispersion of chromium species compared to conventional silicas.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In-situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已经被研究用于CO2-ODHP（用CO2进行丙烷脱氢），其中含铬和镓的催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

1. 铬的氧化态：Cr6+物种，以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。丙烯生成速率几乎与焙烧催化剂中Cr6+物种的浓度成正比。

2. Cr物种的结构：高度分散的Cr物种比晶态-Cr2O3更活跃，后者由于Cr原子对反应物的可及性降低而对催化活性产生负面影响。

3. 铬-硅相互作用：铬物种与硅载体之间的相互作用影响活性位点的分散和稳定性。

4. 负载量：随着铬负载量的增加，形成活性较低的晶态-Cr2O3的可能性增大，可能降低整体催化剂性能。

5. 载体性质：载体的比表面积和孔结构影响Cr物种的分散。与传统硅胶相比，具有更高比表面积的介孔载体可以实现铬物种的更好分散。

铬物种在反应过程中的演变也很重要。原位测量表明，在CO2和丙烷存在的情况下，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，这表明Cr6+物种作为活性位点的前体，而不是活性位点本身。
