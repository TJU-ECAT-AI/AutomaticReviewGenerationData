          [1] "Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromium–silica interaction."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[4] "The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

[5] "The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts."

[6] "In situ UV–vis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites"

[7] "Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13]."

[8] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."

          Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2), with chromium and gallium-based catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Oxidation states of chromium: Cr6+ species, present as mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites. The rate of propene formation is almost proportional to the concentration of Cr6+ species in calcined catalysts.

2. Structure of Cr species: Highly dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline α-Cr2O3, which has a negative influence on catalytic activity due to reduced accessibility of Cr atoms to reactants.

3. Chromium-silica interaction: The interaction between chromium species and the silica support affects the dispersion and stability of active sites.

4. Loading: As chromium loading increases beyond monolayer coverage, the formation of less active amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 becomes more likely, potentially reducing overall catalyst performance.

5. Support properties: The nature of the support influences catalytic properties. For example, CO2 has a promoting effect on Cr2O3/SiO2 but a negative effect on Cr2O3/Al2O3.

6. Preparation conditions: Factors like calcination temperature and water content affect the final state of chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species during the reaction is also important. In-situ measurements show that Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species in the presence of CO2 and propane, indicating that Cr6+ species act as precursors to the active sites rather than being the active sites themselves.

The catalytic performance is optimized when there is a high dispersion of Cr6+ species on the support surface, without the formation of bulk Cr2O3 phases. This is typically achieved at lower chromium loadings on high surface area supports.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢），其中铬和镓基催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性。对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

1. 铬的氧化态：Cr6+物种，以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式存在，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。丙烯生成速率几乎与焙烧催化剂中Cr6+物种的浓度成正比。

2. Cr物种的结构：高度分散的Cr物种比晶态α-Cr2O3更活跃，后者由于Cr原子对反应物的可及性降低而对催化活性产生负面影响。

3. 铬-硅相互作用：铬物种与硅载体之间的相互作用影响活性位点的分散和稳定性。

4. 负载量：随着铬负载量超过单层覆盖度，形成活性较低的无定形和结晶α-Cr2O3的可能性增大，可能降低整体催化剂性能。

5. 载体性质：载体的性质影响催化性能。例如，CO2对Cr2O3/SiO2有促进作用，但对Cr2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。

6. 制备条件：如煅烧温度和水含量等因素影响铬物种的最终状态。

铬物种在反应过程中的演变也很重要。原位测量表明，在CO2和丙烷存在的情况下，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，这表明Cr6+物种作为活性位点的前体，而不是活性位点本身。

当载体表面上有高度分散的Cr6+物种，同时没有形成体相Cr2O3时，催化性能达到最佳。这通常在高比表面积载体上使用较低铬负载量时实现。
