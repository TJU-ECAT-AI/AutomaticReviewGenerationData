Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial. High dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be achieved on supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSUx). These supports outperform unordered silica supports.

The choice of support significantly impacts catalyst performance. While silica-based supports are favorable, γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience a poisoning effect with CO2 addition. Active carbon supports, on the other hand, require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

A well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield has been observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading. This suggests that the evolution of chromium species with increasing loading plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance, with an optimal loading around 2 wt% Cr.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括含有Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V的催化剂。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为是非常有前景的。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 氧化还原铬物种的存在
3. 载体性质

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要。在具有大比表面积的载体上，如有序介孔二氧化硅材料（MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15、MSUx），可以实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散和高浓度。这些载体的性能优于无序二氧化硅载体。

载体的选择对催化剂性能有显著影响。虽然基于二氧化硅的载体是有利的，但γ-Al2O3负载的铬氧化物催化剂在添加CO2时会发生中毒效应。另一方面，活性炭载体需要定期用空气再生，限制了它们在CO2-PDH中的应用。

在铬负载量达到2 wt%之前，氧化还原铬位点的数量与丙烯产率之间存在良好的相关性。这表明，随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用，最佳负载量约为2 wt%铬。
