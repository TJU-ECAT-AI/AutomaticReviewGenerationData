[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32]."

[4] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined."

[5] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Dispersion of metal species: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for achieving good catalytic performance.

2. Presence of redox chromium species: The availability of redox-active chromium sites correlates with improved catalytic activity.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support significantly affects catalyst performance. For example, γ-Al2O3 supports lead to poisoning effects when CO2 is added, while active carbon supports require frequent regeneration.

4. Chromium loading: A correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield was observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading.

5. Acidity of the support: Low acidity supports like SiBeta lead to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while highly acidic supports like AlBeta promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on both the loading and support properties. As chromium loading increases, the number of redox-active sites increases, correlating with improved propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr. The support's acidity plays a crucial role in determining selectivity, with less acidic supports favoring propene formation over cracking reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括基于Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V的催化剂。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属物种的分散度：铬物种的高度分散对于获得良好的催化性能至关重要。

2. 氧化还原铬物种的存在：可氧化还原的铬位点的可用性与改善的催化活性相关。

3. 载体性质：载体的性质显著影响催化剂性能。例如，γ-Al2O3载体在添加CO2时会导致中毒效应，而活性炭载体需要频繁再生。

4. 铬负载量：观察到氧化还原铬位点的数量与丙烯产率之间的相关性，最高可达2 wt%的铬负载量。

5. 载体的酸度：低酸度载体如SiBeta导致较高的丙烯选择性（超过80%），而高酸度载体如AlBeta会促进不希望的丙烷裂解反应。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。随着铬负载量的增加，氧化还原活性位点的数量增加，与丙烯产率的提高相关，最高可达2 wt%铬。载体的酸度在决定选择性方面起着关键作用，酸度较低的载体有利于丙烯的形成而不是裂解反应。
