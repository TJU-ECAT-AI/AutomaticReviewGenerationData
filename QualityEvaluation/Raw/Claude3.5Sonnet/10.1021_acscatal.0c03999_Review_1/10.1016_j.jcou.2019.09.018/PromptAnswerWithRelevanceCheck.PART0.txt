[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [6,9,10,14,18,27,28]."

[4] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32]."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is significantly influenced by the support properties and loading. Silica, especially ordered mesoporous structures like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx, are excellent supports due to their large specific surface area (typically above 1000 m2/g). This allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species compared to unordered silica supports.

The support material plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. For example, γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience a poisoning effect with CO2 addition, while active carbon supports require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

The study demonstrates that dealumination of Beta zeolite followed by chromium dispersion through simple impregnation produces excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. This suggests that modifying the support structure (in this case, removing aluminum) can significantly impact the evolution and performance of chromium species in the catalyst.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 存在氧化还原铬物种
3. 载体性质

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变受载体性质和负载量的显著影响。二氧化硅，尤其是有序介孔结构如MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx，由于其较大的比表面积（通常超过1000 m2/g）是优秀的载体。与无序二氧化硅载体相比，这允许铬氧化物物种具有高度分散性和浓度。

载体材料在决定催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。例如，γ-Al2O3负载的铬氧化物催化剂在添加CO2时会产生中毒效应，而活性炭载体需要定期用空气再生，限制了它们在CO2-PDH中的应用。

研究表明，通过简单浸渍法对Beta沸石进行脱铝后分散铬可以产生优秀的CO2-PDH催化剂。这表明改变载体结构（在本例中，去除铝）可以显著影响催化剂中铬物种的演变和性能。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Number of redox Cr sites (correlated with propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr loading)
4. Acidity of the support

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial. There is a well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr loading. The support's acidity also plays a significant role, with low acidity supports like SiBeta achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity supports like AlBeta promote unwanted propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons.

The support's properties also affect the catalyst's response to CO2. Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts show increased propene formation rates in the presence of CO2, while Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalysts exhibit a negative effect on propene formation rates when CO2 is present.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning both the chromium loading and the support properties to optimize catalyst performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 氧化还原铬物种的存在
3. 氧化还原Cr位点的数量（与2 wt%Cr负载量以下的丙烯产率相关）
4. 载体的酸性

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要。氧化还原Cr位点的数量与2 wt%Cr负载量以下的丙烯产率之间存在很好的相关性。载体的酸性也起着重要作用，低酸性载体如SiBeta可以实现高选择性的丙烯生成（超过80%），而高酸性载体如AlBeta则促进不需要的丙烷裂解为轻烃。

载体的性质还影响催化剂对CO2的响应。含Cr的SiBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时表现出丙烯生成速率的增加，而含Cr的AlBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时对丙烯生成速率产生负面影响。

这些发现突出了在CO2-ODHP反应中，仔细调节铬负载量和载体性质以优化催化剂性能的重要性。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Dispersion of metal species: High dispersion of chromium species is crucial for achieving good catalytic performance.

2. Presence of redox chromium species: The availability of redox-active chromium sites correlates with improved catalytic activity.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support significantly affects catalyst performance. For example, γ-Al2O3 supports lead to poisoning effects when CO2 is added, while active carbon supports require frequent regeneration.

4. Chromium loading: A correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield was observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading.

5. Acidity of the support: Low acidity supports like SiBeta lead to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while highly acidic supports like AlBeta promote undesirable propane cracking reactions.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on both the loading and support properties. As chromium loading increases, the number of redox-active sites increases, correlating with improved propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr. The support's acidity plays a crucial role in determining selectivity, with less acidic supports favoring propene formation over cracking reactions.

4. 铬负载量：观察到氧化还原铬位点的数量与丙烯产率之间的相关性，最高可达2 wt%的铬负载量。

5. 载体的酸度：低酸度载体如SiBeta导致较高的丙烯选择性（超过80%），而高酸度载体如AlBeta会促进不希望的丙烷裂解反应。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。随着铬负载量的增加，氧化还原活性位点的数量增加，与丙烯产率的提高相关，最高可达2 wt%铬。载体的酸度在决定选择性方面起着关键作用，酸度较低的载体有利于丙烯的形成而不是裂解反应。

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial. High dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be achieved on supports with large specific surface areas, such as ordered mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSUx). These supports outperform unordered silica supports.

The choice of support significantly impacts catalyst performance. While silica-based supports are favorable, γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience a poisoning effect with CO2 addition. Active carbon supports, on the other hand, require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

A well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield has been observed up to 2 wt% Cr loading. This suggests that the evolution of chromium species with increasing loading plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance, with an optimal loading around 2 wt% Cr.

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要。在具有大比表面积的载体上，如有序介孔二氧化硅材料（MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15、MSUx），可以实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散和高浓度。这些载体的性能优于无序二氧化硅载体。

载体的选择对催化剂性能有显著影响。虽然基于二氧化硅的载体是有利的，但γ-Al2O3负载的铬氧化物催化剂在添加CO2时会发生中毒效应。另一方面，活性炭载体需要定期用空气再生，限制了它们在CO2-PDH中的应用。

在铬负载量达到2 wt%之前，氧化还原铬位点的数量与丙烯产率之间存在良好的相关性。这表明，随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用，最佳负载量约为2 wt%铬。
