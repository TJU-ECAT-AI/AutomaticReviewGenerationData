Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of metal species on the support
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Number of redox Cr sites (correlated with propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr loading)
4. Acidity of the support

For chromium-based catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial:

1. Redox Cr sites play a vital role in catalytic performance
2. Increasing Cr loading up to 2 wt% improves propene yield
3. Support acidity affects selectivity - low acidity of SiBeta leads to high propene selectivity (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking
4. Support type impacts CO2 interaction - γ-Al2O3 supports lead to CO2 poisoning, while active carbon supports require periodic air regeneration

The choice of support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance and stability in CO2-PDH reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括含有Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V的催化剂。其中，由于高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属物种在载体上的高度分散
2. 存在氧化还原铬物种
3. 氧化还原Cr位点的数量（与丙烯产率相关，最高至2 wt%的Cr负载量）
4. 载体的酸性

对于铬基催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要：

1. 氧化还原Cr位点在催化性能中起关键作用
2. 增加Cr负载量至2 wt%可提高丙烯产率
3. 载体酸性影响选择性 - SiBeta的低酸性导致高丙烯选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta的高酸性促进丙烷裂解
4. 载体类型影响CO2相互作用 - γ-Al2O3载体导致CO2中毒，而活性炭载体需要定期空气再生

载体材料的选择显著影响催化剂在CO2-PDH反应中的性能和稳定性。
