Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH), including Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Support properties

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species is significantly influenced by the support properties and loading. Silica, especially ordered mesoporous structures like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx, are excellent supports due to their large specific surface area (typically above 1000 m2/g). This allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species compared to unordered silica supports.

The support material plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. For example, γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts experience a poisoning effect with CO2 addition, while active carbon supports require periodic regeneration with air, limiting their application in CO2-PDH.

The study demonstrates that dealumination of Beta zeolite followed by chromium dispersion through simple impregnation produces excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. This suggests that modifying the support structure (in this case, removing aluminum) can significantly impact the evolution and performance of chromium species in the catalyst.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，包括Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 存在氧化还原铬物种
3. 载体性质

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种的演变受载体性质和负载量的显著影响。二氧化硅，尤其是有序介孔结构如MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx，由于其较大的比表面积（通常超过1000 m2/g）是优秀的载体。与无序二氧化硅载体相比，这允许铬氧化物物种具有高度分散性和浓度。

载体材料在决定催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。例如，γ-Al2O3负载的铬氧化物催化剂在添加CO2时会产生中毒效应，而活性炭载体需要定期用空气再生，限制了它们在CO2-PDH中的应用。

研究表明，通过简单浸渍法对Beta沸石进行脱铝后分散铬可以产生优秀的CO2-PDH催化剂。这表明改变载体结构（在本例中，去除铝）可以显著影响催化剂中铬物种的演变和性能。
