[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]."

[3] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined."

[4] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been investigated for CO2-ODHP (CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation), including those containing Pt, Ni-Fe, Cr, Ga, In-Al, Fe, and V. Among these, chromium oxide-based materials are considered particularly promising due to their high activity and selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. High dispersion of chromium species
2. Presence of redox chromium species
3. Number of redox Cr sites (correlated with propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr loading)
4. Acidity of the support

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties is crucial. There is a well-correlated relationship between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt% Cr loading. The support's acidity also plays a significant role, with low acidity supports like SiBeta achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity supports like AlBeta promote unwanted propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons.

The support's properties also affect the catalyst's response to CO2. Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts show increased propene formation rates in the presence of CO2, while Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalysts exhibit a negative effect on propene formation rates when CO2 is present.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning both the chromium loading and the support properties to optimize catalyst performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP（CO2辅助丙烷脱氢），包括含有Pt、Ni-Fe、Cr、Ga、In-Al、Fe和V的催化剂。其中，由于具有高活性和选择性，铬氧化物基材料被认为特别有前景。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬物种的高度分散
2. 氧化还原铬物种的存在
3. 氧化还原Cr位点的数量（与2 wt%Cr负载量以下的丙烯产率相关）
4. 载体的酸性

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变至关重要。氧化还原Cr位点的数量与2 wt%Cr负载量以下的丙烯产率之间存在很好的相关性。载体的酸性也起着重要作用，低酸性载体如SiBeta可以实现高选择性的丙烯生成（超过80%），而高酸性载体如AlBeta则促进不需要的丙烷裂解为轻烃。

载体的性质还影响催化剂对CO2的响应。含Cr的SiBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时表现出丙烯生成速率的增加，而含Cr的AlBeta沸石催化剂在CO2存在时对丙烯生成速率产生负面影响。

这些发现突出了在CO2-ODHP反应中，仔细调节铬负载量和载体性质以优化催化剂性能的重要性。
