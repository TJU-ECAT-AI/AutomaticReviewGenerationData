[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[4] "Although the BET surface area and pore volume decreased largely as the Cr content increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr=25), the conversion of CsH8 and the yield of CsH6 still increased with Cr content, indicating such change in the porous structure did not significantly influence the catalytic behavior."

[5] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."

[7] "It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP (CO2 dehydrogenation of propane) activity and selectivity. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with a high selectivity above 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most active site for the reaction.

2. Metal content: Conversion of propane increased almost linearly with increasing Cr content, even when surface area and pore volume decreased.

3. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ plays an important role in the dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: MCM-41 support provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, contributing to the catalyst's performance.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties was observed as follows:

1. Before reaction: Cr6+ existed in tetrahedral coordination.

2. After reaction: Chromium changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination, forming small Cr3+Ox clusters.

3. Regeneration: Treatment with O2 or CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra.

This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

对于CO2-ODHP（丙烷的CO2脱氢）活性和选择性，比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂。Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，其次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41达到了15%以上的丙烯产率，选择性高于90%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：发现铬是反应的最活跃位点。

2. 金属含量：即使表面积和孔体积减少，丙烷转化率仍随着Cr含量的增加而几乎呈线性增加。

3. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr6+在脱氢反应中起重要作用。

4. 载体性质：MCM-41载体提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，有助于催化剂的性能。

负载的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变如下：

1. 反应前：Cr6+以四面体配位存在。

2. 反应后：铬从四面体配位的Cr6+变为八面体配位的Cr3+，形成小的Cr3+Ox簇。

3. 再生：用O2或CO2处理可以将还原的Cr3+O6八面体重新生成Cr6+O4四面体。

这种Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应中起着关键作用。
