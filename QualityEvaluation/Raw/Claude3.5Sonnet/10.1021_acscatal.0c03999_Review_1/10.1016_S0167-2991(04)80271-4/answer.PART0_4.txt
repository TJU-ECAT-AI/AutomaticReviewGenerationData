[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "According to the Cr K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP activity, with Cr-MCM-41 showing the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated high selectivity (>90%) and yield (>15%) for propene production.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most effective.

2. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and uniform mesoporous structure contribute to catalyst performance.

3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher activity, despite decreased surface area and pore volume.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The cycling between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination plays a crucial role in the catalytic process.

5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium species to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles is essential for sustained catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra)
2. During reaction: Reduction to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra)
3. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr3+O6 to Cr6+O4 by CO2

This cycle of reduction and oxidation is crucial for the catalyst's performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP活性方面进行了比较，其中Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，依次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。Cr-MCM-41表现出高选择性（>90%）和高产率（>15%）的丙烯生产。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：铬被发现是最有效的。

2. 载体性质：MCM-41的高比表面积和均匀的介孔结构有助于催化剂性能。

3. 铬负载量：增加Cr含量导致更高的活性，尽管表面积和孔体积减少。

4. 铬的氧化态和配位：四配位Cr6+和八配位Cr3+之间的循环在催化过程中起着关键作用。

5. 氧化还原性质：铬物种进行氧化还原循环的能力对持续的催化活性至关重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 初始状态：四配位的Cr6+（Cr6+O4四面体）
2. 反应过程中：还原为八配位的Cr3+（Cr3+O6八面体）
3. 再生：CO2将Cr3+O6重新氧化为Cr6+O4

这种还原和氧化的循环对催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢的性能至关重要。
