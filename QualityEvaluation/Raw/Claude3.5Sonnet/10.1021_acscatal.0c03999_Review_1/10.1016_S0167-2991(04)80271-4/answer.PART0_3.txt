[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[5] "According to the Cr K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), focusing on Cr-MCM-41. Among the tested catalysts (Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a yield above 15% with high selectivity (>90%) for propene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most effective active site.

2. Cr loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher C3H8 conversion, suggesting a direct relationship between Cr content and catalytic activity.

3. Support properties: MCM-41 provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, contributing to catalyst performance.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of Cr: The evolution of Cr species plays a crucial role. Initially, Cr exists as Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra). During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra).

5. Redox cycle: The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is essential for the dehydrogenation process. C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are then reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. CO2 reoxidizes the Cr3+O6 octahedra back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, completing the cycle.

This redox mechanism explains the high activity and selectivity of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, highlighting the importance of the chromium species' evolution and the support's role in maintaining catalyst performance.

该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）中的表现，重点关注Cr-MCM-41。在测试的催化剂中（MCM-41-DHT上的Cr、Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co），Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，依次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41达到了超过15%的产率，同时对丙烯的选择性很高（>90%）。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：铬被发现是最有效的活性位点。

2. Cr负载量：增加Cr含量导致C3H8转化率提高，表明Cr含量与催化活性之间存在直接关系。

3. 载体性质：MCM-41提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，有助于催化剂性能的提升。

4. Cr的氧化态和配位：Cr物种的演变起着关键作用。最初，Cr以四面体配位的Cr6+形式存在（Cr6+O4四面体）。在反应过程中，它被还原为八面体配位的Cr3+（Cr3+O6八面体）。

5. 氧化还原循环：Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环对脱氢过程至关重要。C3H8被Cr6+O4四面体脱氢成C3H6，同时Cr6+O4四面体被还原为Cr3+O6八面体。CO2将Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，完成循环。

这种氧化还原机制解释了Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的高活性和选择性，突出了铬物种演变的重要性以及载体在维持催化剂性能方面的作用。
