          [1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[5] "According to the Cr K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

          Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) activity and selectivity. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co supported on MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most active site for the reaction.
2. Catalyst support: MCM-41 support provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, enhancing catalyst performance.
3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher propane conversion, despite decreases in surface area and pore volume.
4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The catalytic cycle involves the transformation between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (active species) and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (reduced form).
5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra) before the reaction.
2. During reaction: Transformation to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra).
3. Regeneration: Reoxidation of Cr3+O6 to Cr6+O4 by CO2.

This redox cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

          研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的活性和选择性。Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，其次是负载在MCM-41上的Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41实现了超过15%的丙烯产率，同时保持超过90%的高选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：发现铬是反应的最活跃位点。
2. 催化剂载体：MCM-41载体提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，增强了催化剂性能。
3. 铬负载量：增加铬含量导致丙烷转化率提高，尽管表面积和孔体积有所减少。
4. 铬的氧化态和配位：催化循环涉及四配位Cr6+（活性物种）和八配位Cr3+（还原形式）之间的转化。
5. 氧化还原性质：铬在Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间进行氧化还原循环的能力对脱氢过程至关重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 初始状态：反应前为四配位的Cr6+（Cr6+O4四面体）。
2. 反应过程中：转变为八配位的Cr3+（Cr3+O6八面体）。
3. 再生：CO2将Cr3+O6重新氧化为Cr6+O4。

这种Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环在Cr-MCM-41上CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应中起着关键作用。
