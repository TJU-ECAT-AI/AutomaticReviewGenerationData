[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co supported on MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested.

2. Catalyst support: MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve, provides high surface area and uniform pore structure, enhancing catalyst performance.

3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher propane conversion, despite decreases in surface area and pore volume.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The catalytic cycle involves the transformation between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (active species) and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (reduced form).

5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

6. Regeneration ability: CO2 can reoxidize the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, maintaining catalyst activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by the interconversion between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination during the reaction and regeneration cycles. This transformation is key to the catalyst's activity and can be influenced by factors such as chromium loading and support properties.

[4] "Although the BET surface area and pore volume decreased largely as the Cr content increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr=25), the conversion of CsH8 and the yield of CsH6 still increased with Cr content, indicating such change in the porous structure did not significantly influence the catalytic behavior."

[5] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[6] "It is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."

[7] "It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for CO2-ODHP (CO2 dehydrogenation of propane) activity and selectivity. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with a high selectivity above 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most active site for the reaction.

2. Metal content: Conversion of propane increased almost linearly with increasing Cr content, even when surface area and pore volume decreased.

3. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ plays an important role in the dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: MCM-41 support provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, contributing to the catalyst's performance.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties was observed as follows:

1. Before reaction: Cr6+ existed in tetrahedral coordination.

2. After reaction: Chromium changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination, forming small Cr3+Ox clusters.

3. Regeneration: Treatment with O2 or CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra.

This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 demonstrating the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium is the most active among the tested metals.

2. Catalyst structure: MCM-41 support provides high surface area and uniform mesoporous channels.

3. Chromium content: Higher Cr content leads to increased C3H8 conversion, with a linear relationship observed.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

5. Support properties: As Cr content increases, pore volume and surface area decrease, but pore diameter remains constant up to a certain loading.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination before the reaction.

2. During reaction: Transformation to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination.

3. Regeneration: Reoxidation to Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination after O2 treatment.

This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is essential for the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP. The support properties influence the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species, affecting the overall catalytic performance.

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), focusing on Cr-MCM-41. Among the tested catalysts (Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT), Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a yield above 15% with high selectivity (>90%) for propene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium was found to be the most effective active site.

2. Cr loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher C3H8 conversion, suggesting a direct relationship between Cr content and catalytic activity.

3. Support properties: MCM-41 provided high surface area and uniform pore structure, contributing to catalyst performance.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of Cr: The evolution of Cr species plays a crucial role. Initially, Cr exists as Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (Cr6+O4 tetrahedra). During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (Cr3+O6 octahedra).

5. Redox cycle: The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is essential for the dehydrogenation process. C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are then reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. CO2 reoxidizes the Cr3+O6 octahedra back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, completing the cycle.

This redox mechanism explains the high activity and selectivity of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, highlighting the importance of the chromium species' evolution and the support's role in maintaining catalyst performance.
