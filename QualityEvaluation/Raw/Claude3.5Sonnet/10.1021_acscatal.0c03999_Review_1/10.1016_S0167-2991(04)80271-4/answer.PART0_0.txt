[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Among various metal oxide catalysts tested for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co supported on MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested.

2. Catalyst support: MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve, provides high surface area and uniform pore structure, enhancing catalyst performance.

3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content led to higher propane conversion, despite decreases in surface area and pore volume.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: The catalytic cycle involves the transformation between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination (active species) and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination (reduced form).

5. Redox properties: The ability of chromium to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra is crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

6. Regeneration ability: CO2 can reoxidize the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, maintaining catalyst activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by the interconversion between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination during the reaction and regeneration cycles. This transformation is key to the catalyst's activity and can be influenced by factors such as chromium loading and support properties.

在测试的各种金属氧化物催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中表现出最高的活性，其次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co负载的MCM-41。Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41实现了超过15%的丙烯产率，同时保持超过90%的高选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：铬表现出比其他测试金属更优异的性能。

2. 催化剂载体：MCM-41作为介孔分子筛，提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，增强了催化剂性能。

3. 铬负载量：增加铬含量导致丙烷转化率提高，尽管表面积和孔体积有所减少。

4. 铬的氧化态和配位：催化循环涉及四配位Cr6+（活性物种）和八配位Cr3+（还原形式）之间的转化。

5. 氧化还原性质：铬能够在Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间进行氧化还原循环的能力对脱氢过程至关重要。

6. 再生能力：CO2能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，维持催化剂活性。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征是在反应和再生循环过程中四配位Cr6+和八配位Cr3+之间的相互转化。这种转化是催化剂活性的关键，并且可以受到铬负载量和载体性质等因素的影响。
