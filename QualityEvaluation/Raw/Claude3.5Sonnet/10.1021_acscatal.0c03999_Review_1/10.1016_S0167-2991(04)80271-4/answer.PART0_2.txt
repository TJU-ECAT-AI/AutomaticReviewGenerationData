[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."

[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[5] "It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[6] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 demonstrating the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Chromium is the most active among the tested metals.

2. Catalyst structure: MCM-41 support provides high surface area and uniform mesoporous channels.

3. Chromium content: Higher Cr content leads to increased C3H8 conversion, with a linear relationship observed.

4. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

5. Support properties: As Cr content increases, pore volume and surface area decrease, but pore diameter remains constant up to a certain loading.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by:

1. Initial state: Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination before the reaction.

2. During reaction: Transformation to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination.

3. Regeneration: Reoxidation to Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination after O2 treatment.

This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is essential for the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP. The support properties influence the dispersion and accessibility of chromium species, affecting the overall catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性，其中Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，依次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：在测试的金属中，铬表现出最高的活性。

2. 催化剂结构：MCM-41载体提供高比表面积和均匀的介孔通道。

3. 铬含量：更高的Cr含量导致C3H8转化率增加，呈线性关系。

4. 铬的氧化态和配位状态：四面体配位的Cr6+在脱氢过程中起着关键作用。

5. 载体性质：随着Cr含量增加，孔体积和比表面积下降，但孔径在一定负载量范围内保持恒定。

支持的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征为：

1. 初始状态：反应前为四面体配位的Cr6+。

2. 反应过程中：转变为八面体配位的Cr3+。

3. 再生：经O2处理后重新氧化为四面体配位的Cr6+。

这种Cr6+和Cr3+之间的氧化还原循环对CO2-ODHP的催化活性至关重要。载体性质影响铬物种的分散和可及性，从而影响整体催化性能。
