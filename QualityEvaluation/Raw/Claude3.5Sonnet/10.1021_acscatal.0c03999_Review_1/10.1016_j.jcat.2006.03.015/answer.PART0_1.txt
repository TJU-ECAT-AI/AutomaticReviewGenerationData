[1] "The alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts were also inactive for the selective propane ODH to propylene, and only COx byproducts were detected."

[2] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[3] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[4] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[5] "The surface CrOx modifier is more active than the surface vanadia sites for propane activation, but has a lower selectivity for propane ODH to propylene."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies significantly:

1. Tungsta and molybdena catalysts supported on alumina were inactive, producing only COx byproducts.

2. Chromia and vanadia catalysts supported on alumina showed much higher activity, with overall turnover frequencies (TOFs) about two orders of magnitude greater than tungsta and molybdena catalysts.

3. Surface CrOx species had a higher overall TOF compared to surface VOx species, but lower propylene selectivity (24% for CrO3/Al2O3 vs 72% for V2O5/Al2O3).

4. Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased propylene selectivity from 72% to 49%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Chromia and vanadia are more active than tungsta and molybdena.
2. Support material: Alumina was used as the support in this study.
3. Combination of metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 significantly enhanced activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties was not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study shows that chromium species are more active but less selective for propane ODH compared to vanadium species when supported on alumina.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能差异显著：

1. 以氧化铝为载体的钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂无活性，仅产生COx副产物。

2. 以氧化铝为载体的铬酸盐和钒酸盐催化剂表现出更高的活性，总转化频率(TOF)比钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂高约两个数量级。

3. 表面CrOx物种的总TOF比表面VOx物种高，但丙烯选择性较低(CrO3/Al2O3为24%，V2O5/Al2O3为72%)。

4. 向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx使活性提高6倍，但丙烯选择性从72%降至49%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：铬酸盐和钒酸盐比钨酸盐和钼酸盐更活跃。
2. 载体材料：本研究中使用氧化铝作为载体。
3. 金属氧化物的组合：向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx显著提高了活性。

关于负载量和载体性质对负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响，给定的文献中没有直接讨论。然而，研究表明，当负载在氧化铝上时，铬物种在丙烷ODH反应中比钒物种更活跃但选择性较低。
