[1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers on supported V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst for propane ODH to propylene is further shown in Fig. 4, which plots the propylene yield versus the reaction temperature."

[5] "The propylene yields of the modified supported vanadiaalumina catalysts were greater than those of the individual supported metal oxide catalysts at all temperatures."

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Activity: Chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than tungsta and molybdena catalysts. Surface CrOx species showed higher overall turnover frequency (TOF) than surface VOx species.

2. Selectivity: Propylene selectivity was inversely related to activity. V2O5/Al2O3 showed 72% selectivity compared to 24% for CrO3/Al2O3.

3. Key factors influencing performance:
   - Catalyst composition: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity 6-fold but decreased selectivity from 72% to 49%.
   - Temperature: Propylene yield increased with reaction temperature for all catalysts.
   - Promoter effects: Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) enhanced propylene yields compared to individual metal oxide catalysts.

The literature does not specifically discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses more on the comparative performance of different metal oxide catalysts and the promotional effects of secondary metal oxide additives on V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts for propane ODH.

该文献比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的表现：

1. 活性：铬氧化物和钒氧化物催化剂的活性明显高于钨氧化物和钼氧化物催化剂。表面CrOx物种的总体转化频率(TOF)高于表面VOx物种。

2. 选择性：丙烯选择性与活性呈反比。V2O5/Al2O3的选择性为72%，而CrO3/Al2O3的选择性为24%。

3. 影响性能的关键因素：
   - 催化剂组成：向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx使活性提高6倍，但选择性从72%降至49%。
   - 温度：所有催化剂的丙烯产率随反应温度升高而增加。
   - 促进剂效应：第VI族金属氧化物改性剂（Cr、Mo、W）与单一金属氧化物催化剂相比提高了丙烯产率。

文献没有具体讨论负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变。它更多地关注不同金属氧化物催化剂的比较性能，以及次级金属氧化物添加剂对V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中的促进作用。
