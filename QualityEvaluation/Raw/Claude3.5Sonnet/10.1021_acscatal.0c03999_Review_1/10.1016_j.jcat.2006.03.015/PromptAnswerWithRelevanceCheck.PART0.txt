[1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The propane equilibrium adsorption constant is affected by both surface metal oxide sites, and the adsorbed propane is converted to propylene and further to carbon oxides, depending on the whether the activation occurs on the surface vanadia or chromia sites."

The study compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than CO2-ODHP. For propane ODH:

1. Activity: Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts were significantly more active than WO3 and MoO3 catalysts on alumina support. CrOx species showed higher overall turnover frequency (TOF) than VOx species.

2. Selectivity: V2O5/Al2O3 showed higher propylene selectivity (72%) compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 (24%). 

3. Key factors influencing performance:
- Nature of metal oxide: Different metal oxides showed varying activities and selectivities.
- Interactions between metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity but decreased selectivity.
- Adsorption properties: The propane equilibrium adsorption constant is affected by both surface metal oxide sites.

4. Evolution of chromium species: The study does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. It mainly focuses on comparing different metal oxides and their combinations rather than examining the behavior of chromium species specifically.

这项研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应,而非CO2-ODHP反应。对于丙烷ODH反应:

1. 活性:在氧化铝载体上,Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂的活性显著高于WO3和MoO3催化剂。CrOx物种表现出比VOx物种更高的总体转化频率(TOF)。

2. 选择性:V2O5/Al2O3表现出更高的丙烯选择性(72%),而Cr2O3/Al2O3的选择性较低(24%)。

3. 影响性能的关键因素:

- 金属氧化物之间的相互作用:在V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx提高了活性但降低了选择性。
- 吸附性能:丙烷平衡吸附常数受到两种表面金属氧化物位点的影响。

4. 铬物种的演变:该研究并未提供关于铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。它主要集中在比较不同金属氧化物及其组合,而非专门研究铬物种的行为。

[1] "The alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts were also inactive for the selective propane ODH to propylene, and only COx byproducts were detected."

[2] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

The catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies significantly:

1. Tungsta and molybdena catalysts supported on alumina were inactive, producing only COx byproducts.

2. Chromia and vanadia catalysts supported on alumina showed much higher activity, with overall turnover frequencies (TOFs) about two orders of magnitude greater than tungsta and molybdena catalysts.

3. Surface CrOx species had a higher overall TOF compared to surface VOx species, but lower propylene selectivity (24% for CrO3/Al2O3 vs 72% for V2O5/Al2O3).

4. Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased propylene selectivity from 72% to 49%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Chromia and vanadia are more active than tungsta and molybdena.
2. Support material: Alumina was used as the support in this study.
3. Combination of metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 significantly enhanced activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties was not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study shows that chromium species are more active but less selective for propane ODH compared to vanadium species when supported on alumina.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能差异显著：

1. 以氧化铝为载体的钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂无活性，仅产生COx副产物。

2. 以氧化铝为载体的铬酸盐和钒酸盐催化剂表现出更高的活性，总转化频率(TOF)比钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂高约两个数量级。

3. 表面CrOx物种的总TOF比表面VOx物种高，但丙烯选择性较低(CrO3/Al2O3为24%，V2O5/Al2O3为72%)。

4. 向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx使活性提高6倍，但丙烯选择性从72%降至49%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：铬酸盐和钒酸盐比钨酸盐和钼酸盐更活跃。
2. 载体材料：本研究中使用氧化铝作为载体。
3. 金属氧化物的组合：向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx显著提高了活性。

关于负载量和载体性质对负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响，给定的文献中没有直接讨论。然而，研究表明，当负载在氧化铝上时，铬物种在丙烷ODH反应中比钒物种更活跃但选择性较低。

The metal oxide catalysts compared in the study showed significant differences in activity and selectivity for propane ODH:

1. Tungsta and molybdena catalysts on alumina were inactive, producing only COx byproducts.

2. Chromia and vanadia catalysts on alumina were much more active, with TOF about 100 times higher than tungsta and molybdena catalysts.

3. Surface CrOx species had higher overall TOF than VOx species, but lower propylene selectivity (24% for CrO3/Al2O3 vs 72% for V2O5/Al2O3).

4. Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity 6-fold but decreased propylene selectivity from 72% to 49%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. The type of metal oxide (Cr and V being more active than W and Mo)
2. Interactions between different metal oxides (e.g., CrOx promoting V2O5/Al2O3)
3. The balance between activity and selectivity (higher activity often corresponding to lower selectivity)

The study does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The promotional effect of secondary metal oxides was not attributed to new phases or changes in redox center strength, suggesting that the chromium species may not undergo significant structural changes. However, more detailed studies would be needed to fully understand the evolution of chromium species under different conditions.

研究中比较的金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中的活性和选择性表现出显著差异：

1. 铝氧化物负载的钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂无活性，仅产生COx副产物。

2. 铝氧化物负载的铬酸盐和钒酸盐催化剂活性较高，其TOF约为钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂的100倍。

3. 表面CrOx物种的总体TOF高于VOx物种，但丙烯选择性较低（CrO3/Al2O3为24%，而V2O5/Al2O3为72%）。

4. 向V2O5/Al2O3中加入CrOx使活性提高6倍，但丙烯选择性从72%降至49%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的类型（Cr和V比W和Mo更活跃）
2. 不同金属氧化物之间的相互作用（例如，CrOx促进V2O5/Al2O3的活性）
3. 活性和选择性之间的平衡（较高的活性通常对应较低的选择性）

该研究未提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。次级金属氧化物的促进作用并非归因于新相的形成或氧化还原中心强度的变化，这表明铬物种可能没有发生显著的结构变化。然而，需要进行更详细的研究才能充分理解铬物种在不同条件下的演变。

The literature compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Activity: Chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than tungsta and molybdena catalysts. Surface CrOx species showed higher overall turnover frequency (TOF) than surface VOx species.

2. Selectivity: Propylene selectivity was inversely related to activity. V2O5/Al2O3 showed 72% selectivity compared to 24% for CrO3/Al2O3.

3. Key factors influencing performance:
   - Catalyst composition: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity 6-fold but decreased selectivity from 72% to 49%.
   - Temperature: Propylene yield increased with reaction temperature for all catalysts.
   - Promoter effects: Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) enhanced propylene yields compared to individual metal oxide catalysts.

The literature does not specifically discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses more on the comparative performance of different metal oxide catalysts and the promotional effects of secondary metal oxide additives on V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts for propane ODH.

2. 选择性：丙烯选择性与活性呈反比。V2O5/Al2O3的选择性为72%，而CrO3/Al2O3的选择性为24%。

3. 影响性能的关键因素：
   - 催化剂组成：向V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx使活性提高6倍，但选择性从72%降至49%。
   - 温度：所有催化剂的丙烯产率随反应温度升高而增加。
   - 促进剂效应：第VI族金属氧化物改性剂（Cr、Mo、W）与单一金属氧化物催化剂相比提高了丙烯产率。

文献没有具体讨论负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变。它更多地关注不同金属氧化物催化剂的比较性能，以及次级金属氧化物添加剂对V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中的促进作用。
