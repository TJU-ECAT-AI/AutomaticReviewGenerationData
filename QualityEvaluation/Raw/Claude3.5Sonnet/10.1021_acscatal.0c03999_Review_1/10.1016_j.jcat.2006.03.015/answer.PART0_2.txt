[1] "The alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts were also inactive for the selective propane ODH to propylene, and only COx byproducts were detected."

[2] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[3] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[4] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[5] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."

The metal oxide catalysts compared in the study showed significant differences in activity and selectivity for propane ODH:

1. Tungsta and molybdena catalysts on alumina were inactive, producing only COx byproducts.

2. Chromia and vanadia catalysts on alumina were much more active, with TOF about 100 times higher than tungsta and molybdena catalysts.

3. Surface CrOx species had higher overall TOF than VOx species, but lower propylene selectivity (24% for CrO3/Al2O3 vs 72% for V2O5/Al2O3).

4. Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity 6-fold but decreased propylene selectivity from 72% to 49%.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. The type of metal oxide (Cr and V being more active than W and Mo)
2. Interactions between different metal oxides (e.g., CrOx promoting V2O5/Al2O3)
3. The balance between activity and selectivity (higher activity often corresponding to lower selectivity)

The study does not provide specific information about the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The promotional effect of secondary metal oxides was not attributed to new phases or changes in redox center strength, suggesting that the chromium species may not undergo significant structural changes. However, more detailed studies would be needed to fully understand the evolution of chromium species under different conditions.

研究中比较的金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中的活性和选择性表现出显著差异：

1. 铝氧化物负载的钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂无活性，仅产生COx副产物。

2. 铝氧化物负载的铬酸盐和钒酸盐催化剂活性较高，其TOF约为钨酸盐和钼酸盐催化剂的100倍。

3. 表面CrOx物种的总体TOF高于VOx物种，但丙烯选择性较低（CrO3/Al2O3为24%，而V2O5/Al2O3为72%）。

4. 向V2O5/Al2O3中加入CrOx使活性提高6倍，但丙烯选择性从72%降至49%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的类型（Cr和V比W和Mo更活跃）
2. 不同金属氧化物之间的相互作用（例如，CrOx促进V2O5/Al2O3的活性）
3. 活性和选择性之间的平衡（较高的活性通常对应较低的选择性）

该研究未提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。次级金属氧化物的促进作用并非归因于新相的形成或氧化还原中心强度的变化，这表明铬物种可能没有发生显著的结构变化。然而，需要进行更详细的研究才能充分理解铬物种在不同条件下的演变。
