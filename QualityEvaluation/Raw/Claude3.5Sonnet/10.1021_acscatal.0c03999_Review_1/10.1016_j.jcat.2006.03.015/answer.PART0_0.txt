[1] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[2] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[3] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[4] "The propane equilibrium adsorption constant is affected by both surface metal oxide sites, and the adsorbed propane is converted to propylene and further to carbon oxides, depending on the whether the activation occurs on the surface vanadia or chromia sites."

The study compares various metal oxide catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than CO2-ODHP. For propane ODH:

1. Activity: Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts were significantly more active than WO3 and MoO3 catalysts on alumina support. CrOx species showed higher overall turnover frequency (TOF) than VOx species.

2. Selectivity: V2O5/Al2O3 showed higher propylene selectivity (72%) compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 (24%). 

3. Key factors influencing performance:
- Nature of metal oxide: Different metal oxides showed varying activities and selectivities.
- Interactions between metal oxides: Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity but decreased selectivity.
- Adsorption properties: The propane equilibrium adsorption constant is affected by both surface metal oxide sites.

4. Evolution of chromium species: The study does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. It mainly focuses on comparing different metal oxides and their combinations rather than examining the behavior of chromium species specifically.

这项研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应,而非CO2-ODHP反应。对于丙烷ODH反应:

1. 活性:在氧化铝载体上,Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂的活性显著高于WO3和MoO3催化剂。CrOx物种表现出比VOx物种更高的总体转化频率(TOF)。

2. 选择性:V2O5/Al2O3表现出更高的丙烯选择性(72%),而Cr2O3/Al2O3的选择性较低(24%)。

3. 影响性能的关键因素:
- 金属氧化物的性质:不同的金属氧化物表现出不同的活性和选择性。
- 金属氧化物之间的相互作用:在V2O5/Al2O3中添加CrOx提高了活性但降低了选择性。
- 吸附性能:丙烷平衡吸附常数受到两种表面金属氧化物位点的影响。

4. 铬物种的演变:该研究并未提供关于铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。它主要集中在比较不同金属氧化物及其组合,而非专门研究铬物种的行为。
