[1] "The catalytic activity, selectivity, and redox turnover frequency for the alumina-supported metal oxide catalysts and the pure alumina support are presented in Table 2."

[2] "The alumina-supported chromia and vanadia catalysts were significantly more active than the alumina-supported tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with an overall TOF about two orders of magnitude greater."

[3] "The overall TOF for the surface CrOx species was higher than that for the surface VOx species, but the propylene selectivity trend was inverse to that for activity (72% for supported V2O5/Al2O3 vs. 24% for supported CrO3/Al2O3)."

[4] "Adding surface CrOx to supported V2O5/Al2O3 increased the activity by a factor of 6, but with an accompanying decrease in propylene selectivity from 72 to 49%."

[5] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), focusing on alumina-supported catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Chromia and vanadia catalysts showed significantly higher activity than tungsta and molybdena catalysts, with turnover frequencies about two orders of magnitude greater.

2. Surface CrOx species exhibited higher overall turnover frequency than VOx species, but lower propylene selectivity (24% for CrO3/Al2O3 vs 72% for V2O5/Al2O3).

3. Adding CrOx to V2O5/Al2O3 increased activity sixfold but decreased propylene selectivity from 72% to 49%.

4. The promotional effect of secondary Group VI metal oxide modifiers (Cr, Mo, W) was not due to new phase formation, changes in redox center strength, or changes in exposed alumina sites.

The study does not provide specific information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it suggests that the interaction between different metal oxide species and their distribution on the support surface play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应中的性能，重点关注氧化铝负载的催化剂。主要发现包括：

1. 铬和钒催化剂显示出显著高于钨和钼催化剂的活性，其转化频率高出约两个数量级。

2. 表面CrOx物种表现出比VOx物种更高的整体转化频率，但丙烯选择性较低（CrO3/Al2O3为24%，而V2O5/Al2O3为72%）。

3. 将CrOx添加到V2O5/Al2O3中使活性提高了6倍，但丙烯选择性从72%降至49%。

4. 第六族金属氧化物二次修饰剂（Cr、Mo、W）的促进效应并非由于新相的形成、氧化还原中心强度的变化或暴露的氧化铝位点的变化造成的。

该研究没有提供关于负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的具体信息。然而，它表明不同金属氧化物物种之间的相互作用以及它们在载体表面的分布对确定催化性能起着至关重要的作用。
