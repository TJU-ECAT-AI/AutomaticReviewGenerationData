[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Furthermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."

[3] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[4] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[5] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Oxidation state: Cr3+ species, especially those formed from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+, are more active than other oxidation states.

2. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium species on the support surface lead to better catalytic performance.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species.

4. Chromium loading: An optimal loading (e.g., 7% in the case of Cr-ZrO2) results in the highest catalytic activity.

5. Chromium species structure: Both oligomeric and isolated chromium species contribute to catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties involves:

1. Initial state: At lower loadings, isolated Cr6+ species are dominant. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.

2. During reaction: Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main catalytically active species.

3. Support effect: The support (e.g., ZrO2) influences the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species, which in turn affects their evolution during the reaction.

4. Optimal loading: An optimal chromium loading exists where the balance between dispersion and concentration of active sites is achieved, resulting in the highest catalytic activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP，包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂。其中，铬氧化物表现出特别高的活性。

影响铬基催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 氧化态：Cr3+物种，尤其是由初始聚合Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+，比其他氧化态更活跃。

2. 分散度：高度分散在载体表面的铬物种会导致更好的催化性能。

3. 载体性质：载体的性质（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性。

4. 铬负载量：最佳负载量（如Cr-ZrO2的7%）会产生最高的催化活性。

5. 铬物种结构：寡聚和孤立的铬物种都对催化活性有贡献。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变包括：

1. 初始状态：在较低负载量时，孤立的Cr6+物种占主导地位。随着负载量的增加，形成寡聚Cr6+物种。

2. 反应过程中：在诱导期间，Cr6+物种还原为Cr3+。配位不饱和的寡聚和孤立Cr3+位点成为主要的催化活性物种。

3. 载体效应：载体（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性，从而影响它们在反应过程中的演变。

4. 最佳负载量：存在一个最佳的铬负载量，在这个负载量下，活性位点的分散和浓度之间达到平衡，从而产生最高的催化活性。
