[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Furthermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."

[3] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[4] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were observed after the induction period."

[5] "Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area, crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%)."

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include:

1. Surface area
2. Crystalline structure of the support (e.g. ZrO2)
3. Dispersity of Cr species
4. Initial valence of Cr species
5. Surface acidity 
6. Redox properties
7. Cr loading amount

For chromium species evolution:

- Initially, polymeric and isolated Cr6+ species are present
- During reaction, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ 
- Coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main active sites
- Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduction of polymeric Cr6+ is more active than that from isolated Cr6+
- Higher concentration of initial Cr6+ species can lead to enhanced activity
- Maintaining Cr in the 3+ oxidation state (rather than further reduction to Cr2+) is important for activity and coke resistance

The optimal chromium loading and support properties allow for high dispersion of active Cr species while maintaining the desired crystal structure and surface properties of the support material.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应,包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂。其中,铬氧化物表现出特别高的活性。

影响负载型Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 比表面积
2. 载体的晶体结构(如ZrO2)
3. Cr物种的分散度
4. Cr物种的初始价态
5. 表面酸性
6. 氧化还原性质
7. Cr负载量

对于铬物种的演变:

- 初始时,存在聚合态和孤立态的Cr6+物种
- 反应过程中,Cr6+物种被还原为Cr3+
- 配位不饱和的聚合态和孤立态Cr3+位点成为主要活性位点
- 由聚合态Cr6+还原而来的配位不饱和Cr3+比由孤立态Cr6+还原而来的更活跃
- 初始Cr6+物种浓度较高可导致活性增强
- 保持Cr处于3+氧化态(而不是进一步还原为Cr2+)对活性和抗积碳性能很重要

最佳的铬负载量和载体性质可以在保持载体材料所需晶体结构和表面性质的同时,实现活性Cr物种的高度分散。
