[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[3] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[4] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

[5] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."

Various metal oxide catalysts including indium, gallium, vanadium, and chromium-based catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxides showing particularly high activity. 

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest activity.

2. Chromium species: Coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

3. Support properties: ZrO2 support influences the dispersion and oxidation state of chromium species.

4. Redox properties: The ability of chromium species to cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ states is important for catalytic activity.

5. Oxygen activation: Cr3+ species with activated oxygen from CO2 dissociation are considered the active oxidative chromium species.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading involves:

1. At low loadings, isolated Cr6+ species dominate.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.
3. Under reaction conditions, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+, which are the main active sites.
4. The support properties influence the stability and reducibility of the chromium species.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂，已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬氧化物表现出特别高的活性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：含有大量分散的寡聚和孤立Cr6+物种的7CrAZrO2催化剂显示出最高的活性。

2. 铬物种：配位不饱和的寡聚和孤立Cr3+位点是丙烷与CO2脱氢的主要活性位点。

3. 载体性质：ZrO2载体影响铬物种的分散和氧化态。

4. 氧化还原性质：铬物种在Cr6+和Cr3+状态之间循环的能力对催化活性很重要。

5. 氧活化：来自CO2解离的活化氧的Cr3+物种被认为是活性氧化铬物种。

随着负载量变化，铬物种的演变包括：

1. 在低负载量时，孤立的Cr6+物种占主导地位。
2. 随着负载量增加，形成寡聚Cr6+物种。
3. 在反应条件下，Cr6+物种被还原为Cr3+，这是主要的活性位点。
4. 载体性质影响铬物种的稳定性和可还原性。
