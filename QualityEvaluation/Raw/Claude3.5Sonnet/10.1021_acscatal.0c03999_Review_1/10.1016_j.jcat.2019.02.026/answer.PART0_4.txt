[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

[2] "Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species."

[3] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."

[4] "The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."

[5] "For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane."

Various metal oxide catalysts including indium, gallium, vanadium, and chromium-based catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxides showing particularly high activity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest activity.

2. Oxidation state: Initially, higher concentrations of Cr6+ species contribute to enhanced activity. However, during the reaction, Cr3+ species become the main active sites.

3. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium oxide species on the support surface are crucial for good catalytic performance.

4. Support properties: The support material (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and oxidation state of chromium species.

5. Redox properties: The balance between reduction by propane and oxidation by CO2 influences the evolution of chromium species during the reaction.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts involves the initial reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites then become the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2. The presence of CO2 helps maintain the Cr3+ oxidation state, preventing further reduction to Cr2+, which is less active and more prone to coke formation.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂，都已被研究用于CO2-ODHP反应，其中铬氧化物显示出特别高的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：含有大量分散的寡聚和孤立Cr6+物种的7CrAZrO2催化剂显示出最高的活性。

2. 氧化态：初始时，较高浓度的Cr6+物种有助于提高活性。然而，在反应过程中，Cr3+物种成为主要活性位点。

3. 分散度：在载体表面高度分散的铬氧化物物种对于良好的催化性能至关重要。

4. 载体性质：载体材料（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和氧化态。

5. 氧化还原性质：丙烷的还原作用和CO2的氧化作用之间的平衡影响反应过程中铬物种的演变。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变包括在诱导期内Cr6+初始还原为Cr3+。随后，配位不饱和的寡聚和孤立Cr3+位点成为丙烷与CO2脱氢反应的主要活性位点。CO2的存在有助于维持Cr3+的氧化态，防止进一步还原为活性较低且更易形成积碳的Cr2+。
