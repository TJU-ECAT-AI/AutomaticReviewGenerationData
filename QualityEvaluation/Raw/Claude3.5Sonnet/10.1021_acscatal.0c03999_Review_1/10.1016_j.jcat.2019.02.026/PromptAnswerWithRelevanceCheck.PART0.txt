Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts include:

1. Oxidation state: Cr3+ species, especially those formed from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+, are more active than other oxidation states.

2. Dispersion: Highly dispersed chromium species on the support surface lead to better catalytic performance.

3. Support properties: The nature of the support (e.g., ZrO2) affects the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species.

4. Chromium loading: An optimal loading (e.g., 7% in the case of Cr-ZrO2) results in the highest catalytic activity.

5. Chromium species structure: Both oligomeric and isolated chromium species contribute to catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties involves:

1. Initial state: At lower loadings, isolated Cr6+ species are dominant. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr6+ species form.

2. During reaction: Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the induction period. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main catalytically active species.

3. Support effect: The support (e.g., ZrO2) influences the dispersion and reducibility of chromium species, which in turn affects their evolution during the reaction.

4. Optimal loading: An optimal chromium loading exists where the balance between dispersion and concentration of active sites is achieved, resulting in the highest catalytic activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被研究用于CO2-ODHP，包括铟、镓、钒和铬基催化剂。其中，铬氧化物表现出特别高的活性。

影响铬基催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 氧化态：Cr3+物种，尤其是由初始聚合Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+，比其他氧化态更活跃。

2. 分散度：高度分散在载体表面的铬物种会导致更好的催化性能。

3. 载体性质：载体的性质（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性。

4. 铬负载量：最佳负载量（如Cr-ZrO2的7%）会产生最高的催化活性。

5. 铬物种结构：寡聚和孤立的铬物种都对催化活性有贡献。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变包括：

1. 初始状态：在较低负载量时，孤立的Cr6+物种占主导地位。随着负载量的增加，形成寡聚Cr6+物种。

2. 反应过程中：在诱导期间，Cr6+物种还原为Cr3+。配位不饱和的寡聚和孤立Cr3+位点成为主要的催化活性物种。

3. 载体效应：载体（如ZrO2）影响铬物种的分散和可还原性，从而影响它们在反应过程中的演变。

4. 最佳负载量：存在一个最佳的铬负载量，在这个负载量下，活性位点的分散和浓度之间达到平衡，从而产生最高的催化活性。

Various metal oxide catalysts have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts. Among these, chromium oxides have shown particularly high activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include:

1. Surface area
2. Crystalline structure of the support (e.g. ZrO2)
3. Dispersity of Cr species
4. Initial valence of Cr species
5. Surface acidity 
6. Redox properties
7. Cr loading amount

For chromium species evolution:

- Initially, polymeric and isolated Cr6+ species are present
- During reaction, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ 
- Coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites become the main active sites
- Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduction of polymeric Cr6+ is more active than that from isolated Cr6+
- Higher concentration of initial Cr6+ species can lead to enhanced activity
- Maintaining Cr in the 3+ oxidation state (rather than further reduction to Cr2+) is important for activity and coke resistance

The optimal chromium loading and support properties allow for high dispersion of active Cr species while maintaining the desired crystal structure and surface properties of the support material.

Among various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, chromium oxides have shown especially high activity compared to indium-, gallium-, and vanadium-based catalysts. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst (7% Cr loading) exhibited the highest catalytic activity.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: Abundant dispersed oligomeric and isolated Cr species contribute to higher activity.

3. Initial oxidation state: A higher concentration of Cr6+ species in the fresh catalyst is associated with enhanced activity.

4. Support properties: ZrO2 support, particularly in its tetragonal form, plays a role in dispersing and stabilizing active Cr species.

5. Redox properties: The ability of Cr species to undergo redox cycling between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is crucial for catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is as follows:

1. At lower loadings, isolated Cr species are predominant.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr species form alongside isolated species.
3. The support (ZrO2) helps maintain high dispersion of Cr species and stabilizes the tetragonal phase.
4. During the reaction, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+, which are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.
5. The presence of CO2 helps maintain Cr3+ species and prevents further reduction to Cr2+, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity.
