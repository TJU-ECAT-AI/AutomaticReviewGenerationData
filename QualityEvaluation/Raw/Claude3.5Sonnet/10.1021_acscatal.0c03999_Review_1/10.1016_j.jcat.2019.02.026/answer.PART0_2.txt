[1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reaction with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."

Among various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, chromium oxides have shown especially high activity compared to indium-, gallium-, and vanadium-based catalysts. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst (7% Cr loading) exhibited the highest catalytic activity.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: Abundant dispersed oligomeric and isolated Cr species contribute to higher activity.

3. Initial oxidation state: A higher concentration of Cr6+ species in the fresh catalyst is associated with enhanced activity.

4. Support properties: ZrO2 support, particularly in its tetragonal form, plays a role in dispersing and stabilizing active Cr species.

5. Redox properties: The ability of Cr species to undergo redox cycling between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is crucial for catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is as follows:

1. At lower loadings, isolated Cr species are predominant.
2. As loading increases, oligomeric Cr species form alongside isolated species.
3. The support (ZrO2) helps maintain high dispersion of Cr species and stabilizes the tetragonal phase.
4. During the reaction, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+, which are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.
5. The presence of CO2 helps maintain Cr3+ species and prevents further reduction to Cr2+, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity.

在各种用于CO2-ODHP的金属氧化物催化剂中，铬氧化物相比铟、镓和钒基催化剂表现出特别高的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：7CrAZrO2催化剂（7%铬负载量）表现出最高的催化活性。

2. 铬物种的分散度：大量分散的寡聚体和孤立的铬物种有助于提高活性。

3. 初始氧化态：新鲜催化剂中较高浓度的Cr6+物种与增强的活性相关。

4. 载体性质：ZrO2载体，特别是四方晶型，在分散和稳定活性铬物种方面发挥作用。

5. 氧化还原性质：铬物种在Cr6+和Cr3+之间进行氧化还原循环的能力对催化活性至关重要。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变如下：

1. 在较低负载量时，以孤立的铬物种为主。
2. 随着负载量增加，寡聚体铬物种与孤立物种一起形成。
3. 载体（ZrO2）有助于保持铬物种的高分散度并稳定四方晶相。
4. 在反应过程中，Cr6+物种还原为Cr3+，后者是丙烷与CO2脱氢的主要活性位点。
5. CO2的存在有助于维持Cr3+物种并防止进一步还原为Cr2+，这有利于催化剂的稳定性和活性。
