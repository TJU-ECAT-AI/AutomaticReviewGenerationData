[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

[5] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

</quotes>

The literature compares Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods for CO2-ODHP and methane partial oxidation reactions. 

For CO2-ODHP, both DHT and TIE samples show similar catalytic properties, with propylene selectivity over 90% and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. The chromate species on both samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the reaction.

For methane partial oxidation, the DHT sample exhibits remarkably higher formaldehyde selectivity compared to the TIE sample. This is attributed to the higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample, while the TIE sample contains both monochromates and polychromates.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT tends to produce mainly monochromate species, while TIE results in a mixture of mono- and polychromates.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample leads to better selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in CO2-ODHP.

4. Structural changes during reaction: Chromate species are reduced to Cr(III) during dehydrogenation but remain stable during methane oxidation.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the preparation method, with DHT favoring monochromates and TIE producing a mixture of species. The loading and support properties affect the dispersion and coordination of chromium, which in turn influence catalytic performance.

该文献比较了通过直接水热合成(DHT)和模板离子交换(TIE)方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP和甲烷部分氧化反应中的性能。

对于CO2-ODHP，DHT和TIE样品显示相似的催化性能，丙烯选择性超过90%，CO2的存在增强了丙烷转化率。两种样品上的铬酸盐物种在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

对于甲烷部分氧化，DHT样品表现出明显高于TIE样品的甲醛选择性。这归因于DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散，而TIE样品同时含有单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT倾向于主要产生单铬酸盐物种，而TIE产生单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的混合物。

2. 铬物种的分散度：DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散导致甲烷部分氧化中的选择性更好。

3. 反应条件：CO2的存在增强了CO2-ODHP中的丙烷转化率。

4. 反应过程中的结构变化：铬酸盐物种在脱氢过程中被还原为Cr(III)，但在甲烷氧化过程中保持稳定。

铬物种的演变取决于制备方法，DHT有利于形成单铬酸盐，而TIE产生混合物种。载量和载体性质影响铬的分散和配位，进而影响催化性能。

The literature provides information on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). For CO2-ODHP (dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide), both types of catalysts show similar performance, with high selectivity to propylene (>90%) and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. 

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT and TIE methods result in different chromium species distributions, which affects catalyst performance in certain reactions.

2. Chromium species: Monochromate species are predominant in DHT samples, while both monochromates and polychromates exist in TIE samples.

3. Reaction conditions: During dehydrogenation reactions, chromate species on both catalyst types are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

4. Dispersion of chromium species: High dispersion of monochromate species in DHT samples leads to higher selectivity in some reactions, such as partial oxidation of methane.

5. Reaction type: While both catalysts perform similarly in CO2-ODHP, they show different selectivities in other reactions like partial oxidation of methane.

The evolution of chromium species during reactions depends on the reaction type. In CO2-ODHP, chromate species are reduced to Cr(III), while in methane partial oxidation, the chromate structure is maintained. The initial distribution and dispersion of chromium species, which is influenced by the preparation method, plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance in different reactions.

文献提供了关于通过两种不同方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂的信息：直接水热合成法（DHT）和模板离子交换法（TIE）。对于CO2-ODHP（与二氧化碳的丙烷脱氢），两种类型的催化剂表现出相似的性能，对丙烯的选择性高（>90%），且在CO2存在下丙烷转化率提高。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT和TIE方法导致不同的铬物种分布，这影响了催化剂在某些反应中的性能。

2. 铬物种：DHT样品中以单铬酸盐物种为主，而TIE样品中同时存在单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种。

3. 反应条件：在脱氢反应过程中，两种类型催化剂上的铬酸盐物种都被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

4. 铬物种的分散度：DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散导致在某些反应中具有更高的选择性，如甲烷部分氧化。

5. 反应类型：虽然两种催化剂在CO2-ODHP中表现相似，但在其他反应如甲烷部分氧化中表现出不同的选择性。

反应过程中铬物种的演变取决于反应类型。在CO2-ODHP中，铬酸盐物种被还原为Cr(III)，而在甲烷部分氧化中，铬酸盐结构保持不变。铬物种的初始分布和分散度（受制备方法影响）在决定催化剂在不同反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。

For CO2-ODHP of propane, both DHT and TIE Cr-MCM-41 catalysts show similar catalytic properties. They exhibit high selectivity to propylene (>90%) and the presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of catalysts are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

For partial oxidation of methane with oxygen, the DHT method produces catalysts with remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE method. This difference is attributed to the high dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample, while the chromate structure remains intact during the reaction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
1. Preparation method (DHT vs TIE), which affects the dispersion and type of chromate species
2. Reaction type (dehydrogenation vs partial oxidation)
3. Structure and coordination of chromium species (monochromate vs polychromate)

The evolution of chromium species depends on the reaction conditions. In dehydrogenation reactions, chromate species are reduced to Cr(III), while in methane oxidation, the chromate structure is preserved.

该文献并未提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的全面比较。但是，它确实讨论了通过两种不同方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂的性能：直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）。

2. 反应类型（脱氢vs部分氧化）

The study does not provide extensive information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that increasing chromium content beyond a certain point (Si/Cr ratio of 25) leads to a decrease in structural regularity and surface area of the MCM-41 support.
