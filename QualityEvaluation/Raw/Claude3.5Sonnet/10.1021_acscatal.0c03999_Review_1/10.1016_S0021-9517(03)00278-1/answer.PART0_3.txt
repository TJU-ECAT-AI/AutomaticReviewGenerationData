[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[5] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

The literature compares Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods for CO2-ODHP and methane partial oxidation reactions. 

For CO2-ODHP, both DHT and TIE samples show similar catalytic properties, with propylene selectivity higher than 90% and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. During the reaction, chromate species on both catalysts are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

For methane partial oxidation, the DHT sample exhibits remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE sample. This difference is attributed to the chromate species structure, which remains intact during the reaction, and the higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT tends to produce mainly monochromate species, while TIE results in a mixture of monochromates and polychromates.

2. Dispersion of chromate species: Higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample leads to better selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in CO2-ODHP.

4. Evolution of chromium species: During CO2-ODHP, chromate species are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination, while they remain stable during methane partial oxidation.

The study does not provide extensive information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that increasing chromium content beyond a certain point (Si/Cr ratio of 25) leads to a decrease in structural regularity and surface area of the MCM-41 support.

该文献比较了通过直接水热合成(DHT)和模板离子交换(TIE)方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP和甲烷部分氧化反应中的性能。

对于CO2-ODHP，DHT和TIE样品显示出相似的催化性能，丙烯选择性高于90%，CO2的存在增强了丙烷转化率。在反应过程中，两种催化剂上的铬酸盐物种都被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

对于甲烷部分氧化，DHT样品对甲醛的选择性明显高于TIE样品。这种差异归因于铬酸盐物种结构在反应过程中保持不变，以及DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的分散度更高。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT倾向于主要产生单铬酸盐物种，而TIE会产生单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的混合物。

2. 铬酸盐物种的分散度：DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高分散度导致在甲烷部分氧化中具有更好的选择性。

3. 反应条件：在CO2-ODHP中，CO2的存在增强了丙烷的转化率。

4. 铬物种的演变：在CO2-ODHP过程中，铬酸盐物种被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)，而在甲烷部分氧化过程中保持稳定。

该研究没有提供关于铬物种随负载量和载体性质变化的详细信息。但是，它提到当铬含量超过某个点（Si/Cr比为25）时，会导致MCM-41载体的结构规整性和比表面积下降。
