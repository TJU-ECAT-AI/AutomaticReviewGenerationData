[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

[5] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

The literature compares Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods for CO2-ODHP and methane partial oxidation reactions. 

For CO2-ODHP, both DHT and TIE samples show similar catalytic properties, with propylene selectivity over 90% and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. The chromate species on both samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the reaction.

For methane partial oxidation, the DHT sample exhibits remarkably higher formaldehyde selectivity compared to the TIE sample. This is attributed to the higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample, while the TIE sample contains both monochromates and polychromates.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT tends to produce mainly monochromate species, while TIE results in a mixture of mono- and polychromates.

2. Dispersion of chromium species: Higher dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample leads to better selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in CO2-ODHP.

4. Structural changes during reaction: Chromate species are reduced to Cr(III) during dehydrogenation but remain stable during methane oxidation.

The evolution of chromium species depends on the preparation method, with DHT favoring monochromates and TIE producing a mixture of species. The loading and support properties affect the dispersion and coordination of chromium, which in turn influence catalytic performance.

该文献比较了通过直接水热合成(DHT)和模板离子交换(TIE)方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP和甲烷部分氧化反应中的性能。

对于CO2-ODHP，DHT和TIE样品显示相似的催化性能，丙烯选择性超过90%，CO2的存在增强了丙烷转化率。两种样品上的铬酸盐物种在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

对于甲烷部分氧化，DHT样品表现出明显高于TIE样品的甲醛选择性。这归因于DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散，而TIE样品同时含有单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT倾向于主要产生单铬酸盐物种，而TIE产生单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的混合物。

2. 铬物种的分散度：DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散导致甲烷部分氧化中的选择性更好。

3. 反应条件：CO2的存在增强了CO2-ODHP中的丙烷转化率。

4. 反应过程中的结构变化：铬酸盐物种在脱氢过程中被还原为Cr(III)，但在甲烷氧化过程中保持稳定。

铬物种的演变取决于制备方法，DHT有利于形成单铬酸盐，而TIE产生混合物种。载量和载体性质影响铬的分散和配位，进而影响催化性能。
