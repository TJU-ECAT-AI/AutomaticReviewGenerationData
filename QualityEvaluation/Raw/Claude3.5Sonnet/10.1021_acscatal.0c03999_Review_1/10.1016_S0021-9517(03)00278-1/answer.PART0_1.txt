[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

[5] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."

The literature provides information on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). For CO2-ODHP (dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide), both types of catalysts show similar performance, with high selectivity to propylene (>90%) and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2. 

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT and TIE methods result in different chromium species distributions, which affects catalyst performance in certain reactions.

2. Chromium species: Monochromate species are predominant in DHT samples, while both monochromates and polychromates exist in TIE samples.

3. Reaction conditions: During dehydrogenation reactions, chromate species on both catalyst types are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

4. Dispersion of chromium species: High dispersion of monochromate species in DHT samples leads to higher selectivity in some reactions, such as partial oxidation of methane.

5. Reaction type: While both catalysts perform similarly in CO2-ODHP, they show different selectivities in other reactions like partial oxidation of methane.

The evolution of chromium species during reactions depends on the reaction type. In CO2-ODHP, chromate species are reduced to Cr(III), while in methane partial oxidation, the chromate structure is maintained. The initial distribution and dispersion of chromium species, which is influenced by the preparation method, plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's performance in different reactions.

文献提供了关于通过两种不同方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂的信息：直接水热合成法（DHT）和模板离子交换法（TIE）。对于CO2-ODHP（与二氧化碳的丙烷脱氢），两种类型的催化剂表现出相似的性能，对丙烯的选择性高（>90%），且在CO2存在下丙烷转化率提高。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT和TIE方法导致不同的铬物种分布，这影响了催化剂在某些反应中的性能。

2. 铬物种：DHT样品中以单铬酸盐物种为主，而TIE样品中同时存在单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种。

3. 反应条件：在脱氢反应过程中，两种类型催化剂上的铬酸盐物种都被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

4. 铬物种的分散度：DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散导致在某些反应中具有更高的选择性，如甲烷部分氧化。

5. 反应类型：虽然两种催化剂在CO2-ODHP中表现相似，但在其他反应如甲烷部分氧化中表现出不同的选择性。

反应过程中铬物种的演变取决于反应类型。在CO2-ODHP中，铬酸盐物种被还原为Cr(III)，而在甲烷部分氧化中，铬酸盐结构保持不变。铬物种的初始分布和分散度（受制备方法影响）在决定催化剂在不同反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。
