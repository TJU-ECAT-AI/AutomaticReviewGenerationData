[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does discuss Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by two different methods:

1. For propane dehydrogenation with CO2, both DHT and TIE prepared Cr-MCM-41 catalysts show similar performance, with high selectivity to propylene (>90%) and enhanced propane conversion in the presence of CO2.

2. For methane partial oxidation, the DHT prepared Cr-MCM-41 shows remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE prepared catalyst.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Preparation method: DHT vs TIE affects the dispersion and type of chromate species formed.

2. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion in dehydrogenation.

3. Chromium species evolution: During propane dehydrogenation, chromate species on both catalyst types are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. However, during methane oxidation, the chromate species structure is maintained.

4. Dispersion of active species: The higher selectivity of DHT prepared catalysts in methane oxidation is attributed to better dispersion of monochromate species.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties beyond these observations.

该文献没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的综合比较。但是，它确实讨论了通过两种不同方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂：

1. 对于使用CO2进行的丙烷脱氢反应，通过DHT和TIE方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂显示出相似的性能，具有较高的丙烯选择性（>90%），并且在CO2存在的情况下丙烷转化率得到提高。

2. 对于甲烷部分氧化反应，通过DHT方法制备的Cr-MCM-41显示出比TIE方法制备的催化剂明显更高的甲醛选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：DHT与TIE影响形成的铬酸盐物种的分散度和类型。

2. 反应条件：在脱氢反应中，CO2的存在增强了丙烷的转化率。

3. 铬物种的演变：在丙烷脱氢过程中，两种类型催化剂上的铬酸盐物种都被还原为八面体配位的聚集态Cr(III)。然而，在甲烷氧化过程中，铬酸盐物种的结构保持不变。

4. 活性物种的分散度：DHT制备的催化剂在甲烷氧化中具有更高的选择性，这归因于单铬酸盐物种的更好分散。

除了这些观察结果外，该文献没有提供关于铬物种随载量和载体性质变化而演变的详细信息。
