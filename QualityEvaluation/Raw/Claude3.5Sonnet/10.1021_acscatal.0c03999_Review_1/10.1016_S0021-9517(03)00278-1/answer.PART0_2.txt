[1] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."

[2] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

[3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does discuss the performance of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE).

For CO2-ODHP of propane, both DHT and TIE Cr-MCM-41 catalysts show similar catalytic properties. They exhibit high selectivity to propylene (>90%) and the presence of CO2 enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of catalysts are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination.

For partial oxidation of methane with oxygen, the DHT method produces catalysts with remarkably higher selectivity to formaldehyde compared to the TIE method. This difference is attributed to the high dispersion of monochromate species in the DHT sample, while the chromate structure remains intact during the reaction.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:
1. Preparation method (DHT vs TIE), which affects the dispersion and type of chromate species
2. Reaction type (dehydrogenation vs partial oxidation)
3. Structure and coordination of chromium species (monochromate vs polychromate)

The evolution of chromium species depends on the reaction conditions. In dehydrogenation reactions, chromate species are reduced to Cr(III), while in methane oxidation, the chromate structure is preserved.

该文献并未提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的全面比较。但是，它确实讨论了通过两种不同方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂的性能：直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）。

对于丙烷的CO2-ODHP，DHT和TIE制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂都表现出相似的催化性能。它们对丙烯的选择性很高（>90%），并且CO2的存在增强了丙烷的转化率。在脱氢反应过程中，两种类型催化剂上的铬酸盐物种都被还原为八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。

对于甲烷与氧气的部分氧化反应，DHT方法制备的催化剂对甲醛的选择性明显高于TIE方法。这种差异归因于DHT样品中单铬酸盐物种的高度分散，而在反应过程中铬酸盐结构保持不变。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：
1. 制备方法（DHT vs TIE），这影响铬酸盐物种的分散和类型
2. 反应类型（脱氢vs部分氧化）
3. 铬物种的结构和配位（单铬酸盐vs多铬酸盐）

铬物种的演变取决于反应条件。在脱氢反应中，铬酸盐物种被还原为Cr(III)，而在甲烷氧化中，铬酸盐结构得以保持。
