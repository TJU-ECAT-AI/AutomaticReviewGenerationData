[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."

[2] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[3] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[4] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[5] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."

[6] "The resultant Cr2+ and Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles responsible for high catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials."

The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP include:

1. Chromium loading: The catalytic activity increases with Cr loading up to an optimal level (7 wt% in this study), beyond which it remains constant or decreases slightly.

2. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings (<7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ species (chromates and dichromates) dominate. As loading increases, Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline α-Cr2O3 begin to form.

3. Redox properties: The high catalytic activity is attributed to redox cycles involving Cr2+ and Cr3+ species.

4. Support properties: The high surface area of SBA-1 allows for better dispersion of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

5. Formation of inactive species: At higher loadings, the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 leads to a plateau in catalytic activity as these species are less active.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading on SBA-1 support shows a transition from well-dispersed, high-valent Cr6+ species at low loadings to a mixture of Cr6+ and crystalline Cr3+ species at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with an optimal balance of active species achieved at around 7 wt% Cr loading.

影响负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：催化活性随铬负载量增加而提高，直到达到最佳水平(本研究中为7 wt%)，之后保持恒定或略有下降。

2. 铬物种演变：在低负载量(<7 wt%)时，高价Cr6+物种(铬酸盐和重铬酸盐)占主导地位。随着负载量增加，以α-Cr2O3晶体形式存在的Cr3+物种开始形成。

3. 氧化还原性质：高催化活性归因于涉及Cr2+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1的高比表面积允许比传统二氧化硅载体更好地分散铬物种。

5. 非活性物种的形成：在较高负载量下，晶态Cr2O3的形成导致催化活性趋于平稳，因为这些物种活性较低。

铬物种随SBA-1载体负载量的演变显示，从低负载量时的分散良好的高价Cr6+物种，过渡到高负载量时Cr6+和晶态Cr3+物种的混合。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在约7 wt%铬负载量时达到活性物种的最佳平衡。
