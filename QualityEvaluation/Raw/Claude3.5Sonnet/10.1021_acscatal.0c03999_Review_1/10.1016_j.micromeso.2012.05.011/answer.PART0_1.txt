[1] "Crx/SBA-1 catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."

[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[3] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[4] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[5] "The Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process. The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[6] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites). This type of cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation. The reduced forms identified as Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to 7 wt%, then plateaus due to formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings.

2. Chromium species: Calcined catalysts contain Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3. During reaction, Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+, which are the main active sites.

3. Redox properties: Activity is linked to reducible Cr sites that form a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle. This cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation, while reduced Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: SBA-1 mesoporous structure allows for high chromium dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

The Crx/SBA-1 catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity, with maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C for 7 wt% Cr loading. The evolution of chromium species with increasing loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, highly active species at lower loadings to less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings.

这项研究主要关注以SBA-1为载体的铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的应用。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而上升，直至7 wt%达到最高，之后由于形成无活性的晶态Cr2O3而趋于平稳。

2. 铬物种：焙烧后的催化剂含有Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和晶态Cr2O3。在反应过程中，Cr6+迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+，成为主要活性位。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性与可还原的铬位点有关，这些位点形成CrOx/CrOx-1氧化还原循环。该循环在氧化脱氢中起作用，而还原态的Cr3+和Cr2+位点在非氧化脱氢中起作用。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1介孔结构允许高度分散的铬物种和活性位点的高可及性。

Crx/SBA-1催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性，在550°C下，7 wt%铬负载时达到最高丙烷转化率37.7%。随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变呈现从低负载时分散度高、活性强的物种向高负载时活性较低的晶态Cr2O3转变的趋势。
