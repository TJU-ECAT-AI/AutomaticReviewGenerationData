[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."

[2] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[3] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[4] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."

[5] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites)."

The study focuses on Cr-based catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr loading: Catalytic activity increases with Cr content up to 7 wt%, reaching maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C. Further increase in Cr content leads to slight decrease in activity.

2. Chromium species: Various Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr2O3) are present on the catalyst surface. Their distribution depends on total Cr content.

3. Redox properties: Activity is mainly related to reducible Cr sites participating in a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle.

4. Support properties: SBA-1 mesoporous structure allows for high Cr dispersion and stabilization of active species.

5. Oxidation state evolution: Cr6+ species rapidly reduce to Cr3+ and Cr2+ at the beginning of the reaction, which then participate in the catalytic cycle.

The study does not directly compare different metal oxide catalysts, focusing instead on the evolution and performance of Cr species on SBA-1 support.

该研究主要关注以SBA-1为载体的铬基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中的性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：催化活性随铬含量增加而提高，在7 wt%时达到最大丙烷转化率37.7%(550°C)。进一步增加铬含量会导致活性略有下降。

2. 铬物种：催化剂表面存在多种铬物种(Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr2O3)。它们的分布取决于总铬含量。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性主要与参与CrOx/CrOx-1氧化还原循环的可还原铬位点有关。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1介孔结构允许高度分散铬并稳定活性物种。

5. 氧化态演变：反应初期，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+，随后参与催化循环。

该研究并未直接比较不同金属氧化物催化剂，而是集中探讨了SBA-1载体上铬物种的演变和性能。
