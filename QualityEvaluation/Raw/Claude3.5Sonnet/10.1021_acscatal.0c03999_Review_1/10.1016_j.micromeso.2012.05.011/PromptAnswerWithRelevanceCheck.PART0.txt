[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

[5] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples. Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content. Cr5+ species were found in the samples containing below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."

[6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal. For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal loading (around 7 wt% in this study), after which it plateaus due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Oxidation state of chromium: Various redox cycles between Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ species have been proposed as active sites.

3. Dispersion of chromium species: Well-dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline Cr2O3 particles.

4. Support properties: High surface area supports provide more adsorption sites to stabilize redox Cr species, improving catalytic performance.

5. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings (<7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ and Cr5+ species dominate. As loading increases, Cr6+ species (mainly chromates and dichromates) coexist with crystalline Cr2O3.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is highly dependent on the total Cr content and support properties. Mesoporous supports like SBA-1 allow for higher Cr dispersion and stabilization of active redox species, leading to improved catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP compared to conventional supports.

铬氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而提高，直至达到最佳负载量（本研究中约为7 wt%），之后由于形成无活性的晶态Cr2O3而趋于平稳。

2. 铬的氧化态：提出了Cr6+/Cr3+、Cr5+/Cr3+和Cr3+/Cr2+等不同氧化还原循环作为活性位点。

3. 铬物种的分散度：分散良好的铬物种比晶态Cr2O3颗粒更具活性。

4. 载体性质：高比表面积载体提供更多吸附位点以稳定氧化还原铬物种，从而提高催化性能。

5. 铬物种演变：在低负载量(<7 wt%)时，高价态Cr6+和Cr5+物种占主导。随着负载量增加，Cr6+物种（主要是铬酸盐和重铬酸盐）与晶态Cr2O3共存。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变高度依赖于总铬含量和载体性质。与传统载体相比，SBA-1等介孔载体允许更高的铬分散度和活性氧化还原物种的稳定，从而在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出更优异的催化性能。

[6] "The activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is mainly connected with the presence of reducible Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx(oxidized sites)/CrOx1(reduced sites). This type of cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation. The reduced forms identified as Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to 7 wt%, then plateaus due to formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings.

2. Chromium species: Calcined catalysts contain Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3. During reaction, Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+, which are the main active sites.

3. Redox properties: Activity is linked to reducible Cr sites that form a CrOx/CrOx-1 redox cycle. This cycle operates in oxidative dehydrogenation, while reduced Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Support properties: SBA-1 mesoporous structure allows for high chromium dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

The Crx/SBA-1 catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity, with maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C for 7 wt% Cr loading. The evolution of chromium species with increasing loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, highly active species at lower loadings to less active crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings.

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而上升，直至7 wt%达到最高，之后由于形成无活性的晶态Cr2O3而趋于平稳。

2. 铬物种：焙烧后的催化剂含有Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和晶态Cr2O3。在反应过程中，Cr6+迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+，成为主要活性位。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性与可还原的铬位点有关，这些位点形成CrOx/CrOx-1氧化还原循环。该循环在氧化脱氢中起作用，而还原态的Cr3+和Cr2+位点在非氧化脱氢中起作用。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1介孔结构允许高度分散的铬物种和活性位点的高可及性。

Crx/SBA-1催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性，在550°C下，7 wt%铬负载时达到最高丙烷转化率37.7%。随着负载量的增加，铬物种的演变呈现从低负载时分散度高、活性强的物种向高负载时活性较低的晶态Cr2O3转变的趋势。

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, high-valent species at lower loadings to a mix of high-valent species and crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at an intermediate loading (7 wt% Cr) that maximizes the number of active, high-valent Cr species while minimizing inactive Cr2O3 formation.

这项研究主要关注SBA-1负载的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的表现。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而上升，直至7 wt%后趋于平稳，这是由于形成了无活性的结晶Cr2O3。

2. 铬物种：高价态铬物种(Cr6+, Cr5+)的存在与更高的活性相关。在较低负载量(<7 wt%)时，Cr6+物种占主导。在较高负载量时，Cr6+与结晶Cr2O3共存。

3. 载体性质：SBA-1的高比表面积允许铬物种比在常规二氧化硅载体上有更好的分散性。

4. 氧化态：在反应过程中，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+，这些物种参与负责催化活性的氧化还原循环。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高分散、高价态物种，到高负载时高价态物种与结晶Cr2O3混合的转变。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在中等负载量(7 wt% Cr)时达到最佳活性，此时活性高价态Cr物种数量最大化，同时最小化了无活性Cr2O3的形成。

The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP include:

1. Chromium loading: The catalytic activity increases with Cr loading up to an optimal level (7 wt% in this study), beyond which it remains constant or decreases slightly.

2. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings (<7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ species (chromates and dichromates) dominate. As loading increases, Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline α-Cr2O3 begin to form.

3. Redox properties: The high catalytic activity is attributed to redox cycles involving Cr2+ and Cr3+ species.

4. Support properties: The high surface area of SBA-1 allows for better dispersion of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

5. Formation of inactive species: At higher loadings, the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 leads to a plateau in catalytic activity as these species are less active.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading on SBA-1 support shows a transition from well-dispersed, high-valent Cr6+ species at low loadings to a mixture of Cr6+ and crystalline Cr3+ species at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts the catalytic performance, with an optimal balance of active species achieved at around 7 wt% Cr loading.

影响负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：催化活性随铬负载量增加而提高，直到达到最佳水平(本研究中为7 wt%)，之后保持恒定或略有下降。

2. 铬物种演变：在低负载量(<7 wt%)时，高价Cr6+物种(铬酸盐和重铬酸盐)占主导地位。随着负载量增加，以α-Cr2O3晶体形式存在的Cr3+物种开始形成。

3. 氧化还原性质：高催化活性归因于涉及Cr2+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环。

4. 载体性质：SBA-1的高比表面积允许比传统二氧化硅载体更好地分散铬物种。

5. 非活性物种的形成：在较高负载量下，晶态Cr2O3的形成导致催化活性趋于平稳，因为这些物种活性较低。

铬物种随SBA-1载体负载量的演变显示，从低负载量时的分散良好的高价Cr6+物种，过渡到高负载量时Cr6+和晶态Cr3+物种的混合。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在约7 wt%铬负载量时达到活性物种的最佳平衡。
