[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."

[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."

[3] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."

[4] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

[5] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."

[6] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."

The study focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-1 for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: Activity increases with Cr content up to 7 wt%, then plateaus due to formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Chromium species: Presence of high-valent Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+) correlates with higher activity. At lower loadings (<7 wt%), Cr6+ species dominate. At higher loadings, Cr6+ coexists with crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Support properties: SBA-1's high surface area allows for better dispersion of Cr species compared to conventional silica supports.

4. Oxidation state: During reaction, Cr6+ species rapidly reduce to Cr3+ and Cr2+, which participate in redox cycles responsible for catalytic activity.

The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading shows a transition from well-dispersed, high-valent species at lower loadings to a mix of high-valent species and crystalline Cr2O3 at higher loadings. This evolution directly impacts catalytic performance, with optimal activity achieved at an intermediate loading (7 wt% Cr) that maximizes the number of active, high-valent Cr species while minimizing inactive Cr2O3 formation.

这项研究主要关注SBA-1负载的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的表现。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而上升，直至7 wt%后趋于平稳，这是由于形成了无活性的结晶Cr2O3。

2. 铬物种：高价态铬物种(Cr6+, Cr5+)的存在与更高的活性相关。在较低负载量(<7 wt%)时，Cr6+物种占主导。在较高负载量时，Cr6+与结晶Cr2O3共存。

3. 载体性质：SBA-1的高比表面积允许铬物种比在常规二氧化硅载体上有更好的分散性。

4. 氧化态：在反应过程中，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+，这些物种参与负责催化活性的氧化还原循环。

随着负载量的变化，铬物种的演变显示出从低负载时的高分散、高价态物种，到高负载时高价态物种与结晶Cr2O3混合的转变。这种演变直接影响催化性能，在中等负载量(7 wt% Cr)时达到最佳活性，此时活性高价态Cr物种数量最大化，同时最小化了无活性Cr2O3的形成。
