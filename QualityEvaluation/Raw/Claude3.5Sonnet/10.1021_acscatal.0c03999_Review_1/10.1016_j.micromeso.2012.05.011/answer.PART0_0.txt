[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

[5] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples. Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content. Cr5+ species were found in the samples containing below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."

[6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal. For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium loading: The activity increases with Cr content up to an optimal loading (around 7 wt% in this study), after which it plateaus due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3.

2. Oxidation state of chromium: Various redox cycles between Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ species have been proposed as active sites.

3. Dispersion of chromium species: Well-dispersed Cr species are more active than crystalline Cr2O3 particles.

4. Support properties: High surface area supports provide more adsorption sites to stabilize redox Cr species, improving catalytic performance.

5. Chromium species evolution: At low loadings (<7 wt%), high-valent Cr6+ and Cr5+ species dominate. As loading increases, Cr6+ species (mainly chromates and dichromates) coexist with crystalline Cr2O3.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is highly dependent on the total Cr content and support properties. Mesoporous supports like SBA-1 allow for higher Cr dispersion and stabilization of active redox species, leading to improved catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP compared to conventional supports.

铬氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬负载量：活性随铬含量增加而提高，直至达到最佳负载量（本研究中约为7 wt%），之后由于形成无活性的晶态Cr2O3而趋于平稳。

2. 铬的氧化态：提出了Cr6+/Cr3+、Cr5+/Cr3+和Cr3+/Cr2+等不同氧化还原循环作为活性位点。

3. 铬物种的分散度：分散良好的铬物种比晶态Cr2O3颗粒更具活性。

4. 载体性质：高比表面积载体提供更多吸附位点以稳定氧化还原铬物种，从而提高催化性能。

5. 铬物种演变：在低负载量(<7 wt%)时，高价态Cr6+和Cr5+物种占主导。随着负载量增加，Cr6+物种（主要是铬酸盐和重铬酸盐）与晶态Cr2O3共存。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变高度依赖于总铬含量和载体性质。与传统载体相比，SBA-1等介孔载体允许更高的铬分散度和活性氧化还原物种的稳定，从而在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出更优异的催化性能。
