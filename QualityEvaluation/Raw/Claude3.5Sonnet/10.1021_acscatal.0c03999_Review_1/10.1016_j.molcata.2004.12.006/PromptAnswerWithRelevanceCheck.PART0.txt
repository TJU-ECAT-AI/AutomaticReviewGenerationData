[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high selectivity above 90% of styrene. The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Ethylbenzene conversion increased with increasing Cr content up to 1.7 wt.% (Si/Cr = 50), where the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts (V, Cr, Fe, and Ga) supported on MCM-41 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODHEB). Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity and selectivity among the tested catalysts, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity to styrene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal type: Cr was most active, followed by V, Ga, and Fe.

2. Cr loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which structural changes occurred.

3. Chromium species evolution: Initially, active Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form, which are reduced to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedral species during the reaction.

4. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure contribute to good dispersion of Cr species.

5. Redox properties: The Cr(II)/Cr(III) redox cycle plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, involving both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift reaction.

6. Regeneration ability: Deactivated catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen or CO2, restoring the active Cr(VI) species.

The evolution of chromium species is particularly important, as the transformation from dispersed Cr(VI)O4 to aggregated Cr(III)O6 species during the reaction is linked to catalyst deactivation. The ability to regenerate the active Cr(VI) species through oxidative treatments is key to maintaining catalyst performance.

该研究比较了各种负载在MCM-41上的金属氧化物催化剂(V、Cr、Fe和Ga)在CO2辅助乙苯氧化脱氢(ODHEB)中的性能。Cr-MCM-41在测试的催化剂中显示出最高的活性和选择性,实现了65%的乙苯转化率,同时对苯乙烯的选择性超过90%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 金属类型:Cr最活跃,其次是V、Ga和Fe。

2. Cr负载量:活性随Cr含量增加而增加,直到1.7 wt%,超过此含量会发生结构变化。

3. 铬物种演变:最初形成活性Cr(VI)O4四面体物种,在反应过程中被还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体物种。

4. 载体性质:MCM-41的高比表面积和有序介孔结构有助于Cr物种的良好分散。

5. 氧化还原性质:Cr(II)/Cr(III)氧化还原循环在催化过程中起着关键作用,涉及直接氧化脱氢和逆水气变换反应。

6. 再生能力:失活的催化剂可以通过氧气或CO2处理再生,恢复活性Cr(VI)物种。

铬物种的演变尤为重要,因为在反应过程中分散的Cr(VI)O4向聚集的Cr(III)O6物种的转变与催化剂失活有关。通过氧化处理恢复活性Cr(VI)物种的能力是保持催化剂性能的关键。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 exhibited the highest activity, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity for styrene. The activity order of different metals was similar for both M-MCM-41 and diamond-supported metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination acts as the active monochromate species, while Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination is less active.

3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content leads to the formation of di- or polychromate species, amorphous phases, and eventually crystalline chromia phases.

4. Support properties: MCM-41, with its high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure, provides an effective support for dispersing chromium species.

5. Reaction mechanism: The catalytic cycle involves a redox process between Cr(III) and Cr(II), facilitating both direct dehydrogenation with CO2 and reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form on the support surface. As loading increases, these species gradually transform into di- or polychromate species, then amorphous phases, and finally crystalline chromia phases. The support's surface area and pore structure influence the dispersion and stability of these chromium species, affecting the overall catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中表现出不同的活性和选择性。在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，实现了65%的乙苯转化率，苯乙烯的选择性超过90%。不同金属的活性顺序在M-MCM-41和金刚石负载金属催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢时相似。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：铬显示出比其他测试金属更优越的性能。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4作为活性单铬酸盐物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)O6活性较低。

3. 铬负载量：随着Cr含量的增加，会形成二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种，非晶相，最终形成结晶的氧化铬相。

4. 载体性质：MCM-41具有高比表面积和有序的介孔结构，为分散铬物种提供了有效的载体。

5. 反应机理：催化循环涉及Cr(III)和Cr(II)之间的氧化还原过程，促进了CO2直接脱氢和逆水气变换反应。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，载体表面形成孤立的四面体Cr(VI)O4物种。随着负载量增加，这些物种逐渐转变为二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种，然后是非晶相，最后是结晶的氧化铬相。载体的比表面积和孔结构影响这些铬物种的分散和稳定性，从而影响整体催化性能。

[5] "It seems that the tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. However, the reaction proceeded under CO2 atmosphere even after the deactivation, where Cr(VI) tetrahedra almost disappeared and moreover its quick regeneration was not easy."

Various metal oxide catalysts showed different activities for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 demonstrating the highest activity among the M-MCM-41 catalysts tested. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Cr showed superior performance compared to V, Ga, and Fe supported on MCM-41.

2. Chromium loading: The rate of styrene formation increased with Cr loading up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which the activity gradually increased but at a slower rate.

3. Chromium species evolution: Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as an active monochromate species. During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active and exists as polychromate species.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 plays a role in dispersing Cr species. At higher Cr contents, the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure decreases, leading to aggregation of Cr species and reduced dispersion.

5. Oxidation state and coordination: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) appears to play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. However, the reaction can still proceed even after the disappearance of Cr(VI) tetrahedra, suggesting that other Cr species (possibly Cr(III) and Cr(II)) may also be involved in the catalytic cycle.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by the initial formation of well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra, which are reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction. This transformation is accompanied by a decrease in catalytic activity. The catalyst can be regenerated through oxidation treatments, which convert the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性，其中Cr-MCM-41在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中表现出最高的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：在MCM-41载体上，Cr的性能优于V、Ga和Fe。

2. 铬负载量：苯乙烯的生成速率随着Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到1.7 wt%，之后活性继续缓慢增加。

3. 铬物种演变：初始时，四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4形成活性单铬酸盐物种。在反应过程中，它被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6，活性较低，以多铬酸盐物种形式存在。

4. 载体特性：MCM-41的介孔结构在分散Cr物种方面起重要作用。在较高的Cr含量下，介孔结构的规整性降低，导致Cr物种聚集和分散度降低。

5. 氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)似乎在CO2存在下的乙苯脱氢反应中起关键作用。然而，即使在Cr(VI)四面体消失后，反应仍能进行，这表明其他Cr物种（可能是Cr(III)和Cr(II)）也可能参与催化循环。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征是初始形成分散良好的Cr(VI)O4四面体，在反应过程中被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。这种转变伴随着催化活性的降低。通过氧化处理可以使催化剂再生，将Cr(III)物种转化回Cr(VI)物种。
