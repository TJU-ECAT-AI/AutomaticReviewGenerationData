[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "The increase in Cr content leads gradually to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and finally crystalline -chromia phases."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

Various metal oxide catalysts showed different activities for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 exhibiting the highest activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal type: Cr performed best, followed by V, Ga, and Fe.

2. Chromium species evolution: Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as the active monochromate species. During the reaction, it reduces to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active.

3. Chromium loading: As Cr content increases, it leads to the formation of di- or polychromate species, then amorphous and crystalline chromia phases.

4. Support properties: MCM-41 provides a high surface area and uniform mesoporous structure, allowing for better dispersion of chromium species.

5. Redox properties: The catalytic cycle likely involves a redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) species, which plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts in the CO2-ODHP reaction, with the evolution and dispersion of chromium species being particularly important for maintaining high activity and selectivity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性，其中Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性和选择性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属类型：Cr表现最佳，其次是V、Ga和Fe。

2. 铬物种的演变：最初，四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4形成为活性单铬酸盐物种。在反应过程中，它还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6，活性较低。

3. 铬负载量：随着Cr含量的增加，会导致二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种的形成，然后是无定形和晶态的氧化铬相。

4. 载体性质：MCM-41提供了高比表面积和均匀的介孔结构，有利于铬物种的更好分散。

5. 氧化还原性质：催化循环可能涉及Cr(II)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环，这在脱氢过程中起着关键作用。

这些因素共同contributes了Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的优异性能，其中铬物种的演变和分散对于维持高活性和选择性尤为重要。
