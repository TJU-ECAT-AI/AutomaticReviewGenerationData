[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."

[5] "These results obtained by both XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were almost similar to those observed in the dehydrogenation of propane [37,38]."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts supported on MCM-41 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2-ODHP). Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity and selectivity among the tested catalysts, achieving 65% ethylbenzene conversion with over 90% styrene selectivity.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal type: Cr was most active, followed by V, Ga, and Fe.

2. Chromium loading: Activity increased with Cr loading up to 1.7 wt%.

3. Chromium species evolution: 
   - Initially, active Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form
   - During reaction, these reduce to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedral species
   - Deactivation occurs as Cr(III) species accumulate
   - Regeneration with O2 or CO2 reoxidizes Cr(III) back to active Cr(VI) species

4. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure likely contribute to good catalyst performance.

5. Reaction atmosphere: CO2 presence enhances activity compared to inert atmosphere.

The evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in catalyst activity and deactivation/regeneration cycles. This behavior was observed to be similar for both ethylbenzene and propane dehydrogenation reactions over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

该研究比较了各种负载在MCM-41上的金属氧化物催化剂用于CO2辅助乙苯氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)的性能。Cr-MCM-41在测试的催化剂中显示出最高的活性和选择性,实现了65%的乙苯转化率和90%以上的苯乙烯选择性。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 金属类型:Cr最活跃,其次是V、Ga和Fe。

2. 铬负载量:活性随铬负载量增加而增加,直至1.7 wt%。

3. 铬物种演变:
   - 最初形成活性Cr(VI)O4四面体物种
   - 反应过程中,这些物种还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体物种
   - 随着Cr(III)物种的累积,催化剂失活
   - 用O2或CO2再生可将Cr(III)重新氧化为活性Cr(VI)物种

4. 载体性质:MCM-41的高比表面积和有序介孔结构可能有助于催化剂的良好性能。

5. 反应气氛:与惰性气氛相比,CO2的存在增强了活性。

铬物种的演变在催化剂活性和失活/再生循环中起着关键作用。观察到这种行为在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上的乙苯和丙烷脱氢反应中都是相似的。
