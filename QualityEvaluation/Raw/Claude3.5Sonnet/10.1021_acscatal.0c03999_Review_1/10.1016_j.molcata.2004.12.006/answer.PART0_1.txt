[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "The increase in Cr content leads gradually to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and finally crystalline -chromia phases."

[5] "It is suggested that ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to styrene directly with CO2 and also coupled by reverse water-gas shift reaction and that both reactions were catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II)."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2). Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 exhibited the highest activity, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity for styrene. The activity order of different metals was similar for both M-MCM-41 and diamond-supported metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal: Chromium showed superior performance compared to other metals tested.

2. Oxidation state and coordination of chromium: Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination acts as the active monochromate species, while Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination is less active.

3. Chromium loading: Increasing Cr content leads to the formation of di- or polychromate species, amorphous phases, and eventually crystalline chromia phases.

4. Support properties: MCM-41, with its high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure, provides an effective support for dispersing chromium species.

5. Reaction mechanism: The catalytic cycle involves a redox process between Cr(III) and Cr(II), facilitating both direct dehydrogenation with CO2 and reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. At low loadings, isolated Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form on the support surface. As loading increases, these species gradually transform into di- or polychromate species, then amorphous phases, and finally crystalline chromia phases. The support's surface area and pore structure influence the dispersion and stability of these chromium species, affecting the overall catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP（使用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢）中表现出不同的活性和选择性。在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，实现了65%的乙苯转化率，苯乙烯的选择性超过90%。不同金属的活性顺序在M-MCM-41和金刚石负载金属催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢时相似。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属的性质：铬显示出比其他测试金属更优越的性能。

2. 铬的氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4作为活性单铬酸盐物种，而八面体配位的Cr(III)O6活性较低。

3. 铬负载量：随着Cr含量的增加，会形成二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种，非晶相，最终形成结晶的氧化铬相。

4. 载体性质：MCM-41具有高比表面积和有序的介孔结构，为分散铬物种提供了有效的载体。

5. 反应机理：催化循环涉及Cr(III)和Cr(II)之间的氧化还原过程，促进了CO2直接脱氢和逆水气变换反应。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。在低负载量时，载体表面形成孤立的四面体Cr(VI)O4物种。随着负载量增加，这些物种逐渐转变为二铬酸盐或多铬酸盐物种，然后是非晶相，最后是结晶的氧化铬相。载体的比表面积和孔结构影响这些铬物种的分散和稳定性，从而影响整体催化性能。
