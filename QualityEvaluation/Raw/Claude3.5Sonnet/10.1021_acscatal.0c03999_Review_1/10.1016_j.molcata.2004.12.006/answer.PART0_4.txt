[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[3] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%."

[4] "It is considered that, at higher Cr contents, the dispersion of Cr species decreased by the aggregation (vide infra) partly due to the decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure."

[5] "It seems that the tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. However, the reaction proceeded under CO2 atmosphere even after the deactivation, where Cr(VI) tetrahedra almost disappeared and moreover its quick regeneration was not easy."

Various metal oxide catalysts showed different activities for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 demonstrating the highest activity among the M-MCM-41 catalysts tested. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal species: Cr showed superior performance compared to V, Ga, and Fe supported on MCM-41.

2. Chromium loading: The rate of styrene formation increased with Cr loading up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which the activity gradually increased but at a slower rate.

3. Chromium species evolution: Initially, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination forms as an active monochromate species. During the reaction, it is reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination, which is less active and exists as polychromate species.

4. Support properties: The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 plays a role in dispersing Cr species. At higher Cr contents, the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure decreases, leading to aggregation of Cr species and reduced dispersion.

5. Oxidation state and coordination: Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) appears to play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. However, the reaction can still proceed even after the disappearance of Cr(VI) tetrahedra, suggesting that other Cr species (possibly Cr(III) and Cr(II)) may also be involved in the catalytic cycle.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is characterized by the initial formation of well-dispersed Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra, which are reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction. This transformation is accompanied by a decrease in catalytic activity. The catalyst can be regenerated through oxidation treatments, which convert the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性，其中Cr-MCM-41在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中表现出最高的活性。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属种类：在MCM-41载体上，Cr的性能优于V、Ga和Fe。

2. 铬负载量：苯乙烯的生成速率随着Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到1.7 wt%，之后活性继续缓慢增加。

3. 铬物种演变：初始时，四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4形成活性单铬酸盐物种。在反应过程中，它被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6，活性较低，以多铬酸盐物种形式存在。

4. 载体特性：MCM-41的介孔结构在分散Cr物种方面起重要作用。在较高的Cr含量下，介孔结构的规整性降低，导致Cr物种聚集和分散度降低。

5. 氧化态和配位：四面体配位的Cr(VI)似乎在CO2存在下的乙苯脱氢反应中起关键作用。然而，即使在Cr(VI)四面体消失后，反应仍能进行，这表明其他Cr物种（可能是Cr(III)和Cr(II)）也可能参与催化循环。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变特征是初始形成分散良好的Cr(VI)O4四面体，在反应过程中被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。这种转变伴随着催化活性的降低。通过氧化处理可以使催化剂再生，将Cr(III)物种转化回Cr(VI)物种。
