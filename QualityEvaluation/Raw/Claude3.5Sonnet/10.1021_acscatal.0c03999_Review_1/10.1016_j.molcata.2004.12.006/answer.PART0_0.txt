[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high selectivity above 90% of styrene. The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Ethylbenzene conversion increased with increasing Cr content up to 1.7 wt.% (Si/Cr = 50), where the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium."

[5] "It is most likely that molecularly dispersed chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in the water-gas shift reaction."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts (V, Cr, Fe, and Ga) supported on MCM-41 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODHEB). Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity and selectivity among the tested catalysts, achieving 65% conversion of ethylbenzene with over 90% selectivity to styrene.

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Metal type: Cr was most active, followed by V, Ga, and Fe.

2. Cr loading: Activity increased with Cr content up to 1.7 wt%, beyond which structural changes occurred.

3. Chromium species evolution: Initially, active Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral species form, which are reduced to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedral species during the reaction.

4. Support properties: MCM-41's high surface area and ordered mesoporous structure contribute to good dispersion of Cr species.

5. Redox properties: The Cr(II)/Cr(III) redox cycle plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, involving both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift reaction.

6. Regeneration ability: Deactivated catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen or CO2, restoring the active Cr(VI) species.

The evolution of chromium species is particularly important, as the transformation from dispersed Cr(VI)O4 to aggregated Cr(III)O6 species during the reaction is linked to catalyst deactivation. The ability to regenerate the active Cr(VI) species through oxidative treatments is key to maintaining catalyst performance.

该研究比较了各种负载在MCM-41上的金属氧化物催化剂(V、Cr、Fe和Ga)在CO2辅助乙苯氧化脱氢(ODHEB)中的性能。Cr-MCM-41在测试的催化剂中显示出最高的活性和选择性,实现了65%的乙苯转化率,同时对苯乙烯的选择性超过90%。

影响催化性能的关键因素包括:

1. 金属类型:Cr最活跃,其次是V、Ga和Fe。

2. Cr负载量:活性随Cr含量增加而增加,直到1.7 wt%,超过此含量会发生结构变化。

3. 铬物种演变:最初形成活性Cr(VI)O4四面体物种,在反应过程中被还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体物种。

4. 载体性质:MCM-41的高比表面积和有序介孔结构有助于Cr物种的良好分散。

5. 氧化还原性质:Cr(II)/Cr(III)氧化还原循环在催化过程中起着关键作用,涉及直接氧化脱氢和逆水气变换反应。

6. 再生能力:失活的催化剂可以通过氧气或CO2处理再生,恢复活性Cr(VI)物种。

铬物种的演变尤为重要,因为在反应过程中分散的Cr(VI)O4向聚集的Cr(III)O6物种的转变与催化剂失活有关。通过氧化处理恢复活性Cr(VI)物种的能力是保持催化剂性能的关键。
