Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. Al2O3 and SiO2 show much lower activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include:

1. Cr loading: The generation and dispersion of lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield. Optimal activity is typically achieved at monolayer Cr coverage. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content, but excessive loading leads to the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

2. Support properties: The textural properties of the support significantly affect the dispersion and evolution of Cr species. Supports with high surface area and ordered mesoporous structures (e.g., SBA-15, MCM-41) can improve Cr dispersion and catalytic performance.

3. Metal-support interaction: Relatively weak metal-support interactions, such as those observed with SiO2 supports, appear to benefit C3H6 formation.

4. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity. Well-dispersed mono- and dichromates are associated with high activity, while extended polychromate structures formed at higher loadings are less active.

5. Oxidation state: The presence of lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+/Cr2+) is important for high C3H6 yield, with different redox cycles (Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+ or Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+) proposed depending on the support and reaction conditions.

These factors collectively influence the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, ultimately determining their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出最高的活性，其中Ga2O3性能最佳，其次是Fe2O3和Cr2O3。Al2O3和SiO2的活性则明显较低。

影响负载型Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：低氧化态Cr物种（Cr3+/Cr2+）的生成和分散对获得高C3H6产率至关重要。通常在Cr单层覆盖时达到最佳活性。低于这个阈值时，C3H6产率随Cr含量增加而增加，但过量负载会导致形成无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒。

2. 载体性质：载体的结构性质显著影响Cr物种的分散和演变。具有高比表面积和有序介孔结构的载体（如SBA-15、MCM-41）可以改善Cr分散和催化性能。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：相对较弱的金属-载体相互作用（如SiO2载体）似乎有利于C3H6的形成。

4. Cr结构：Cr结构的变化对Cr负载量敏感，并决定了活性。分散良好的单铬酸盐和重铬酸盐与高活性相关，而在高负载量下形成的扩展多铬酸盐结构活性较低。

5. 氧化态：低氧化态Cr物种（Cr3+/Cr2+）的存在对高C3H6产率很重要，根据载体和反应条件的不同，提出了不同的氧化还原循环（Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+或Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+）。

这些因素共同影响了负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，最终决定了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3, which have similar activities. Al2O3 and SiO2 show much lower activity.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Chromium oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for achieving high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading and coverage: A monolayer Cr coverage is generally optimal. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species may decompose to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

3. Support properties: The textural properties of the support affect the dispersion and structural evolution of Cr species. Supports with weak metal-support interactions, such as SiO2, tend to benefit C3H6 formation.

4. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity. Well-dispersed mono- and dichromates are associated with higher activity.

5. Surface area and porosity: Supports with high surface area and ordered mesoporous structures (e.g., MCM-41, SBA-15) can improve Cr dispersion and catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3. The optimal loading varies depending on the support but generally corresponds to a balance between well-dispersed active Cr species and the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3.

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量的演变通常遵循以下顺序：接枝Cr6+ → 分散Cr6+氧化物 → 微晶Cr3+ → 晶态α-Cr2O3。最佳负载量因载体而异，但通常对应于分散良好的活性Cr物种和无活性α-Cr2O3形成之间的平衡。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Different metal oxides have inherent differences in their catalytic properties.

2. Oxidation state of active species: For Cr catalysts, lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

3. Metal loading: The activity generally increases with metal content up to a monolayer coverage, beyond which it may decrease due to the formation of inactive crystalline phases.

4. Support properties: Textural properties of the support affect the dispersion and evolution of active species. Supports with weak metal-support interactions, like SiO2, tend to benefit C3H6 formation.

5. Catalyst preparation method: Different preparation methods can lead to varying distributions of active species and thus different catalytic performances.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is crucial:

1. At low loadings, well-dispersed Cr6+ species (mono- and dichromates) are formed.
2. As loading increases, these transform into polychromates.
3. At higher loadings, crystalline α-Cr2O3 begins to form, which is less active or inactive.

The optimal loading typically corresponds to a near-monolayer coverage, where maximum dispersion of active Cr species is achieved without significant formation of inactive crystalline phases. The support properties play a vital role in determining the dispersion and stability of these Cr species, with high surface area supports generally allowing for better dispersion and higher catalytic activity.

1. 金属氧化物的性质：不同的金属氧化物具有固有的催化特性差异。

2. 活性物种的氧化态：对于Cr催化剂，较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对获得高C3H6产率很重要。

3. 金属负载量：活性通常随金属含量增加而增加，直至达到单层覆盖，超过这个阈值后可能会由于形成无活性的晶态相而降低。

4. 载体性质：载体的结构特性影响活性物种的分散和演变。具有弱金属-载体相互作用的载体（如SiO2）往往有利于C3H6的形成。

5. 催化剂制备方法：不同的制备方法可能导致活性物种分布不同，从而影响催化性能。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量的演变至关重要：

1. 在低负载量时，形成分散良好的Cr6+物种（单铬酸盐和重铬酸盐）。
2. 随着负载量增加，这些物种转变为多铬酸盐。
3. 在更高的负载量下，开始形成结晶的α-Cr2O3，其活性较低或无活性。

最佳负载量通常对应于接近单层覆盖的情况，在这种情况下，活性Cr物种达到最大分散度，而不会形成大量无活性的晶态相。载体性质在决定这些Cr物种的分散和稳定性方面起着至关重要的作用，高比表面积的载体通常允许更好的分散，从而获得更高的催化活性。

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. The activity sequence for C3H6 yield is Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none. Among these, Cr-based catalysts have been extensively studied.

For supported Cr catalysts, the key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading: A monolayer coverage is optimal. Below this, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species can decompose to inactive α-Cr2O3.

3. Redox properties: There is a clear correlation between C3H6 yield and the number of redox sites.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects Cr dispersion and evolution. Metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are commonly used. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41) and carbon-based supports can provide better Cr dispersion.

5. Textural properties: High surface area and pore structure of supports influence Cr dispersion and mass transfer.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. With increasing loading, Cr species typically evolve from well-dispersed Cr6+ species to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, and finally to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings. The support's texture and surface chemistry play crucial roles in this evolution by affecting the Cr-support interaction and Cr dispersion.

5. 结构性质：载体的高比表面积和孔结构影响铬的分散和质量传递。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。随着负载量的增加，铬物种通常从分散良好的Cr6+物种演变为Cr3+/Cr2+物种，最终在高负载量时演变为无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3。载体的结构和表面化学性质通过影响铬-载体相互作用和铬的分散性在这一演变过程中起着关键作用。
