[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≈ 50% and olefin ≈ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3, which have similar activities. Al2O3 and SiO2 show much lower activity.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, several key factors influence their catalytic performance:

1. Chromium oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for achieving high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading and coverage: A monolayer Cr coverage is generally optimal. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species may decompose to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

3. Support properties: The textural properties of the support affect the dispersion and structural evolution of Cr species. Supports with weak metal-support interactions, such as SiO2, tend to benefit C3H6 formation.

4. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity. Well-dispersed mono- and dichromates are associated with higher activity.

5. Surface area and porosity: Supports with high surface area and ordered mesoporous structures (e.g., MCM-41, SBA-15) can improve Cr dispersion and catalytic performance.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading typically follows this sequence: grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3. The optimal loading varies depending on the support but generally corresponds to a balance between well-dispersed active Cr species and the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出最高的活性，其中Ga2O3性能最佳，其次是Fe2O3和Cr2O3，它们的活性相似。Al2O3和SiO2的活性则要低得多。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，几个关键因素影响其催化性能：

1. 铬的氧化态：较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对于获得高C3H6产率很重要。

2. Cr负载量和覆盖度：单层Cr覆盖通常是最佳的。低于这个阈值时，C3H6产率随Cr含量增加而增加。超过这个阈值，过量的Cr物种可能会分解成无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒。

3. 载体性质：载体的结构性质影响Cr物种的分散和结构演变。具有弱金属-载体相互作用的载体（如SiO2）往往有利于C3H6的形成。

4. Cr结构：Cr结构的变化对Cr负载量敏感，并决定了活性。分散良好的单铬酸盐和重铬酸盐与更高的活性相关。

5. 比表面积和孔隙度：具有高比表面积和有序介孔结构的载体（如MCM-41、SBA-15）可以改善Cr的分散和催化性能。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载量的演变通常遵循以下顺序：接枝Cr6+ → 分散Cr6+氧化物 → 微晶Cr3+ → 晶态α-Cr2O3。最佳负载量因载体而异，但通常对应于分散良好的活性Cr物种和无活性α-Cr2O3形成之间的平衡。
