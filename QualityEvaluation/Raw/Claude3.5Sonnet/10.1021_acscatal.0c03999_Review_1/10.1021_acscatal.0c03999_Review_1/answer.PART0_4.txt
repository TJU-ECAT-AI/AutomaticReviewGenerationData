[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."

[4] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[5] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≥ 50% and olefin ≥ 90%)."

[6] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, with Ga2O3 showing the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. 

For supported Cr catalysts, the key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Cr species oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr coverage and support properties: The structural evolution of Cr species depends heavily on these factors.

3. Cr loading: As loading increases, Cr species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, then to microcrystalline Cr3+, and finally to crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. Monolayer coverage: This is the optimal threshold for Cr-dependent activity. Below this, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content; above it, excess Cr species decompose to inactive α-Cr2O3 particles.

5. Support interaction: Weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, benefit C3H6 formation.

6. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity.

These factors combined determine the overall catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出活性，其中Ga2O3显示最高的C3H6产率，其次是Fe2O3和Cr2O3。

对于负载型Cr催化剂，影响其催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr物种的氧化态：较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对获得高C3H6产率很重要。

2. Cr覆盖度和载体性质：Cr物种的结构演变很大程度上依赖于这些因素。

3. Cr负载量：随着负载量的增加，Cr物种从接枝Cr6+演变为分散Cr6+氧化物，然后是微晶Cr3+，最后是结晶α-Cr2O3。

4. 单层覆盖：这是Cr依赖活性的最佳阈值。低于此阈值时，C3H6产率随Cr含量增加而增加；高于此阈值时，过量的Cr物种分解为无活性的α-Cr2O3颗粒。

5. 载体相互作用：弱的金属-载体相互作用（如SiO2）有利于C3H6的形成。

6. Cr结构：Cr结构的变化对Cr负载量敏感，并决定了活性。

这些因素共同决定了负载型Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体催化性能。
