[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≈ 50% and olefin ≈ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. Al2O3 and SiO2 show much lower activity.

The key factors influencing catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include:

1. Cr loading: The generation and dispersion of lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield. Optimal activity is typically achieved at monolayer Cr coverage. Below this threshold, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content, but excessive loading leads to the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles.

2. Support properties: The textural properties of the support significantly affect the dispersion and evolution of Cr species. Supports with high surface area and ordered mesoporous structures (e.g., SBA-15, MCM-41) can improve Cr dispersion and catalytic performance.

3. Metal-support interaction: Relatively weak metal-support interactions, such as those observed with SiO2 supports, appear to benefit C3H6 formation.

4. Cr structure: The variation of Cr structures is sensitive to Cr loadings and determines activity. Well-dispersed mono- and dichromates are associated with high activity, while extended polychromate structures formed at higher loadings are less active.

5. Oxidation state: The presence of lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+/Cr2+) is important for high C3H6 yield, with different redox cycles (Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+ or Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+) proposed depending on the support and reaction conditions.

These factors collectively influence the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, ultimately determining their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出最高的活性，其中Ga2O3性能最佳，其次是Fe2O3和Cr2O3。Al2O3和SiO2的活性则明显较低。

影响负载型Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. Cr负载量：低氧化态Cr物种（Cr3+/Cr2+）的生成和分散对获得高C3H6产率至关重要。通常在Cr单层覆盖时达到最佳活性。低于这个阈值时，C3H6产率随Cr含量增加而增加，但过量负载会导致形成无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒。

2. 载体性质：载体的结构性质显著影响Cr物种的分散和演变。具有高比表面积和有序介孔结构的载体（如SBA-15、MCM-41）可以改善Cr分散和催化性能。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：相对较弱的金属-载体相互作用（如SiO2载体）似乎有利于C3H6的形成。

4. Cr结构：Cr结构的变化对Cr负载量敏感，并决定了活性。分散良好的单铬酸盐和重铬酸盐与高活性相关，而在高负载量下形成的扩展多铬酸盐结构活性较低。

5. 氧化态：低氧化态Cr物种（Cr3+/Cr2+）的存在对高C3H6产率很重要，根据载体和反应条件的不同，提出了不同的氧化还原循环（Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+或Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+）。

这些因素共同影响了负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，最终决定了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。
