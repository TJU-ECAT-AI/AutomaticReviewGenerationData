[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP."

[5] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. The activity sequence for C3H6 yield is Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none. Among these, Cr-based catalysts have been extensively studied.

For supported Cr catalysts, the key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Cr oxidation state: Lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

2. Cr loading: A monolayer coverage is optimal. Below this, C3H6 yield increases with Cr content. Above it, excess Cr species can decompose to inactive α-Cr2O3.

3. Redox properties: There is a clear correlation between C3H6 yield and the number of redox sites.

4. Support properties: The nature of the support affects Cr dispersion and evolution. Metal oxides like Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are commonly used. Ordered mesoporous materials (SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41) and carbon-based supports can provide better Cr dispersion.

5. Textural properties: High surface area and pore structure of supports influence Cr dispersion and mass transfer.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on loading and support properties. With increasing loading, Cr species typically evolve from well-dispersed Cr6+ species to Cr3+/Cr2+ species, and finally to inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 at high loadings. The support's texture and surface chemistry play crucial roles in this evolution by affecting the Cr-support interaction and Cr dispersion.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。C3H6产率的活性顺序为Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ 无。其中，铬基催化剂已被广泛研究。

对于负载型铬催化剂，影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 铬的氧化态：较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对于获得高C3H6产率很重要。

2. 铬的负载量：单层覆盖是最佳的。低于此值时，C3H6产率随铬含量增加而增加。超过此值时，过量的铬物种可能分解为无活性的α-Cr2O3。

3. 氧化还原性质：C3H6产率与氧化还原位点数量存在明显的相关性。

4. 载体性质：载体的性质影响铬的分散和演变。常用的金属氧化物载体包括Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2、TiO2和SiO2。有序介孔材料（SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41）和碳基载体可以提供更好的铬分散性。

5. 结构性质：载体的高比表面积和孔结构影响铬的分散和质量传递。

负载型Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和载体性质。随着负载量的增加，铬物种通常从分散良好的Cr6+物种演变为Cr3+/Cr2+物种，最终在高负载量时演变为无活性的晶态α-Cr2O3。载体的结构和表面化学性质通过影响铬-载体相互作用和铬的分散性在这一演变过程中起着关键作用。
