[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 ≈ none."

[2] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[3] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

[4] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≥ 50% and olefin ≥ 90%)."

[5] "Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2."

Various metal oxide catalysts show different activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit the highest activity, with Ga2O3 showing the best performance. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include:

1. Nature of the metal oxide: Different metal oxides have inherent differences in their catalytic properties.

2. Oxidation state of active species: For Cr catalysts, lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are important for high C3H6 yield.

3. Metal loading: The activity generally increases with metal content up to a monolayer coverage, beyond which it may decrease due to the formation of inactive crystalline phases.

4. Support properties: Textural properties of the support affect the dispersion and evolution of active species. Supports with weak metal-support interactions, like SiO2, tend to benefit C3H6 formation.

5. Catalyst preparation method: Different preparation methods can lead to varying distributions of active species and thus different catalytic performances.

For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading is crucial:

1. At low loadings, well-dispersed Cr6+ species (mono- and dichromates) are formed.
2. As loading increases, these transform into polychromates.
3. At higher loadings, crystalline α-Cr2O3 begins to form, which is less active or inactive.

The optimal loading typically corresponds to a near-monolayer coverage, where maximum dispersion of active Cr species is achieved without significant formation of inactive crystalline phases. The support properties play a vital role in determining the dispersion and stability of these Cr species, with high surface area supports generally allowing for better dispersion and higher catalytic activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出不同的活性和选择性。Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出最高的活性，其中Ga2O3性能最佳。影响催化性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属氧化物的性质：不同的金属氧化物具有固有的催化特性差异。

2. 活性物种的氧化态：对于Cr催化剂，较低的氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）对获得高C3H6产率很重要。

3. 金属负载量：活性通常随金属含量增加而增加，直至达到单层覆盖，超过这个阈值后可能会由于形成无活性的晶态相而降低。

4. 载体性质：载体的结构特性影响活性物种的分散和演变。具有弱金属-载体相互作用的载体（如SiO2）往往有利于C3H6的形成。

5. 催化剂制备方法：不同的制备方法可能导致活性物种分布不同，从而影响催化性能。

对于负载型Cr2O3催化剂，铬物种随负载量的演变至关重要：

1. 在低负载量时，形成分散良好的Cr6+物种（单铬酸盐和重铬酸盐）。
2. 随着负载量增加，这些物种转变为多铬酸盐。
3. 在更高的负载量下，开始形成结晶的α-Cr2O3，其活性较低或无活性。

最佳负载量通常对应于接近单层覆盖的情况，在这种情况下，活性Cr物种达到最大分散度，而不会形成大量无活性的晶态相。载体性质在决定这些Cr物种的分散和稳定性方面起着至关重要的作用，高比表面积的载体通常允许更好的分散，从而获得更高的催化活性。
