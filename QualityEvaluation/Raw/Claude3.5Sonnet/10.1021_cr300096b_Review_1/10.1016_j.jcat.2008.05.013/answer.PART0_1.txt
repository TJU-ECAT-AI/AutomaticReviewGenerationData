[1] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr."

[2] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (5×10−8 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[3] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[4] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[5] "When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature was elevated to 600 K during deposition, then the 3d metal began to diffuse into the subsurface region, with the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt"

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) using thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically involves a UHV chamber with a base pressure in the range of 10^-10 Torr. 

The process begins with thorough cleaning of the substrate surface, usually involving sputter-anneal cycles and oxygen treatment to remove contaminants. For the deposition itself, a high-purity metal wire is wound around a tungsten filament, which is then enclosed in a shield to direct the metal vapor onto the substrate. The filament is resistively heated using a DC power supply to evaporate the metal.

Critical process parameters include the deposition rate (typically 0.2-0.3 monolayers per minute), substrate temperature, and total coverage. The substrate temperature is particularly important, as it can determine whether the deposited metal remains on the surface (e.g., at 300 K) or diffuses into the subsurface region (e.g., at 600 K).

To ensure high-purity overlayers, ultra-high vacuum conditions are maintained throughout the process, and high-purity metal sources are used. The deposition is monitored in-situ using techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to determine the coverage and composition of the deposited layer.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include maintaining UHV conditions, careful control of deposition parameters, and thorough characterization of the resulting surfaces using techniques like AES and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).

物理气相沉积(PVD)使用热蒸发是一种广泛应用于超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面的技术,用于表面科学研究。实验装置通常包括一个基压在10^-10 Torr范围内的UHV腔。

该过程始于对基底表面的彻底清洁,通常涉及溅射-退火循环和氧处理以去除污染物。对于沉积本身,将高纯度金属丝缠绕在钨丝上,然后将其封装在屏蔽罩中,以将金属蒸汽引导到基底上。使用直流电源对灯丝进行电阻加热以蒸发金属。

关键工艺参数包括沉积速率(通常为每分钟0.2-0.3单层)、基底温度和总覆盖率。基底温度尤为重要,因为它可以决定沉积的金属是保留在表面(例如,在300 K下)还是扩散到亚表面区域(例如,在600 K下)。

为确保高纯度的覆盖层,在整个过程中保持超高真空条件,并使用高纯度金属源。使用诸如俄歇电子能谱(AES)等技术对沉积进行原位监测,以确定沉积层的覆盖率和成分。

这种方法通过允许精确控制双金属表面的成分和结构来促进表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括维持UHV条件、仔细控制沉积参数,以及使用AES和程序升温脱附(TPD)等技术对所得表面进行彻底表征。
