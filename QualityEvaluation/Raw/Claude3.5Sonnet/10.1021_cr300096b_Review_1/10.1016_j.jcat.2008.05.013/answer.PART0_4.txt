[1] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr."

[2] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (5×10−8 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[3] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[4] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[5] "When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature was elevated to 600 K during deposition, then the 3d metal began to diffuse into the subsurface region, with the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt"

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr. 

The process begins with thorough cleaning of the Pt(111) substrate using Ne+ sputter cycles, high-temperature flashing, oxygen dosing, and annealing. This ensures a clean surface for deposition.

The 3d metal is deposited using a custom-made evaporation source. A thin wire of the desired 3d metal is wrapped around a tungsten wire to create a filament. This filament is enclosed in a stainless steel shield to direct the metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when heated resistively.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Deposition rate: 0.2-0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute
2. Substrate temperature: 300K for surface deposition, 600K for subsurface diffusion
3. Coverage: Approximately one monolayer of 3d metal

The quantity and quality of the deposited metal are monitored using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. The 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio is used to determine the amount of metal deposited.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include maintaining UHV conditions, careful preparation and cleaning of the substrate, precise control of deposition rate and substrate temperature, and accurate monitoring of coverage using AES.

物理气相沉积(PVD)技术，特别是热蒸发法，被用于在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面。实验装置包括一个双层不锈钢UHV腔，其基础压力为2×10−10 Torr。

过程始于对Pt(111)基底的彻底清洁，包括Ne+离子溅射循环、高温闪烁、氧气剂量和退火。这确保了一个干净的沉积表面。

3d金属通过定制的蒸发源进行沉积。将所需3d金属的细丝缠绕在钨丝上制成灯丝。这个灯丝被封闭在不锈钢屏蔽罩中，当电阻加热时，将金属蒸气引导到Pt(111)表面。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 沉积速率：每分钟0.2-0.3单层(ML)
2. 基底温度：表面沉积为300K，亚表面扩散为600K
3. 覆盖率：约一个单层的3d金属

使用加速电压为3 kV的俄歇电子能谱(AES)来监测沉积金属的数量和质量。3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES峰峰比用于确定沉积的金属量。

这种方法通过允许精确控制双金属表面的成分和结构，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括保持UHV条件、仔细准备和清洁基底、精确控制沉积速率和基底温度，以及使用AES准确监测覆盖率。
