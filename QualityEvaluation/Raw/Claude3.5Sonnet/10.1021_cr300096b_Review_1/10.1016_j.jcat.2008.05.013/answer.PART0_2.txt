[1] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 Torr."

[2] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (5 × 10−8 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[3] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[4] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is used in this study to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup consists of a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 Torr. 

The process begins with thorough cleaning of the Pt(111) substrate using Ne+ sputter cycles, high-temperature flashing, oxygen dosing, and annealing. This ensures a clean surface for deposition.

The PVD setup involves wrapping a thin wire (0.1 mm diameter) of the desired 3d metal around a tungsten filament (0.5 mm diameter). This assembly is enclosed in a stainless steel shield to direct the metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface. The filament is resistively heated using a DC power supply to evaporate the 3d metal.

Critical process parameters include the deposition rate (0.2-0.3 ML/min) and the total coverage (approximately one monolayer). The deposition is monitored and quantified using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), specifically by measuring the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) peak-to-peak ratio.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the study uses high-purity metal wires (99.95+% pure) and maintains UHV conditions throughout the process. The stainless steel shield helps direct the metal vapor, reducing potential contamination.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include maintaining UHV conditions, careful substrate preparation, precise control of deposition rates and coverage, and accurate in-situ monitoring of the deposition process using surface-sensitive techniques like AES.

本研究使用物理气相沉积(PVD)技术，特别是热蒸发法，在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面。实验装置由一个基压为2 × 10−10 Torr的双层不锈钢UHV腔室组成。

该过程首先对Pt(111)基底进行彻底清洁，使用Ne+溅射循环、高温闪烧、氧气剂量和退火。这确保了一个干净的沉积表面。

PVD装置包括将所需3d金属的细线(直径0.1 mm)缠绕在钨丝灯丝(直径0.5 mm)上。这个组件被封闭在不锈钢屏蔽罩中，以将金属蒸汽引导到Pt(111)表面。使用直流电源对灯丝进行电阻加热，以蒸发3d金属。

关键的工艺参数包括沉积速率(0.2-0.3 ML/min)和总覆盖率(约一个单层)。使用俄歇电子能谱(AES)监测和量化沉积过程，具体是通过测量3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV)峰峰比。

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层，研究使用高纯度金属线(纯度99.95+%)并在整个过程中保持UHV条件。不锈钢屏蔽罩有助于引导金属蒸汽，减少潜在的污染。

这种方法通过允许精确控制双金属表面的成分和结构，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括保持UHV条件、仔细的基底准备、精确控制沉积速率和覆盖率，以及使用AES等表面敏感技术对沉积过程进行准确的原位监测。
