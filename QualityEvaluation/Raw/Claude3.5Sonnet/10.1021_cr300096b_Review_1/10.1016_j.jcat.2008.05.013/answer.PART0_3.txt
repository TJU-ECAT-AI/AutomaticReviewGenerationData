[1] "This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[2] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min."

[3] "When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature was elevated to 600 K during deposition, then the 3d metal began to diffuse into the subsurface region, with the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt"

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique using thermal evaporation is described for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves wrapping a thin wire of the desired 3d metal around a tungsten wire to create a filament. This filament is enclosed in a stainless steel shield to direct the metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when heated resistively.

Critical process parameters include the deposition rate (0.2-0.3 ML/min), substrate temperature (300 K for surface deposition, 600 K for subsurface diffusion), and coverage (approximately one monolayer). The quantity of deposited metal is monitored using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) peak-to-peak ratios.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the experiments are conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. The Pt(111) substrate is cleaned through sputter-anneal cycles and oxygen dosing before deposition. High-purity metal wires (99.95+%) are used as evaporation sources.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces. It enables the creation of both surface (3d-Pt-Pt(111)) and subsurface (Pt-3d-Pt(111)) configurations by adjusting the substrate temperature during deposition.

Key considerations for optimal results include maintaining UHV conditions, precise control of deposition rates and substrate temperature, and accurate monitoring of coverage using surface-sensitive techniques like AES. The purity of source materials and cleanliness of the substrate are also crucial factors.

物理气相沉积(PVD)技术使用热蒸发法在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面。实验装置包括将所需3d金属的细线缠绕在钨丝上制成丝状物。这个丝状物被封闭在不锈钢罩内，当通电加热时，可以将金属蒸气引导到Pt(111)表面上。

关键的工艺参数包括沉积速率(0.2-0.3 ML/min)、基底温度(表面沉积为300 K，次表面扩散为600 K)以及覆盖率(约为一个单层)。沉积金属的数量通过俄歇电子能谱(AES)峰峰比来监测。

为确保高纯度的金属覆盖层，实验在超高真空腔室中进行。在沉积之前，Pt(111)基底通过溅射-退火循环和氧气剂量处理进行清洁。使用高纯度金属丝(99.95+%)作为蒸发源。

该方法通过精确控制双金属表面的组成和结构，有利于表面科学研究。通过调节沉积过程中的基底温度，可以创建表面(3d-Pt-Pt(111))和次表面(Pt-3d-Pt(111))配置。

获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括保持超高真空条件、精确控制沉积速率和基底温度，以及使用表面敏感技术(如AES)准确监测覆盖率。源材料的纯度和基底的清洁度也是至关重要的因素。
