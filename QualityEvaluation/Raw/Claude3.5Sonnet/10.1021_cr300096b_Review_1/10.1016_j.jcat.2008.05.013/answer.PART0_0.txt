[1] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr."

[2] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (5×10−8 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[3] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[4] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[5] "When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature was elevated to 600 K during deposition, then the 3d metal began to diffuse into the subsurface region, with the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt"

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr.

Key components of the setup include:
1. A Pt(111) single-crystal substrate
2. A thermal evaporation source made of a 3d metal wire wound around a tungsten filament
3. A stainless steel shield to direct the metal vapor
4. A DC power supply for resistive heating of the filament

Critical process parameters include:
1. Substrate temperature (300 K for surface deposition, 600 K for subsurface diffusion)
2. Deposition rate (0.2-0.3 ML/min)
3. Coverage (approximately one monolayer)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. The substrate is cleaned by Ne+ sputtering, flashing to 1050 K, and oxygen dosing
2. High-purity metal wires (99.95+%) are used for evaporation
3. UHV conditions are maintained throughout the process

The deposition is monitored and quantified using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), with the 3d/Pt peak ratio used to determine coverage.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include maintaining UHV conditions, careful substrate preparation, accurate temperature control, and precise monitoring of deposition rates and coverage.
