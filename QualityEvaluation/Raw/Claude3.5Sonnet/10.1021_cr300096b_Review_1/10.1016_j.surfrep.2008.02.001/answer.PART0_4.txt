[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[5] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×10−10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically consists of a tungsten wire (0.5 mm) wrapped with a thin wire (0.1 mm) of the metal to be deposited. This assembly is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Metal vapor flux rate
2. Deposition time
3. Substrate temperature
4. Deposition environment (vacuum or background gases)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. The metal source is conditioned by gradually heating to evaporation temperature and holding for several hours.
2. UHV pressure is maintained at 5×10−10 Torr or lower during deposition.
3. The substrate crystal is often kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process in a clean UHV environment. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum, controlling substrate temperature, and carefully managing deposition parameters to achieve the desired overlayer structure and composition.

物理气相沉积(PVD)，特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空(UHV)环境中制造双金属表面的广泛使用的方法。实验装置通常由一根钨丝(0.5毫米)包裹着待沉积金属的细丝(0.1毫米)组成。这个组件通过UHV导线连接到电源，可以通过电阻加热。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 金属蒸气通量率
2. 沉积时间
3. 基底温度
4. 沉积环境（真空或背景气体）

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 金属源通过逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持数小时来进行调节。
2. 沉积过程中UHV压力保持在5×10−10 Torr或更低。
3. 基底晶体通常保持在600 K，以最大程度地减少杂质吸附。

这种方法有利于表面科学研究，因为它可以在洁净的UHV环境中精确控制沉积过程。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源调节、保持超高真空、控制基底温度，以及仔细管理沉积参数以获得所需的覆盖层结构和成分。
