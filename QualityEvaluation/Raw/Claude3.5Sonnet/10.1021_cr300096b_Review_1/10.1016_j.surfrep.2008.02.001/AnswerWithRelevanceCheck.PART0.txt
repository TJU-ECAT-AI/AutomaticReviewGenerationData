          [1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[4] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."

[5] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[6] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

          Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a 0.5 mm tungsten wire wrapped with a 0.1 mm wire of the metal to be deposited. This source is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening (about 1 cm) to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Rate of metal vapor flux
2. Time of deposition
3. Substrate temperature
4. Deposition environment (UHV pressure)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. The metal source is gradually heated and conditioned for several hours before deposition, often at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for deposition.
2. The UHV system pressure is maintained at 5×10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation.
3. The substrate crystal is typically kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption, such as CO.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process in a clean, well-defined UHV environment. Key considerations for optimal results include:
1. Proper conditioning of the metal source
2. Maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions
3. Controlling substrate temperature
4. Optimizing deposition rate and time
5. Ensuring line-of-sight deposition geometry

By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can create well-defined bimetallic surfaces for detailed surface science investigations.

          物理气相沉积(PVD)，特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面用于表面科学研究的广泛使用的技术。实验装置通常包括一个金属源，由0.5毫米的钨丝包裹着0.1毫米的待沉积金属丝组成。这个源被置于一个不锈钢圆筒内，圆筒前面有一个小开口（约1厘米），用于将金属沉积物引导到基底上。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 金属蒸气通量率
2. 沉积时间
3. 基底温度
4. 沉积环境（UHV压力）

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 金属源在沉积前逐渐加热并调节数小时，通常使用比沉积时稍高的电流或电压。
2. UHV系统在蒸发过程中的压力保持在5×10^-10 Torr或更低。
3. 基底晶体通常保持在600 K，以最大程度地减少杂质如CO的吸附。

这种方法通过在洁净、明确定义的UHV环境中精确控制沉积过程，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括：
1. 适当调节金属源
2. 维持超高真空条件
3. 控制基底温度
4. 优化沉积速率和时间
5. 确保直线视线沉积几何

通过仔细控制这些参数，研究人员可以创建明确定义的双金属表面，用于详细的表面科学研究。
