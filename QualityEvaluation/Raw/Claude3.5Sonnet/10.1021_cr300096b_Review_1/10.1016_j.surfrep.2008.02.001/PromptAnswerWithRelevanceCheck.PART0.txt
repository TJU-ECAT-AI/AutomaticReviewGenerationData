[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[3] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."

[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[5] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×10−10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a 0.5 mm tungsten wire wrapped with a 0.1 mm wire of the desired metal. This source is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters include:

1. Evaporation temperature: The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and held there for a specific time.
2. Conditioning: The source is often conditioned for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for deposition to ensure reproducibility and purity.
3. UHV pressure: The system pressure should be 5×10−10 Torr or lower during evaporation.
4. Substrate temperature: Often maintained at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken:
1. Using UHV conditions to minimize background impurities.
2. Proper conditioning of the metal source.
3. Maintaining elevated substrate temperatures to prevent impurity adsorption.
4. Using a shielded evaporation source to prevent unwanted metal deposition on UHV system components.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process in a clean, well-defined UHV environment. Key considerations for optimal results include careful control of evaporation temperature, thorough source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum, and proper substrate preparation and temperature control.

关键工艺参数包括：

1. 蒸发温度：金属源逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间。
2. 调节：源常常在比沉积时稍高的电流或电压下调节多个小时，以确保重现性和纯度。
3. UHV压力：蒸发过程中系统压力应为5×10−10 Torr或更低。
4. 基底温度：通常保持在600 K，以最大程度地减少杂质吸附。

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层，采取了以下措施：
1. 使用UHV条件以最小化背景杂质。
2. 对金属源进行适当的调节。

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a key technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a 0.5 mm tungsten wire wrapped with a 0.1 mm wire of the metal to be deposited. This source is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated.

Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and held there to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. This conditioning process often takes many hours.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the UHV system pressure should be maintained at 5×10-10 Torr or lower during evaporation. The substrate crystal is typically kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption, such as CO.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process in a clean, UHV environment. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum, controlling substrate temperature, and carefully managing deposition parameters such as flux rate and time. The line-of-sight nature of PVD allows for targeted deposition onto the substrate, making it ideal for creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces for detailed study.
