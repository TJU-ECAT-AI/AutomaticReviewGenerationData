[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[5] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a key technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a 0.5 mm tungsten wire wrapped with a 0.1 mm wire of the metal to be deposited. This source is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated.

Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and held there to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. This conditioning process often takes many hours.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the UHV system pressure should be maintained at 5×10-10 Torr or lower during evaporation. The substrate crystal is typically kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption, such as CO.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process in a clean, UHV environment. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum, controlling substrate temperature, and carefully managing deposition parameters such as flux rate and time. The line-of-sight nature of PVD allows for targeted deposition onto the substrate, making it ideal for creating well-defined bimetallic surfaces for detailed study.

物理气相沉积(PVD)，特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面用于表面科学研究的关键技术。实验装置通常由金属源组成，金属源由0.5毫米的钨丝包裹着0.1毫米的待沉积金属丝。这个源通过UHV馈通连接到电源，可以通过电阻加热。

关键的工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境。金属源逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持在该温度，以实现可重复的、无杂质的沉积。这个调节过程通常需要几个小时。

为确保高纯度的金属覆盖层，UHV系统在蒸发过程中的压力应保持在5×10-10 Torr或更低。基底晶体通常保持在600 K，以最大程度地减少杂质如CO的吸附。

这种方法通过在洁净的UHV环境中精确控制沉积过程，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源调节、维持超高真空、控制基底温度，以及仔细管理沉积参数如通量率和时间。PVD的直线视线性质允许对基底进行定向沉积，使其成为创建明确定义的双金属表面进行详细研究的理想选择。
