[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[4] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."

[5] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[6] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×10−10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically consists of a tungsten (W) wire wrapped with the metal of interest, housed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Metal vapor flux rate
2. Deposition time
3. Substrate temperature
4. Deposition environment (vacuum or background gases)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. Use ultra-pure metal wire
2. Maintain UHV pressure at 5×10−10 Torr or lower during evaporation
3. Condition the metal source for several hours before deposition
4. Keep the substrate temperature at around 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption

This method facilitates surface science studies by providing a clean, controlled environment for depositing metal overlayers. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining UHV conditions, and carefully controlling deposition parameters to achieve the desired overlayer thickness and structure.

物理气相沉积(PVD)，特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面的广泛使用的技术。实验装置通常由包裹着目标金属的钨(W)丝组成，装在一个带有开口的不锈钢圆筒中，用于将金属沉积物定向到基底上。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 金属蒸汽通量率
2. 沉积时间
3. 基底温度
4. 沉积环境（真空或背景气体）

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 使用超纯金属丝
2. 在蒸发过程中将UHV压力保持在5×10−10 Torr或更低
3. 在沉积前对金属源进行数小时的预处理
4. 将基底温度保持在约600 K，以最大程度地减少杂质吸附

这种方法通过提供一个清洁、可控的环境来沉积金属覆盖层，从而促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源预处理、维持UHV条件，以及仔细控制沉积参数以达到所需的覆盖层厚度和结构。
