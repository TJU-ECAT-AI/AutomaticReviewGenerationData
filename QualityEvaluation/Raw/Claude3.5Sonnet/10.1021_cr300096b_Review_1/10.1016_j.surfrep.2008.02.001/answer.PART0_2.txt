[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."

[4] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."

[5] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."

[6] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface. In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a tungsten wire wrapped with the metal of interest, housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal vapor onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Rate of metal vapor flux
2. Deposition time
3. Substrate temperature
4. UHV environment (pressure below 5×10^-10 Torr)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. The metal source is gradually heated and conditioned for several hours before deposition
2. The UHV pressure is maintained at extremely low levels
3. The substrate is often kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process and maintaining a clean environment. Key considerations for optimal results include:
1. Proper conditioning of the metal source
2. Maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions
3. Controlling substrate temperature
4. Optimizing deposition rate and time
5. Ensuring line-of-sight deposition geometry

By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can create well-defined bimetallic surfaces for detailed surface science investigations.
