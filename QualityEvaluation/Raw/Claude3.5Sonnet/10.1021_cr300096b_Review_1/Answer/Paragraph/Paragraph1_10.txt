Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, particularly thermal evaporation, are essential for creating high-purity bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science applications. The experimental setup typically involves a UHV chamber equipped with multiple evaporation sources, substrate holders, and in-situ characterization tools. Thermal evaporation utilizes resistive heating or electron beam bombardment to vaporize the source materials, which then condense on the substrate to form thin films. Critical process parameters include evaporation rates, substrate temperature, and base pressure, all of which significantly influence the film's structure and composition. Quality control measures are crucial to ensure the desired surface properties and often involve a combination of in-situ techniques such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for thickness monitoring, reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) for surface crystallography assessment, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for compositional analysis. Post-deposition characterization may include atomic force microscopy (AFM) for surface morphology evaluation and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for atomic-scale imaging. By carefully controlling these aspects, researchers can produce well-defined bimetallic surfaces suitable for fundamental studies in catalysis, electrochemistry, and materials science.
