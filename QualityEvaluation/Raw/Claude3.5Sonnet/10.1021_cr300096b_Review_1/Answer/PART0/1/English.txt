Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly effective technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, making it ideal for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire (0.2-0.5 mm) wrapped with the metal of interest (0.05-0.1 mm wire). This source is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough for resistive heating and is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment (vacuum or selected background gases). The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and maintained for a specific duration to ensure reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer.

To achieve high-purity metal overlayers and optimal results, several key considerations and measures are taken:

1. Use of high-melting-point W or Ta filaments to prevent contamination during deposition.
2. Housing the evaporation filament in a stainless steel cylinder to prevent unwanted metal deposition on other UHV system components.
3. Proper conditioning of the metal source, which can take many hours, often at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for actual deposition.
4. Maintaining an extremely low pressure in the UHV system (5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower) during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities.
5. Careful control of deposition parameters to achieve the desired overlayer structure and composition.

This method facilitates surface science studies by providing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. The line-of-sight deposition allows for the production of metal overlayers on target substrates with high precision and purity, enabling detailed investigations of surface structures and properties in a controlled UHV environment.

The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a 0.5 mm tungsten wire wrapped with a 0.1 mm wire of the metal to be deposited. This source is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening (about 1 cm) to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Rate of metal vapor flux
2. Time of deposition
3. Substrate temperature
4. Deposition environment (UHV pressure)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. The metal source is gradually heated and conditioned for several hours before deposition, often at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for deposition.
2. The UHV system pressure is maintained at 5×10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation.
3. The substrate crystal is typically kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption, such as CO.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Substrate temperature (300 K for surface deposition, 600 K for subsurface diffusion)
2. Deposition rate (0.2-0.3 ML/min)
3. Coverage (approximately one monolayer)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:

The experimental setup typically consists of a resistively heated metal source (e.g., nickel wires wrapped around a tungsten wire) placed in a UHV chamber. 

Critical process parameters include:

2. Control of substrate temperature during and after deposition to influence surface structure and composition.
3. Maintaining excellent vacuum conditions throughout the process.
4. Proper design of source assemblies to minimize contamination and ensure uniform deposition.
