[1] "Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%)."

[2] "In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly."

[3] "After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 1010 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time."

[4] "Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) via thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically consists of a resistively heated wire (often tungsten) wrapped with the metal to be deposited (in this case, nickel wires). This assembly is usually enclosed in a water-cooled jacket with an adjustable shutter to control deposition.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Source temperature (controlled by current through the wire)
2. Deposition time (to control film thickness)
3. Chamber pressure (maintained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr)

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. Use high-purity source materials (99.95% or better)
2. Thoroughly outgas the source before deposition
3. Maintain UHV conditions throughout the process

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over film thickness and composition. It enables the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces for investigating phenomena like surface alloying, electronic modifications, and catalytic properties.

Key considerations for optimal results include:
1. Proper source outgassing to minimize contaminants
2. Stable deposition rates through precise current control
3. Uniform deposition across the substrate
4. Accurate thickness monitoring (e.g., using quartz crystal microbalance)
5. Substrate temperature control (for room temperature or elevated temperature depositions)
6. Post-deposition characterization using surface-sensitive techniques like AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM to verify film properties and composition

物理气相沉积(PVD)通过热蒸发是在超高真空(UHV)环境中制备双金属表面的广泛使用的技术。实验装置通常由电阻加热的金属丝(通常是钨丝)包裹待沉积金属(本例中为镍丝)组成。这个组件通常封闭在一个带有可调节挡板的水冷套筒中以控制沉积。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 源温度(通过金属丝电流控制)
2. 沉积时间(控制薄膜厚度)
3. 腔室压力(保持在7 × 10^-10 Torr以下)

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 使用高纯度源材料(99.95%或更高)
2. 在沉积前彻底排气源
3. 在整个过程中保持UHV条件

该方法通过允许精确控制薄膜厚度和成分来促进表面科学研究。它能够创建明确定义的双金属表面，用于研究表面合金、电子修饰和催化性质等现象。

获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括：
1. 适当的源排气以最小化污染物
2. 通过精确的电流控制实现稳定的沉积速率
3. 基底上的均匀沉积
4. 精确的厚度监测(例如使用石英晶体微天平)
5. 基底温度控制(用于室温或升高温度沉积)
6. 使用AES、XPS、LEIS和STM等表面敏感技术进行沉积后表征，以验证薄膜性质和成分
