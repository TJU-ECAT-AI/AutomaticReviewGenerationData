[1] "Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%)."

[2] "In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly."

[3] "After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10−10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time."

[4] "Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) via thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically consists of a high-purity metal source (in this case, Ni wires) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. This assembly is enclosed in a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter to control deposition.

Critical process parameters include:
1. Source temperature: Controlled by the current through the tungsten wire
2. Deposition time: Used to control the amount of metal deposited
3. Chamber pressure: Maintained below 7 × 10−10 Torr during evaporation

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. Use high-purity metal sources (99.95% or higher)
2. Thoroughly outgas the source before deposition
3. Maintain UHV conditions throughout the process

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the amount and composition of deposited metal. It enables the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces for investigating their properties and reactivity.

Key considerations for optimal results include:
1. Proper source outgassing to minimize contaminants
2. Precise control of deposition parameters (time, temperature)
3. Use of multiple characterization techniques (AES, XPS, LEIS, STM) to accurately determine surface composition and structure
4. Maintaining UHV conditions to prevent surface contamination

By carefully controlling these factors, researchers can create high-quality bimetallic surfaces for detailed surface science investigations.

物理气相沉积（PVD）通过热蒸发是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的广泛使用的技术。实验装置通常由高纯度金属源（在本例中为镍丝）缠绕在电阻加热的钨丝上组成。这个组件被封装在一个带有可调节挡板的水冷不锈钢夹套中，以控制沉积。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 源温度：由通过钨丝的电流控制
2. 沉积时间：用于控制沉积的金属量
3. 腔室压力：在蒸发过程中保持在7 × 10−10 Torr以下

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 使用高纯度金属源（99.95%或更高）
2. 在沉积前彻底排气源
3. 在整个过程中保持UHV条件

这种方法通过允许精确控制沉积金属的数量和成分，促进了表面科学研究。它能够创建明确定义的双金属表面，用于研究其性质和反应性。

获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括：
1. 适当的源排气以最小化污染物
2. 精确控制沉积参数（时间、温度）
3. 使用多种表征技术（AES、XPS、LEIS、STM）准确确定表面成分和结构
4. 维持UHV条件以防止表面污染

通过仔细控制这些因素，研究人员可以创建高质量的双金属表面，用于详细的表面科学研究。
