[1] "Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%)."

[2] "In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly."

[3] "After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10−10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time."

[4] "Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) via thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of:

1. A source material (in this case, high-purity Ni wires) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire.

2. A water-cooled stainless steel jacket or shield surrounding the evaporation source to prevent unwanted heating of the chamber.

3. An adjustable shutter to control deposition time.

4. The substrate (here, a Pt(111) single crystal) onto which the metal is deposited.

Critical process parameters include:

1. Source temperature (controlled by the current through the tungsten wire)
2. Deposition time
3. Chamber pressure
4. Substrate temperature

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:

1. Use high-purity source materials (99.95% or higher)
2. Maintain UHV conditions (below 7 × 10−10 Torr during evaporation)
3. Thoroughly outgas the source before deposition
4. Use water cooling to prevent contamination from chamber walls

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the amount and composition of deposited material. Key considerations for optimal results include:

1. Careful calibration of deposition rates
2. Monitoring and control of substrate temperature
3. Use of multiple characterization techniques (AES, XPS, LEIS, STM) to verify surface composition and structure
4. Proper substrate preparation and cleaning before deposition

By controlling these parameters, researchers can create well-defined bimetallic surfaces for studying fundamental surface phenomena and catalytic properties.

物理气相沉积（PVD）通过热蒸发是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面用于表面科学研究的广泛使用技术。实验设置通常包括：

1. 源材料（在本例中为高纯度镍丝）缠绕在电阻加热的钨丝上。

2. 水冷不锈钢夹套或屏蔽罩包围蒸发源，以防止腔体不必要的加热。

3. 可调节的快门控制沉积时间。

4. 基底（这里是Pt(111)单晶）用于金属沉积。

关键工艺参数包括：

1. 源温度（通过钨丝的电流控制）
2. 沉积时间
3. 腔体压力
4. 基底温度

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：

1. 使用高纯度源材料（99.95%或更高）
2. 维持UHV条件（蒸发过程中低于7 × 10−10 Torr）
3. 在沉积前彻底排气源
4. 使用水冷却以防止腔壁污染

该方法通过允许精确控制沉积材料的数量和成分，有助于表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 仔细校准沉积速率
2. 监测和控制基底温度
3. 使用多种表征技术（AES、XPS、LEIS、STM）验证表面成分和结构
4. 沉积前proper准备和清洁基底

通过控制这些参数，研究人员可以创建明确定义的双金属表面，用于研究基本表面现象和催化性质。
