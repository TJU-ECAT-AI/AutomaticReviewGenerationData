[1] "Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%)."

[2] "In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly."

[3] "After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 1010 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time."

[4] "Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) via thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a resistively heated metal source (in this case, nickel wires wrapped around a tungsten wire) placed in a UHV chamber. 

Critical process parameters include:
1. Source temperature: Controlled by applying a constant current to achieve consistent evaporation rates.
2. Deposition time: Used to control the amount of metal deposited.
3. Chamber pressure: Maintained at UHV levels (below 7 × 10^-10 Torr) during deposition.
4. Substrate temperature: Can be controlled to influence growth modes and surface morphology.

To ensure high-purity metal overlayers:
1. High-purity source materials are used (99.95% purity in this case).
2. The source is thoroughly outgassed before deposition.
3. Water-cooling of the source assembly and surrounding shields helps minimize contamination.
4. An adjustable shutter allows precise control of deposition timing.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces with controlled compositions and structures. Key considerations for optimal results include:
1. Careful calibration of deposition rates and amounts using surface analysis techniques (AES, XPS, LEIS, STM).
2. Control of substrate temperature during and after deposition to influence surface structure and composition.
3. Maintaining excellent vacuum conditions throughout the process.
4. Proper design of source assemblies to minimize contamination and ensure uniform deposition.

By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can create reproducible bimetallic surfaces for studying fundamental surface processes and developing novel catalytic materials.

物理气相沉积(PVD)通过热蒸发是在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面用于表面科学研究的广泛使用技术。实验装置通常由放置在UHV腔室中的电阻加热金属源(在本例中为缠绕在钨丝上的镍丝)组成。

关键工艺参数包括：
1. 源温度：通过施加恒定电流来控制，以获得稳定的蒸发速率。
2. 沉积时间：用于控制沉积的金属量。
3. 腔室压力：在沉积过程中保持在UHV水平(低于7×10^-10 Torr)。
4. 基底温度：可以控制以影响生长模式和表面形貌。

为确保高纯度金属覆盖层：
1. 使用高纯度源材料(本例中为99.95%纯度)。
2. 在沉积前彻底排气源。
3. 源组件和周围屏蔽的水冷有助于最小化污染。
4. 可调节的快门允许精确控制沉积时间。

该方法通过允许创建具有受控成分和结构的明确定义的双金属表面来促进表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括：
1. 使用表面分析技术(AES、XPS、LEIS、STM)仔细校准沉积速率和数量。
2. 控制沉积期间和之后的基底温度以影响表面结构和成分。
3. 在整个过程中保持优良的真空条件。
4. 适当设计源组件以最小化污染并确保均匀沉积。

通过仔细控制这些参数，研究人员可以创建可重复的双金属表面，用于研究基本表面过程和开发新型催化材料。
