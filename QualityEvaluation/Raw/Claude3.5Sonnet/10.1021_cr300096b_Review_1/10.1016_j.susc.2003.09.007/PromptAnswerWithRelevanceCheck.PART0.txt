Physical vapor deposition (PVD) via thermal evaporation is a widely used technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a resistively heated source material (in this case, nickel wires wrapped around a tungsten wire) placed in a UHV chamber. 

Critical process parameters include:

1. Source temperature: Controlled by the current applied to the tungsten wire.
2. Deposition time: Used to control the amount of material deposited.
3. Chamber pressure: Maintained at UHV levels to ensure high purity of the deposited layer.

To ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken:

1. High-purity source materials (99.95% pure Ni and W wires).
2. Water-cooling of the source assembly to prevent unwanted heating of surrounding components.
3. Use of stainless steel shields or jackets around the source to contain the vapor.
4. Thorough outgassing of the source before deposition to remove contaminants.
5. Maintaining UHV conditions (below 7 × 10−10 Torr) during evaporation.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the composition and thickness of deposited metal layers. The UHV environment ensures minimal contamination, which is crucial for studying intrinsic surface properties.

Key considerations for optimal results include:

1. Careful calibration of deposition rates.
2. Monitoring and control of substrate temperature during deposition.
3. Proper alignment of the source and substrate to ensure uniform coverage.
4. Regular maintenance and cleaning of the deposition system to prevent cross-contamination between experiments.

By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers can create well-defined bimetallic surfaces for detailed surface science investigations.
