CHILD WELFARE: PRINCIPLES AND METHODS. 
By Dorothy Zietz, M.S.W., Ph.D. 
New 
York: John Wiley 8c Sons, Inc., 1959. 
384 pp. $5.50. 
This volume is addressed to the college 
classroom. 
The author states that while 
the material presented is from the social 
welfare, social action, and planning point 
of view, it shows as well the interrelation-
ship of social work with other professions 
such as medicine, nursing, education, psy-
chiatry, psychology, and law. The book is 
designed, therefore, to be useful not only 
in teaching undergraduates who will enter 
training for social work, but also those who 
may choose other fields serving people. 
The text is divided into five sections. 
Part One deals with the social heritage of 
America. 
The place of the church, the 
government, and private philanthropy in 
meeting the needs of people is described in 
relation to changing social conditions. 
Part 
Two discusses significant events in the 
nineteenth century, Part Three is entitled 
"The Child in the Twentieth Century," 
and Parts Four and Five are concerned 
respectively with children in need of special 
protection and those with special needs. 
The rapid development of social conscious-
ness from 1850 to the present is spelled out 
descriptively, social movements and social 
institutions are identified, and attention is 
given to the evolution of social work as a 
profession with the need for special training 
being recognized in the early 1900's. Par-
ticular attention is given to social move-

ments and legislation in America during the 
present century. The chapters on protec-
tion of children and on those with special 
needs are informational but greatly over-
simplified. 
This text is basically informational. Its 
title, therefore, is somewhat misleading be-
cause principles and methods in child wel-
fare receive little attention as such. Rather, 
emphasis is upon broad social reform set in 
historical perspective. 
The author has 
nevertheless done a creditable job in pre-
senting in simple straightforward language 
events covering large segments of time. It 
is evident, both from the content and from 
the references, that Dr. Zietz has digested 
a great deal of source material in prepara-
tion for the writing of this book. 
On the whole the author accomplishes 
her purpose as set forth in the preface. 
However, while abiding faithfully by the 
history of social movements and action, she 
has offered very little evaluation of signifi-
cant social developments. To the reviewer 
this omission may result in loss of reader 
interest, particularly when the audience is 
an undergraduate one. As a factual outline 
the text may be a valuable source of help 
to teachers of undergraduate students.

step in the NASW certification program-
offers few hazards as long as the base of 
social work is carefully and proudly pro-
tected. Toward this end, it is worth noting 
that the long-term aim of NASW with re-
gard to legal regulation on a state basis is 
the definition of the practice of social work 
and its restriction to social workers, not the 
protection of titles such as Certified Social 
Worker and Registered Social Worker.
