[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."

[2] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."

[4] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."

[5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."

[6] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."

[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly effective technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This method is well-suited for surface science studies due to its compatibility with UHV conditions.

The experimental setup for thermal evaporation typically consists of a metal source made of a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire wrapped with the metal of interest. This wire is connected to a power supply for resistive heating and is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and maintained for a specific duration to ensure reproducible deposition of a pure metal overlayer.

To ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken:

1. Using high-melting-point W or Ta filaments to prevent contamination.
2. Housing the evaporation filament in a cylinder to prevent unwanted metal deposition on other UHV components.
3. Conditioning the source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for deposition.
4. Maintaining an extremely low pressure (5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower) in the UHV system during evaporation.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include careful selection of deposition parameters, thorough conditioning of the metal source, and maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions throughout the process.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的高效方法。由于其与UHV条件的兼容性，该方法非常适合表面科学研究。

热蒸发的实验装置通常包括一个金属源，由一根薄的钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝包裹着所需的金属线组成。这根线通过电阻加热连接到电源，并被置于一个带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以引导金属沉积到基底上。

PVD合成的关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境。金属源被逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间，以确保可重复沉积纯金属覆盖层。

为确保沉积高纯度金属覆盖层，采取了以下几项措施：

1. 使用高熔点的W或Ta丝以防止污染。
2. 将蒸发丝置于圆筒中，防止金属沉积到UHV系统的其他部件上。
3. 在略高于沉积使用的电流或电压下对源进行多小时的调节。
4. 在蒸发过程中保持UHV系统中的极低压力（5 × 10^-10 Torr或更低）。

这种方法通过允许精确控制沉积过程并确保创建明确定义的双金属表面，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括仔细选择沉积参数、彻底调节金属源，以及在整个过程中保持超高真空条件。
