[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."

[2] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."

[4] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."

[5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."

[6] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."

[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly effective technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, making it ideal for surface science studies. The experimental setup typically consists of a metal source made of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with the metal of interest. This source is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and maintained for a specific duration to ensure reproducible deposition of a pure metal overlayer.

To achieve high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken. The use of high-melting-point tungsten or tantalum filaments prevents contamination from the wire itself. The metal source undergoes a conditioning process lasting many hours, often at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for actual deposition. Additionally, the UHV system pressure is maintained at 5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent impurity accumulation.

This method facilitates surface science studies by providing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions, and carefully controlling the deposition parameters to achieve the desired overlayer structure and composition.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的高效方法，非常适合表面科学研究。实验装置通常由金属源组成，该金属源由包裹着目标金属的薄钨丝或钽丝制成。这个源被置于一个不锈钢圆筒内，圆筒前面有一个小开口，用于引导金属沉积到基底上。

PVD合成的关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境。金属源被逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间，以确保可重复沉积纯金属覆盖层。

为了获得高纯度的金属覆盖层，采取了几项措施。使用高熔点的钨丝或钽丝可防止丝本身的污染。金属源经过长达数小时的调节过程，通常使用略高于实际沉积时的电流或电压。此外，蒸发过程中UHV系统压力保持在5 × 10^-10 Torr或更低，以防止杂质积累。

这种方法通过对沉积过程的精确控制和确保创建well-defined的双金属表面，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源调节、维持超高真空条件，以及仔细控制沉积参数以获得所需的覆盖层结构和成分。
