[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."

[2] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."

[4] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."

[5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."

[6] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."

[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly suitable technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The method employs line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on a target substrate.

The experimental setup for thermal evaporation typically consists of a metal source made of a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire (0.2-0.5 mm) wrapped with a wire of the metal to be deposited (0.05-0.1 mm). This source is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough for resistive heating. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment (vacuum or selected background gases). To ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken:

1. Using high-melting-point W or Ta filaments to prevent contamination from the source material.
2. Gradual heating of the metal source to evaporation temperature and maintaining it for a specific time to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition.
3. Conditioning the source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for actual deposition.
4. Maintaining UHV system pressure at 5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent background impurity accumulation.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of well-defined, high-purity bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source preparation, careful control of deposition parameters, and maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions throughout the process.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的高度适用技术，适用于表面科学研究。该方法采用直线视线沉积在目标基底上产生金属覆盖层。

热蒸发的实验装置通常包括一个金属源，由薄的钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝（0.2-0.5毫米）包裹着待沉积金属的细丝（0.05-0.1毫米）组成。该源通过UHV馈通连接到电源，用于电阻加热。蒸发丝通常被置于不锈钢圆筒内，圆筒前面有一个小开口，用于引导金属沉积到基底上，并防止金属蒸发到UHV系统的其他组件上。

PVD合成的关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境（真空或选定的背景气体）。为确保沉积高纯度金属覆盖层，采取了以下几项措施：

1. 使用高熔点的W或Ta丝，防止源材料污染。
2. 将金属源逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间，以实现可重复的、无杂质的沉积。
3. 在略高于实际沉积使用的电流或电压下对源进行多小时的调节。
4. 在蒸发过程中将UHV系统压力保持在5 × 10^-10 Torr或更低，以防止背景杂质积累。

这种方法通过允许精确控制沉积过程并确保创建明确定义的高纯度双金属表面，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源准备、沉积参数的仔细控制以及在整个过程中保持超高真空条件。
