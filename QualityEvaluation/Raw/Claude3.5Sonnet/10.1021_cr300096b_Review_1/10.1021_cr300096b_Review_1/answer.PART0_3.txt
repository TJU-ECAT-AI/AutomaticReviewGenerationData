[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."

[2] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."

[4] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."

[5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."

[6] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."

[7] "Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."

[8] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly effective technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This method is well-suited for surface science studies due to its compatibility with UHV conditions.

The experimental setup for thermal evaporation typically includes a metal source consisting of a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire wrapped with the metal of interest. This wire is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough for resistive heating. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and maintained for a specific duration to ensure reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer.

To achieve high-purity metal overlayers, several measures are taken:

1. Using W or Ta filaments with extremely high melting temperatures to prevent contamination.
2. Housing the evaporation filament in a stainless steel cylinder to prevent unintended metal deposition on other UHV system components.
3. Conditioning the source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for deposition.
4. Maintaining a UHV system pressure of 5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent background impurity accumulation.

This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include proper source conditioning, maintaining ultra-high vacuum conditions, and carefully controlling the deposition parameters to achieve the desired surface structure and composition.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的高效方法。由于其与UHV条件的兼容性，该方法非常适合表面科学研究。

热蒸发的实验装置通常包括一个金属源，由薄的钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝包裹着待沉积的金属线。这根线通过UHV馈通连接到电源，用于电阻加热。蒸发丝管置于不锈钢圆筒内，圆筒前面有一个小开口，用于引导金属沉积到基底上。

PVD合成的关键工艺参数包括金属蒸汽通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境。金属源被逐渐加热到蒸发温度并保持特定时间，以确保可重复沉积无杂质的金属覆盖层。

为了获得高纯度的金属覆盖层，采取了以下几项措施：

1. 使用具有极高熔点的W或Ta丝，防止污染。
2. 将蒸发丝管置于不锈钢圆筒内，防止金属意外沉积到UHV系统的其他部件上。
3. 在略高于沉积时使用的电流或电压下对源进行数小时的调节。
4. 在蒸发过程中保持UHV系统压力为5×10^-10 Torr或更低，以防止背景杂质积累。

这种方法通过允许精确控制沉积过程并确保创建明确定义的双金属表面，促进了表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括适当的源调节、保持超高真空条件，以及仔细控制沉积参数以实现所需的表面结构和成分。
