[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."

[2] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."

[3] "Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."

[4] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."

[5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."

[6] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."

[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a highly effective technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. The method involves line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on a target substrate.

The experimental setup for thermal evaporation typically consists of a metal source made of a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire wrapped with the metal of interest. This wire is connected to a power supply through a UHV feedthrough for resistive heating. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate.

Critical process parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is gradually heated to the evaporation temperature and maintained for a specific duration to ensure reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer.

To achieve optimal results and ensure high-purity metal overlayers, several key considerations must be addressed:

1. Use of high-melting-point W or Ta filaments to prevent contamination during deposition.
2. Proper conditioning of the metal source, which can take many hours, often at a slightly higher current or voltage than used for actual deposition.
3. Maintaining an extremely low pressure in the UHV system (5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower) during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities.
4. Housing the evaporation filament in a stainless steel cylinder to prevent unwanted metal deposition on other UHV system components.

By carefully controlling these factors, researchers can create high-quality bimetallic surfaces for detailed surface science studies, enabling the investigation of various surface structures and properties in a controlled UHV environment.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发技术，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面用于表面科学研究的高效方法。该方法涉及直线视线沉积，在目标基底上产生金属覆盖层。

热蒸发的实验装置通常包括一个金属源，由薄的钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝包裹着目标金属wire制成。这根丝通过UHV导线连接到电源，用于电阻加热。蒸发丝管housed在一个不锈钢圆筒内，圆筒前面有一个小开口，用于引导金属沉积到基底上。

PVD合成的关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境。金属源逐渐加热到蒸发温度并维持特定时间，以确保可重复沉积无杂质的金属覆盖层。

为了获得最佳结果并确保高纯度金属覆盖层，必须考虑以下几个关键因素：

1. 使用高熔点的W或Ta丝，以防止沉积过程中的污染。
2. 适当调节金属源，这可能需要多个小时，通常使用比实际沉积略高的电流或电压。
3. 在蒸发过程中保持UHV系统中极低的压力（5 × 10^-10 Torr或更低），以防止背景杂质的累积。
4. 将蒸发丝管housed在不锈钢圆筒中，以防止不需要的金属沉积到UHV系统的其他组件上。

通过仔细控制这些因素，研究人员可以创建高质量的双金属表面用于详细的表面科学研究，从而在受控的UHV环境中研究各种表面结构和性质。
