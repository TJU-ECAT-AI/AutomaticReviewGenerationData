Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Include details on the experimental setup, critical process parameters, and specific measures to ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers. How does this method facilitate surface science studies, and what are the key considerations for achieving optimal results?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically about physical vapor deposition (PVD) or thermal evaporation techniques for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The document appears to focus on catalysis by alloys and bimetallic clusters, but does not discuss details of PVD methods or experimental setups. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive overview of the PVD technique or answer the specific questions about experimental setup, process parameters, and measures for high-purity metal overlayer deposition based solely on the given text.

所提供的文献中并不包含关于在超高真空(UHV)环境中使用物理气相沉积(PVD)或热蒸发技术创建双金属表面的具体信息。该文档似乎主要关注合金和双金属簇的催化作用,但并未讨论PVD方法或实验设置的细节。因此,仅基于给定的文本,我无法提供关于PVD技术的全面概述,也无法回答有关实验设置、工艺参数以及高纯度金属覆盖层沉积措施的具体问题。
