I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

About this book
The success of the first edition of this broad appeal book prompted the prepa ration of an updated and expanded second edition. The field of surface anal ysis is constantly changing as it answers the need to provide more specific and more detailed information about surface composition and structure in advanced materials science applications. The content of the second edition meets that need by including new techniques and expanded applications. Newcastle John O'Connor Clayton Brett Sexton Adelaide Roger Smart January 2003 Preface to the First Edition The idea for this book stemmed from a remark by Philip Jennings of Mur doch University in a discussion session following a regular meeting of the Australian Surface Science group. He observed that a text on surface anal ysis and applications to materials suitable for final year undergraduate and postgraduate science students was not currently available. Furthermore, the members of the Australian Surface Science group had the research experi ence and range of coverage of surface analytical techniques and applications to provide a text for this purpose. A list of techniques and applications to be included was agreed at that meeting. The intended readership of the book has been broadened since the early discussions, particularly to encompass industrial users, but there has been no significant alteration in content.

Reviews
  I teach graduate courses on Surface Analysis and on Surface Science (with a strong component of Surface Analysis). I was so impressed with the first edition of this book that I intended to adopt it for my class but, unfortunately, it was soon out-of-print. I encouraged John O'Connor to prepare another edition of this jewel that I could use in the future. What distinguishes this book from others is the very unusual breadth. It covers fundamentals, practical issues of analyses, and concrete applications to the analysis of metals, semiconductors, polymers, and ceramics (including minerals).
Quote from Prof. Raul Baragiola, University of Virginia
From the reviews of the second edition:
"More than 30 experts have contributed to this book providing a wealth of expertise based on theoretical as well as practical background.  the book can be recommended not only to university students but also to scientists and engineers working in industry. It will help to find the appropriate method, or better the combination of methods, which will be needed to solve problems in process control and failure analysis." (W. Oesterle, Werkstoffe und Korrosion/Materials and Corrosion, Vol. 55 (3), 2004)

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Include details on the experimental setup, critical process parameters, and specific measures to ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers. How does this method facilitate surface science studies, and what are the key considerations for achieving optimal results?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
