[1] "Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate9. For oxygen, which has a similar Pauling electronegativity as nitrogen (3.44 for oxygen and 3.04 for nitrogen), the surface configuration was shown to be more stable than the subsurface configuration through DFT and was confirmed experimentally."

[2] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure9,31,32."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that experimental techniques confirmed DFT predictions about the stability of surface vs subsurface configurations in the presence of oxygen.

The document states that exposure to oxygen caused subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low and atmospheric pressure conditions. This supports the idea that oxygen induces surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms.

The literature does not provide specific information about measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these systems, nor does it compare these to DFT predictions. More detailed experimental studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

文献中没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的详细信息。但是，它确实提到实验技术证实了DFT对存在氧时表面与亚表面构型稳定性的预测。

文档指出，在低压和大气压条件下，暴露于氧会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面构型（NiPtPt）。这支持了氧诱导亚表面Ni原子表面偏析的观点。

文献没有提供这些系统的具体偏析动力学或活化能垒的测量信息，也没有将这些与DFT预测进行比较。需要更详细的实验研究才能充分解答问题的这些方面。
