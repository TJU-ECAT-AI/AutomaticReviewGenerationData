The literature does not provide detailed information on how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that oxygen exposure causes subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low and atmospheric pressure conditions. This reconstruction was likely observed using surface characterization techniques like AES.

The document does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these systems, nor does it compare experimental results with DFT predictions. It only states that the relative thermodynamic stability of surface and subsurface structures depends on adsorbate coverage and electronegativity, and that a similar stability was predicted for nitrogen adsorbates as for oxygen.

To fully answer this question, more specific experimental details and computational results would be needed, which are not provided in the given literature.

该文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的详细信息。但是，它确实提到在低压和大气压条件下，氧暴露会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面构型(NiPtPt)。这种重构可能是通过AES等表面表征技术观察到的。

文档没有提供这些系统的测量偏析动力学或激活能垒的信息，也没有将实验结果与DFT预测进行比较。它只是指出表面和亚表面结构的相对热力学稳定性取决于吸附质覆盖度和电负性，并且预测氮吸附质的稳定性与氧类似。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更具体的实验细节和计算结果，而这些在给定的文献中并未提供。
