[1] "Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate"

[2] "For oxygen, which has a similar Pauling electronegativity as nitrogen (3.44 for oxygen and 3.04 for nitrogen), the surface configuration was shown to be more stable than the subsurface configuration through DFT and was confirmed experimentally."

[3] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure"

The literature does not provide detailed information on how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that experimental techniques confirmed DFT predictions about the relative stability of surface vs. subsurface configurations in the presence of oxygen adsorbates. 

The document states that exposure to oxygen caused subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low and atmospheric pressure conditions. This supports the idea that oxygen induces surface segregation of Ni in this bimetallic system.

The literature does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these systems, nor does it compare experimental measurements to DFT predictions for these specific parameters. More detailed experimental studies focused on segregation dynamics would be needed to fully address the question.

文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的详细信息。但是，它确实提到实验技术证实了DFT对存在氧吸附质时表面与亚表面构型相对稳定性的预测。

文档指出，在低压和大气压条件下，暴露于氧气会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面构型(NiPtPt)。这支持了氧气在该双金属系统中诱导Ni表面偏析的观点。

文献没有提供这些系统的偏析动力学或活化能障的测量信息，也没有将实验测量结果与这些特定参数的DFT预测进行比较。需要进行更详细的聚焦于偏析动力学的实验研究才能全面回答这个问题。
