The literature does not provide detailed information about how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it does mention that oxygen exposure causes subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low and atmospheric pressure conditions. The stability of surface vs subsurface structures is said to depend on adsorbate coverage and electronegativity. While the document doesn't discuss measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers, it notes that similar stability was predicted for NiPtPt surfaces with nitrogen adsorbates as with oxygen. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between experimental measurements and DFT predictions for these systems.

该文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的详细信息。然而，它确实提到氧暴露导致亚表面Ni在低压和大气压条件下重构为表面构型(NiPtPt)。文中提到表面与亚表面结构的相对热力学稳定性取决于吸附质覆盖度和鲍林电负性。虽然文档没有讨论测量的偏析动力学或激活能障，但它指出对于氮吸附质的NiPtPt表面预测有类似的稳定性。该文献没有直接比较这些系统的实验测量结果和DFT预测。
