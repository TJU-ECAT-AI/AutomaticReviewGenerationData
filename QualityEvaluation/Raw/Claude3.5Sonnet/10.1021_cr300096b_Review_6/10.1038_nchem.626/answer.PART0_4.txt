[1] "Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate"

[2] "For oxygen, which has a similar Pauling electronegativity as nitrogen (3.44 for oxygen and 3.04 for nitrogen), the surface configuration was shown to be more stable than the subsurface configuration through DFT and was confirmed experimentally."

[3] "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure"

The literature does not provide specific details about HREELS and AES techniques for verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. However, it does mention that experimental confirmation was obtained for the DFT-predicted stability of the surface configuration over the subsurface configuration in the presence of oxygen. The document states that exposure to oxygen caused subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low and atmospheric pressure conditions. 

The literature does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers, nor does it compare these with DFT predictions. The document only mentions that DFT calculations showed the surface configuration to be more stable than the subsurface configuration for oxygen adsorbates, which was then confirmed experimentally.

该文献没有提供关于使用HREELS和AES技术来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中氧诱导的Ni和Co表面偏析的具体细节。但是，它确实提到了实验证实了DFT预测的在氧存在下表面构型比亚表面构型更稳定。文档指出，在低压和大气压条件下，暴露于氧气中会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面构型(NiPtPt)。

文献没有提供关于测量的偏析动力学或激活能垒的信息，也没有将这些与DFT预测进行比较。文档仅提到DFT计算表明对于氧吸附剂，表面构型比亚表面构型更稳定，这随后得到了实验证实。
