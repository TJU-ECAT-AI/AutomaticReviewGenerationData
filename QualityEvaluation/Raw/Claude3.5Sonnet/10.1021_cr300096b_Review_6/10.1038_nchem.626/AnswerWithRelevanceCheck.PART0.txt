          "Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate"

          "For oxygen, which has a similar Pauling electronegativity as nitrogen (3.44 for oxygen and 3.04 for nitrogen), the surface configuration was shown to be more stable than the subsurface configuration through DFT and was confirmed experimentally."

          "Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure"

          "A similar stability was predicted for the NiPtPt surface with nitrogen adsorbates"

          The literature does not provide specific details about how HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it mentions that experimental techniques confirmed DFT predictions about the stability of surface vs subsurface configurations in the presence of oxygen.

          The document states that exposure to oxygen caused subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure conditions. This supports the idea that oxygen induces surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in this bimetallic system.

          The literature does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these systems, nor does it compare these to DFT predictions. It only mentions that DFT calculations showed the surface configuration to be more stable than the subsurface configuration for oxygen adsorbates, which was then confirmed experimentally.

          The relative thermodynamic stability of surface and subsurface structures is said to depend on adsorbate coverage and electronegativity. A similar stability was predicted for NiPtPt surfaces with nitrogen adsorbates as with oxygen.

          该文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子（特别是Ni和Co）表面偏析的详细信息。但是，它确实提到实验技术证实了DFT对存在氧时表面与亚表面构型稳定性的预测。

          文档指出，在低压（1 × 107 torr O2）和大气压条件下，暴露于氧会导致亚表面Ni重构为表面构型（NiPtPt）。这支持了氧在该双金属系统中诱导亚表面Ni原子表面偏析的观点。

          文献没有提供这些系统的偏析动力学或活化能障的测量信息，也没有将这些与DFT预测进行比较。它仅提到DFT计算表明对于氧吸附剂，表面构型比亚表面构型更稳定，这随后得到了实验证实。

          文中提到表面与亚表面结构的相对热力学稳定性取决于吸附质覆盖度和电负性。对于氮吸附质的NiPtPt表面预测有类似于氧的稳定性。
