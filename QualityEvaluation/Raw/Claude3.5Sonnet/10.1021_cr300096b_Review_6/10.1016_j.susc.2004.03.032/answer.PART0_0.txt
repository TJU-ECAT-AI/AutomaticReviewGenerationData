<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on cyclohexene reactions on Pt/Ni(111) surfaces and does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation or comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions for these particular systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有关于氧诱导的Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子(如Ni和Co)表面偏析的具体信息。该文档主要关注Pt/Ni(111)表面上环己烯的反应,并没有讨论氧诱导的偏析或这些特定系统的实验测量与DFT预测之间的比较。因此,基于给定文献中提供的信息无法回答这个问题。
