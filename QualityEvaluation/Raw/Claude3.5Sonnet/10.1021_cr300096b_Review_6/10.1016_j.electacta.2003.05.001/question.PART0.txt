I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
Nonlocal gradient corrected DFT slab calculations were carried out to determine the overall reaction energies along with the barriers for the activation of water and the oxidation of CO over well-defined Pt(111) and PtRu(111) surfaces. We attempt to elucidate the features that control the bifunctional mechanism proposed for the oxidation of CO in solution. The addition of Ru to Pt along with the presence of solution helps to enhance the elementary steps that comprise the bifunctional mechanism. The activation of water over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is energetically unfavorable with an activation barrier of +142 kJ/mol and overall heat of reaction of +53 kJ/mol. Water will desorb before it will react on Pt(111). The presence of solution reduces the barrier to about 75 kJ/mol. The addition of Ru lowers the barrier for water activation in the vapor phase. Alloying Pt with Ru lowers the barriers for the homolytic as well as the heterolytic activation of water in solution. The presence of solution, however markedly favors the heterolytic activation which leads to the formation of an adsorbed OH* surface intermediate, a proton which migrates into solution and an electron. The energetics for this path over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3%(111) surface were calculated to be quite favorable with an activation barrier of +27 kJ/mol and an overall energy of reaction of +26 kJ/mol. Ab initio molecular dynamics results indicate that water can be activated over PtRu at 300 K. The resulting surface Ru-OH group that forms induces the adsorption and subsequent activation of water at a neighboring Pt site. The surface hydroxyl intermediate continues to diffuse across the surface via a sequence of proton transfer steps. The barrier for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO by surface OH groups over Pt(111) in the vapor phase is 86 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of 21 kJ/mol. The barrier is reduced to 71 kJ/mol when carried out over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy in the vapor phase. The barrier for the homolytic disproportionation of CO and OH in solution (over Pt66.7%Ru33.3%) is 90 kJ/mol with an overall reaction energy of +24 kJ/mol. The heterolytic path which involves the oxidation of CO by OH to form CO2+H+(aq)+e is more favorable than the homolytic path. The activation barrier for the heterolytic path over Pt66.7%Ru33.3% is +60 kJ/mol with an overall reaction of 6 kJ/mol (exothermic). These results indicate that at potentials which are less than or equal to the potential of zero total charge, water activation over Pt(111) may be difficult. CO oxidation, however is more likely limiting over the Pt66.7%Ru33.3% alloy at these potentials. These results only hold for the ideal conditions studied herein including ideal single crystal surfaces, an ideal liquid water solution phase and the absence of an applied potential.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
