Abstract
In this study we have investigated the reaction pathways for the decomposition and hydrogenation of acrolein (CH2@CHCH@O)
on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolu-
tion electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). While gas-phase hydrogenation products are not observed from clean Pt(111), the
subsurface PtNiPt(111), with Ni residing below the first layer of Pt, is active for the self-hydrogenation of the C@O bond to produce
unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) and the C@C bond to produce saturated aldehyde (propanal), with the latter being the main hydro-
genation product without the consecutive hydrogenation to saturated alcohol. For a thick Ni(111) film prepared on Pt(111), the self-
hydrogenation yields for both products are lower than that from the PtNiPt(111) surface. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen
further enhances the selectivity toward C@O bond hydrogenation on the PtNiPt(111) surface. In addition, HREELS studies of the
adsorption of the two hydrogenation products, 2-propenol and propanal, are performed on the PtNiPt(111) surface to identify the
possible surface intermediates during the reaction of acrolein. The results presented here indicate that the hydrogenation activity and
selectivity of acrolein on Pt(111) can be significantly modified by the formation of the bimetallic surfaces.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are
not present on either of the parent metal surface [14]. Our
group has recently investigated the electronic and chemical
properties of model bimetallic surfaces, using a combina-
tion of experimental studies and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations to gain insights into the effects of bime-
tallic formation [58]. For example, we have utilized the
hydrogenation of cyclohexene [5,911], 1-hexene [12] and
1-butene [12] to demonstrate the novel low-temperature
hydrogenation activities on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.
In this study we use the hydrogenation of acrolein
(CH2@CHCH@O) as a probe reaction on Pt(111),
Ni(111) film, and PtNiPt(111) to determine how the for-
mation of the bimetallic surface affects the hydrogenation
activity and selectivity of organic molecules containing
multiple unsaturated functional groups.
Studies of the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated
aldehydes, such as a,b-unsaturated aldehydes, have been
of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals
and pharmaceutical precursors. Most of these studies have
been carried out on supported group VIII transition metal
catalysts by exploring the influence of different factors that
promote the formation of the desirable unsaturated alco-
hols [13]. Some of those factors are: the nature of the sup-
port that influences the metal-support interaction [14,15],
the electronic and steric effects of the support [16], the par-
ticle size distribution [17,18], and the impact of adding a
second metal to make bimetallic alloys [1924], among
others.

Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic sur-
faces have shown promise due to their better selectivity
toward the hydrogenation of the C@O bond of some a,b-
unsaturated aldehydes. Koel et al. have studied the hydro-
genation of crotonaldehyde (methyl substituted acrolein
at the b carbon) on Sn/Pt(111). They found that the
hydrogenation activity was enhanced on the bimetallic
Sn/Pt(111) surfaces in comparison with Pt(111) by using
a batch reactor at relative low pressures [25]. Beccat et al.
observed an enhancement on the selectivity of crotonalde-
hyde and methylcrotonaldehyde toward the corresponding
unsaturated alcohols on Pt80Fe20(111) surfaces [26]. The
enhancement in the selectivity to C@O hydrogenation
was attributed to alloy formation in the case of crotonalde-
hyde. However, the effect on the selectivity toward the
corresponding unsaturated alcohol was found to be higher
by the addition of a methyl group in methylcrotonaldehyde
than that induced by alloy formation. Thermal activation
of crotonaldehyde using temperature programmed desorp-
tion (TPD) was performed by Zaera and de Jesus [27] on
Pt(111). The main reaction pathway was decarbonylation
leading to the production of CO and propene.
The hydrogenation of acrolein, which is the smallest a,b-
unsaturated aldehyde, is an important probe reaction for
the understanding of factors that govern the selectivity to-
ward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol. As illustrated
in Scheme 1, the hydrogenation of the C@O bond of acro-
lein leads to the formation of the desirable unsaturated
alcohol (2-propenol), while the hydrogenation of the
C@C bonds results in the formation of the undesirable sat-
urated aldehyde (propanal). Both products can undergo
further hydrogenation to produce the saturated alcohol
(1-propanol). Single crystal studies of acrolein reaction
pathways have provided insights into the adsorption mech-
anisms for the activation of either C@C or C@O bond.
Studies of thermal activation of acrolein on Pt(111) [27],
Rh(111) [28], and Pd(110) [29] have shown that decompo-
sition pathways toward the formation of CO and H2 occur
simultaneously with the formation of small hydrocarbon
molecules, such as ethane and ethylene. The formation of
both ketene and propene was also reported by Zaera and
de Jesus on the Pt(111) surface [27,30]. However, on
Pd(111) the formation of propanal from acrolein was re-
ported [31]. High-resolution electron energy loss spectros-
copy
(HREELS)
showed
that
at
low
temperature
(<170 K) acrolein was bound to both Rh(111) and
Pd(111) in an g2(C,O) configuration, which was strongly
rehybridized to an g4(C,C,C,O)-bound species upon heat-
ing the substrate to 200 K [28,31]. The self-hydrogenation
of acrolein to propanal on Pd(111) was explained in terms
of a C@C interaction with the substrate [31].
Recent studies have attempted to explain the absorption
configurations of acrolein on different single crystals and
surface alloys by using theoretical approaches and/or in
combination with HREELS experiments [3237]. Specifi-
cally, Loffreda et al. reported coverage dependence in the
adsorption modes of acrolein on Pt(111) using DFT and
HREELS [37]. Two configurations were found to be dom-
inant at low coverages (up to 0.15 ML) on Pt(111), a flat
g4-trans and a g3-cis configuration. On the other hand,
at higher coverages (0.20 and 0.25 ML), g2-cis and -trans
configurations through the C@C bond were found to be
more stable. These authors also confirmed HREEL spectra
simulations of the different vibrational modes in the most
stable configurations with experimental HREEL spectra
at different coverages. In the current work we have focused
on the high coverage region, where the g2-bonding via the
C@C bond of acrolein was considered to be the stable con-
figuration. Loffreda et al. also reported that the hydrogena-
tion of C@O bond of acrolein occurs on Pt(111). However,
the desorption step of the saturated aldehyde was favored
over that of the unsaturated alcohol, making the net selec-
tivity higher for the gas phase desorption of mainly the sat-
urated aldehyde under catalytic conditions [38,39].
In a recent publication we reported the selective hydroge-
nation of acrolein on two types of bimetallic surfaces, Ni
PtPt(111) with Ni atoms occupying the top-most surface
and PtNiPt(111) with Ni atoms occupying the subsurface
region [40]. Experimental results and DFT calculations
from that study indicated that the hydrogenation of acro-
lein by the co-adsorbed H atoms occurred on the subsurface
PtNiPt(111) structure but not on surface NiPtPt(111)
[40]. In the current study we focused on the comparison of
the adsorption and hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt(111)
and Ni(111) film to further demonstrate the unique hydro-
genation pathways on the PtNiPt(111) bimetallic sur-
face. Finally, we also investigated the adsorption of the
two main hydrogenation products, 2-propenol and prop-
anal, on the PtNiPt(111) surface to further understand
the hydrogenation pathways of acrolein on the bimetallic
surface.

tion
(LEED),

1.5 mm thick disk and 12 mm in diameter, was spot welded
directly to two tantalum spots that served as both electrical
connections for resistive heating and thermal contacts for
cooling with liquid nitrogen. Using this configuration the
crystal could be cooled down to 90 K and heated to
1100 K. The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by cycles of sput-
tering with Ne+ at 600 K, oxygen dosing (1  108 Torr) at
890 K, and annealing at 1100 K. The cleanliness of the sur-
face was checked by AES measurements. The Pt(111) sur-
face was heated at a rate of 3 K/s during the TPD
experiments, with the surface placed at a distance of
5 mm from the opening of a random flux shield of the
mass spectrometer. The TPD setup was used to monitor
up to 10 masses simultaneously.
The HREELS experiments were performed in a three-le-
vel stainless steel chamber (base pressure 6  1010 Torr)
equipped with a QMS, LEED, AES, and an LK-3000 dou-
ble-pass HREEL spectrometer for vibrational analysis.
The HREEL spectra reported here were acquired with a
primary beam energy of 6 eV. Angles of incidence and
reflection were 60 with respect to the surface normal in
the specular direction. For some measurements the reflec-
tion angle was moved to 50 with respect to the surface
normal in an off-specular direction. Count rates in the elas-
tic peak were typically 3  1043  105 counts per second
(cps), and the spectral resolution was between 30 and
40 cm1 full-width at half maximum (FWHM). The expo-
sure of acrolein or hydrogen was made with the Pt(111)
surface held at <120 K. The initial HREEL spectrum was
acquired at low temperature (110 K). The adsorbed layer
was then heated to a specified temperature with a linear
rate of 3 K/s, held for 5 s, then cooled down to 110 K
for data collection. The temperatures were chosen on the
basis of the TPD results.
Acrolein (Alfa Aesar, 99.9% stabilized with hydroqui-
none 0.1%) was purified by successive freezepumpthaw
cycles prior to use. The purity was verified in situ by mass
spectrometry. Hydrogen, oxygen, and neon were all re-
search grade purity (Matheson, 99.999%) and were intro-
duced
into
the
UHV
chamber
without
further
purification. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1 Langmuir
(L) = 1  106 Torr s) and are not corrected for ion gauge
sensitivity factors. Acrolein, 2-propenol, propanal, and
oxygen were dosed through directional dosing tubes, with
a diameter of 5 mm, attached to leak valves with a crystal
temperature below 120 K. For H2 dosing, the exposure of
0.5 L in the TPD chamber (directional dosing) and 5 L in
the HREELS chamber (background dosing) resulted in
50% saturation coverage of hydrogen, based on TPD
measurements as a function of hydrogen exposure.
The bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor
deposition (PVD) of Ni on the Pt(111) surface by main-
taining the crystal at 600 K to prevent CO adsorption from
the background, as described in detail previously [6]. The
evaporative Ni doser consisted of a Ni wire (99.999% pur-
ity) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire,
which was contained in a stainless steel enclosure with an
opening of 1 cm in diameter. During deposition, the
UHV pressure remained below 5  1010 Torr. The metal
coverage was estimated using AES by monitoring the
Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Up to a
monolayer coverage, when the Pt(111) substrate is main-
tained at a temperature of 600 K, Ni atoms diffuse to the
subsurface of Pt(111), resulting in a top layer enriched
with Pt atoms [6]. The surface prepared at 600 K at a
monolayer coverage is referred to as a PtNiPt(111) sur-
face in the current paper. The Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES
peak-to-peak ratio corresponding to this surface is 1.
The PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure was previously
characterized using a combination of low energy ion scat-
tering (LEIS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and
DFT modeling [6]. The LEIS results indicate that the most
of the surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region
after heating a ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600 K. Although
there is no direct experimental confirmation of Ni residing
exclusively in the second layer, the following indirect evi-
dence strongly suggests the presence of the subsurface Ni
atoms: (1) DFT modeling indicates that the d-band center
of Pt is modified by the presence of Ni directly underneath
Pt in the PtNiPt(111) structure, and trends in the calcu-
lated binding energies of various adsorbates have been con-
firmed experimentally [6]. (2) DFT modeling suggests that
the second layer Ni should segregate to the top-most sur-
face in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, which has been
confirmed experimentally [41]. (3) The novel chemistry of
the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure is always observed
by annealing the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600700 K. If
the annealing temperature is above 800 K, at which tem-
perature the Ni starts to diffuse into the bulk of Pt(111)
based on AES measurements, the surface essentially be-
haves as Pt(111) and the Ni atoms no longer segregate to
the surface after exposing to oxygen.
As discussed earlier, at Ni coverages greater than a
monolayer, Ni layers start to resemble a Ni(111) surface
on top of the Pt(111) substrate [5,42]. It is important to
point out the presence of the lattice mismatch due to the
different bond lengths between Ni and Pt, which are
2.49 A
 and 2.77 A
 , respectively. As a result, the first Ni
overlayer on top of the Pt(111) substrate is under a tensile
strain. The (1  1) LEED pattern becomes sharper after a
Ni film with a Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES ratio higher
than 6. Using H2 and C2H4 TPD as probe reactions, we ob-
served that such Ni(111) film was similar to that of a
Ni(111) single crystal surface [8]. Therefore, the surface
with a Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES ratio higher than 6 is re-
ferred to as a Ni(111) film in the current manuscript.

TPD by monitoring the mass cracking patterns that belong

to the different decomposition and hydrogenation prod-
ucts. Some of the fragmentation patterns of acrolein, prop-
anal, 2-propenol and 1-propanol overlap as reported in
NIST database [43]. The TPD traces reported here were
chosen based on the main contributions to the mass spec-
trum of the compound of interest. Other masses were also
collected to confirm the desorption of the main products in
the TPD spectra.
The TPD spectra of 31, 58, and 60 amu are shown in
Fig. 1 for different Ni coverages after dosing 0.5 L of acro-
lein at 100 K. The 31 amu trace is related mainly to 2-pro-
penol (hydrogenation of C@O), the 58 amu trace is
primarily related to propanal (hydrogenation of C@C),
and the 60 amu TPD spectrum is associated with 1-propa-
nol (hydrogenation of both C@O and C@C). The spectra

(2 amu), and CO and ethylene (28 amu) are also shown in
Fig. 1.
Four different Ni/Pt(111) surfaces were included in
Fig. 1. The TPD spectra of these masses from clean
Pt(111) are also included for comparison. As mentioned
earlier, when Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) substrate held
at 600 K, Ni atoms diffuse to the subsurface of Pt(111) at
submonolayer and monolayer coverages. These surfaces
are referred to as subsurface Ni structures, 0.5 ML PtNi
Pt(111) and 1 ML PtNiPt(111). For coverages higher
than one monolayer, Ni atoms start to form a Ni(111) film
on top of the Pt(111) surface, which are referred to as
2 ML Ni/Pt(111) and Ni(111) film in Fig. 1 [5,42].
On the clean Pt(111) surface (Fig. 1), no hydrogenation
products are detected, which is in agreement with previous
studies reported by Zaera and de Jesus [27,30]. Based on
the 56 amu TPD spectrum, acrolein desorbs from Pt(111)
as a sharp peak centered around 143 K with smaller multi-
layer peaks at 129 and 114 K. The peak at 114 K appears
to be more intense while the peak at 129 K is not noticeable
from the 0.5 ML PtNiPt(111) surface. The 1 ML PtNi
Pt(111) surface exhibits the same peaks with higher inten-
sities, which could be related with the decrease of the
decomposition pathway as will be discussed later. At high-
er Ni coverages a single peak centered at 135 K is observed
for the desorption of molecular acrolein. The intensity of
this peak is slightly higher from the thick Ni(111) film.
The desorption of 2-propenol (31 amu) shows practically
no features on Pt(111). It starts to occur on the 0.5 ML
PtNiPt(111) surface as a weak peak at 271 K. The
desorption peak on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface oc-
curs at 265 K. The desorption of 2-propenol occurs at
253 K from the 2 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface and at 351 K
from the thick Ni(111) film. The desorption of propanal
(58 amu) starts to occur as a weak peak at 271 K from
the 0.5 ML PtNiPt(111) surface, with the intensity
reaching maximum at a slightly lower temperature from
the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface (265 K). The desorption
temperature of propanal from the 2 ML Ni/Pt(111)
and thick Ni(111) film occurs in the same temperature
ranges as for 2-propenol. Finally, gas-phase 1-propanol
(60 amu) is not detected from any surface. Therefore, the
consecutive self-hydrogenation of both C@C and C@O
bonds does not occur on Pt(111), PtNiPt(111) or
Ni(111) film.
Hydrogen (2 amu) desorbs from clean Pt(111) in two
peaks at 277 and 490 K, with the latter showing a shoulder
at 445 K. On the 0.5 ML PtNiPt(111) surface, the low
temperature desorption peak is still present but the high
temperature peak occurs at 445 K. The desorption of the
hydrogen product decreases on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111)
surface, as characterized by a low intensity peak at 277 K
and a broad peak centered at 402 K. As more Ni is depos-
ited on the Pt(111) surface, a relative intense peak is ob-
served at 364 K from the 2 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface and
the thick Ni(111) film, with the latter also showing a smal-
ler peak at 297 K. Lastly, the 28 amu spectra include the
desorption of both CO due to decarbonylation and the
hydrogenated products through their cracking pattern.
CO desorbs from clean Pt(111) surface at 385 K. Smaller
peaks at 250 and 303 K correspond to the cracking pattern
of ethylene and ketene in agreement with previous studies
[27]. The desorption of CO decreases on the 0.5 ML Pt
NiPt(111) and 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surfaces with peaks
at 331 and 321 K, respectively. Again cracking patterns
most likely due to ethylene and hydrogenated products oc-
cur at 223 and 271 K, respectively, on the 0.5 ML PtNi
Pt(111) surface. These peaks are slightly shifted to lower
temperatures on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface. An in-
crease in the decarbonylation pathway is confirmed on
higher Ni coverages, as indicated by the desorption of
CO from the 2 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface at 364 K with a
shoulder at 331 K, which becomes even more intense from
the Ni(111) film at 364 K with a shoulder at 408 K.
The activity toward the different hydrogenation and
decomposition products is estimated based on the TPD
peaks that contribute to the cracking patterns of each
gas-phase reaction product. The gas-phase mass spectra
of the potential products and acrolein were collected by
introducing them into the UHV chamber at similar pres-
sures (1.1  108 Torr). Based on these spectra and the
measurements of the TPD peak areas for 2-propenol, prop-
anal, 1-propanol, ethylene, CO and hydrogen, the yields of
these products from the different surfaces, expressed in
units of molecule per surface metal atom, are calcu-
lated and are shown in Table 1. The empirical procedure

developed by Ko et al. [44] is used for the correction of
mass spectrometer sensitivity in the calculations. The cali-
bration of CO coverages from the decarbonylation of
acrolein is estimated by TPD following the saturation
exposure of CO on clean Pt(111) [45]. The CO TPD peak
areas are calibrated by assuming the saturation coverage of
CO on Pt(111) to be 0.68 ML [45]. The integrated area of
CO desorption spectrum is used as base to calculate abso-
lute yields of the desorbing products, with the yields of all
other carbon-containing gas-phase products being calcu-
lated once they are deconvoluted (if needed) and corrected
by their sensitivity factors relative to CO.
The absolute yields of Cads and H2 were estimated based
on the formation of CO and using atomic balance based on
the following equations:
CH2  CH  CH  O ! CH2  CH2  CO
1
CH2  CH  CH  O ! 2H2  2Cads  CO
2
The stoichiometry in Eq. (1) leads to a molecular ratio of
ethylene/CO of one, while in the decomposition pathway
(Eq. (2)) for every molecule of CO formed there are two
H2 molecules and two Cads atoms on the surface.
For the Ni(111) film, the self-hydrogenation yield to
propanal is 0.014 molecule per surface metal atom, signifi-
cantly lower than that on the PtNiPt(111) surface. In
contrast, self-hydrogenation of acrolein does not occur on
Pt(111), which is consistent with previous studies by Zaera
and de Jesus [27,30]. As summarized in Table 1, on Pt(111)
the main decomposition products are CO, C2H4, H2 and
Cads. In addition, the formation of ketene and propene
are also detected when following the TPD spectra of 14,
39 and 42 amu (not shown), which is again consistent with
the results by Zaera and de Jesus [27,30]. Due to the lack of
sensitivity factors for ketene and propene, their yields are
not quantified on the Pt(111) surface in the current study.
Ketene is also detected on the PtNiPt(111) surface, with
the TPD peak area being 75% of that from Pt(111). Gas-
phase ketene is not detected from the Ni(111) film.
3.1.2. Effect of pre-adsorption of hydrogen
The effect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the hydrogena-
tion of acrolein on Pt(111), PtNiPt(111), and Ni(111)
film was studied. For these experiments, 0.5 L of hydrogen
(50% saturation) was dosed at <140 K prior to exposure
to 0.5 L of acrolein and the results are displayed in Fig. 2.
The clean Pt(111) surface does not exhibit hydrogenation,
in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen, except trace amount
of propanal as reported elsewhere [40]. The most noticeable
change is the enhancement of the hydrogen TPD peaks
(not shown). The presence of surface hydrogen induces
two intense low-temperature desorption peaks of molecular
acrolein on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface at 126 and 138 K, as
shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the desorption of 2-propenol
(31 amu) and propanal (58 amu) increases at 260 K. The
formation of 1-propanol (60 amu) is also observed as a rel-
ative weak peak at 256 K. The desorption of acrolein on
the Ni(111) film with pre-adsorbed hydrogen occurs as a
broader peak centered at 135 K. Propanal desorbs at a low-
er temperature (216 K) when pre-adsorbed hydrogen is
present on the Ni(111) film. Mass 60 amu is not detected
on the thick Ni(111) film. Hydrogen desorption increases
slightly from the PtNiPt(111) surface. On the Ni(111)
film, the main hydrogen desorption temperature is shifted
to 330 K with a shoulder at 300 K, with a smaller peak
at 381 K. The CO desorption (28 amu) state increases
slightly in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen on the Pt
NiPt(111) surface. On the Ni(111) film the desorption
temperature of CO increases to 418 K but the peak inten-
sity is lower in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
In contrast, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen does
not significantly affect the hydrogenation activity or selec-
tivity on the Ni(111) film, as shown in Table 1. This can
be explained by the strong bonding of acrolein and its
intermediates on Ni(111), resulting in the complete decom-
position to produce CO and Cads as the dominant reaction
pathway (Table 1). Last, the presence of pre-adsorbed
hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acro-
lein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads
as shown in Table 1.
3.2. HREELS results
3.2.1. Vibrational spectra of acrolein, 2-propenol and
propanal
HREELS measurements are performed to identify the
surface intermediates after the adsorption and thermal
decomposition of acrolein on clean Pt(111), PtNi
Pt(111), and the Ni(111) film. The vibrational spectra of
acrolein adsorbed on Pt(111) at different exposures are
shown in Fig. 3. The vibrational assignment based on cal-
culated features from DFT [37] is shown in Table 2 for
acrolein adsorbed on different surfaces. In the top spectrum
in Fig. 3, most of the vibrational features remain unper-
turbed in comparison with the calculated ones, which is ex-
pected at a multilayer exposure of 5 L at 110 K. At lower
exposures, some vibrational features are different from the
calculated
values.
For
example,
the
m(C@O)
mode
(1698 cm1) is not well resolved at either 0.5 or 1 L expo-
sure of acrolein, suggesting that the interaction of the
C@O bond with Pt(111) occurs at low coverages. The
slight red shift, observed for the m(C@O) mode (1691
1664 cm1) at low coverages, suggests the interaction of
the carbonyl group with the surface, as observed previously
on Rh(111) and Pd(111) [28,31].
In order to identify whether the hydrogenation products
are produced as surface intermediates on the bimetallic sur-
face, HREEL spectra of 2-propenol and propanal were
measured on the PtNiPt(111) surface at exposures
slightly below the monolayer coverage at 110 K, as shown
in Fig. 4. The vibrational frequencies are compared to those
of gas-phase 2-propenol and liquid-phase propanal in
Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The spectrum of 2-propenol
shows similar features to those in the gas-phase [28,46].

Some of the characteristic features of adsorbed 2-propenol
on PtNiPt(111) include the m(C@C) mode at 1637 cm1,
the m(@CH2) feature at 3071 cm1 and the broad m(OH)
mode at 3300 cm1. In comparison, the characteristic fea-
tures for adsorbed propanal include the relatively sharp
d(CH3) mode at 1373 cm1 and the m(C@O) mode at
1664 cm1 [47,48]. The main purpose of Fig. 4 in the current
study is to provide reference spectra to help identify whether
the two hydrogenation products are produced on the sur-
face during the hydrogenation of acrolein. More detailed
TPD and HREELS studies of the reaction pathways of 2-
propenol, propanal and 1-propanol on Pt(111) and Ni/
Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces will be published elsewhere.

110 K spectrum of 0.3 L of acrolein, which is near mono-
layer coverage based on TPD measurements in the
HREELS chamber, exhibits features that show the reten-
tion of the C@C bond, as indicated by the presence of
the m(@CH2) mode at 3098 cm1 and the m(C@C) feature
at 1630 cm1 (see Table 2). The retention of the C@O
bond is demonstrated by the observation of the m(C@O)
mode at 1664 cm1 as well as the d(CCO) feature at
548 cm1. Upon heating to 200 K, the m(C@C) and
m(C@O) modes are observed at 1616 and 1680 cm1,
respectively. The d(CCO) mode appears at 561 cm1, and
the modes around 3000 cm1 are still present. However,
the vibrational features at 3098, 994, and 602 cm1 are
no longer present. The PtC vibrational modes at 426
and 473 cm1 become more intense and better defined, in
agreement with that observed by Loffreda et al. for expo-
sures of acrolein at around 180 K on Pt(111) [37]. The
decarbonylation
of
acrolein
occurs
upon
heating
to
300 K, as indicated by the onset of the 1826 and
2070 cm1 features for CO adsorbed on the bridge and
on-top sites, respectively. The presence of the relatively
sharp feature at 1691 cm1 is likely related to the formation
of ketene that starts to desorb at around 285 K with a peak
centered at 304 K (TPD spectrum of 14 amu, not shown),
which is in agreement with the observation by de Jesus
and Zaera [27]. The formation of a decarbonylated inter-
mediate is also indicated by the single broad band centered
at 2963 cm1, corresponding to the m(CH3) mode in ethyl-
idyne. The presence of the ethylidyne intermediate is also
consistent with the detection of the relatively sharp
q(CH3), m(CC), and d(CH3) bands at 980, 1123, and
1353 cm1, respectively. The spectrum upon heating to
400 K still shows features related to the ethylidyne species
at 981, 1123, 1339, and 2949 cm1. The observation of
peaks at 1407 and 2895 cm1 suggests the presence of acet-
ylide moieties, which are also observed on Rh(111) from
the decomposition of acrolein [28].
Fig. 6 shows the HREEL spectra following the thermal
decomposition of acrolein on the 1 ML PtNiPt(111) sur-
face. The spectrum of acrolein at 110 K shows similar fre-
quencies to those on clean Pt(111). Several changes are
observed upon annealing the surface to 200 K: (1) the pres-
ence of the on-top m(CO) mode at 2036 cm1 suggests that
decarbonylation of adsorbed acrolein starts to occur at this
temperature; (2) the relative intensities of the acrolein
vibrational features are different from those at 110 K, with
many features undergoing a change in frequency in the
range of 30 cm1; (3) the m(@CH2) mode at 3078 cm1
and the CH2 twist mode at 608 cm1 disappear, suggesting
a strong interaction between the C@C moiety of acrolein
with the surface; (4) the presence of the m(C@O) mode at

1644 cm1 and the relatively sharp d(CCO) at 534 cm1
suggests that the skeletal aldehyde structure remains on
the surface; and (5) a relatively intense and broad new fea-
ture is observed at 846 cm1. As shown earlier in the TPD
results (Fig. 1), the desorption of the self-hydrogenation
products (2-propenol and propanal) and relatively small
amounts of H2 and CO occur between 200 and 300 K from
the ML PtNiPt(111) surface. In the corresponding
HREELS measurements, the broad and intense feature at
846 cm1 disappears upon heating to 300 K. At present
we do not know the origin of the 846 cm1 feature,
although it is clearly related to intermediate(s) that lead
to the self-hydrogenation of acrolein between 200 and
300 K. The vibrational spectrum at 300 K appears to be
in general similar to the reference spectrum of propanal
in Fig. 4. The main exception is that the d(COO) feature
of propanal at 663 cm1 is absent, suggesting that the inter-
action between the surface and the COO moiety of the
propanal-like intermediate is different from that of molec-
ularly adsorbed propanal. The detection of a propanal-like
vibrational features can be attributed to the presence of
either the di-r bonded acrolein through the C@C moiety
or the remaining propanal intermediate (via self-hydroge-
nation of acrolein) that does not desorb from the surface.
In addition, the m(CO) mode at 2036 cm1 increases in
intensity, indicating the additional decarbonylation at
300 K. Most of the propanal-like features disappear after
annealing to 400 K, with the remaining features being as-
signed to adsorbed CO at 2036 cm1 and CHx fragments
with c(CH) at 778 cm1, d(CHx) at 1407 cm1, and
m(CHx) at 2976 cm1.
The HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposi-
tion of acrolein on the Ni(111) film, shown in Fig. 7, are
in general similar to those on PtNiPt(111) at the corre-
sponding annealing temperatures. One noticeable differ-
ence is that the CO product occupies both the bridge and
on-top sites, with the vibrational frequency at 1786 and
2022 cm1, respectively, after annealing to 300 K. In addi-
tion, the vibrational features on the Ni(111) film appear to
be better resolved than on PtNiPt(111), especially in the
300 K spectrum. For example, the m(CH) region is clearly
resolved into two features at 2916 and 2963 cm1 on the
Ni(111) film. The sharper vibrational features suggest that
the propanal-like intermediate is better ordered on the
Ni(111) film at 300 K.

3.2.3. HREEL spectra with pre-adsorbed hydrogen
Even though 2-propenol is detected in the TPD mea-
surements from the self-hydrogenation of acrolein from
the ML PtNiPt(111) surface, the characteristic 2-prope-
nol features, such as m(@CH2) at 3071 cm1 and m(OH) at
3300 cm1 (Fig. 4), are not detected in the HREELS mea-
surements (Fig. 6). The TPD results indicate that the pro-
duction of 2-propenol is significantly enhanced after the
PtNiPt(111)
surface
is
pre-dosed
with
hydrogen
(Fig. 2). We have performed HREELS studies to determine
weather the pre-adsorbed hydrogen leads to the formation
of the 2-propenol surface intermediate. We have carried
out both on- and off-specular HREELS measurements in
case the OH bond of the 2-propenol intermediate is paral-
lel to the surface and therefore dipole-forbidden in the
specular HREELS measurements.
Fig. 8 shows the specular and off-specular HREEL spec-
tra of acrolein adsorbed on PtNiPt(111) in the presence
of pre-adsorbed hydrogen at 110 K and after annealing
to 200 K. At 110 K, the vibrational features are similar
to those of acrolein on clean PtNiPt(111) (Fig. 6), with
one difference being that there is a clear splitting of the
m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes at 1610 and 1684 cm1, respec-
tively. However, after annealing to 200 K several significant
differences are observed with and without pre-adsorbed
hydrogen: (1) Comparing to clean PtNiPt(111) that
shows a m(C@C)/m(C@O) mode at 1644 cm1, the vibra-
tional feature in Fig. 8 appears at 1569 cm1, which is too
low in frequency to be the m(C@O) mode and suggests the
bonding between the C@O moiety and the H/PtNi
Pt(111) surface. (2) The intensity of the 1218 cm1 (CH(b)
ip-bend) mode, relative to other CHx features, is more in-
tense on the H/PtNiPt(111) surface, suggesting that the
C@C moiety does not interact as strongly as that on clean
PtNiPt(111). (3) In the specular spectrum, the intensity
of the 846 cm1 feature, which is related to the production
of the hydrogenation product as described earlier in Fig. 6,
shows a higher relatively intensity as compared to that on
clean PtNiPt(111). Furthermore, the comparison of the
200 K specular and off-specular spectra reveals that several
modes, such as d(CCO) at 534 cm1, (CH(b) ip-bend) at
1218 cm1, and m(C@C) at 1569 cm1, have strong dipole
characters as indicated by the decrease in intensity in the
off-specular spectrum as compared to other vibrational fea-
tures. More importantly, neither specular nor off-specular
spectra
show
the
characteristic
m(@CH2)
mode
at
3071 cm1 and m(OH) mode at 3300 cm1, indicating
that 2-propenol is not produced as surface intermediate at
200 K.
3.3. Unique hydrogenation activity and selectivity of PtNi
Pt(111)
As summarized in Table 1, the saturated aldehyde
(propanal) is the main self-hydrogenation product on the
1 ML PtNiPt(111) surface, with an activity of 0.09 prop-
anal per surface Pt atom. The hydrogenation selectivity,
defined as the ratio between the yield of a hydrogenation
compound and the total yield of hydrogenation com-
pounds, is 98%, which is in agreement with the thermody-
namic preference for the hydrogenation of the C@C bond
in the a,b-unsaturated aldehydes [49]. DFT calculations
have shown that the presence of Ni atoms on the second
layer of a Pt(111) surface shifts the average energy of the
surface Pt d-band (d-band center) away from the Fermi le-
vel as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111) [7]. This elec-
tronic modification leads to a weaker binding energy for
hydrogen and alkenes on the PtNiPt(111) surface, which
has been suggested to be responsible for the low tempera-
ture self-hydrogenation activity of the C@C bond in 1-hex-
ene and cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(111) surface [5,6].
Accordingly, similar argument can be made in the current
study for the self-hydrogenation activity of acrolein on Pt
NiPt(111). A weaker interaction of the acrolein moieties
with the bimetallic surface is likely to promote the self-
hydrogenation of the C@C bond in acrolein to produce
propanal. On the other hand, the consecutive hydro-
genation to the saturated alcohol does not occur. This
could be explained by the non-steady process of the TPD

experiments and the preferential hydrogenation of the
C@C bond [26].
Pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the hydrogenation
selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol
(2-propenol) on the PtNiPt(111) surface. As summarized
in Table 1, on this surface the yield to 2-propenol increases
by a factor of 12.5 (from 0.002 to 0.025 molecule per Pt
atom), while the yield to propanal increases only by 0.3
(from 0.09 to 0.12 molecule per Pt atom). The preferential
enhancement in 2-propenol production is explained in our
previous publication of the DFT modeling of binding ener-
gies of acrolein on PtNiPt(111) with co-adsorbed hydro-
gen [40]. In that study the binding energies of acrolein were
calculated in three different geometries (di-r-CC, di-r-C
O and flat g4). Table 5 compares the binding energies of the
three bonding configurations with and without co-adsorbed
hydrogen. On clean PtNiPt(111), the di-r-CC and flat
g4 configurations are preferred over di-r-CO, leading to
the preferential hydrogenation of the C@C bond to produce
propanal as the main hydrogenation product. In compari-
son, on the H/PtNiPt(111) surface, the difference be-
tween the binding energies of the three geometries is much
smaller, making it possible for the surface to effectively
interact with the C@O moiety, which should facilitate the
production of 2-propenol. The interaction of the C@O moi-
ety with the H/PtNiPt(111) surface confirmed in the
HREELS measurements, as indicated by the absence of
the m(C@O) mode at 200 K in Fig. 8.
4. Conclusions
Using TPD and HREELS, the reaction pathways of
acrolein are compared on Pt(111), Ni(111) film, and bime-
tallic PtNiPt(111) surfaces. Based on the results and the
discussion presented above, the following conclusions can
be made regarding the reaction mechanisms of acrolein
on these surfaces:
The formation of a bimetallic PtNiPt(111) subsurface
structure promotes the production of gas-phase hydroge-
nation products, with saturated aldehyde, propanal, being
observed from all the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The
PtNiPt(111) surface also leads to the self-hydrogenation
of acrolein toward the desirable unsaturated alcohol, 2-
propenol, as a minor product.
Vibrational studies using HREELS show features con-
sistent with the hydrogenation product, propanal, on the
PtNiPt(111) and Ni(111) film surfaces, which is not
present on the Pt(111) surface.
The presence of pre-adsorbed atomic hydrogen on Pt
NiPt(111) significantly increases the hydrogenation yield
to 2-propenol in the TPD measurements. The HREELS
and previous DFT modeling results indicate that the in-
crease is due to the enhanced interaction of the C@O moi-
ety with the surface, facilitating the hydrogenation of the
C@O bond to produce 2-propenol.
