Vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over magnesia-supported platinumtin catalysts
Magnesia-supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts with various metal contents and Pt/Sn atomic ratios were prepared using the bimetallic complex cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2] or the monometallic complex cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2 as metal precursors. Catalysts were characterised by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy techniques and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts was related to the catalytic behaviour in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (but-2-enal). It is shown that the various preparation methods produce catalysts with distinct properties and catalytic behaviour. For catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was achieved for the catalyst containing larger bimetallic particles, which are associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidised tin species. The catalyst prepared with separate metal precursors contains a higher amount of residual chlorides, which significantly affect the catalytic activity but only slightly alter the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.
1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production. That of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes generates unsaturated alcohols, which are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, flavourings and pharmaceuticals.1 The hydrogenation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde such as crotonaldehyde (but-2-enal) over platinum catalysts usually yields the saturated aldehyde (butanal). It is necessary to promote the metal to increase selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond and thus to produce the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or but-2-en-1-ol). This can be achieved by the addition of a second, more electropositive metal such as iron,24 nickel5 or tin,2,3,613 and by using a support that can interact with the metal: TiO2,2,1417 CeO2,18 ZnO,19 zeolites20 or oxidised active carbon.21
The platinumtin bimetallic system has been extensively studied for the selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl bond in the presence of an olefinic CC bond. Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species. Tin enhances the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond as a result of the co-operation of two phenomena. On the one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the CC bond and suppresses the re-adsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol.7,8,13 Thus, a proper relation between oxidised and metallic or alloyed tin species is required to ensure the selectivity of a catalyst in this type of reaction.
The method followed and the metal precursors used in the preparation of catalysts clearly affect the catalytic performance. In this way, a close contact between platinum and tin species has been achieved when PtSn/SiO2 catalysts have been prepared by controlled surface reaction between hydrogen adsorbed on supported platinum and Sn(C2H5)4 .11,12 The resulting catalysts show a selectivity value as high as 78% for the production of crotyl alcohol at 5% conversion.22
The use of a metal precursor containing both platinum and tin, such as cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2] yields catalysts composed of well-defined platinumtin alloys.23 When tested in the skeletal reactions of n-hexane, these catalysts are highly stable and selective to dehydrogenated products.24 Furthermore, the support also plays a key role: the MgO-supported PtSn alloy shows higher selectivity for dehydrogenated products than silica- or alumina-supported catalysts.25 These magnesia-supported bimetallic catalysts are the most selective for isobutene production in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction at 753 K, with a low degree of deactivation by coke deposition.26
As stated above, support effects have been widely used to obtain selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Thus, research has focused on partially reducible oxides prone to render strong metalsupport interactions after reduction. The data available on the use of basic oxides, such as MgO, that can electronically interact with the active metal, are scarce. A recent report has shown that magnesia-supported PtSn catalysts, prepared by a two-step impregnation procedure with Pt(acac)2 and Sn(Bu)4, are highly selective in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of citral, and even the monometallic Pt/MgO catalysts showed a selectivity as high as 70% at 100% conversion to unsaturated alcohols.27
This paper reports the catalytic behaviour of well-characterised magnesia-supported PtSn catalysts, prepared from a bimetallic complex such as cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2] or the monometallic complex cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2, in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Their performance is associated with structural and surface characteristics, as revealed by a number of techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The MgO support (SBET: 110 m2 g1) was prepared by adding ammonia to a MgCl2 solution. Three bimetallic platinumtin catalysts, with a nominal Pt/Sn atomic ratio = 1 and platinum metal loadings of 2.66, 1.46 and 0.25 wt% [PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5) and PtSn(0.25), respectively] were prepared by impregnation of a methylene chloride solution of the bimetallic complex cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2].26 In addition, one platinumtin catalyst with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 2.4 and a platinum metal loading of 2.2 wt% [2PtSn(2.5)] was prepared using cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2. For comparative purposes, one monometallic platinum catalyst [2.78 wt%, referred to as Pt(2.5)] was prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2]. The metal precursors were prepared and characterised as described elsewhere.28,29
All the samples were dried under vacuum at 373 K, and subsequently reduced in flowing hydrogen at 673 K.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were collected at a step width of 0.02 and by counting for 10 s at each step in the 2θ range of interest using a Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and Cu target.
Conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) was carried out with a Hitachi H 800-MT electron microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a Kevex analytical system and a CCD camera. High resolution TEM was performed using a Philips CM-30 electron microscope working at 300 kV. Samples for analysis were suspended in methanol and placed on copper grids with a holey-carbon-film support.
Catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after reduction at 673 and 773 K. Photoelectron spectra were acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser and a Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.6302 × 1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder samples were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and reduced in H2, at 673 K for 1 h, before transfer to the analysis chamber. Before recording the spectra, the sample was maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure of ca. 5 × 109 mbar was reached. The spectra were collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by fitting the experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%) and Gaussian (70%) lines. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV, which provided binding energy values with an accuracy of  0.2 eV.
2.3. Catalytic measurements
The catalytic behaviour of the samples in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was tested in a micro-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure under differential conditions. Catalysts (about 100 mg) were re-activated in situ in flowing hydrogen at 673 K for 1 h, and then cooled under hydrogen to the reaction temperature (333 K). Thereafter, they were contacted with a reaction mixture (total flow: 50 cm3 min1; H2/crotonaldehyde ratio of 26) containing purified hydrogen and crotonaldehyde, which was prepared by passing a hydrogen flow through a thermostabilised saturator (293 K) containing the unsaturated aldehyde. The concentration of reactants and products at the outlet of the reactor was determined by on-line gas chromatography with a Carbowax 20 M 58/90 semi-capillary column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterisation
The catalysts PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5), PtSn(0.25) and Pt(2.5) have been structurally and morphologically characterised elsewhere26 (Table 1). Briefly, sample PtSn(2.5) contains well-defined hexagonal PtSn alloy particles, as revealed by XRD, EDX, electron diffraction (ED) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), with a mean particle size of 12.7 nm; the same bimetallic phase is inferred in sample PtSn(1.5) from ED and HREM, with particles of about 3.8 nm; sample PtSn(0.25) contains metallic particles with an average size of 1.4 nm. In all cases CO singleton vibration frequency experiments confirmed the bimetallic nature of metallic particles with isolated Pt. Finally, sample Pt(2.5) contains Pt entities with a mean particle size of 1.5 nm, as determined by TEM. On the other hand, the structure of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) differs from that of the other bimetallic samples. The X-ray diffractogram of this catalyst shows the main reflections due to the crystalline MgO support and low intensity peaks belonging to a cubic phase with a cell parameter of a = 0.391 nm (Fig. 1). Taking into account that the only platinumtin bimetallic phases that exhibit cubic structures are Pt3Sn and PtSn2, with cell parameters of 0.4001 and 0.6433 nm, respectively,30 the reflections in the XRD profile of 2PtSn(2.5) can be assigned to the platinum-enriched Pt3Sn alloy. Fig. 2a shows a representative high-magnification TEM image of this catalyst. Metallic particles are homogeneously distributed and their size distribution is centred at 2.2 nm (Fig. 2b). EDX points to a bimetallic composition, with more intense platinum signals than those corresponding to tin (see, for example, the EDX pattern depicted in Fig. 2c). However, it was not possible to determine unambiguously for this catalyst the bimetallic nature of particles by this technique, since the electron probe used for EDX was in the range 58 nm.

3.2. Characterisation of catalysts after reaction
As discussed in the next section, all catalysts underwent deactivation under the reaction conditions used. The structural changes of sample PtSn(1.5) were monitored by TEM techniques. Before preparation for TEM, the sample resulting from the reaction test was treated under hydrogen at the reaction temperature, until no evolved products were detected by gas chromatography, to avoid contamination by adsorbed products. Fig. 3a shows a bright-field image of catalyst PtSn(1.5). As reported for the same catalyst before reaction,26 metallic particles were well distributed onto the MgO support. On the other hand, the bimetallic nature of the particles was preserved after reaction, as revealed by ED measurements. However, a slight sintering effect was evidenced when determining the particle size histogram after reaction (Fig. 3b). The mean size of PtSn particles increased from 3.8 to 4.5 nm during reaction and, also, the particle size distribution was widened. In order to examine possible changes at a microstructural level, the sample resulting from reaction was studied by high resolution TEM. Fig. 3c depicts a representative lattice fringe image of a single PtSn particle in catalyst PtSn(1.5) after reaction. The particle exhibited clean edges and complete lack of covering structures, and the nature of the PtSn alloy particles is maintained during reaction. In contrast, for a similar catalyst supported on silica an amorphous 34 nm thick layer covered almost all silica-supported PtSn particles, with ED properties distinct from those of the bimetallic particles.31

3.3. Catalytic behaviour
Five magnesia-supported catalysts were studied: monometallic Pt(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2]; bimetallic PtSn(2.5), PtSn(1.5) and PtSn(0.25), prepared from the bimetallic complex cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2]; and bimetallic 2PtSn(2.5), prepared from cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2. The same precursors had been used to prepare alumina- and silica- supported catalysts.31 Thus, a first comparison between the catalytic behaviour of monometallic platinum catalysts with various supports seemed appropriate. Fig. 4 plots the activity (μmol of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt) as a function of time on-stream at 333 K for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/SiO2 and Pt/MgO [Pt(2.5) in this paper]. The activity data plotted in Fig. 4 were taken after 10 min on-stream, in order to facilitate their comparison. The initial activities, measured after 6 min on-stream, when the mass balance between reactants and products had been achieved, differed. They are shown in Table 2, together with the corresponding turnover numbers (TON) obtained from the platinum particle sizes determined by TEM. Initial activity is much lower for the silica-supported platinum, and it does not correlate with the particle size [1.8 nm for Pt/SiO2s. 1.6 nm for Pt/Al2O3 and 1.5 nm for Pt(2.5)]. Thus, the initial TON for the Pt/SiO2 catalyst is much lower than those of its counterparts. The value obtained for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is close to that found by Vannice and Sen,14 169 h1, for a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst prepared with H2PtCl6·6H2O as metal precursor, with particles of about 3.9 nm. On the other hand, these authors have reported TON frequencies ranging from 160 to 200 h1 for Pt/SiO2 catalysts with various particle sizes, also prepared with H2PtCl6 ·6H2O. However, Englisch et al. have obtained a lower value (68 h1) for a Pt/SiO2 catalyst with particles of about 1.8 nm, prepared from [Pt(NH3)4(OH)2] and a similar value for EURO-Pt 1, with the same particle size but prepared with H2PtCl6 ·6H2O as the metal precursor.15

Deactivation does not affect the catalysts in the same way, as the most active catalysts deactivated to a higher extent. After 100 min on-stream, we obtained closer activity values, which yield similar TON (Table 2). In conclusion, the use of magnesia as support hardly modifies the catalytic activity of platinum, at least when the catalyst has been reduced at 673 K. Furthermore, the selectivity is similar to those obtained with Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2, butanal being the main product obtained (more than 80% of selectivity). For monometallic platinum catalysts, the formation of crotyl alcohol by the pref erential hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond has been attributed to the abundance of Pt(111) surfaces,15 which favours the adsorption of crotonaldehyde through the carbonyl group.32
Fig. 5 plots the evolution of the catalytic activity for the magnesia-supported catalysts studied. For further details, Fig. 5(a) focuses on the first 30 min on-stream, and Fig. 5(b) shows the evolution from t = 100 min onwards. The data for catalyst PtSn(0.25) are not included in Fig. 5, since its activity is so high that it would hinder the comparison between its counterparts. Indeed, its initial activity (after 6 min on-stream) is as high as 400 μmol s1 g1, and it deactivates to 110 μmol s1 g1 after 6 h.
Fig. 5 Evolution of catalytic activity with time on-stream at 333 K for the magnesia-supported catalysts: (a) First stages of the reaction. (b) Last stages of the reaction.
In the first stages of the reaction, two processes take place simultaneously: the reaction itself and the adsorption of crotonaldehyde and reaction products. Therefore, real initial reaction rates cannot be measured. The initial activity was recorded after about 6 min on-stream, when the mass balance between reactants and products had been achieved. As stated above, monometallic Pt(2.5) shows a higher initial activity than bimetallic catalysts, with the exception of PtSn(0.25). After 5 h on-stream and subsequent deactivation, the activity order was unchanged: PtSn(0.25)>Pt(2.5)>2PtSn(2.5)>PtSn(2.5)>PtSn(1.5). For bimetallic catalysts, activity was not related to the particle size or to the Pt/Sn atomic ratio. Catalyst PtSn(2.5) is composed of PtSn alloy particles about 12.7 nm in size and is more active than PtSn(1.5), with particles of about 3.8 nm (Table 1). Both catalysts, as well as the active PtSn(0.25), have a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.92 and differ only in the metal content (see Table 1). Thus, taking into account that the three bimetallic catalysts are composed of PtSn alloy particles, as determined by TEM, their different activities can be related to different surface compositions in particles of different sizes.
The catalytic activity of platinumtin catalysts is determined by two main parameters: (i) the amount of surface platinum aggregates, which are mainly active for the hydrogenation of the CC bond and (ii) the amount of surface oxidised tin species, close to the platinum atoms, which promote the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. The presence of oxidised tin species is required to ensure selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, as reported elsewhere.1,68,10,11,31 Thus PtSn alloy particles show a low activity (on a platinum content basis) due to the dilution of platinum atoms with tin, and a low selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, given the absence of oxidised tin species. These species enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.31
Catalysts prepared with the bimetallic cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2] have been characterised by XPS.26 The XPS Pt/Sn atomic ratio was similar to the bulk Pt/Sn atomic ratio only for catalyst PtSn(1.5) and slightly lower for PtSn(2.5). However, surface enrichment with tin was much stronger for PtSn(0.25), the catalyst with the lowest metal loading and the smallest particle size, in this study. Table 3 summarises the bulk and XPS Pt/Sn atomic ratios for the three catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex. Furthermore, the peak profile of the Sn3d level was deconvoluted into two components, one (485.3486.1 eV) corresponding to metallic Sn, and the other (487.2487.6 eV), to oxidised species. The ratio of oxidised to metallic tin increases linearly with the platinum content (and thus with the PtSn particle size) in the three catalysts.

The surface composition of the catalyst determines not only its activity, but also its selectivity to the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in the unsaturated aldehyde. The products obtained under the conditions used in this study are butyraldehyde, crotyl alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol), butanol and light hydrocarbons (butane and propane). Fig. 6 plots the evolution of selectivity (molar fraction, %) to crotyl alcohol, as a function of the conversion degree in reaction at 333 K, for all the MgO-supported catalysts. Butanol and hydrocarbons are produced in small amounts, which are similar for all the catalysts (<5%); consequently, a high selectivity to crotyl alcohol means a low selectivity for the hydrogenation of the olefinic CC bond yielding butyraldehyde. Higher conversion levels are obtained at the first stages of the reaction. Thereafter, deactivation decreases the conversion degree. The monometallic catalyst shows a selectivity as low as about 10%, which is even lower than that found for a similar silica-supported catalyst (25%) in the same range of conversion degree.31 When the three catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex are compared, significant differences in selectivity are obtained. Thus, catalyst PtSn(2.5) is the most selective and PtSn(0.25) mainly produces butanal. Between these two, PtSn(1.5) shows some selectivity to crotyl alcohol only at low conversion degrees (<2%), when the strong initial deactivation has taken place. The behaviour of these catalysts can be correlated with the amount of oxidised tin species on the particle surface. Thus the relative amount of surface oxidised tin species increases with particle size, in such a way that it is as high as 75% in catalyst PtSn(2.5), as discussed above. These oxidised tin species promote the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond and favour the production of crotyl alcohol. Catalyst PtSn(0.25) shows the highest degree of surface tin segregation (Table 3), but this surface tin is mainly reduced. The catalyst shows zero selectivity to crotyl alcohol but a very high activity compared with its counterparts. It is not easy to explain this behaviour on the basis of available data on this sample. The behaviour of this catalyst in isobutane dehydrogenation, both with and without hydrogen, has been described elsewhere.26 Its activity was also higher than those of the other PtSn catalysts prepared from the bimetallic complex when hydrogen was present in the reaction mixture, whereas it was lower than that of PtSn(2.5) when an isobutaneargon mixture was fed to the reactor.
Fig. 6 Evolution of selectivity to crotyl alcohol as a function of the conversion degree during reaction at 333 K, for the magnesia-supported catalysts.
Catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) deserves a separate treatment. As mentioned in the Experimental section, it was prepared by impregnation with cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] as platinum precursor and SnCl2 as tin precursor. If the presence of small bimetallic particles (2.2 nm) of platinum-enriched Pt3Sn is assumed, and taking into account the catalyst composition, the presence of residual non-alloyed tin must be concluded. This agrees with the XPS characterisation of this catalyst, which, after reduction at 673 K, shows a much higher tin surface segregation than the other bimetallic catalysts. The Pt/Sn atomic ratio obtained by XPS was as small as 0.06 (Table 3). With this surface composition, catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) is the most active among the bimetallic catalysts, except for PtSn(0.25) (Fig. 5). Furthermore, its selectivity to crotyl alcohol is also high (Fig. 6). Only PtSn(2.5) is more selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.
The surface Sn(ox)/Pt atomic ratio can be evaluated from XPS data by dividing the XPS Sn(ox)/Sn(ox + met) ratio by the XPS Pt/Sn atomic ratio (Table 3). High selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond is paralleled by a high Sn(ox)/Pt ratio (higher than unity). However, the relative positions of the oxidised tin species to the platinum atoms is also relevant. Proximity allows the polarisation of the carbonyl bond of crotonaldehyde chemisorbed on platinum atoms. This may be the case for catalyst PtSn(2.5), the most selective, although it has a lower Sn(ox)/Pt ratio than 2PtSn(2.5). On the other hand, we use the term oxidised tin  to denote both Sn(II) and Sn(IV) species, which cannot be distinguished by XPS. A different content of these species can also affect the catalytic selectivity, as they would be able to activate the carbonyl bond to a different extent.
3.4. Effect of reduction temperature
As discussed above, the behaviour of the magnesia-supported platinum catalyst is similar to that of alumina- and silica- supported catalysts. However, selectivity for unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol, trans- and cis-3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol) as high as 70% in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal), with a Pt/MgO catalyst prepared from Pt(acac)2 and reduced at 773 K, has been reported.27 With a PtSn/MgO catalyst containing 1 wt% Pt and Sn/Pt = 0.5, and using a trickle-bed reactor at 373 K, an induction period of about 10 h was observed before complete conversion, with 97% selectivity for the unsaturated alcohols. No traces of deactivation were observed after 100 h on-stream. Such catalytic behaviour may be attributed to an electronic ligand effect of the basic support.
Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) in the Pt/MgO system after high temperature reduction (773 K) was first reported by Adamiec et al.,33 who worked with a 0.5% Pt/MgO catalyst that showed a high metal dispersion after reduction at 573 K, as deduced by TEM and H2 chemisorption. However, the chemisorption capacity was negligible after reduction at 773 K. The decrease in H2 chemisorption in magnesia-supported catalysts may be due to poisons, such as sulfate, in the support.34 This has been confirmed for the Pt/MgO system, although a decrease in hydrogen uptake has been observed even for a sulfur-free catalyst reduced at high temperature.35
The generation of a support effect was tested with catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) by reducing the magnesia-supported catalyst at high temperature. As commented above, SMSI effects have been reported in the Pt/MgO system after reduction at 773 K. Fig. 7 compares the evolution of the catalytic activity of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) with time on-stream, at 333 K, after reduction at 673 and 773 K. The increase in the reduction temperature clearly enhances the catalytic activity. However, this was accompanied by only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol, as shown in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8 Evolution of selectivity to crotyl alcohol as a function of the conversion degree during reaction at 333 K, for catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) reduced at 673 and 773 K.
A comparison of the XPS spectra obtained with catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) after reduction at 673 and 773 K reveals no change in the platinum or tin surface properties. Thus, the low increase in the reduction temperature modifies neither the Pt/Sn surface ratio nor the relative amount of surface oxidised tin. Furthermore, the binding energy of the Pt electrons remains unchanged: 71.0 eV, which indicates that the metalsupport interaction, if any, is too weak to be detected by a decrease in the binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level.
The main surface modification in catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) induced by the increase in the reduction temperature is the removal of residual chlorides. Fig. 9 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the P 2s and Cl 2p region, obtained after reduction at 673 K (a) and 773 K (b). These spectra reveal residual phosphorus, originating from the phosphine ligands in the platinum complex precursor. The XPS signal remains unchanged after reduction at 773 K. However, Fig. 9(a) shows that a relatively high amount of chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.01) remains on this catalyst after reduction at 673 K. Note that no chlorides were detected by XPS in the bimetallic catalysts prepared from the bimetallic complex precursor, as reported elsewhere.26 Reduction at 773 K removes nearly completely the residual chlorides (Cl/Mg atomic ratio = 0.001) [Fig. 9(b)]. Thus, the increase in activity of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) can be attributed to the removal of residual chlorides, which may poison surface platinum atoms.
Fig. 9 XPS spectra of the P 2s and Cl 2p region for catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) reduced at (a) 673 K and (b) 773 K.
The presence of chlorides may lead to an increase of selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.36,37 For silica-supported cobalt catalysts, the activity and selectivity in the liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde are maximum at around Cl/Co = 0.2 in the catalyst surface, as reported by Nitta et al.36 This is consistent with the hypothesis that residual chlorine affects both the reduction stage, by favouring the formation of an optimum crystallite size distribution and the reaction stage, by decreasing the hydrogenation of the CC double bond. Bachiller-Baeza et al.,37 in a study on the vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over platinum/graphite catalysts prepared from H2PtCl6 as the metal precursor, obtained a higher selectivity for crotyl alcohol when the graphite support contained a certain amount of oxygen surface complexes. This was attributed to an effect of the residual chlorides anchored on the oxygen functionalities of the support. However, when the reduction temperature of their most effective catalyst was increased from 523 to 673 K, the catalytic activity increased from 34.3 to 57.1 μmol s1 (g-Pt)1, whereas the selectivity for crotyl alcohol slightly increased from 21 to 25 mol%. Furthermore, the amount of surface chlorine clearly decreased, as no chlorides were detected by XPS after reduction at 673 K. Here, catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) shows the same behaviour: a high reduction temperature is accompanied by a significant removal of surface chlorides, which strongly modifies the catalytic activity but only slightly increases the selectivity.
5. Conclusions
Bimetallic platinumtin catalysts supported on magnesia containing PtSn alloy particles of various sizes were prepared. The selective vapour phase hydrogenation of the carbonyl (CO) bond in crotonaldehyde is strongly favoured in large PtSn particles. This has been attributed to the presence of a higher amount of surface oxidised tin species in these large particles, as evidenced by XPS.
The preparation method and the Pt/Sn bulk ratio determine the properties of the prepared catalysts, as shown by the differences between catalyst 2PtSn(2.5)which was prepared with separate platinum and tin precursors and with a higher Pt/Sn ratioand its bimetallic counterparts, prepared from a bimetallic complex. Catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) is composed of platinum-enriched Pt3Sn bimetallic particles and shows a high degree of tin surface segregation and high chloride content after reduction at 673 K, whereas catalysts prepared from the bimetallic precursor are composed of PtSn alloy particles and show no surface chlorides after reduction at 673 K.
The reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol. These results do not allow us to infer any support effect of magnesia in this system under the conditions used.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
