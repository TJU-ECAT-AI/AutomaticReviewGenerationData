Abstract
The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene (H3CCCH) on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)
surface alloys were investigated with temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy electron
diffraction. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces
accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. Addition of Sn to the Pt(111) surface to form these two ordered surface alloys
suppresses the decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon. The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly
adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy.
Methylacetylene reaction also leads to a small amount of desorption of benzene, along with butane, butene, isobutylene and ethylene.
There is some difference in the yield of these other reaction products depending the Sn concentration, with the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111)
surface alloy having the highest selectivity for these. Despite previous experiments showing cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form
benzene on the PtSn surface alloys, the analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, that is,
cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is proposed that this and the high yield of propylene is due to
facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene because of the relatively weak HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene. The desorption
of several C4 hydrocarbon products at low (<170 K) temperature indicates that some minor pathway involving CC bond breaking
is possible on these surfaces.  1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111)
surface also changes the H2 desorption temper-
ature from dehydrogenation during TPD. The
principle peak at 450 K shifts to 505 K and the
series of peaks from 500 to 800 K are transformed
into a less structured feature that now extends to
850 K upon changing from the Pt(111) surface to
the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Increasing the
amount of Sn to form the E3 surface alloy shifts
the peak at 505 K down in temperature to 490 K.

ciation of deuterated acetylene on Pt(111) and the

<questions>


How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
