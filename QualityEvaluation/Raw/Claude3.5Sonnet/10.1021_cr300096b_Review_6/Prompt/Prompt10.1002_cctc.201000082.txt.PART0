General Trends in the Partial and Complete Hydrogenation of 1,4-Cyclohexadiene over PtCo, PtNi and PtCu Bimetallic Catalysts
Graphical Abstract
It takes two: Bimetallic catalysts often show different properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene has been investigated over several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts using a batch reactor. The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher complete hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, whereas PtCu is a promising catalyst for selective partial hydrogenation.
It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show different physical, chemical, and electronic properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts.16 Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.28 Recently our group has studied the hydrogenation of cyclohexene over PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts, using both model single crystal surfaces9 and supported catalysts.10 The combined theoretical and experimental studies suggest that the novel hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces is related to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface bimetallic structures.5,9 The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces are weaker than those on monometallic Pt, making the bimetallic surfaces more active for the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond of cyclohexene.9 The prediction from the model surface studies has also been verified on supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts using both batch and flow reactors.10
In the current study, we extend the hydrogenation study to a more complex cyclic molecule, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD). Unlike cyclohexene, 1,4-CHD offers the possibility to differentiate the effects of bimetallic formation on the partial hydrogenation (one CC bond) and complete hydrogenation (both CC bonds). In addition, 1,4-CHD also offers the additional dehydrogenation pathway to produce benzene. In the current study the novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity of PtM3d (M3d=Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic catalysts supported γ-Al2O3 was investigated. The bimetallic catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and characterized by CO chemisorption and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). The catalytic activity was tested for 1,4-CHD hydrogenation at 308K in a batch reactor using a FTIR spectroscopy. The experimental results were correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different bimetallic surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies of cycloalkenes generally showed higher hydrogenation activity. One exception was the PtCu catalyst, which exhibited unexpectedly low hydrogenation activity accompanied by a high selectivity toward partial hydrogenation to produce cyclohexene.
To ensure that PtM3d bimetallic bonds were formed on the supported catalysts, EXAFS measurements were performed to elucidate the intermetallic bond lengths and coordination numbers and thus characterize the extent of bimetallic bond formation (Table1). The bond lengths were between the bulk M3dM3d and PtPt distances, consistent with the presence of PtM3d bimetallic bonds. The ratios of PtM3d to PtPt coordination numbers also provided an indication of the extent of bimetallic bond formation. For PtNi and PtCu bimetallic catalysts, this ratio of coordination numbers was greater than one, indicating that most Pt atoms were primarily coordinated with Ni or Cu atoms. In comparison, the ratio for the PtCo catalyst was less than one, suggesting that the first coordination shell around each Pt atom was filled with more Pt than Co atoms.

The volumetric static CO chemisorption technique was used to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts (Table2). The amount of CO chemisorbed onto the catalysts was calculated using a stoichiometry of oneCO molecule persurface metal atom. The CO uptake values calculated for the PtNi and PtCo catalysts were higher than that for monometallic Pt, suggesting that CO molecules also adsorb on some of the M3d (Ni or Co) metals.

The catalytic activity toward 1,4-CHD hydrogenation over these catalysts was evaluated with a FTIR batch reactor. The concentrations of the four main species, 1,4-CHD, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined by using the intensities of the characteristic vibrational features, similar to the analysis in our previous work.10 The consumption of 1,4-CHD and the production of cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, as a function of reaction time at 308K, are shown in Figure1 for Pt and bimetallic PtM3d catalysts. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,4-CHD were found to occur simultaneously over all the catalysts. The complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane took place on the PtNi, PtCo, and Pt catalysts, whereas partial hydrogenation to produce cyclohexene occurred on the PtCu catalysts.

Comparison of the rate of 1,4-CHD consumption and cyclohexene, cyclohexane, benzene production over Pt and PtM3d catalysts at 308K.
To quantify the difference between the hydrogenation rates on the four catalysts, first-order kinetics were assumed for the consumption of 1,4-CHD. The values of the rate constant k, with and without normalizing to the number of surface sites based on CO chemisorption, are listed in Table2. The consumption rate of 1,4-CHD, normalized by the weight of catalysts, followed the order PtNi>PtCo>Pt>PtCu; after normalization by the number of surface sites the general trend was the same, except that the order of PtNi and PtCo is reversed. This trend is similar to that for the production rate of the complete hydrogenation pathway, as judged based on the initial slopes in the concentration curves of cyclohexane production over the four catalysts (Figure1).
Although the consumption rate of 1,4-CHD over the PtCu catalyst was much slower than that over the other three catalysts, it exhibited a unique hydrogenation behavior, as illustrated by the absence of the cyclohexane product and the continuous increase in the concentration of the partial hydrogenation product, cyclohexene. To further understand the hydrogenation behavior of the PtCu catalyst, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene was performed under the same reaction conditions (Figure2a). Using first-order kinetics, the rate constant for cyclohexene consumption over the PtCu catalyst at 308K was estimated to be 27min1g1. This value is much smaller than the rate constants over the other catalysts, which were estimated previously to be 310, 150, and 110min1g1 over PtNi, PtCo, and Pt, respectively, at a reaction temperature of 303K.10 The lower rate of cyclohexene hydrogenation over PtCu was likely the origin for the higher concentration of cyclohexene as compared to the other three catalysts, whereupon cyclohexene was initially produced but was subsequently consumed due to the higher hydrogenation rate of cyclohexene over PtNi, PtCo and Pt. However, the low cyclohexene hydrogenation rate on PtCu alone is not sufficient to explain the absence of any cyclohexane product. One possible explanation is that the surface intermediate is different when PtCu is exposed to pure cyclohexene or to the reaction mixture of 1,4-CHD, benzene, and cyclohexene.

The dehydrogenation product, benzene, was also produced during the reaction of 1,4-CHD over the four catalysts (Figure1). The concentration of benzene decreased slightly with reaction time over the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts. The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane occurs readily over PtNi and PtCo at 343K,10 which might have been responsible for the slight consumption of benzene at 308K (Figure1). In contrast, the continuous increase in benzene concentration over the PtCu catalyst suggested that it was completely inert toward benzene hydrogenation at 308K (Figure2b).
In general, for hydrogenation reactions bimetallic surfaces with weaker alkene binding energies show higher hydrogenation activity.5,9 To determine whether such a correlation also exists for the hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD, DFT was used to calculate its binding energy on different surfaces using the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP). The optimized configurations for 1,4-CHD and DFT calculation results for different bimetallic surfaces are shown in Figure3. A 3×3 slab, with four metal layers, was used for calculations on the adsorption of 1,4-CHD. The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration. A 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid mesh was used to determine the electronic energies. The calculations were performed with spin polarization.

For the bimetallic slabs, both the subsurface PtM3dPt and surface M3dPtPt configurations were considered. As predicted by DFT calculations11 and verified experimentally,12 the subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures are preferred thermodynamically in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen. The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111). The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst. However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane. However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities.
In conclusion, the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD has been investigated over several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts using a batch reactor. The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, with the trend being consistent with previously reported correlations that higher hydrogenation activity is related to more weakly bonded alkenes. The exception was the PtCu catalyst, which showed unexpectedly low hydrogenation activity. However, the only hydrogenation product was cyclohexene, suggesting that PtCu is a promising bimetallic catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
The catalyst preparation for the hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD is similar to those described in detail previously.10
CO chemisorption
The number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts was determined based on CO uptake at room temperature using Altamira Instruments (AMI-200ip). The catalyst sample (0.05g) was loaded into a quartz reactor and reduced in H2 at 723K for 2h. After cooling in He, pulses of CO in an He carrier (CO/He molar ratio=1:1) were injected at 50mLmin1 at room temperature through a sample loop (535μL) and the signal was monitored with a TCD detector. The amount of CO adsorbed pergram of catalyst represents the number of active sites on the catalysts surfaces.
Catalytic reactions
Batch reactor studies were performed at 308K using FTIR spectroscopy to monitor the concentrations of individual reactants and products during the hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD. FTIR spectra were recorded with 4cm1 spectral resolution, by collecting 32scans for gas-phase spectra using a Nicoliet-510 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The supported catalysts were pressed, at approximately 4tons of force, into 25mgcm2 self-supporting pellets. To remove water and other impurities, the sample pellets were outgassed in a dynamic vacuum (residual pressure was 1.333×104Pa) at room temperature for 1h, and then reduced at 723K in 3999Pa hydrogen for 15min, followed by evacuation. This procedure was repeated three times before performing the reactor experiments.
