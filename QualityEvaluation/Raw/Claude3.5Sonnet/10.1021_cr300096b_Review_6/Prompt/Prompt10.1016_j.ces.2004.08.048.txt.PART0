From first principles to catalytic performance: tracking molecular transformations
Abstract
Ab initio methods can be used to elucidate the nature of active sites as well as the influence of the surrounding environment on catalytic kinetics. Theory can be coupled with atomic scale simulation in order to track the molecular transformations that occur over different surfaces and assess their catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein we describe the application of theory and simulation to two specific example systems, the catalytic decomposition of NO under lean conditions, and the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol over Pt. The results for NO decomposition under lean conditions show how density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation can used to begin to tailor the metals that are used, the alloy composition, and the specific atomic arrangements at the surface in order to optimize catalytic performance. Alloying Pt with nearly 50% Au leads to turnover rates that are nearly four times larger than Pt surface alone. The specific arrangement of Pt and Au create special Pt +-site ensembles that reduce surface poisoning by oxygen. In the second example, we describe the elementary pathways for methanol decomposition to CO in both the vapor as well as the liquid phase. The presence of solution significantly alters the overall reaction energies by stabilizing charged complexes that form. The presence of solution drives the heterolytic activation of CH and OH bonds over Pt rather than the homolytic activation thus leading to the generation of protons in the aqueous media. In addition, an external potential can be applied in order to model electrochemical systems. These effects are found to be quite important in the electrochemical phase behavior of water over Pt.
1. Introduction
The design of environmentally benign processes that are economically competitive with current processes is a critical challenge for the chemical industry. Catalysis, which is at the heart of over 90% of all chemical conversion processes, is likely to play a pivotal role. This will require the design of catalytic materials that are highly active, achieve close to 100% selectivity and are stable over prolonged periods of operation. Knowledge of the active catalyst site, the explicit reaction environment that surrounds this site and their effect on catalytic activity would considerably enhance our ability to design more active and selective materials. Elucidating the nature of the active site and its environment will require a detailed understanding of the nature and the strength of the adsorbate-metal surface bonds that form throughout the course of reaction. The local reaction environment that surrounds the active site can be just as important. The presence of defect surface sites, bimetallic alloys, solvent, promoters, poisons, coadsorbed intermediates, and catalyst support can significantly alter the strength of the adsorbate-surface bonds thus changing the kinetics. The atomic scale features that comprise the active site and its environment are dictated by catalyst synthesis procedures. An understanding of how these features form and their subsequent influence on the reaction kinetics could ultimately be used to aid the design of next generation materials with improved catalytic performance.
Computational chemistry has reached the stage where it can be used to model the atomic structure along with the local molecular topography about a proposed active site and establish its influence on the catalytic reactivity. More importantly, it can be used to begin to tune or tailor these structural features toward the design of more active materials. Computational chemistry has thus become an invaluable partner with experiment in molecular reaction engineering efforts. Herein we describe the application of ab initio quantum mechanical methods along with the development of an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the molecular transformations that occur over metal surfaces and to predict the resulting catalytic kinetics. We illustrate how the surface coverage, alloy composition and atomic arrangement, and the molecular networks that form at a liquid/metal interface can impact intrinsic catalytic activity and overall reaction engineering issues. This is illustrated through the analysis of two specific example systems, namely the catalytic decomposition of
under lean conditions and the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The first example is used to show how ab-initio methods and atomistic simulation can be used together toward the in-silico testing of new surface alloys. The second approach describes the challenges of simulating complex reaction environments such as those present in fuel cell systems. Our goal here is not to present a full review on the applications of theory to catalysis nor is it to provide a detailed analysis covering only a very limited problem. Instead we try to outline how theory can help to elucidate the nature of the active site and its environment.
1.1. From first principles towards the design of new materials
The development of novel catalytic materials that can operate under lean conditions would enable the broad commercialization of spark-ignition direct-injection (SIDI) lean burn engines with controlled fuel delivery for improved fuel economy (
Kaspar et al., 2003
). Some of the major obstacles that have hindered finding a solution to this problem are the increasingly stringent regulations on
emissions, catalyst poisoning by oxygen as well as
, and the stability of the active material (
Rodriguez and Chaturvedi, 1999
,
Nakatsuji et al., 1999
,
Uy et al., 2002
). Despite the substantial progress that has been made from both fundamental and applied efforts, there is still an incomplete understanding of the mechanism for direct NO decomposition under lean conditions and no breakthrough discoveries in catalytic materials design. Lean
decomposition has therefore become an important target for high-throughput efforts (Busch et al., 2002;
Ozturk, 2002
,
Richter et al., 2002
). Theory and simulation can begin to complement these efforts but will still likely proceed at a significantly slower rate. We have coupled theoretical results along with ab initio-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation algorithms to computationally explore how changes in the metals used, the composition of alloys formed, and even the atomic structure of the alloy influence the resulting catalytic activity and selectivity for this system.
1.2. Theoretical methods
Periodic plane-wave density functional theoretical calculations were carried out to determine the heats of adsorption for the relevant surface intermediates, the overall reaction energies and activation barriers for a series of elementary surface reactions, as well as the lateral interactions that occur between coadsorbed intermediates. DFT has become the standard for complex transition metal systems offering structures that are typically optimized within
in terms of bond lengths and spectroscopic properties such as infrared and Raman bands that are within 5% of experiment. Relative energies such as adsorption and reaction energies, however, are not within the typical 1 kcal/mol engineering accuracy but instead on the order of 57 kcal/mol. Activation barriers are thought to fall within a similar range (
Neurock, 2003
;
Neurock, 1997
). The improvement in the functionals used in DFT is an on-going effort for many different theoretical chemistry and physics groups which may help to improve on the accuracy of these methods.
Gradient corrected periodic plane wave DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio software program (VASP) by Kresse and Hafner (1993, 1994;
Kresse, 1996
). All calculations used the Perdew Wang 91 form of the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) to describe exchange and correlation energies. The electronion interactions were described by using ultrasoft pseudopotentials (
Vanderbilt, 1990
) with a plane wave cut off energy of
. Increasing the cut off energy changed the relative energetics by less than 5 kJ/mol. The metal surface was described by a periodic supercell, which was comprised of five metal layers along with a
vacuum layer to electronically separate the repeating slab structure in the
-direction. The top few layers of the slab as well as the adsorbate structure were allowed to fully optimize. The bottom layer of the slab was held fixed at the lattice spacing of the metal to mimic the bulk. Transition states were isolated using a nudged elastic band technique (
Mills and Jonsson, 1994
).
1.3.
lean burn kinetics results
In order to simulate lean
decomposition, we start by proposing a basic mechanism that involves the adsorption of NO, direct NO dissociation into adatoms of N and O and the associative recombination of oxygen and nitrogen adatoms to form
(g) and
(g) respectively. In addition, we examine the coupling of two NO molecules to form
, the decomposition of
to form
and a surface oxygen, the reaction of adsorbed NO with O and N adatoms to form
and
and the subsequent desorption of these species into the gas phase. The breakdown of this mechanism into these elementary steps is shown in Eqs.
(1)
(10)
along with the stoichiometric coefficients necessary to balance the overall cycle.
The adsorption energies for all of the proposed intermediates in steps 110 (NO, N, O,
,
,
and
) were calculated at different sites and on different surfaces using periodic DFT calculations. The details of the calculations were described above. The results were subsequently used to calculate the overall reaction energies for each step. The transition states for each step were then isolated using nudged elastic band approach within the DFT framework (
Table 1
). The Arrhenius pre-exponential factor for each step was estimated from statistical mechanics. The activation barriers as well as the prefactors used are given in
Table 2
. Note that adsorption steps are characteristically different in that they are described by a sticking coefficient rather than an Arrhenius prefactor. Additional calculations were carried out in order to analyze the effects of lateral interactions.

The results show that at the ideal low coverage conditions there is a considerable degree of structure sensitivity. The DFT calculated results for NO activation compare quite favorably with experimental results carried out at ultrahigh vacuum conditions as is seen in
Fig. 1
. The results indicate the following ordering for NO dissociation activity:

The openness of the surface as well as the presence of step edges lower the activation barrier for direct NO dissociation. The results suggest that the specific atomic arrangement at the active site has the greatest impact on the calculated barriers. The barrier for NO decomposition over the Pt(1 1 1) surface was calculated to be very high at 235 kJ/mol. This is due to the fact that the N and O adatoms in the transition state share the same two metal atoms. Metal atom sharing is highly repulsive and this drives up the barrier for NO to dissociate. NO will therefore likely desorb before ever dissociating on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The barrier for direct NO decomposition on the Pt(1 0 0) surface, however, was calculated to be +97 kJ/mol which is 138 kJ/mol lower than the barrier on the (1 1 1) surface. This dramatic reduction is due to the presence of unique 4-fold sites which remove metal atom sharing in the transition state as shown in
Fig. 2
(
Ge and Neurock, 2004
). The influence of step edges such as those on the (2 1 0) and (4 1 0) surfaces lower the activation barrier even further since they have both the unique (1 0 0) facets along with coordinatively unsaturated edge sites. These results suggest that at low coverage, the direct NO decomposition is favorable.

At higher coverages the number of vacant sites necessary for NO dissociation becomes increasingly fewer thus limiting this path. The alternative to direct NO dissociation involves NO coupling to form adsorbed

and an adsorbed oxygen atom. The DFT results suggest that at higher coverages this path can be just as favorable as the direct NO decomposition path. The activation barriers for both the forward and reverse paths are given in
Table 2
.
Quantum mechanical calculations were carried out in a similar fashion for all of the steps in Eqs.
(1)
(10)
. The resulting activation barriers for the forward and reverse elementary reaction paths as well as the pre-exponential factors (or sticking coefficients) are tabulated in
Table 2
. These results make up the input kinetic database which is used in the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
1.4. Ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
Previously we developed a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm that can directly incorporate ab initio results in order to simulate the complex network of competing elementary surface steps including adsorption, desorption, surface diffusion and surface reaction that make up the reaction mechanism (
Neurock, 1997
;
Hansen and Neurock, 1999, 2000a,b
;
Hansen and Neurock, 2001
,
Mei et al., 2003
,
Neurock and Mei, 2002
). The simulations explicitly follow the atomic structure of the surface and the specific arrangement of molecules on the surface. The local reaction environment at each of the sites (atop, bridge, and four-fold) on the (1 0 0) surface is explicitly monitored throughout the simulation. The local environment at each site is then used to calculate the influence of the environment on the intrinsic kinetics at that site. The fate of individual molecules and adsorbates are tracked throughout the simulation thus allowing us to determine the dynamic changes that occur within the surface adlayer. By following molecular transformations we can readily calculate turnover frequencies which can subsequently be used to compare with experimental results. In addition, we can also directly monitor reaction selectivity at specific sites. By changing the process or other configurational variables we can simulate various different experimental protocols including temperature programmed desorption experiments, transient as well as steady state batch systems.
The algorithm described below uses a variable time step approach that proceeds step-by-step in event space in order to simulate the system's kinetics. The entire surface is scanned to calculate the probabilities for all possible surface events that can occur at a specific instant in time. These probabilities are then used to construct a kinetic cumulative probability distribution (CPD) which runs from 0.0 to 1.0. A random number is then drawn and compared with the kinetic CPD to determine which event occurs on the surface. A second random number is chosen to determine the time at which the event proceeds. This is calculated via the variable-time expression presented in Eq.
(11)
.
(11)
where
is the elementary rate (given in
) for process
and
is a random number. The simulation proceeds event-by-event and subsequently updates the time, surface structure and the probability distributions after each event. The reader is referred to the following references for more specifics on the ab initio based KMC algorithm (
Neurock, 1997
;
Hansen and Neurock, 1999
,
Hansen and Neurock, 2001
;
Mei et al., 2003
;
Neurock and Mei, 2002
). The simulation can be used to follow the dynamic changes that occur in the surface adlayer as a function of time and/or processing conditions.
1.5. NO decomposition results
We carried out simulations over the active 1 0 0 facets of Pt and PtAu alloys at conditions that mimic those for lean burn. The temperature was chosen to be 713.5 K with
and
. The simulation results indicate that under lean conditions the Pt surface coverages range from 5060%, as is seen in the representative snapshot from the simulation shown in
Fig. 3
. At these coverages, there are no large bare metal ensembles but there are still sites where adsorbed NO sits adjacent to a vacant site. These sites are necessary for the direct dissociation of NO. In addition, there are also sites where two NO molecules sit adjacent to one another thus providing the opportunity for them to react together to form
. A closer analysis suggests that NO coupling is predominantly responsible for
production.

Steady state simulations were carried out at different temperatures in order to calculate the apparent activation barriers. The apparent barrier for
formation was calculated to be 7 kcal/mol, which is lower than the 11.9 kcal/mol (
Kieken, 2003
) barrier found experimentally. The differences may be attributed to the energetics at the active pristine single crystal (1 0 0) surface used here verses the exposed surfaces on the supported nanoparticles used in the experiment. Despite these kinetic differences, the simulations correctly predict that the reaction is nearly first order in NO and negative half order in oxygen. Oxygen clearly inhibits the activity especially at higher partial pressures of
. In addition, the higher surface coverages of oxygen tend to lead to the production of considerable amounts of
.
Similar simulations were carried out over the Rh(1 0 0) surface. Rh, however, was poisoned by strongly adsorbed oxygen. The calculated turnover frequencies under lean conditions were essentially zero. This is also consistent with experimental evidence (
Kieken, 2003
). The strength of the metal-NO bond appears to be related to NO activation and, as well, to the degree of oxygen poisoning. NO, atomic nitrogen and atomic oxygen all bind quite strongly to Rh. Rhodium has a fair number of vacancies in its d-band. This should favor electron donation into the metal, thus leading to a strong MNO bond. The stronger MNO bond strength on Rh correlates with the lower intrinsic barrier for NO dissociation over the Rh. The DFT results calculated herein were also combined with values for other metal surfaces as extracted from the literature to graphically illustrate the periodic trends in the NO, N, and O binding energies along with the NO activation barrier over closed packed metal surfaces. The results are plotted (Pd (
Loffreda et al., 2001
,
Loffreda et al., 2003
), Pt (this work), Rh (
Loffreda et al., 2001
,
Loffreda et al., 2003
) (also this work) and Ru (
Hammer, 1999, 2000
)) in
Fig. 4
. The NO adsorption energies appear to decrease from left to right in this figure. The binding energies for N and O also decrease from left to right. The more weakly adsorbed NO would likely be more difficult to activate. This is consistent with the calculated trends in
Fig. 4
which show an increase in the activation barrier in moving from left to right. The metals on the left of the periodic table have the lowest intrinsic activation barrier whereas the metals on the right have the highest. While the metals on the left are intrinsically more active, they also hold onto to the adatom products much more strongly as is seen by the very strong binding energies for atomic nitrogen and oxygen for metals on the left. This is the classic Sabatier principle. Metals on the left-hand side of the periodic table are poisoned by oxygen whereas metals on the right cannot activate NO. The optimum metal therefore lies somewhere in the middle of the periodic table near platinum.

The typical solution to avoid poisoning of the surface by the reaction products is to alloy it with a more inert metal. Alloying Pt with a group IB metal such as Au should decrease the binding energy of oxygen on the surface and help to prevent poisoning. The addition of too much gold however would limit the ability of the surface to activate NO. The DFT results presented above for Pt were used along with bond-order conservation estimates to determine the energies (and kinetics) over different PtAu alloys. DFT calculations were only used to determine the binding energies for N, O, and NO on the Au(1 1 1) substrate. A modified bond-order conservation approach was subsequently used to estimate the binding energies for all of the reaction intermediates on the alloys described below and in addition estimate the activation barriers for each step.
The ab initio based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation described above was used to examine how changes in the surface composition as well as the specific arrangement of Pt and Au atoms affect the activity (turnover frequency per Pt atom) and selectivity to
. The BOC model is internal to the KMC algorithm and can therefore be used to calculate binding energies as well as the activation barriers in situ for environments that were not already probed with DFT. A large number of different
surface configurations were explored. A few representative surfaces along with their predicted turnover frequencies, selectivities and surface coverages are shown in
Fig. 5
. The optimal activities and selectivities were found on surfaces that contain about 50% Au. More specifically the active surfaces are typically those that shutdown the larger Pt ensembles. Both NO and atomic oxygen prefer to adsorb at the Pt bridge sites. Any surface that contains the four-fold ensemble depicted in
Fig. 6
A should then be poisoned by oxygen since both NO and O compete for the bridging Pt sites.

The well-dispersed
alloy presented third from the top in the
Fig. 5
shows a small increase in the turnover frequency along with an increase in the selectivity. This surface removes all of the bridging Pt sites which significantly reduces the oxygen surface coverage from 0.5 ML on Pt(1 0 0) to 0.194 ML on the
ensemble. This however is a bit too dramatic since it also removes the sites necessary to activate NO. The best alloy configuration found was one in which five Pt atoms are arranged together in the + site ensemble which is shown in
Fig. 6
B. This system is unique in that it only allows one oxygen atom per
+ site. Any additional oxygen would end up sharing Pt atoms with the first oxygen atom. This is very highly repulsive and thus limits the amount of oxygen that can actually adsorb to the surface. Since NO is bound much more weakly than atomic oxygen can still adsorb at the
+ sites without as much repulsion. It can also react much more readily because of the reduction in the oxygen surface coverage. The simulated TOF to form
increases by a factor of 4 on these unique
+ surfaces.
Can one pattern such a surface? and What is its stability under reaction conditions? are still important questions that need to be addressed. Despite these concerns, the approach can begin to provide new ideas for synthesis strategies that might mimic the important elements of the structures identified by supporting metal nanoparticles in mesoporous frameworks or by anchoring complexes to novel supports. Theory and simulation help to generate new ideas that would complement high-throughput experimental efforts.
2. Simulating more complex reaction environments: electrocatalysis
Fuel cell systems hold great potential for providing portable power and efficient power systems, but are presently limited by the catalytic activity at both the anode and the cathode. Understanding the controlling kinetics and elucidating mechanistic features about the active sites could significantly impact the achievable power densities in these systems. Theoretical modeling of electrochemical and electrocatalytic systems, however, is at best a very difficult challenge. The same issues that make it difficult to simulate vapor phase heterogeneous catalytic systems, such as the influence of particle size effects, metal support interactions, defect sites, promoters and poisons, and intermolecular interactions, are also present in aqueous phase heterogeneous systems. Modeling electrocatalysis, however, will also require simulating the complex triple-point necessary in bringing together the catalytically active metal, the electron conducting carbon support and the proton conducting polymer electrolyte. In addition, the kinetics for electron and proton transfer and the influence of the aqueous solution, electrolyte, and an applied potential are also critical in describing the local reaction environment.
Despite the complexity, theory and simulation have been used to help elucidate individual features for ideal surfaces and how they influence the behavior at the anode as well as the cathode. Our interest here is in modeling methanol oxidation at the anode of the direct methanol fuel cell. We start by probing the simplest system possible, methanol decomposition over the ideal Pt(1 1 1) substrate and subsequently increase the complexity of the model. This enables us to sequentially understand how each of the structure features that make up the reaction environment of the working catalyst controls the chemistry of the local environment. Herein we compare our results for methanol decomposition in the vapor phase with results for this same system carried out in the presence of an aqueous solution. Lastly, we comment on how one can begin to probe the effects of an applied potential as well.
2.1. Vapor-phase vs. liquid-phase methanol dissociation over Pt(1 1 1)
The first stage of methanol oxidation over Pt and other Pt-group metal catalysts undoubtedly involves methanol adsorption followed by a series of dehydrogenation steps that produce various
intermediates along with dissociated hydrogen intermediates. For vapor-phase methanol dehydrogenation over Pt(1 1 1) (i.e., dry, gas-phase methanol), previous periodic-slab DFT calculations (
Desai et al., 2002
,
Greeley and Mavrikakis, 2002
) indicate that the first step for methanol dehydrogenation involves the homolytic cleavage of one of the CH bonds to form the adsorbed hydroxymethyl intermediate along with a surface hydride [i.e,
. The initial activation of the OH bond of methanol to form an adsorbed methoxy and a surface hydride was found to be 80 kJ/mol less favorable than the path involving CH activation of methanol to form an adsorbed hydroxymethyl intermediate and a surface hydride.
The same two reactions carried out at the aqueous/metal interface should be quite different since the surface hydrogen would more likely desorb into solution as a solvated proton such as the hydronium
ion leaving an extra electron in the surface. The partial oxidation of methanol from the favored path would now be
. The energies calculated by DFT for the formation of a solvated hydronium ion versus an adsorbed hydride for this solution-phase dissociation step confirm that the former hydrogen species is favored by 43 kJ/mol. In addition to proton solvation by the aqueous phase, the adsorbed
and
intermediates that form are also stabilized by the presence of water. The differences between various different
intermediates and their interactions with an aqueous phase can significantly influence the energetics and pathway of dehydrogenation. Elucidating the differences for methanol dissociation in vapor- and solution-phase environments will aid in understanding catalytic differences at ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) and electrochemical interfaces for this reaction. Further details and comparisons of vapor- vs. liquid-phase reactions are evident in the literature (
Okamoto et al., 2003
,
Desai et al., 2001
,
Ogasawara et al., 2002
).
The fundamental differences between the vapor- and aqueous-phase environments are established in the computational models utilized for these two systems. A three-dimensional depiction of the periodic unit-cell structure for the vapor- and liquid-phase systems is shown in
Fig. 7
A and B, respectively. For the vapor-phase system,
or
intermediates are bound to one side of the metal slab, separated along the
-lattice vector by vacuum, such that only the methanol or intermediate interacts with the bare single-crystal surface (
Fig. 7
A). In the liquid-phase system, the methanol (or a
intermediate) is chemisorbed to the metal surface and surrounded by water molecules which hydrogen bond with one another as well as the adsorbate. As a result, the region between Pt slabs for the aqueous-phase system is completely filled with discrete
molecules in a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network (
Fig. 7
B).

The number of water molecules within a specific cell volume were optimized to find the lowest energy state. In the system studied here this amounted to 24 water molecules. All water molecules were treated quantum mechanically. Calculations with eight water molecules in the cell scaled down proportionally and led to vary similar energetic results. The optimized density of water that forms at the metal interface is
which is less dense then that of liquid water which results further away from the surface.
The reaction energy
for each CH and OH bond activation step was calculated by subtracting the total energy for the reactant state from that for the product state. For the solution-phase calculations, however, the definition of reactant and product state is not entirely clear since upon dissociation the location of the
ion is not static (
Desai et al., 2001
) and will likely diffuse from the surface before subsequent dehydrogenation steps occur. In order to maintain some control over pH, only one
ion was allowed in the unit cell. The energy of reaction
corresponds to difference in energy between the product, an adsorbed
intermediate and the aqueous
ion and the reactant states, a neutrally adsorbed
. Both the reactant and product states were, to some extent, stabilized by the presence of the aqueous phase water molecules. This approach, however, does not include energy contributions due to
diffusion into the bulk solution.
The energy required to remove
from the
complex into the solution phase is estimated to be between +30 to +70 kJ/mol, depending on the nature of the surface-adsorbate electronic structure. The range here refers to the values calculated when the
ion is nearby (i.e.,
and further away (i.e.,
) from the bare Pt(1 1 1) surface.

for the dehydrogenation steps that convert
to CO, calculated with DFT, are summarized in

for both metal-catalyzed vapor phase and liquid phase processes. The values listed at the top of each step refer to the paths for the liquid/metal interface. The energies in parentheses (reported just below the liquid phase energies) refer to the vapor phase values. The energies for the vapor phase were determined by the method described above. They do not include contributions that would result from the formation of

;
Greeley and Mavrikakis, 2002
). The favored pathway is that which involves the least endothermic OH cleavage step. The most energetically favored sequence of CH bond activation steps involves the CH activation of the adsorbed methanol
to form the surface hydroxymethyl
intermediate followed by what appears to be the potentially rate-limiting OH activation to form formaldehyde
. Two subsequent CH activation steps can occur resulting in the formation of the formyl species (CHO) and finally carbon monoxide (CO) (
Desai et al., 2002
;
Greeley and Mavrikakis, 2002
) respectively as shown in
Fig. 8
.
For solution-phase dehydrogenation, the stability of the intermediate states, and hence
are greatly influenced by hydrogen bonding with nearby
and
species. Adsorbed methanol reacts to start the cycle and most favorably forms the hydroxy methyl surface intermediate along with a proton which is solvated by solution. There is considerably more charge localization in the product state than in that of the reactant state. The charge that forms in the product state is greatly stabilized by the polar medium. The overall energy
is 336 kJ/mol more favorable in solution than in the vapor phase (
Fig. 8
).
Maintaining the
hydrogen bond additionally favors CH over OH bond cleavage at the second dissociation step to form hydroxymethylene (CHOH) rather than formaldehyde, the vapor-phase product. Following the bold arrows in
Fig. 8
, the path for subsequent dehydrogenation of hydroxymethylene involves the activation of the OH bond which is now exothermic. This is in contrast to the CH and OH cleavage trends established for the vapor-phase reaction when comparing the overall reaction energies
for these steps (
Fig. 8
). The complete dehydrogenation to carbon monoxide entails a final CH activation step which also appears to be exothermic.
In addition to the detailed differences in reaction pathway for methanol dehydrogenation over Pt(1 1 1) in vapor- vs. solution-phase environments, hydrogen-bond stabilization of the intermediate states generally results in solution-phase reaction energies that are considerably more exothermic (or less endothermic). The only exception is CH dissociation of methoxy to form formaldehyde (i.e.,
, which is about 16 kJ/mol more exothermic in the vapor-phase (
Fig. 8
). This analysis, however, does not consider the energy required for
diffusion away from the surface between dehydrogenation steps which is estimated to be 3070 kJ/mol (vide supra).
Of obvious importance is bridging the solution-phase reaction properties detailed above to an understanding of reactions in aqueous-electrochemical environments, especially given the importance of methanol oxidation to fuel-cell chemistry. Despite the progress, there are still significant differences between an electrochemical system and the solution-phase environment just described. First and foremost is the effect of the electrode potential, which can either enhance or impede the electron-transfer reactions including methanol dehydrogenation, which is not taken into consideration in the solution-phase calculations carried out thus far. The magnitude and sign of the potential is a consequence of electronic characteristics of the reaction occurring at the anode (i.e., methanol oxidation) coupled to reactions at the cathode (i.e., oxygen reduction to water). Additionally, the potential can be thought of as a tunable parameter as utilized in cyclic voltammetry experiments where a reaction can be promoted by externally altering the electronic driving force by using a potentiostat. Regardless of the origin of the value of the electrode potential (i.e., internal chemical characteristics or an external driving force), reaction energetics and pathways are likely quite dependent on the potential of the electrode surface. As a first step, the methodology for studying the influence of potential on aqueous-phase Pt(1 1 1) reactions is presented next by investigating the potential-dependent nature of the
Pt(1 1 1) interface.
2.1.1. Influence of electrode potential on the aqueous-Pt(1 1 1) interface
The electrode potential is related to the electronic structure (i.e., Fermi level) of the metal perturbed by metal-chemisorbate, metal-solution and metal-electrolyte interactions and referenced to that for a known chemical reaction, such as
for the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference or
for the Ag/AgCl reference. (See
Bard and Faulkner, 1980
for more detail.) The potentials calculated here were referenced to a value of
for the hydrogen electrode. However, there is some ambiguity to the correct potential for the hydrogen reference electrode in the literature, which can lead to differences of up to 0.4 V (
Wagner, 1993
,
Trasati, 1991
). Similar to the role of a potentiostat in cyclic voltammetry, the potential of the calculated metal slab can be tuned by either adding or removing charge to the metal surface. Combined with the internal reference, the change in Fermi level tracks the change in potential caused by variation in surface electron density and resulting metal-chemisorbate and metal-solution interactions. The optimum geometry and energy can then be obtained as a function of potential. We demonstrate the approach here by mapping out a portion of the phase diagram for water on Pt. The general approach is described in more detail in
Filhol and Neurock (2004)
.
Of significant interest to aqueous-phase systems over Pt(1 1 1) is the potential-dependent nature of the
layer(s), considering both the metalwater structure and water dissociation. The total system free energy is plotted as a function of potential in
Fig. 9
. The potential was calculated by the method described above for both the pure
over Pt(1 1 1) system(circles) and the hydroxylated surface system which involves a single water molecule dissociated at the surface into an adsorbed OH and a solvated proton
(squares). The open circle at
vs. NHE refers to a pure
layer over Pt(1 1 1) with no external charge. Points more positive potentials to systems where electrons have been removed from the metal surface. In addition to the potential-induced changes in the total free energy of the system, becoming more favorable at both negative as well as positive potentials, significant changes in the geometric structure at the Pt(1 1 1)
interface occur. Structural parameters for the closest-bound
molecule on Pt(1 1 1) as a function of external surface charge and resulting calculated potential are listed in
Table 3
. The
distance from the surface (determined by the location of the O atom) for the
system is about
from the surface, similar to other DFT studies of
adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) (
Filhol and Neurock, 2004
,
Weaver, 1998
). As we move toward more positive potentials, the
molecule is attracted closer to the surface thus decreasing the Pt
bond distance (
Table 3
). Similarly, electronic charge repulsion toward negative potentials acts to lift the
molecule off the surface, increasing the Pt
distance.

In addition to potential-induced changes in the equilibrium binding distance, the interaction of the
dipole moment with the charged surface acts to effectively rotate the
molecule as the potential is varied. For the
system, the water molecule is bound via the O atom, with the OH bonds tilted such that the HOH plane and the surface plane make an angle of
(
Table 3
). The angle is defined in
Table 3
such that
perpendicularly-bound via the O and lying parallel to the surface have angles of
and
, respectively. Negatively charging the surface induces the OH bonds to rotate toward the surface, progressively forming a more parallel configuration and eventually leading to a structure in which the
atoms point toward the
surface, as in the
system with and angle of
(
Table 3
). As we move toward more positive potentials, the OH bonds tilt away from the surface, increasing interaction of the
charge on the O atom with the positively-charged Pt(1 1 1) surface. Similar
rotation is observed for calculations in which a positive and negative electric field is applied across a Pt(1 1 1) cluster (
Ohwaki et al., 2001
).
The structural changes observed above are indicative of favorable
interactions toward positive potentials, which also lead to
dissociation. Evident in the crossing of energy vs. potential curves for molecular (circles) and dissociated
(squares) over Pt(1 1 1) in
Fig. 9
, water dissociation to adsorbed OH and
is thermodynamically favored at potentials greater than
vs. NHE. The results in
Fig. 9
represent the water and hydroxylated surface phases. At more negative potentials, water reacts to form a surface hydride layer along with OH- ions in solution which is not presented here. A more complete picture of the water Pt(1 1 1) phase diagram will require the superposition of the potential dependent hydride phase onto the diagram in
Fig. 9
. In addition, the ability to predict overpotentials will require the activation barriers for water to dissociate into either the hydride or the hydroxylated phases. Both of these are the subject of future work.
The potential-dependent
phase diagram (
Fig. 9
) signifies the central role of the electrode potential in dictating the reactivity at electrochemical interfaces. The example presented here involves
activation over Pt(1 1 1). However, this method can be translated to any aqueous-phase electrochemical reaction. Investigations of potential-dependent methanol oxidation pathways, as referred to above, are underway.
3. Summary and conclusions
Theory and simulation can begin to complement fundamental experimental efforts in elucidating the mechanisms that control metal catalyzed reactions and the nanoscale features of the catalyst that dictate its reactivity. We have used two illustrative environmental examples herein to demonstrate how computational chemistry can be used to determine the intrinsic chemical bonding between adsorbed surface intermediates and the metal substrate, understand their reactivity and establish the influence of the local reaction environment on their reactivity. This includes how changes in the metal, the surface structure, alloying, and surface coverage impact catalytic activity under operating conditions. Computational chemistry can be used to begin to model all of these individual features, and in addition, screen many different surface structures, formulations and their influence on the overall catalytic kinetics.
In addition, it is now possible to begin to examine much more complex reaction environments which provide a tighter coupling between theory and experiment. While it would be quite difficult to perform full ab initio simulation for complex reaction systems such as fuel cell catalysis, it is possible to begin to formulate somewhat more ideal systems that can be solved.
More specifically we showed that the decomposition of NO is quite sensitive to the nature of the active site. The four fold site on the reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surface is quite unique in terms of its activity. Ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were subsequently used to computationally screen over many different
surface alloys in order to distinguish unique atomic patterning of the surface that would lead to more active and selective materials. The
system presented herein is comprised of a specific +-site configuration which does not appear to be dramatically poisoned by oxygen.
The fundamental energetics for methanol decomposition over Pt(1 1 1) in both the vapor and liquid phase is important toward understanding the chemistry that occurs at the anode. The results in the liquid phase were found to be significantly different than those found for the liquid phase. The effect of potential on these calculations is also quite important in dictating the structure, and calculated kinetics.
