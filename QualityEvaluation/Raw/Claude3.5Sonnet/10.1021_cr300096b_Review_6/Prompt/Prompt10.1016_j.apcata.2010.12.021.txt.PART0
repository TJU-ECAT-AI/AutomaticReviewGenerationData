Reverse micelle synthesis and characterization of supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3
Abstract
Reverse micelle synthesis was used to improve the nanoparticle size uniformity of bimetallic Pt/Ni nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3. Two impregnation methods were investigated to optimize the use of the micelle method: (1) step-impregnation, where Ni nanoparticles were chemically reduced in microemulsion and then supported, followed by Pt deposition using incipient wetness impregnation, and (2) co-impregnation, where Ni and Pt were chemically reduced simultaneously in microemulsion and then supported. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the particle size distribution. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to perform elemental analysis of bimetallic catalysts. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were utilized to confirm the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the step-impregnated catalyst. CO pulse chemisorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation in a batch reactor were performed to determine the catalytic activity. Step-impregnated Pt/Ni catalyst demonstrated enhanced hydrogenation activity over the parent monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts due to bimetallic bond formation. The catalyst synthesized using co-impregnation showed no enhanced activity, behaving similarly to monometallic Ni. Overall, our results indicate that reverse micelle synthesis combined with incipient wetness impregnation produced small, uniform nanoparticles with bimetallic bonds that enhanced hydrogenation activity.

Research highlights
 Reverse micelle method was used to synthesize supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts.  TEM was employed to verify uniform size distribution of the nanoparticles.  EXAFS was utilized to confirm the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds.  The reverse micelle synthesized PtNi catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts.
1. Introduction
Catalyst design is a complicated matter that spans from the choice of metal precursors and supports to the thermal treatments the catalyst encounters before reaction. A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support
[1]
,
[2]
. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles
[1]
,
[3]
. Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation

. A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable, optically clear system of two immiscible liquids often stabilized by surfactant molecules. The internal structure of a microemulsion is dependent upon the relative concentration of water and oil. At low water concentrations in oil, the microemulsions formed will be droplets of water. These droplets of water provide discrete environments of aqueous solution into which a certain amount of water-soluble material can be dissolved. Upon mixing two microemulsions, one containing metal precursor and another containing a reducing agent, metal precursor will reduce to metal nanoparticles within the water droplets. This environment provides two major advantages: (1) nanoparticle growth is restricted by the presence of surfactants, thus promoting uniform particle sizes,
[9]
,
[14]
,
[15]

[16]
and (2) nanoparticle size is dependent on the size of the water droplets, which can be varied by changing the molar ratio of water to surfactant (known as the ω parameter)

. The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts.
One of the model bimetallic systems that has been previously well-studied is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. Depending on experimental conditions, a monolayer of Ni atoms can either reside on the surface to produce a NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface, or diffuse into the subsurface to form a Pt-terminated PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure. These two surfaces exhibit properties that differ from each other and from their monometallic surfaces
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
. Due to the decreased adsorbate binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes, novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways have been identified on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure
[29]
,
[33]
,
[34]
. On the other hand, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface configuration binds adsorbates more strongly and is predicted to be beneficial to produce H2 from oxygenates
[31]
and ammonia
[35]
.
The trends of enhanced hydrogenation activity on the Pt-terminated bimetallic model surfaces have been recently extended to oxide-supported Pt/Ni catalysts synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation. These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts
[4]
,
[36]
. In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles. Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique. Particle size and extent of bimetallic interactions were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), respectively. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was performed on bimetallic catalysts to determine extent of metal adhesion to oxide supports. Pulse carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption provided the number of active sites and was correlated with batch reactor studies of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation to compare the hydrogenation activity between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.
2. Synthesis and experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The reverse micelle synthesis procedure was modified from previous work
[12]
. Microemulsions were created using the following volume percentages: 15% DI water, 10% Triton X-100 surfactant (C14H22O(C2H4O)n, n  9.5 on average, Alfa Aesar), 40% 2-propanol co-surfactant (Fisher Scientific), and 35% cyclohexane (Fisher Scientific). The volume of water required was determined by using a metal concentration of 0.04 M. The amount of reductant, hydrazine (50% N2H4 by volume, SigmaAldrich), was calculated by maintaining the concentration of reductant in water as 0.3 M. An additional volume of 2-propanol was added in order to reach an ω parameter ([H2O]/[Triton X + 2-propanol]) of 1.0.
2.1.1. Step-impregnation
To obtain 4 grams of 1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst two aqueous solutions were created: one containing 0.30 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) metal salt and 25.56 ml DI water, the other containing 0.48 ml N2H4 and 25.32 ml DI water. 59.63 ml cyclohexane and 106.24 ml 2-propanol were added to each solution. While under rigorous stirring, 17.04 ml Triton X-100 was added to each solution. Upon addition of the surfactant the solutions became transparent, serving as an indication of the formation of micelles. Solutions were stirred separately for 1 h to allow micelle size to equilibrate. The reductant solution was then added to the metal solution. After stirring overnight, 3.87 g of γ-Al2O3 support (Alfa Aesar, 80120 m2/g) was added to the solution and the solution was then titrated with acetone (twice the volume of the total synthesis solution) to disrupt the micelles and precipitate nanoparticles onto the support. The supernatant was decanted and the catalyst powder was rinsed with acetone. Catalysts were treated in order to further remove residual surfactant, which involved ramping to 373 K in O2 (Keen Gas) over 2 h, holding for 2 h at 373 K, followed by a 2 h ramp to 673 K and a subsequent 2 h hold before cooling to room temperature.
The amount of Pt precursor impregnated on the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was measured to achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, corresponding to a 1.67% weight loading of Pt. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) salt was dissolved in enough DI water to saturate the pores in γ-Al2O3. This solution was added dropwise to Ni/γ-Al2O3. The catalyst was dried in air at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h.
2.1.2. Co-impregnation
Co-impregnation using reverse micelle synthesis was performed by dissolving both Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 metal precursors in water. To yield 1.5 g of 1.67 wt% Pt1.50 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst two aqueous solutions were created: one containing 0.11 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.05 g Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and 12.80 ml DI water, the other containing 0.24 ml N2H4 and 12.68 ml DI water. 29.86 ml cyclohexane and 53.19 ml 2-propanol were added to each solution. While under rigorous stirring, 8.53 ml Triton X-100 was added to each solution. The sample was treated as described above, with the exception of adding 1.45 g of γ-Al2O3 support.

2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Particle size distributions were determined using a JEOL 2010F electron microscope equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200 kV. High angle annular dark field (HAADF) images were collected with a camera length of 20 cm and a probe size of 0.5 nm HR. To image unsupported catalysts, two drops of micellar solution containing reduced nanoparticles before supporting were placed on a Lacey carbon film supported on a 200-mesh copper grid. Supported catalysts were pre-treated in H2 at 723 K for 1 h before TEM analysis. To image supported catalyst samples, catalyst powders were dispersed in ethanol and two drops of the solution were transferred to grids. Grids were allowed to dry before TEM characterization.
2.2.2. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
Elemental analysis was performed using the SOLAAR S Series spectrometer from Thermo Elemental. The principal of AAS involves the absorption by free atoms of an element of light at a wavelength specific to that element. The light source was provided by hollow cathode lamps containing Pt and Ni (Thermo Elemental). Samples were prepared by dissolving the catalyst in 4 ml nitric acid (NO3, SigmaAldrich) and 12 ml hydrochloric acid (HCl, SigmaAldrich) overnight. Solutions were then heated carefully while mixing until 5 ml of solution remained in the vial. Solutions were then diluted to 50 ml with the corresponding matrix solution (10% by volume HCl for Pt, 4% by volume HNO3 for Ni). The sample solution was burned in a flame fueled by an air and acetylene mixture, the ratio of which was optimized for the metal of interest. The absorbance for Pt and Ni in a Pt/Ni catalyst synthesized using incipient wetness was used to normalize the absorbance for reverse micelle catalysts in order to determine the extent of metal uptake.
2.2.3. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization
EXAFS measurements were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, on the X18B beamline to determine the nearest-neighbor coordination numbers and interatomic distances to verify the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds. Catalyst powder was pressed into pellets using a force of approximately 3.5 tons/cm2. Catalyst mass was chosen so that samples would have a thickness on the order of two absorption coefficients. Pellets were loaded into an EXAFS cell that allowed for in situ reduction and collection of transmission signals. The sample was heated to 723 K at a rate of 14 K/min under 5% H2 in He (40 sccm) and reduced for 1 h before cooling to room temperature. The procedures for EXAFS collection and data analysis are reported elsewhere
[4]
.
2.2.4. Pulse CO chemisorption
An AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was used to perform pulse chemisorption to determine CO uptake. Approximately 0.1 g of catalyst was loaded into a quartz U-tube with quartz wool to hold it in place. Catalysts were reduced at 723 K for 1 h in a 50 sccm of a 50% H2/He mixture. Once the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in He, pulse CO chemisorption was performed using 58 μl pulses of CO in He carrier gas. CO uptake in μmol CO per gram of catalyst was calculated with the integrated area from chemisorption.
2.2.5. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the gas phase reactants and products during hydrogenation reactions to determine catalytic activity. Batch reactor studies of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation were performed to determine whether bimetallic catalysts synthesized using reverse micelles exhibited increased activity as compared to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The catalyst reduction and reaction procedures are reported elsewhere
[4]
. Carbon atoms were accounted for by performing a carbon balance, which confirmed the absence of cis-2-butenes and trans-2-butenes. The extinction coefficients and concentration calibrations for all gas-phase reactants and products were determined in a previous study
[4]
.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Particle size distribution using TEM
HAADF TEM images and particle size distributions are shown in
Fig. 1
. Particle size distributions were determined by measuring horizontal particle diameter in several collected TEM images. The median and average particle sizes are reported with standard deviations in

lPt3Ni(co-M), unsupported 1.6 1.6 0.2
lPt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 2.8 2.9 0.6
The median diameter for all catalysts is near that of the average diameter, suggesting that majority of the particles are small, ranging from 1.4 to 2.8 nm. Particle sizes of reduced 3Ni(M) nanoparticles before supporting (
Fig. 1
a) are similar to supported 3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 (
Fig. 1
b), indicating that high-temperature treatment to remove surfactants and pre-treatment in H2 did not affect particle size. No large agglomerations were observed in any reverse micelle synthesized catalysts, unlike those reported for catalysts synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation
[4]
.
Images of reduced, unsupported 1Pt3Ni(co-M) (
Fig. 1
d) show average nanoparticle size of 1.6 nm with a narrow distribution of 0.2 nm. Upon supporting on γ-Al2O3 (
Fig. 1
e), the average particle size increases to 2.8 nm and the distribution widens to 0.6 nm. In comparison, the monometallic Ni(M) particle diameter is 1.9 nm. This increase in particle diameter could be a result of the increase in metal loading during synthesis with 1.67 wt% Pt and 1.50 wt% Ni. The increased metal loading increases the amount of solvents used, which would increase the volume in which reducing agents must reach metal ions, possibly affecting reduction time.
3.2. Elemental analysis using AAS
Elemental analysis was performed on bimetallic catalysts to determine extent of metal uptake during reverse micelle synthesis. A catalyst synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation was used to normalize data to determine extent of metal uptake (1Pt3Ni(IW)/γ-Al2O3). As shown in
Table 3
using AAS, the Pt content for the step-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 is within 12%  4% of the expected Pt content from incipient wetness impregnation. However, the Pt content for the co-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 is only 24%  1% of the expected Pt content. The Ni content for both catalysts synthesized using reverse micelle synthesis is within 15%  1% of the expected Ni content of incipient wetness impregnation.
Table 3. Elemental analysis of bimetallic catalysts using AAS. Reported errors are calculated from standard deviations obtained during sampling.
Catalyst Ni content Pt content
l Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 85%  1% 88%  4%
l Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 89%  1% 24%  1%
l Pt3Ni(IW)/γ-Al2O3 100%  1% 100%  5%
The observation of a significantly low Pt uptake during co-micelle synthesis and a slightly lower Ni uptake during micelle synthesis is likely due to the effect of varying pH during synthesis for two reasons: (1) N2H4 prefers a basic medium for reducing Ni2+ to metallic Ni
[37]
,
[38]
. It is possible that this extends to the ability of N2H4 to effectively reduce Pt2+ to metallic Pt during the reverse micelle synthesis. (2) The range of solution pH has an effect on the adhesion of different metals on oxide supports
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
. Brunelle suggests that since γ-Al2O3 is amphoteric its surface is either negatively or positively charged. Depending on the surrounding pH, there is an optimal region for metal adhesion
[39]
. Additional systematic studies are needed to identify the optimal pH range for the synthesis of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts using the reverse micelle method.
3.3. EXAFS characterization
EXAFS and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed to elucidate the effect of reduction conditions on oxidation state and to investigate the extent of bimetallic bond formation between Pt and Ni atoms for step-impregnated and co-impregnated bimetallic catalysts.
Fig. 2
a) shows the Pt LIII-edge XANES of 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 and a Pt foil that serves as a reference for reduced Pt. The spectra shown in
Fig. 2
b) have been treated with background subtraction, edge step normalization and have been k2-weighted. The data were Fourier-transformed using a k-range between 2 Å1 and 16 Å1. The Hanning window function was used with a sill width of Δk = 2 Å1.

.
The large peaks observed at low R-space for 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 in
Fig. 2
b) are due to the presence of the PtO bond, which disappear after reduction. The resulting peaks at larger values of R are due to PtPt and PtNi bonds. This observation is consistent with
Fig. 2
a), where the white line intensity from the catalysts decreases after reduction to resemble that of a Pt foil, indicating that Pt in the supported catalysts is reduced by H2 treatment.
Fig. 2
c) represents the Fourier-transformed experimental data after reduction and the fits obtained used FEFF6 theory. The EXAFS data were fitted by incorporating PtPt and PtNi interactions. Given that the PtO peaks in
Fig. 2
b) disappear after reduction in hydrogen, PtO contributions were not included in the model. A summary of these values is shown in
Table 4
.

It should be noted that when data in
Fig. 2
c) was fitted without introducing Ni interactions in the first shell the fit was unacceptable based on the large DebyeWaller parameter (σ2). Analysis of the PtPt and PtNi coordination numbers gives information regarding the extent of bimetallic bond formation and particle size. The presence of the PtNi bonds in 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 is indicated by a coordination number of 1.6  0.5. The sum of the PtPt and PtNi coordination numbers for 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 is 8.1  0.8. Assuming a hemispheric cuboctohedral geometry, Frenkel et al. have predicted particle sizes based on average first shell coordination numbers. A coordination number of 8.1  0.8 corresponds to particle size ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 nm
[42]
, consistent with the average particle size determined from TEM of 1.7 nm.
The co-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was also investigated using EXAFS measurements. However, there was not enough X-ray absorption signal at the edge energy to collect sufficient data for analysis. One explanation for the weak X-ray absorption at the Pt LIII-edge is that few Pt atoms were present in the co-impregnated catalyst, as confirmed by the elemental analysis presented in Section
3.2
.
3.4. Pulse CO chemisorption
Results from pulse CO chemisorption are listed in
Table 5
. The uptake is 4.4 and 28.0 μmol CO/g catalyst for 3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, respectively. The CO uptake for the step-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 is greater than the sum of the monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts, totaling 45.1 μmol CO/g catalyst. Given the low uptake of monometallic Ni, it is a fair assumption that the majority of CO is adsorbing to Pt metal atoms. The CO uptake for the co-impregnated 1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 is low, 5.3 μmol CO/g catalyst, indicating that the concentration of Pt is very low, which coincides with results from elemental analysis using AAS.
Table 5. First-order consumption rate constants for hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, CO uptake, rate constant per CO uptake. On a grams metal basis, CO uptake has been corrected based on findings from AAS in Section
3.2
.

1.4 28.0 5.0 1677 8.4
1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 3.1 45.1 6.9 1643 18.9
1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 0.10 5.3 1.9 305 3.3
If the CO uptake is instead determined per gram of metal (correcting for the elemental analysis found from AAS), the CO uptake for the bimetallic catalyst 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 (1643 μmol/g metal) is smaller than that of 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 (1677 μmol/g metal). This suggests that although the total amount of metal in bimetallic catalysts increases with the addition of Ni, there is not a subsequent increase in CO uptake based on gram of metal. Combined with the observation of the low CO uptake for monometallic 3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3, it is a fair assumption that the majority of CO chemisorption occurs on Pt atoms.
3.5. Catalytic activity of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation
The concentrations of 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene and n-butane over step-impregnated catalysts are displayed in
Fig. 3
. Reactants and products were normalized by dividing by the initial concentration of 1,3-butadiene for each catalyst. Rate constants for 1,3-butadiene consumption are listed in
Table 5
and were determined assuming that 1,3-butadiene consumption was first-order. Rate constants were divided by CO uptake determined using CO chemisorption based on mass of catalyst and metal, as discussed in Section
3.4
. The increase in k/CO uptake on the basis of gram of catalyst from monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 to bimetallic 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3 is modest with an increase of 37%. The increase in activity with the bimetallic catalyst is more significant when dividing the hydrogenation rate constant by CO uptake on the basis of gram of metal. The rate per CO uptake using a metal basis increases by more than a factor of 2 from 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 to 1Pt3Ni(M)/γ-Al2O3. This enhanced rate of activity cannot be explained alone by the increase in amount of metal on the catalyst, as demonstrated in the decreased CO uptake with increasing metal loading. This suggests that although the amount of metal in the catalyst has increased, the rate of enhanced activity is primarily due to bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ni atoms. This increase in activity is explained by the presence of bimetallic bonds, as confirmed using EXAFS.

[4]
.
The CO uptake and rate of 1,3-butadiene consumption over 1Pt3Ni(co-M)/γ-Al2O3 is an order of magnitude lower than 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, with a rate constant of 0.10 × 102 min1 and CO uptake of 304 μmol/g metal. This decreased activity is consistent with low CO uptake and weak X-ray absorption in EXAFS measurements. The low Pt content determined using elemental analysis is congruent with these trends and confirms that little Pt was incorporated onto the support during co-impregnation using reverse micelle synthesis.
4. Conclusions
In order to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts, controlled and reproducible synthesis of particles with a narrow particle size distribution is essential. This paper investigated a core-shell step-impregnation nanoparticle synthesis method by using reverse micelles to synthesize uniform, reduced Ni nanoparticles, supporting them on γ-Al2O3, and then depositing Pt using incipient wetness impregnation. HAADF images collected using TEM showed that nanoparticle size was small (roughly 2 nm) and uniform before supporting and after high-temperature cleaning treatments in O2 and H2. AAS confirms that the majority of Ni is adsorbed onto the support, but the amount of Pt deposition during reverse micelle synthesis is limited. EXAFS measurements confirmed the PtNi bimetallic bond formation in the step-impregnated catalyst, which explained enhanced activity for low-temperature 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. Overall, our synthesis and characterization results demonstrate the feasibility of using reverse micelle synthesis to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with narrow size distributions and with enhanced hydrogenation activity. More systematic evaluation of different synthesis conditions will be needed to optimize the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and to further improve the catalytic activity.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
