[1] "To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures."

[2] "In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."

[3] "Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms."

[4] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS monitors the segregation by detecting the onset of characteristic NiO and CoO vibrational modes after oxygen exposure. This confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms to the surface.

AES quantifies the segregation kinetics by measuring the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt. An increase in these ratios with increasing oxygen exposure indicates the segregation of subsurface atoms to the surface.

The measured activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation are 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. These values align with DFT predictions, which suggest that Ni should have a higher activation barrier due to its smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co.

Overall, the experimental measurements using HREELS and AES show good agreement with DFT predictions for the oxygen-induced segregation behavior of these Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

HREELS和AES技术被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS通过检测氧气暴露后特征NiO和CoO振动模式的出现来监测偏析。这证实了亚表面Ni和Co原子向表面的偏析。

AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来量化偏析动力学。这些比率随氧气暴露量的增加而增加，表明亚表面原子向表面偏析。

测得的氧诱导偏析活化能为Co为7 ± 1 kcal/mol，Ni为15 ± 2 kcal/mol。这些数值与DFT预测一致，DFT预测表明Ni由于偏析驱动力较小，应该具有较高的活化能障。

总的来说，使用HREELS和AES的实验测量结果与DFT对这些Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的氧诱导偏析行为的预测显示了良好的一致性。
