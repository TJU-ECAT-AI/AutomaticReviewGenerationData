[1] "To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures."

[2] "In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."

[3] "Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms."

[4] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems:

1. HREELS monitors the segregation by detecting the onset of characteristic NiO and CoO vibrational modes after oxygen exposure.

2. AES quantifies the segregation kinetics by measuring the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt, which increase with oxygen exposure, confirming the segregation of subsurface atoms.

3. The activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation are estimated using Arrhenius analysis of AES data: 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni.

4. These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which suggest that Ni has a smaller driving potential for segregation and thus a higher activation barrier compared to Co.

The experimental measurements confirm the DFT-predicted trend and provide quantitative values for the activation barriers, demonstrating good agreement between theory and experiment for these Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

HREELS和AES被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析：

1. HREELS通过检测氧暴露后特征NiO和CoO振动模式的出现来监测偏析。

2. AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来量化偏析动力学，这些比值随着氧暴露的增加而增加，证实了亚表面原子的偏析。

3. 使用AES数据的阿伦尼乌斯分析估算氧诱导偏析的活化能：Co为7 ± 1 kcal/mol，Ni为15 ± 2 kcal/mol。

4. 这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，后者表明Ni的偏析驱动势较小，因此具有较高的活化能障。

实验测量证实了DFT预测的趋势，并提供了活化能障的定量值，显示了理论和实验在这些Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统上的良好一致性。
