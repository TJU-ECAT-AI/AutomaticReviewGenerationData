[1] "To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures."

[2] "In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."

[3] "Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms."

[4] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems as follows:

1. HREELS monitors the segregation by detecting the onset of characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes after oxygen exposure at different temperatures.

2. AES quantifies segregation kinetics by measuring the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt, which increase with oxygen exposure, confirming the segregation of subsurface atoms.

3. The activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation are estimated using Arrhenius equation analysis of AES data: 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni.

These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which suggest that Ni should have a higher activation barrier for segregation compared to Co due to its smaller driving potential. The combination of experimental techniques and theoretical predictions provides a comprehensive understanding of the segregation process in these bimetallic systems.

HREELS和AES技术用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子（Ni和Co）的氧诱导表面偏析，具体如下：

1. HREELS通过在不同温度下暴露于氧气后检测特征ν(NiO)和ν(CoO)振动模式的出现来监测偏析。

2. AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来量化偏析动力学，这些比值随氧气暴露增加而增加，证实了亚表面原子的偏析。

3. 利用阿伦尼乌斯方程分析AES数据，估算出氧诱导偏析的活化能：Co为7 ± 1 kcal/mol，Ni为15 ± 2 kcal/mol。

这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，后者表明由于Ni的驱动势较小，其偏析的活化能应该比Co高。实验技术和理论预测的结合为理解这些双金属系统中的偏析过程提供了全面的认识。
