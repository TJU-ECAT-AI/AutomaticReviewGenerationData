[1] "To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures."

[2] "In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."

[3] "Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms."

[4] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS monitors the segregation by detecting the characteristic vibrational modes of NiO and CoO, which confirm the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co when exposed to oxygen at different temperatures.

AES quantifies the segregation kinetics by measuring the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt. The increase in these ratios with higher oxygen exposures confirms the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface atoms.

The activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation, determined using an Arrhenius equation analysis of the AES data, are estimated to be 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which suggest that Ni should have a higher activation barrier due to its smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co.

HREELS和AES被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS通过检测NiO和CoO的特征振动模式来监测偏析，这些模式证实了亚表面Ni和Co在不同温度下暴露于氧气时的偏析。

AES通过测量Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的强度比来量化偏析动力学。这些比率随着氧气暴露量的增加而增加，证实了亚表面原子的氧诱导偏析。

使用阿伦尼乌斯方程分析AES数据，得出氧诱导偏析的活化能估计值：Co为7 ± 1 kcal/mol，Ni为15 ± 2 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，DFT预测表明Ni由于其较小的偏析驱动势而应具有较高的活化能障。
