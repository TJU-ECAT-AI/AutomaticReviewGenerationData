The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation, segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions for these specific systems. The literature focuses on DFT calculations of binding energies and reaction pathways for C2 hydrocarbons on various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, but does not cover the specific topic asked about in the question.

给定的文献中没有任何关于使用HREELS和AES等实验技术来验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的信息。该文档没有讨论氧诱导的偏析、偏析动力学、活化能障或这些特定系统的实验测量与DFT预测之间的比较。该文献主要集中在各种单金属和双金属表面上C2烃的结合能和反应路径的DFT计算，但没有涉及问题中询问的具体主题。
