The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, or comparisons between measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers with DFT predictions for these systems. The document appears to focus on ammonia decomposition activity on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces, but does not provide details relevant to answering the specific question posed.

给定的文献中没有关于HREELS和AES等实验技术、Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子(特别是Ni和Co)的氧诱导表面偏析、或者这些系统的测量偏析动力学和活化能障与DFT预测的比较等信息。该文档似乎主要关注Fe-Pt、Co-Pt和Cu-Pt双金属表面上的氨分解活性，但没有提供与所提出的具体问题相关的详细信息。
