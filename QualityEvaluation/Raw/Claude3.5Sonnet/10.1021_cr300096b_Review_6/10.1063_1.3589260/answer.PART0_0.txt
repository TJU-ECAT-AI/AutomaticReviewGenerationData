The given scientific literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document also does not discuss segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for these systems. The content appears to focus on ammonia decomposition on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is not directly related to the question asked.

给出的科学文献中没有包含关于HREELS和AES等实验技术验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析的信息。文档也没有讨论这些系统的偏析动力学、活化能垒或DFT预测。内容似乎主要集中在Fe-Pt、Co-Pt和Cu-Pt双金属表面上的氨分解，这与所问的问题没有直接关系。
