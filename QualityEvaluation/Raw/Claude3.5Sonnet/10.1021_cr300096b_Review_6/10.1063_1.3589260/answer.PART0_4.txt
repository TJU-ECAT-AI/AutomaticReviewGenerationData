The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES for verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. There is also no mention of segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for these specific systems. The document appears to focus on ammonia decomposition on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces, but does not provide details relevant to the asked question.
