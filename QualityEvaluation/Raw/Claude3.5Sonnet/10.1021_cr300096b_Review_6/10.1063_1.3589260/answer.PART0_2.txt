<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES, or about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document appears to focus on ammonia decomposition on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces, but does not discuss the specific topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

提供的文献中没有关于HREELS和AES等实验技术的信息,也没有涉及Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的内容。该文档似乎主要讨论了Fe-Pt、Co-Pt和Cu-Pt双金属表面上的氨分解,但没有讨论问题中提到的具体主题。因此,无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。
