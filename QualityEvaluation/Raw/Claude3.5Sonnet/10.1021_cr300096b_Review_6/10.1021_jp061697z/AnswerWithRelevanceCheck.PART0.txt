          [1] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[2] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "Through the use of the best log fit equations to derive an approximate time required to reach 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature, an ln 1/t1/2 vs reciprocal temperature plot is generated in Figure 7b. On the basis of the best fit linear equation for data points between 400 and 475 K, the Ea for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15  2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."

[5] "DFT results in Figure 1 are consistent with this argument, as indicated by the weaker metalO binding energy on PtCoPt than that on Pt. At the same time, the DFT results in Figure 1 also indicate that the binding energy of atomic oxygen is significantly higher on the CoPtPt surface than on Pt."

[6] "The DFT results indicate that, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable. The stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface, 3dPtPt, leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."

[7] "DFT results in Figure 3 suggest that the activation barrier for the segregation of other subsurface 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than that for Co or Ni."

          HREELS and AES techniques were used to experimentally verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

HREELS was employed to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni or Co to the surface. The appearance of specific ν(NiO) or ν(CoO) modes in the HREEL spectra signaled the presence of these metals on the surface.

AES measurements tracked the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios over time under oxygen exposure at different temperatures. This allowed for the estimation of activation barriers for the segregation process.

The experimentally determined activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation (in the 400-475 K range) and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation (in the 300-350 K range). These values quantify the kinetics of the segregation process.

The experimental results generally aligned with DFT predictions. DFT calculations showed that:
1. The 3dPtPt surface structures were more stable than Pt3dPt structures in the presence of oxygen, consistent with the observed segregation.
2. Oxygen binding was stronger on 3dPtPt surfaces compared to Pt, which agrees with the experimental observation of segregation driven by oxygen adsorption.
3. The activation barriers for other 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) were predicted to be even lower than those for Co or Ni.

The lower activation barrier for Co segregation compared to Ni matches the DFT-predicted trend of easier segregation for earlier 3d transition metals.

However, the experiments revealed some nuances not captured by DFT, such as the coexistence of outward segregation and inward diffusion processes, particularly for Co. This highlights the complementary nature of experimental and theoretical approaches in understanding these complex systems.

          HREELS和AES技术被用来实验性地验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面Ni和Co原子的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS被用来识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这表明了Ni或Co向表面的偏析。HREEL谱图中特定ν(NiO)或ν(CoO)模式的出现表明这些金属存在于表面。

AES测量在不同温度下追踪了氧暴露时间内表面Ni/Pt或Co/Pt比率的增加。这允许估算偏析过程的活化能。

实验测定的活化能为Ni偏析（在400-475 K范围内）15 ± 2 kcal/mol，Co偏析（在300-350 K范围内）7 ± 1 kcal/mol。这些值量化了偏析过程的动力学。

实验结果总体上与DFT预测一致。DFT计算表明：
1. 在氧存在的情况下，3dPtPt表面结构比Pt3dPt结构更稳定，这与观察到的偏析现象一致。
2. 3dPtPt表面与Pt相比对氧的结合更强，这与实验观察到的由氧吸附驱动的偏析现象相一致。
3. 预测其他3d金属（Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Fe）的活化能障甚至比Co或Ni更低。

Co偏析的活化能障比Ni低，这符合DFT预测的前期3d过渡金属更容易偏析的趋势。

然而，实验揭示了DFT未能捕捉到的一些细微差别，如向外偏析和向内扩散过程的共存，特别是对于Co。这突出了实验和理论方法在理解这些复杂系统时的互补性。
