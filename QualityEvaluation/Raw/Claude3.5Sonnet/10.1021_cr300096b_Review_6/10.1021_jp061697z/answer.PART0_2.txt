[1] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[2] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "Through the use of the best log fit equations to derive an approximate time required to reach 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature, an ln 1/t1/2 vs reciprocal temperature plot is generated in Figure 7b. On the basis of the best fit linear equation for data points between 400 and 475 K, the Ea for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15  2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."

[5] "DFT results in Figure 1 are consistent with this argument, as indicated by the weaker metalO binding energy on PtCoPt than that on Pt. At the same time, the DFT results in Figure 1 also indicate that the binding energy of atomic oxygen is significantly higher on the CoPtPt surface than on Pt."

HREELS and AES techniques were used to experimentally verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS was employed to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) to the surface. The appearance of specific ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) modes in the spectra at certain temperatures signaled the onset of segregation.

AES measurements tracked the increase in surface Ni/Pt and Co/Pt ratios over time at various temperatures. This allowed for the estimation of activation barriers (Ea) for the transformation of PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) to CoPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen.

The experimentally determined activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation (in the 400-475 K range) and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation (in the 300-350 K range). These values quantify the kinetics of the segregation process.

The experimental results were generally consistent with DFT predictions. DFT calculations showed weaker metal-O binding energy on PtCoPt than on Pt, but higher binding energy on CoPtPt than on Pt. This aligns with the experimental observation of subsurface Co segregation to the surface in the presence of oxygen. The lower activation barrier for Co segregation compared to Ni also matches the DFT-predicted trend of easier segregation for earlier 3d transition metals.

HREELS和AES技术被用于实验验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面Ni和Co原子在氧气存在下的表面偏析。

HREELS用于识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这表明了Ni从PtNiPt(111)向表面偏析。在特定温度下谱图中ν(NiO)和ν(CoO)模式的出现标志着偏析的开始。

AES测量在不同温度下追踪表面Ni/Pt和Co/Pt比率随时间的增加。这允许估算在氧气存在下PtNiPt(111)转变为NiPtPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)转变为CoPtPt(111)的活化能障(Ea)。

实验测定的活化能障为：Ni偏析(在400-475 K范围内)为15 ± 2 kcal/mol，Co偏析(在300-350 K范围内)为7 ± 1 kcal/mol。这些值量化了偏析过程的动力学。

实验结果总体上与DFT预测一致。DFT计算显示PtCoPt上的金属-O结合能比Pt上的弱，但CoPtPt上的结合能比Pt上的高。这与实验观察到的亚表面Co在氧气存在下向表面偏析的现象一致。Co偏析的活化能障比Ni低，这也符合DFT预测的前期3d过渡金属更容易偏析的趋势。
