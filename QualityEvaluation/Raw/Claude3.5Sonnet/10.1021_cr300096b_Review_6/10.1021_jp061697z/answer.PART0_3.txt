[1] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[2] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "Through the use of the best log fit equations to derive an approximate time required to reach 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature, an ln 1/t1/2 vs reciprocal temperature plot is generated in Figure 7b. On the basis of the best fit linear equation for data points between 400 and 475 K, the Ea for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15  2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."

[5] "DFT results in Figure 3 suggest that the activation barrier for the segregation of other subsurface 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than that for Co or Ni."

HREELS and AES were used to experimentally verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS was used to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni or Co to the surface. AES measurements determined the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios over time at different temperatures, allowing the estimation of activation barriers for segregation.

The experimentally measured activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation. These values are consistent with DFT predictions, which suggested that the activation barriers for other 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than those for Co or Ni.

The experimental results quantified the kinetics and energetics of the segregation process, providing valuable data to compare with and validate the DFT predictions. The agreement between experiment and theory supports the overall conclusion that subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems tend to segregate to the surface in the presence of oxygen, with varying degrees of ease depending on the specific 3d metal.

HREELS和AES被用来实验性地验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面Ni和Co原子的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS用于识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这表明了Ni或Co向表面的偏析。AES测量确定了在不同温度下表面Ni/Pt或Co/Pt比率随时间的增加，从而估算出偏析的活化能。

实验测得的活化能为Ni偏析为15 ± 2 kcal/mol，Co偏析为7 ± 1 kcal/mol。这些值与DFT预测一致，DFT预测表明其他3d金属（Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Fe）的活化能应该比Co或Ni更低。

实验结果量化了偏析过程的动力学和能量学，提供了valuable的数据来比较和验证DFT预测。实验和理论之间的一致性支持了总体结论，即在氧气存在的情况下，Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中的亚表面3d原子倾向于偏析到表面，不同的3d金属具有不同程度的容易性。
