[1] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[2] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "Through the use of the best log fit equations to derive an approximate time required to reach 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature, an ln 1/t1/2 vs reciprocal temperature plot is generated in Figure 7b. On the basis of the best fit linear equation for data points between 400 and 475 K, the Ea for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15  2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."

[5] "DFT results in Figure 1 are consistent with this argument, as indicated by the weaker metalO binding energy on PtCoPt than that on Pt. At the same time, the DFT results in Figure 1 also indicate that the binding energy of atomic oxygen is significantly higher on the CoPtPt surface than on Pt."

HREELS and AES techniques were used to experimentally verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS was used to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni or Co to the surface. AES measurements tracked the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios over time at different temperatures, allowing estimation of activation barriers for segregation.

The experimentally determined activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation. These values quantify the kinetics of the segregation process.

The experimental results were consistent with DFT predictions. DFT calculations showed weaker metal-oxygen binding on PtCoPt compared to Pt, but stronger binding on CoPtPt than Pt. This trend supports the observed segregation behavior, as stronger oxygen binding provides a driving force for 3d metal segregation to the surface.

Overall, the experimental techniques provided quantitative measurements of segregation kinetics and activation barriers that aligned with qualitative DFT predictions of relative surface stabilities and oxygen binding strengths for different surface configurations.

HREELS和AES技术被用来实验性地验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面Ni和Co原子的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS被用来识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这表明了Ni或Co向表面的偏析。AES测量在不同温度下随时间跟踪表面Ni/Pt或Co/Pt比率的增加，从而估算偏析的活化能障。

实验确定的活化能障为Ni偏析的15 ± 2 kcal/mol和Co偏析的7 ± 1 kcal/mol。这些值量化了偏析过程的动力学。

实验结果与DFT预测一致。DFT计算显示PtCoPt上的金属-氧结合比Pt弱，但CoPtPt上的结合比Pt强。这种趋势支持观察到的偏析行为，因为更强的氧结合为3d金属向表面偏析提供了驱动力。

总的来说，实验技术提供了偏析动力学和活化能障的定量测量，这与DFT对不同表面构型的相对表面稳定性和氧结合强度的定性预测相一致。
