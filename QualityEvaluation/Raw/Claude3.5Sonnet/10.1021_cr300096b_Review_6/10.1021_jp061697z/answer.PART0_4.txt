[1] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[2] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[3] "Through the use of the best log fit equations to derive an approximate time required to reach 0.5, or t1/2, for each temperature, an ln 1/t1/2 vs reciprocal temperature plot is generated in Figure 7b. On the basis of the best fit linear equation for data points between 400 and 475 K, the Ea for the segregation of subsurface Ni is estimated to be 15  2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K."

[5] "The DFT results indicate that, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable. The stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface, 3dPtPt, leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."

HREELS and AES techniques were used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. 

HREELS was used to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) to the surface. 

AES measurements determined the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios over time at different temperatures, allowing for the estimation of activation barriers for segregation.

The experimentally determined activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation (400-475 K) and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation (300-350 K).

These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which indicated that the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is thermodynamically unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The DFT calculations predicted a driving force for segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to form the more stable 3dPtPt surface structure.

The lower activation barrier for Co segregation compared to Ni is consistent with the DFT trend suggesting easier segregation for earlier 3d transition metals.

HREELS和AES技术被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中次表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。

HREELS用于识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这表明了Ni从PtNiPt(111)向表面的偏析。

AES测量确定了在不同温度下表面Ni/Pt或Co/Pt比率随时间的增加，从而估算出偏析的活化能障。

实验确定的活化能障为：Ni偏析（400-475 K）为15 ± 2 kcal/mol，Co偏析（300-350 K）为7 ± 1 kcal/mol。

这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，DFT预测表明在吸附氧的存在下，Pt3dPt次表面结构在热力学上是不稳定的。DFT计算预测了次表面3d原子偏析形成更稳定的3dPtPt表面结构的驱动力。

与Ni相比，Co偏析的较低活化能障与DFT趋势一致，后者表明较早的3d过渡金属更容易发生偏析。
