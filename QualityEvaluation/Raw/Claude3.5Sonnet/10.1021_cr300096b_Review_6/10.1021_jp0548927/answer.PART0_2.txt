[1] "Recent experimental and DFT studies show that the surface monolayer is more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface monolayer in the presence of oxygen. For example, in the presence of 10-8 Torr of O2, subsurface Ni atoms start to diffuse on top of Pt(111) at 450 K, while the diffusion of Co in PtCoPt(111) occurs at temperatures as low as 350 K."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only briefly mentions that experimental studies have shown surface monolayers to be more stable in the presence of oxygen, giving examples of Ni and Co segregation temperatures. The document does not discuss segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions for these systems. More detailed experimental studies would be needed to fully answer this question.

文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中氧诱导表面偏析的详细信息。它只是简单提到实验研究表明,在氧气存在的情况下,表面单层更稳定,并给出了Ni和Co偏析温度的例子。文档没有讨论偏析动力学、活化能垒,或实验测量与这些系统DFT预测之间的比较。需要进行更详细的实验研究才能完整回答这个问题。
