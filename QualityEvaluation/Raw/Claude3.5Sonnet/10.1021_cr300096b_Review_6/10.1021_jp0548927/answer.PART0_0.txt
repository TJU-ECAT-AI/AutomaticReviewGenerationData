[1] "Recent experimental and DFT studies show that the surface monolayer is more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface monolayer in the presence of oxygen. For example, in the presence of 10-8 Torr of O2, subsurface Ni atoms start to diffuse on top of Pt(111) at 450 K, while the diffusion of Co in PtCoPt(111) occurs at temperatures as low as 350 K."

[2] "More direct measurements, such as careful EXAFS (extended X-ray adsorption fine structure) studies under in situ reaction conditions, would reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during reforming."

The document does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only mentions that experimental studies have shown surface monolayers are more stable in the presence of oxygen, giving an example of Ni and Co diffusion under specific conditions. The document suggests EXAFS as a more direct measurement technique for studying this phenomenon under reaction conditions, but does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers, nor does it compare these to DFT predictions. More detailed experimental studies would be needed to fully answer this question.

该文档没有提供关于如何使用HREELS和AES来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析的具体细节。它只提到实验研究表明在有氧存在的情况下表面单层更稳定，并给出了Ni和Co在特定条件下扩散的例子。文档建议使用EXAFS作为一种更直接的测量技术来研究反应条件下的这种现象，但没有提供关于测量的偏析动力学或激活能垒的信息，也没有将这些与DFT预测进行比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行更详细的实验研究。
