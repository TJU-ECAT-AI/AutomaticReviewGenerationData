[1] "Recent experimental and DFT studies show that the surface monolayer is more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface monolayer in the presence of oxygen. For example, in the presence of 10-8 Torr of O2, subsurface Ni atoms start to diffuse on top of Pt(111) at 450 K, while the diffusion of Co in PtCoPt(111) occurs at temperatures as low as 350 K."

The literature does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only mentions that experimental studies have shown surface monolayers are more stable in the presence of oxygen. The text provides examples of segregation temperatures for Ni and Co atoms, but does not discuss kinetics or activation barriers in detail. There is insufficient information to make a comparison between experimental measurements and DFT predictions for these systems.

文献中没有提供关于如何使用HREELS和AES来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中氧诱导表面偏析的具体细节。它只提到实验研究表明,在氧气存在的情况下,表面单层更稳定。文本提供了Ni和Co原子偏析温度的例子,但没有详细讨论动力学或活化能垒。没有足够的信息来比较这些系统的实验测量结果和DFT预测。
