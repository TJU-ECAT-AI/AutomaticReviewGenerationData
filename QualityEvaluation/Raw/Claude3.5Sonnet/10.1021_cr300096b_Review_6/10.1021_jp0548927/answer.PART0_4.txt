[1] "Recent experimental and DFT studies show that the surface monolayer is more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface monolayer in the presence of oxygen. For example, in the presence of 10-8 Torr of O2, subsurface Ni atoms start to diffuse on top of Pt(111) at 450 K, while the diffusion of Co in PtCoPt(111) occurs at temperatures as low as 350 K."

The document does not provide specific details on how HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It only mentions that experimental studies show surface monolayers are more stable in the presence of oxygen, without specifying the techniques used. The document provides some information on segregation kinetics, noting that Ni atoms diffuse to the surface at 450 K and Co atoms at 350 K in the presence of oxygen, but does not compare these to DFT predictions or discuss activation barriers. More detailed experimental studies would be needed to fully answer the question.

该文档没有提供关于如何使用HREELS和AES来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析的具体细节。它仅提到实验研究表明表面单层在氧存在的情况下更稳定，但没有指明所使用的技术。文档提供了一些关于偏析动力学的信息，指出在氧存在的情况下，Ni原子在450 K时扩散到表面，Co原子在350 K时扩散到表面，但没有将这些与DFT预测进行比较或讨论活化能垒。需要更详细的实验研究才能完整回答这个问题。
