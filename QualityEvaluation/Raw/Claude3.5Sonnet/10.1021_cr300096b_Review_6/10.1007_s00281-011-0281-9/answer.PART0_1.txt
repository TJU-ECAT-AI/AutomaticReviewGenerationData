<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information related to HREELS, AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, or DFT predictions for these systems. The text appears to be about thrombin, protease-activated receptors, and inflammation, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献不包含任何与HREELS、AES、Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析,或这些系统的DFT预测相关的信息。该文本似乎是关于凝血酶、蛋白酶激活受体和炎症的,与所问的问题无关。因此,无法根据所提供的文档回答这个问题。
