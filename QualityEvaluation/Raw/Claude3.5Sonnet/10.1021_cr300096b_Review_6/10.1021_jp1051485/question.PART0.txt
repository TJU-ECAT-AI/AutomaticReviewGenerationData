Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) adsorption was studied on two ordered surface alloys: (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) with θSn = 0.25 ML, and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) with θSn = 0.33 ML. Nearly all EO desorbs molecularly during TPD in peaks at 198 K for the (2 × 2) alloy and 190 K for the (3 × 3)R30 alloy, corresponding to desorption activation energies of 12.1 and 11.6 kcal/mol, respectively. HREELS and UPS show that EO adsorbs molecularly even at low coverage through the oxygen atom with the molecular plane tilted away from the surface normal. DFT calculations provide details for the adsorption geometry: EO adsorbs without ring breaking, with oxygen bonding to Sn at a bond distance of 2.72.8 Å and a COSn bond angle of 120. XPS indicates that the EO saturation coverage is not affected by the presence of Sn in the alloys and remains the same as for pure Pt(111) at 0.25 ML. A small amount (12%) of EO decomposition occurs during TPD for both alloy surfaces, and DFT calculations suggest that EO transforms into a more stable metallacycle configuration with oxygen bonding to Sn prior to decomposition.

1 Introduction
Ethylene oxide (C2H4O, EO) is a commodity chemical that is widely used in the manufacturing of numerous and diverse products, e.g., surfactants, coolants, and sterilization solutions. EO is a cyclic molecule that is most commonly produced currently via direct gas-phase catalytic epoxidation of ethylene over supported Ag catalysts promoted with an alkali metal. (1, 2) This catalytic chemistry, as a result, has been the subject of multiple studies on the reaction mechanism and the reasons for the activity and high selectivity of Ag in contrast to other metals that catalyze mostly complete oxidation (burning) of ethylene. (3-11) Understanding of EO adsorption and stability on metal surfaces is critical for gaining fundamental insight into the mechanism of selective epoxidation and, consequently, for optimization of existing and development of improved catalytic systems.
Studies of EO adsorption on a Ag(111) single crystal surface using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) showed that after dosing at 140 K, EO desorbs without any decomposition mainly in a single peak at about 200 K. The adsorption mode was assigned based on a combination of high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to molecular EO weakly bound to the surface through the oxygen atom. (12) A small fraction of EO, however, was observed to desorb at about 300 K. Additional experiments for adsorption of EO at higher temperatures and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) allowed the assignment of this more stable adsorption mode to a metallacycle where EO opens the ring and bonds to the surface as AgOCH2CH2Ag. (12, 13) Transformation of molecularly bound EO to a metallacycle is kinetically limited due to the activation energy required for breaking the ring, but this breaking is more than energetically compensated by the formation of additional bonds with the surface. Adsorption of EO in the form of a metallacycle on pure and oxygen-covered Ag surfaces has been confirmed with multiple techniques, and this species is believed to be an intermediate in ethylene epoxidation that forms on addition of atomic oxygen to ethylene on the surface. (14-16)
Similarly to low-temperature adsorption on Ag, EO is reported to adsorb weakly and molecularly on Cu(110), (6, 7, 10) Fe(100), (10) Ni(110) (17) and Ni(111), (10) with no decomposition upon heating under UHV conditions. EO was also found to be adsorbed reversibly on an oxygen-precovered Cu(110) surface. (6, 7) However, the presence of oxygen on Cu(110) reduced the desorption energy of EO, which is opposite to its effect on Ag(110). (3, 11) Oxygen preadsorption also induced the molecular axis of EO on a O(2× 1)/Cu(110) surface to be tilted away from the surface normal. (6) On Ni(111) precovered with potassium at θK > 0.36 ML, adsorbed EO was found to undergo ring-opening to form a species stable up to 450 K, where it started to decompose into H2 and small molecular fragments. (18) Acetaldehyde was suggested as a possible intermediate based on HREELS results. (19)
TPD of EO adsorbed on Mo(111), in contrast, leads to decomposition of about 70% of the adlayer with the formation of surface oxygen and gas-phase ethylene at 200 K during TPD. (20) On Rh(111), EO was found to be partially reversibly adsorbed and to undergo both molecular desorption and irreversible decomposition to produce CO, H2, and a carbon residue. (21) Chemisorbed EO on Pd(111) at monolayer coverage decomposed at 180 K into ethylene and acetaldehyde, which desorbed and were detected in TPD. (22) Similarly to formation of EO from ethylene, the decomposition of EO was proposed to proceed through a metallacycle intermediate. That is, the strongly bound metallacycle MeOCH2CH2Me (where Me denotes a metal site) can either (a) desorb from the surface as EO, (b) rearrange and desorb as acetaldehyde CH3CHO, or (c) decompose to other products. Other studies, however, were not able to detect acetaldehyde as a stable intermediate in EO decomposition on Pd(110). (23, 24)
EO on Pt(111) was reported initially to have a small desorption energy (decreasing slightly with coverage from 11.9 to 10.0 kcal/mol), which is comparable to Ag(111), but with a higher reactivity. (8) Decomposition reactions were reported to be predominant over molecular desorption at low coverages, evolving H2 and CO into the gas phase and leaving adsorbed carbon as the residual decomposition product. Our reinvestigation of this chemistry, however, has shown that EO has only a minor decomposition channel (<0.015 ML) on Pt(111) and evolves at 158207 K with a desorption energy of 9.3 to 12.8 kcal/mol. (25) EO adsorbed at low temperatures was similarly reported to be unreactive on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) with EO desorbing molecularly at 140230 K and undergoing only minor decomposition (0.02 ML). (26)
Given the importance of promoters in industrial Ag catalytic systems and the search for improved bimetallic catalysts for selective oxidation, the current study extends the fundamental studies of EO adsorption, stability, and desorption behavior from Pt(111) to Sn/Pt(111) alloys. Addition of Sn to Pt is known to suppress hydrogenolysis in reforming reactions (27, 28) and to have utility for selective oxidation, (29-31) oxidative dehydrogenation, (32) and hydrodeoxygenation reactions, among others.
EO adsorption and stability were evaluated on two ordered PtSn bimetallic surfaces, i.e., the (2 × 2) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, with θSn = 0.25 and 0.33 ML, respectively. These alloys were prepared by vapor deposition of Sn on a Pt(111) single crystal substrate by controlling the amount of deposited Sn and the annealing time and temperature. The structure of these surfaces has been characterized by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low energy ion scattering (LEIS) using both inert gases (33) and alkali metal ions (33, 34) and also by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). (35) In addition, chemisorption of a number of small molecules on these two surface alloys has been studied, including H2, O2, and CO. (36) CO adsorbs slightly more weakly on these alloys than on Pt(111). H2 and O2 dissociative adsorption does not occur on these alloys at 100600 K under UHV conditions. Water (H2O), methanol (CH3OH), and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) adsorb reversibly on both alloys, slightly more weakly than on Pt(111), and the desorption energies of methanol and ethanol decrease progressively as the Sn concentration increases. (37) Other studies have found reversible adsorption and desorption of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) on these Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys under UHV conditions. (38)
2 Experimental and Computational Methods
Experiments were conducted in a three-level ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr, as previously described. (39) A double-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) was used for AES, a UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD, and an LK2000 spectrometer was used for HREELS.
The Pt(111) crystal was mounted on two Ta rods that were imbedded in liquid-nitrogen-cooled copper blocks at the bottom of a differentially pumped XYZ-manipulator. The temperature was measured by a chromel-alumel thermocouple spot-welded at the side of the crystal. The sample could be cooled to 90 K or resistively heated to 1200 K. The Pt(111) sample was cleaned by a standard combination of Ar+-ion sputtering at 5 × 105 Torr, O2 treatment (PO2 = 5 × 108 Torr for 5 min) at 850 K and annealing in vacuum at 1200 K. Sample cleanliness was checked with AES, and LEED was used to ensure a well-ordered surface.
The (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was prepared by evaporating 0.7-ML Sn onto the Pt(111) surface and subsequently annealing to 1000 K for 10 s. The (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was prepared by evaporating 1.0-ML Sn on the Pt(111) surface and annealing to 850 K for 10 s. Formation of the correct alloy structure and the long-range two-dimensional order of both surfaces was continuously checked by LEED. For brevity, we will refer to the (2 × 2) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys throughout the rest of this paper as the (2 × 2) and 3 alloys, respectively.
High-purity ethylene oxide (99.5+% purity; Aldrich Chemical Co.) was dosed onto the Pt(111) substrate via a glass microcapillary array doser connected to a leak valve. Exposure values are given in units of Langmuirs (L) as determined by the background gas pressure in the chamber during dosing, without any correction for ion gauge sensitivity. A doser enhancement factor of 20 was utilized in the EO exposures reported herein.
TPD data were collected using a linear heating rate of 3 K/s with the crystal in line-of-sight of the QMS ionizer. A stainless steel shield with an entrance aperture of 1 cm diameter covered the ionizer region of the QMS. The crystal was placed at a distance of 1 mm in front of the aperture for TPD experiments, and this effectively attenuated the background contribution to the TPD curves. In order to stop electrons emitted from the QMS ionizer region from impinging on the substrate during TPD measurements, two highly transparent stainless steel screens were used, one across the end of the ionizer grid (with a bias of 55 V) and the other across the shield aperture (at ground potential).
HREELS spectra were recorded in the specular direction at an angle of 60 from the surface normal and incident beam energy of 4.5 eV. The overall energy resolution of the spectrometer was about 7 meV (56 cm1), and counting rates in the elastic peak were about 100 kHz for clean Pt(111). All spectra reported were normalized to the intensity of the elastic peak.
A high-pressure discharge lamp was used to obtain He I (21.2 eV) and He II (40.8 eV) photons for UPS. These spectra were recorded with the CMA at 25 eV pass energy for a resolution of 0.40 eV.
Coverages, θi, reported in this paper are referenced to the surface atom density of Pt(111) such that θPt = 1.0 ML is defined as 1.505 × 1015 cm2.
Gradient-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the DMol3 code in Materials Studio 4.0 software by Accelrys Inc. Infinite slabs were constructed using two models: (1) a 3 × 3 × 4 unit cell with a total of 36 atoms for Pt(111) and for the 3 alloy and (2) a 4 × 4 × 4 unit cell with a total of 64 atoms for the (2 × 2) alloy. The surface models used are similar to those reported previously for studies of cyclohexanone adsorption on Pt(111) and PtSn alloys. (40) The (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy was constructed by substituting 4 out of 16 surface Pt atoms by Sn in the appropriate positions and, analogously, the 3 Sn/Pt(111) alloy was constructed by substituting 3 out of 9 surface Pt atoms. The optimized Pt lattice constant of 4.0278 Å was used to generate the surface from the bulk crystal with a vacuum spacing between the slabs of 30 Å. All surface layers were optimized with EO during geometry optimizations, simulating surface relaxation upon adsorption. Adsorption energies were calculated at 0 K without zero-energy corrections using as a reference the sum of energies for the appropriate clean surface and EO calculated separately. Frequency calculations were performed with a partial Hessian for the adsorbed EO. The calculations used the double numerical with polarization (DNP) basis set and the generalized gradient-corrected revised PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (GGA RPBE) functional. (41) Tightly bound core electrons were represented with semicore pseudopotentials. Reciprocal-space integration over the Brillouin zone was approximated through k-point sampling with a separation of 0.05 1/Å using the Monkhorst-Pack grid: (3 × 3 × 1). Convergence with respect to the number of k-points was tested by decreasing the k-point separation distance to 0.04 1/Å for representative structures. The density mixing of 0.1 with DIIS and orbital occupancy with smearing of 0.005 Ha were used. The orbital cutoff distance was set at 4.3 Å for all atoms.
3 Results
3.1 Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD)
After exposure of the surface to EO at 90 K, signals from the QMS for the parent molecular ion (m/e = 44) as well as possible cracking fragments or reaction products at m/e = 2, 16, 18, 28, 29 were recorded simultaneously while heating the sample. A series of TPD spectra as a function of increasing EO exposures on the (2 × 2) alloy is shown in Figure 1a for the signal at m/e = 29, which has the largest intensity for fragment ions of EO in the QMS. After small EO exposures, a single EO desorption peak at 198 K was observed. This peak grew and shifted to lower temperature with increasing exposure, possibly due to repulsive interactions between the adsorbed molecules, and finally saturated after the exposure of 3.0-L. Following larger doses, a new low-temperature peak grew in intensity near 120 K due to desorption from physisorbed EO adsorbed on top of the monolayer. The activation energy for desorption, Edes, of EO bonded in the first layer was estimated to be 12.19.7 kcal/mol, depending on coverage, using the position of the TPD peak maximum based on the Redhead analysis (42) by assuming a typical preexponential factor of 1013 s1 and first-order desorption kinetics.

Figure 1b provides a comparison of the TPD trace at m/e = 29 for one of the exposures in Figure 1a (2.0-L EO) to those from masses 44 (parent EO), 28 (CO and also ethylene), and 2 (H2). The similarities of the traces at m/e = 29, 44, and 28 with the main desorption peak at 160 K indicate that most EO desorbs molecularly below 210 K. The high-temperature desorption peak at 385 K for the m/e = 28 trace can be assigned to CO desorption from a small amount of decomposition, or coadsorbed CO from the background. This corresponds to θCO = 0.006 ML, as determined by a calibration with a CO TPD curve obtained from a saturation CO coverage on clean Pt(111). (36) The peak for m/e = 28 at 273 K is unlikely to be from CO since CO desorbs from the (2 × 2) alloy at temperatures above 300 K. (36) After examination of the corresponding QMS signals at m/e = 26 and 27 (not shown), this peak can be assigned to desorption of ethylene that forms from decomposition of strongly adsorbed EO in a metallacycle configuration (as discussed below). The area of this peak corresponds to desorption of 0.005 ML of ethylene, based on an ethylene TPD calibration area obtained after a 5-L C2H4 exposure on Pt(111) at 100 K. (43) The area of the 273 K peak grows with increasing EO exposures and nearly saturates after a 2-L EO dose. Since the area of the peak at 273 K is small even at saturation, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that this peak is due to spurious ethylene. A similar peak does not appear on the 3 alloy (shown below). A desorption peak at 233 K for m/e = 28 was observed on Au(211), (44) which also may arise from ethylene desorption, since CO desorbs from the Au(211) surface below 200 K. (45) Only a small H2 desorption feature was observed in addition to the peak at 160 K that corresponds to a cracking fragment of molecular EO. The amount of H2 desorption at higher temperatures (above 350 K) was estimated to be θH = 0.009 ML based on the calibration of H2 evolution after dosing 100-L H2 on Pt(111) at 100 K, which produced a saturation hydrogen monolayer. (36) This small amount of H2 desorption, similarly to the CO desorption peak at 385 K, can be attributed to decomposition of hydrocarbon fragments left after breaking of the EO metallacycle at 273 K. Adsorption of spurious hydrogen can be ruled out because H2 does not adsorb dissociatively on PtSn surfaces under UHV conditions. (36)
A series of EO TPD spectra obtained after increasing EO exposures on the 3 alloy is shown in Figure 2a. Similarly to adsorption on the (2 × 2) alloy, a single EO desorption peak at low coverages was observed at 190 K. This peak grew and shifted to lower temperatures with increasing exposures, saturating in size with a peak temperature of 160 K after an exposure of 3.0-L. An additional peak appeared at 120 K due to desorption from a second layer of physisorbed EO molecules. Values of Edes are estimated to be 11.69.7 kcal/mol with increasing coverage in the monolayer.

Similar to Figure 1b for the (2 × 2) alloy, Figure 2b provides TPD spectra for several masses after dosing 2.0-L EO on the 3 surface alloy at 90 K. As for the (2 × 2) alloy, the results show that EO desorbs molecularly below 210 K with minimal decomposition. There is no desorption at 273 K for m/e = 28, and the peak at 364 K assigned to CO desorption decreased in area to θCO = 0.002 ML. Similarly, the area of the H2 desorption signal decreased to θH = 0.005 ML.
3.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
In related earlier work, (25) we used XPS to measure the monolayer coverage of EO on a Pt(111) surface by comparing the integrated area of the C (1s) peak in XPS obtained for an EO monolayer on Pt(111) to that obtained for an C2H4 monolayer on Pt(111) at 100 K. The results are shown in Figure 3. The monolayer of EO on Pt(111) was produced by dosing 5-L EO and annealing to 120 K to remove any EO multilayer. The monolayer coverage of ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) at 100 K is taken to be θC2H4 = 0.25 ML. (46) The equality of the C (1s) peak areas in XPS for the EO and ethylene monolayers on Pt(111) indicates that the EO saturation coverage is also 0.25 ML. Since the EO desorption peak areas were nearly the same for Pt(111) and the PtSn alloys, and since EO is essentially reversible adsorbed on all three surfaces, the value of 0.25 ML is also the monolayer coverage of EO on the PtSn alloys.

3.3 High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS)
Figure 4a shows HREELS spectra for the (2 × 2) alloy for increasing EO exposures from 0.2 to 10-L EO. An exposure of 10-L EO produces a condensed film with a thickness corresponding to 3.3 layers (2.3 layers on top of the chemisorbed monolayer), which was used to obtain a reference vibrational spectrum for molecular EO in the condensed phase. Prominent loss peaks were observed in this spectrum at 856, 1160, 1270, 1485, 2980, and 3070 cm1. The intense peak at 856 cm1 is due to the EO COC-ring deformation vibrational mode. This EO multilayer film is still affected by the metallic surface, and the peak at 856 cm1 is red-shifted by 10 cm1 from 866 cm1, which was observed for a thicker (17-layer) EO film on the Pt(111) surface. (25) Other loss peaks are assigned to vibrational modes from CH2 wagging (1160 cm1), COC-ring stretching (1270 cm1), CH2-scissor bending (1485 cm1), and CH2 stretching (2980 cm1 and 3070 cm1) based on visualization of vibrational modes obtained using a frequency analysis of the DFT models for molecularly adsorbed EO with the ring intact in Figure 6. The DFT calculated frequencies matched closely, mostly within 510 cm1, the positions of experimental peaks. The assignments are summarized in Table 1 and compared to IR data for gaseous and solid phases. (47, 48) Table 1 also provides a comparison with IR data for Au(211) (44) and HREELS data for Pt(111).

An exposure of 2.0-L forms a submonolayer coverage of 2/3 ML of molecular EO. At this lower coverage, the ring deformation peak shifts to 846 cm1 (Table 1). This red shift with decreasing lower coverage can be attributed to stronger binding of EO to the surface due to reduction of lateral repulsions from neighboring adsorbed EO molecules. Such a red shift of the ring deformation mode was also observed for EO on Pt(111), where the peak position was red-shifted by 24 cm1 from its value in thick multilayer EO films. (25) Red-shifts of 15 and 10 cm1 were also observed for the loss peaks from CH2 wagging (1160 cm1) and ring stretching (1270 cm1) modes, respectively, at submonolayer coverages. These peaks, however, were not shifted on the Pt(111) surface compared to those found for thicker films. The similarity of peak positions at the lowest coverage, 1/15 of a monolayer, produced by a 0.2-L exposure, and those observed after a 2-L exposure suggests that EO adsorbs mainly in a molecular form at 90 K on the (2 × 2) alloy even at low coverages.
The intensity of the CH2 wagging mode at 1160 cm1 became larger than that of the ring stretching mode at 1270 cm1 with increasing exposure. Such intensity changes are expected as change occurs in the symmetry and orientation of molecules near the surface, and especially in the monolayer, compared to the random orientation of molecules that compose thicker condensed films because of the metal surface dipole selection rule that operates for specular scattering in HREELS.
A series of HREELS spectra collected after exposing the (2 × 2) alloy at 90 K to 10-L EO and then sequentially annealed to higher temperatures (and recooling to 90 K after each annealing step) is shown in Figure 4b. Heating to 120 K removes all EO in the film except that directly bonded to the surface in the adsorbed monolayer. The EO ring deformation mode shifts by 10 cm1 to 846 cm1 after heating to 120 K, which is to the same as that in the 2-L EO spectrum in Figure 4a.
Heating to 160 K decreases the EO coverage to about 0.2 ML and reduces the intensity of the EO ring deformation peak at 846 cm1 by about 80%, but without a shift in the peak position. The reduced intensity of this peak is mainly due to EO desorption, but can be attributed in part to an onset of a transformation of molecularly adsorbed EO (Figure 6b) to a metallacycle configuration (Figure 7f). The new peaks that appear at 1040, 1130, 1420, and 2932 cm1 can be assigned to metallacycle frequencies. The corresponding frequencies calculated with DFT using the model in Figure 7f are 1004 (ring deformation), 1123 (ring deformation), 1423 (CH2 scissoring), 2994 cm1 (CH2 stretching). The agreement of these values with experiment is not as good as that for molecularly adsorbed EO values in Table 1, which may be because EO is predicted to form multiple metallacycle configurations on PtSn (Figure 7b,d,f) and therefore multiple metallacycle configurations may contribute to the spectrum.
TPD results in Figure 1 show that heating to 200 K is sufficient to remove nearly all of molecularly adsorbed EO. The disappearance of the EO ring deformation peak at 846 cm1 after heating to 200 K, as shown in Figure 4b, is consistent with this observation. The remaining EO partially decomposes or is bonded in the form of a more stable metallacycle with the characteristic band at 500 cm1 for the ring deformation. A peak at 450 cm1 assigned to a metallacycle species was observed with HREELS on Ag(111) when EO was dosed at 250 K12. New peaks at 1860 and 2080 cm1 are at least in part due to CO adsorption in bridge and atop sites, which results from a small amount of EO decomposition and coadsorption of CO from the background during the long scan time for HREELS (t = 90 min) on a nearly clean surface after removing EO. The broad peak at 1200 cm1 disappears following heating to 300 K (Figure 4b) after ethylene (m/e = 28) desorption in TPD at 273 K (Figure 1b).
HREELS spectra following exposures of up to 20-L EO on the 3 alloy at 90 K are shown in Figure 5a. A 20-L EO exposure produced a 6.7-layer thick film of EO with a spectrum and peak assignments identical to those for the multilayer film on the (2 × 2) alloy (Figure 4a). Similarly to the (2 × 2) alloy, at the lowest investigated exposure of 0.4-L, which produced about 0.13 ML coverage, a loss peak of the EO ring deformation mode appeared at 846 cm1 (Table 1), indicating that EO adsorbs molecularly even at this low coverage. On increasing exposure to 2.0-L EO, which corresponds to 2/3 of a monolayer, the ring deformation mode shifts to 856 cm1, whereas it remains at 846 cm1 after the same exposure on the (2 × 2) alloy (Figure 4a). The change in relative intensities for the CH2 wagging peak at 1160 cm1 and the ring stretching peak at 1270 cm1 are similar to that observed on the (2 × 2) alloy.

A series of HREELS spectra collected after sequentially heating the 3 alloy are shown in Figure 5b. Heating to 120 K removes all EO except that in the monolayer, and the vibrational spectrum from this adlayer is similar to that from the monolayer formed at 90 K (Figure 5a). Upon further heating to 160 K, the EO coverage is greatly reduced as evidenced by the reduction of the peak at 846 cm1 for the ring deformation of EO adsorbed without ring breaking (Figure 6c). It is possible that a small amount of EO transforms into a metallacycle configuration (Figures 7c,e,g) with a peak at 500 cm1, and that a small fraction of EO decomposes to form CO in an atop-bonded configuration with the frequency at 2065 cm1. However, it is difficult to distinguish peaks from these processes with those that would arise from coadsorbed CO from the background on this nearly clean surface. The ratio of bridge-bonded to atop-bonded CO on the 3 alloy is greatly reduced, as can be expected from the reduction in the number of available PtPt bridge sites.

The surface dipole selection rule would cause the intensity of the ν3 ring stretching peak at 1270 cm1 to be enhanced and that of the ν4 CH2 wagging peak at 1160 cm1 to be reduced if the EO molecular axes were close to being perpendicular to the metal surface. For both alloys, the ν3/ν4 intensity ratio is increased for the monolayer compared to the multilayer, which leads us to conclude that the molecular axis is not parallel with the surface but is likely tilted away from the surface normal. Such tilted geometries have been reported on Ni(111) (49) and Pt(110)-(2 × 1) (26) surfaces probed by angle -resolved ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS). These results are consistent with the DFT models in Figure 6 and Table 2 discussed below.

3.4 Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
DFT calculations suggest that EO molecularly adsorbs on Pt(111) without ring breaking by bonding through the oxygen atom to a single Pt atom (atop site), as shown in Figure 6a, with the OPt bond distance of 2.81 Å and PtOC bond angle of 122. The CO bonds are stretched by 0.01 Å compared to that in the gas phase. Additional details on bond distances and angles for this and other calculated EO adsorbed species are provided in Table 2. The predicted adsorption energy for the molecularly bonded EO is 6.8 kcal/mol, which is below the estimate of 9.312.8 kcal/mol from our TPD results (Table 3). Similarly to multiple studies for EO on Ag surfaces, (12-14, 16, 50) DFT results suggest that a more stable configuration is a metallacycle where EO breaks the ring and binds to two Pt atoms in a bridged position (Figure 7a). Although the metallacycle is estimated to be more stable by 10.5 kcal/mol (Table 3), its formation is predicted to be limited kinetically and its concentration to be small at the temperature of EO molecular desorption of about 200 K. This configuration, however, is expected to be formed before EO decomposition at higher temperatures. The calculated frequencies for the oxygen-surface bond stretch (cycle deformation) for the most stable metallacycle structures in Figure 7 (a, f, and g) are calculated to be 461490 cm1. The disappearance of the HREELS peak due to the molecular ring deformation at 866 cm1 (846 for PtSn) and the appearance of a new peak near 500 cm1 with higher temperatures in Figures 4b and 5b may be associated with molecular EO desorption and conversion of a small fraction of molecularly adsorbed EO to a metallacycle configuration.

For adsorption without ring breaking on both Sn alloy surfaces, EO is predicted to bind through oxygen to a single Sn atom in a tilted configuration similar to the one on Pt (Figure 6). The calculated OSn bond distances and SnOC angles are 2.74 Å and 119 for the (2 × 2) alloy and 2.79 Å and 119 for the 3 alloy, i.e., the EO molecule is closer to the surface and less tilted bonded to Sn in the alloy than when it is bonded to Pt (Table 2). Calculated adsorption energies for bonding to Sn are higher, 8.89.3 kcal/mol, than the value of 6.8 kcal/mol for pure Pt. The calculations, however, also show that molecular EO becomes destabilized on Pt in the presence of Sn; initial configurations with EO on a Pt atop site converged in the process of geometry optimizations either to EO bonding to Sn or to desorbed EO. At our low-temperature experimental conditions of dosing EO at 90 K, adsorption at high coverages in the monolayer may also occur at some destabilized Pt sites. We observe a small decline in the adsorption and desorption energy with a higher Sn concentration (Table 3 and Figure 9).
Similarly to molecularly adsorbed EO, DFT calculations suggest that the metallacycle configuration on Pt is destabilized in the presence of Sn, and the adsorption energy decreases from 17.3 for Pt(111) to 16.3 for the (2 × 2) alloy to 10.6 kcal/mol for the 3 alloy (Table 3 and Figures 7ac). Also similarly to molecular adsorption, preferential bonding through oxygen to Sn is predicted. For both alloys, the SnOCH2CH2Pt configuration with oxygen binding to Sn (Figure 7d and 7e) is energetically more favorable by 18.9 kcal/mol than PtOCH2CH2Sn with oxygen bonding to Pt (Figure 7f and 7g) and by 510 kcal/mol than to two Pt atoms. Since adsorption of nonoxygenate fragments on Sn follows a reverse pattern (less favorable on Sn than on Pt), our results suggest that subsequent decomposition of EO is hindered in the presence of Sn due to (a) higher initial stability of the EO metallacycle on Sn and (b) lower stability of any nonoxygenate hydrocarbon fragments formed on decomposition on neighboring Pt sites.
Computational models of adsorbed EO in Figures 6 and 7 and also gas-phase EO were used to obtain frequency values and visualize the vibrational normal modes. Results from these vibrational analyses were then used to make the assignment of the experimental HREELS data in Table 1. Calculated frequencies closely matched HREELS peaks within 510 cm1. For example, the ring deformation mode, ν5 (A1) in Table 1, is observed experimentally at 866 on Pt(111) and at 846 cm1 on the alloys and calculated values are 861, 848, and 854 for Pt(111) and the (2 × 2) and 3 alloys, respectively. The calculated frequencies for the surface-oxygen stretching mode for the most stable metallacycle geometries are bridge-bonded on Pt(111) at 461 cm1, and SnOCH2CH2Pt on the (2 × 2) alloy at 490 cm1 and on the 3 alloy at 479 cm1 (Figure 7). Small peaks in HREELS that may be assigned to the surface-EO oxygen stretching mode in a metallacycle configuration are observed at 470 cm1 on Pt(111) (25) and 500 cm1 on the alloys (Figures 4b and 5b).
3.5 Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS)
He I UPS spectra were obtained after EO adsorption at near saturation monolayer coverages on Pt(111) and both Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys at 90 K in order to characterize the EO-surface bonding interactions. Figure 8 shows the UPS difference spectra obtained by subtracting the UPS spectrum of the corresponding clean surface from the adsorbate spectra. The multilayer reference spectrum was obtained from a 6.7-layer EO film on the 3 alloy. The binding energy (BE) scale is referenced to the Fermi level (EF) of the clean Pt(111) at 0.0 eV BE. The spectra are shown with the transition energies for the molecular orbitals of gas-phase EO (51, 52) indicated at the bottom of the figure for comparison, after a rigid shift to enable comparison. In Table 4, which summarizes the results from the UPS measurements, all of the energy levels for EO were rigidly shifted to align the 5a1-derived peak at 10.7 eV BE to approximately take into account final-state relaxation energy shifts. (43) Valence level peaks in the monolayer spectra were assigned by comparison to the gas phase and multilayer data and a previous report for EO adsorbed on Pt(110)-(1 × 2). (26)

aAll EO levels were rigidly shifted to align the 5a1 peak BE in each case.
Chemisorption-induced shifts of the 2b1, 6a1, and 3b2 molecular orbitals are of particular interest because they have significant contributions from oxygen atomic orbitals: 2b1 = 77% of O(2px), 6a1 = 20% of O(2pz), and 3b2 = 47% of O(2py). (53, 54) In the condensed-phase EO multilayer, energy separations (ΔEb) from the deepest energy level (5a1) are 5.4, 4.3, and 2.6 eV, respectively. These bands for the EO monolayer on Pt(111) are shifted to lower energies compared to the values from the multilayer. Energy separations increased by 0.6 for 2b1 (ΔEb = 6.0 eV) and 0.8 for 6a1 (ΔEb = 5.1 eV), indicating a stronger interaction between the EO monolayer and the surface via oxygen. Ethylene oxide on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) has been reported to show even a stronger interaction (ΔEb = 7.1 eV). (26) These energy separations are decreased by 0.3 eV for 2b1 and 0.4 eV for 6a1 on both alloy surfaces.
4 Discussion
Fundamental studies of adsorption and surface reactivity of ethylene oxide are of interest because of the industrial importance of EO production and an ongoing search for improved heterogeneous epoxidation catalysts due to low epoxidation yields. EO was initially thought to be quite reactive on Pt(111), (8) but this has now been shown not to be the case: (25) ethylene oxide adsorbs mostly molecularly and reversibly on Pt(111) under UHV conditions at low temperatures. Specifically, HREELS spectra for EO adsorbed at 90 K show only small shifts in molecular vibrational frequencies at monolayer EO coverages compared to condensed phase spectra. Furthermore, TPD results show EO adsorbs mostly reversibly and desorbs at 158207 K, depending on coverage, which corresponds to a desorption energy of 9.312.8 kcal/mol. These values are good estimates for the adsorption energy since there is no appreciable activation barrier for adsorption. TPD results and AES measurements taken after TPD experiments place an upper limit on the extent of decomposition at 0.02 ML. (25) Introduction of step sites on the surface does not strongly alter this chemistry, and similar results were found in previous studies of EO adsorption on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface. (26)
Alloying Sn into the Pt(111) surface generally reduces the adsorption energy and reactivity of hydrocarbons. (37, 43, 55-58) Although Sn is generally reported to be oxophilic because of the relatively strong SnO bond compared to that for Pt, the trend of lower activity for alloys compared to that for Pt(111) also holds for all the reported oxygen-containing organic molecules, including methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), (37) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). (38) For example, 50% of the acetaldehyde monolayer dehydrogenates on a Pt(111) surface during heating in TPD, but practically no reaction is observed on the (2 × 2) and 3 SnPt(111) surface alloys, and acetaldehyde adsorbs mostly reversibly under UHV conditions. (38) Similar effects were reported in more recent studies of cyclohexanone (c-C5H10CO) adsorption: (40) while over 70% of the cyclohexanone monolayer decomposes on Pt(111), less than 5% decomposes on the alloy surfaces. The desorption energy also decreases by 12 kcal/mol on the alloy surfaces compared to that on Pt(111).
The current investigation further supports these findings and provides additional details on the adsorption, stability, and desorption of EO. The presence of Sn alloyed into the Pt(111) surface to form either of these two ordered alloys weakens the EO chemisorption bond. At a low coverage of 0.01 ML, EO desorbs at 207 K on Pt(111), at 198 K on the (2 × 2) alloy, and at 190 K on the 3 alloy. Desorption activation energies, Edes, for EO at these low coverages are estimated to be 12.8, 12.1, and 11.6 kcal/mol on these surfaces, respectively. Figure 9 compares the influence of the alloyed Sn concentration on the desorption temperature at low coverage, Tdes, and calculated values for the desorption energy, Edes, for EO on Pt(111) with our previously reported data for methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH). (37) Values of Edes for EO decrease by 5.5% on the (2 × 2) alloy and 9.4% on the 3 alloy compared to that on pure Pt(111). The influence of alloyed Sn on the EO adsorption energy is very similar to that on methanol where Edes was reduced from that on Pt(111) by 4.2% on the (2 × 2) alloy and 8.2% on the 3 alloy. Alloyed Sn has even a larger effect on more strongly chemisorbed molecules, e.g., Edes for ethylene (CH2CH2) was reduced from 17.0 kcal/mol on Pt(111) by 16% on the (2 × 2) alloy and 36% on the 3 alloy. (43) The values of Edes for EO adsorbed at monolayer coverage are, notably, nearly independent of Sn concentration. As mentioned in the section on the DFT results, the presence of Sn creates a distribution of sites with respect to adsorption energies. DFT calculations suggest that EO adsorbed with the ring intact and bound to Sn is 23 kcal/mol more favorable than that on pure Pt(111). This small energy difference, however, was not observed experimentally within the approximations used for Redhead analysis of the TPD data.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Influence of the alloyed Sn concentration on the desorption temperature in TPD (left axis) and corresponding desorption energy (right axis) for EO on Pt(111) at low coverage (0.01 ML). Values for methanol and ethanol, (37) and also for a saturated monolayer coverage of EO, are shown for comparison.
UPS spectra also indicates that alloying Sn into the Pt(111) surface reduces the bonding of EO to the surface. The energy separation between valence energy levels is sensitive to the bonding strength of the molecule to the surface. The energy separation ΔEb between levels 5a1 and 2b1 for EO in the monolayer is larger on the Pt(111) surface, ΔEb = 6.0 eV, compared to ΔEb = 5.7 on the two alloys, indicating that EO adsorbs more strongly on Pt(111) than on the alloys. Such a decrease in energy separation between high and low binding energy bands was also observed for ethylene adsorption on these same surfaces, with ΔEb between levels πCH2 and σCC,CH2 of adsorbed ethylene decreasing from that on Pt(111) as the concentration of Sn increased. (43)
Although most EO adsorbed at 90 K desorbs reversibly below 210 K, a combination of HREELS, TPD, and DFT also allows us to analyze a small fraction of EO that remains on the surface, transforms, and then decomposes at higher temperatures. As mentioned above, the upper limit on the remaining EO amount is 0.02 ML for Pt(111) (25) and 0.006 ML for the alloys. The evolution of the HREELS spectra after heating in Figures 4b and 5b is consistent with the onset of the transformation of EO bonded with the ring intact (Figure 6) into a metallacycle configuration (Figure 7) at 120160 K. By 200 K, EO remaining on the surface completes the transformation to the metallacycle configuration and begins to decompose, as evidenced by CO formation. At 250300 K, the intensity of CO peaks at 20652080 cm1 in HREELS grows, indicating a greater extent of decomposition. The TPD peak at 273 K for m/e = 28 suggests that some metallacycle decomposes at this temperature and forms gas-phase ethylene. In comparison, EO on Ag(111) forms a metallacycle that desorbs at 300 K based on the m/e = 29 TPD trace after adsorption at 130 K. (12) The fraction of EO adsorbed as a metallacycle on Ag at low temperatures is also small, and EO mostly desorbs reversibly from the adsorbed state without ring breaking on Ag(111) at 200 K. The major difference between Ag(111) and Pt(111) and the Sn/Pt(111) alloys, therefore, is the propensity for the EO metallacycle on Ag(111) to desorb reversibly (without decomposition) at 300 K, since molecular EO desorption from the metallacycle state was not detected in our experiments. While the adsorption energies calculated with DFT for the EO metallacycle on Ag(111) are 1315 kcal/mol, (14, 59) our calculations find a higher value of 17 kcal/mol for Pt(111) and an even higher value of 21 kcal/mol for the Sn/Pt(111) alloys. The presence of Sn is predicted to destabilize the EO metallacycle on a bridging Pt site of the alloys in the form of PtOCH2CH2Pt, but makes possible a more stable metallacycle species with oxygen bonding to Sn as SnOCH2CH2Pt (Table 3, Figure 7f and 7g). Our calculations, therefore, suggest that the presence of Sn would not be expected to promote molecular EO desorption from the metallacycle configurations. In addition, since the metallacycle is a likely intermediate in epoxidation (the formation of EO from ethylene and atomic oxygen on the surface), the balance between the propensity of the metallacycle to desorb molecularly as EO or to stay on the surface and undergo rearrangement, decomposition, or oxidation should determine the selectivity for epoxidation. The higher predicted stability of the EO metallacycle on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) alloys compared to Ag(111), thus, provides an explanation for lower epoxidation selectivities on Pt surfaces.
5 Conclusion
Ethylene oxide (EO) adsorbs reversibly on the (2 × 2) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys and desorbs molecularly without significant decomposition after dosing at 90 K. The EO TPD peak for submonolayer coverage is shifted slightly to lower temperatures, 198 K for the (2 × 2) and 190 K for 3 alloys, compared to the value of 207 K for pure Pt(111), indicating that alloyed Sn reduces the EO adsorption energy. XPS results reveal that the EO monolayer saturation coverage does not depend on the presence of alloyed Sn and remains at 0.25 ML as on pure Pt(111). HREELS vibrational spectra and UPS valence band spectra indicate that EO adsorbs molecularly, with little change from the gas-phase structure. Shifts in the energy of the ring deformation vibrational mode and in the molecular orbitals indicate that EO adsorbs on these surfaces via the oxygen atom. DFT calculations elucidate the adsorption geometry, finding that the oxygensurface bond distance is 2.72.8 Å and the COsurface bond angle is 119122. Normal vibrational modes obtained with frequency analyses of the DFT models closely matched, within 510 cm1, the observed HREELS peaks and were used in making the experimental frequency assignments. The HREELS peak intensities were consistent with the calculated tilt of the EO molecular plane away from the surface normal. DFT calculations further suggest that EO is bonded to a single Pt atom in an atop configuration on Pt(111) and, similarly, to a single Sn atom on the alloys. The calculated adsorption energies at Sn sites on the alloys was slightly higher than on Pt(111), and adsorption at Pt atoms in the alloys is predicted to be destabilized.
Analysis of CO and H2 TPD traces establishes an upper limit on the extent of EO decomposition on heating during TPD at 0.006 ML (2.4% of the EO saturation coverage) for both alloy surfaces, which is less than the value of 0.02 ML limit on Pt(111). DFT calculations predict that a more stable configuration is formed in which EO breaks its molecular ring and creates a metallacycle on the surface prior to decomposition. The evolution of HREELS spectra with annealing temperature are consistent with transformation of a small fraction of adsorbed EO into a metallacycle, but these features are small since most EO desorbs without ring breaking. DFT calculations suggest that, similarly to the EO configuration with the ring intact, neighboring Sn atoms destabilize the EO metallacycle on a bridging Pt site in the form of PtOCH2CH2Pt. The metallacycle configuration with the oxygen bonding to Sn as SnOCH2CH2Pt, however, is more stable than the metallacycle on pure Pt. As a result, Sn is not expected to promote molecular EO desorption from the metallacycle configuration. These DFT calculations provide an explanation of why, unlike on Ag, no molecular desorption of EO from the presumed metallacycle configuration was observed experimentally on Pt(111) and these alloys. EO that remained on the surface after the main EO desorption peak at 200 K decomposed to desorb ethylene at 273 K and CO at 385 K on the (2 × 2) alloy. Since the metallacycle is expected to be an intermediate in ethylene epoxidation, low selectivities to EO on Pt surfaces can be attributed to a higher stability of the metallacycle configuration on Pt compared to Ag and, therefore, to the inability of the metallacycle to desorb as molecular EO.
