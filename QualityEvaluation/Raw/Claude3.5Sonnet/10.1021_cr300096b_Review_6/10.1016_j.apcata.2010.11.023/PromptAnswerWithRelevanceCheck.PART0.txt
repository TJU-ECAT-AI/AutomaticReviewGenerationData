<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, or oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on the effects of oxide supports on Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts for acetone hydrogenation, but does not discuss the specific surface science techniques or segregation kinetics mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
