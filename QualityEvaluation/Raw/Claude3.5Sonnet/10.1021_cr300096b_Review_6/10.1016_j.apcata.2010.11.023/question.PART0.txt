The effects of oxide supports on the low temperature hydrogenation activity of acetone over Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts on SiO2, γ-Al2O3 and TiO2
Abstract
Low temperature (308 K) hydrogenation of acetone was used as a probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2, SiO2 and γ-Al2O3. The oxide supports significantly affected the catalytic properties of Pt/Ni catalysts, in which Pt/Ni/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than the other two bimetallic catalysts. TEM measurements revealed that the three supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts have similar particle size distribution, while CO chemisorption measurements showed very different chemisorption capacity. Extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII-edge indicated that Pt atoms were fully reduced and the PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed on all three catalysts. The extent of PtNi bond formation followed the trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which correlated very well with the hydrogenation activity.

1. Introduction
The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. As the derivatives of biomass often contain the CO functional groups, facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial to the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals
[5]
,
[6]
. For example, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass
[4]
.
Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
. It has been demonstrated that bimetallic structures strongly affect their catalytic performance. For example, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer of Ni atoms located on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, is more active for dehydrogenation
[16]
and oxygenate reforming than either of the parent metals
[17]
. In contrast, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, with Ni atoms residing underneath the Pt(1 1 1) surface, shows a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway that is absent on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)
[14]
. These surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts
[18]
,
[19]
.
However, the γ-Al2O3 support particles can agglomerate or dissolve due to their relatively poor hydrothermal stability at relatively high temperatures in aqueous phase, which are the reaction conditions typically used for biomass conversion. One approach for improving the hydrothermal stability is to use alumina in the form of zeolites and membrane
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
. Another approach is to use oxide supports with greater hydrothermal stability than γ-Al2O3.
It is well known that supported catalysts often exhibit different catalytic performance depending on the nature of the support materials. In the current study acetone hydrogenation was used as the probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2. The comparative studies showed that the oxide supports strongly affected the hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalysts, following the activity trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The supported catalysts were characterized using TEM and EXAFS in order to understand the origins responsible for the difference in hydrogenation activity.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Incipient wetness impregnation was utilized to synthesize the supported catalysts. High surface area γ-Al2O3 (80120 m2/g), amorphous SiO2 (175225 m2/g), and amorphous TiO2 (180300 m2/g) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Previous work
[23]
in our group on Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts found that a co-impregnated synthesis procedure resulted in catalysts with the greatest extent of bimetallic formation, therefore the catalysts in this study were also synthesized using co-impregnation. After impregnating the precursor solution onto the supports, the catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and then calcined in air at 563 K for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. Pulse CO chemisorption
Pulse chemisorption using an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) was performed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion. Approximately 0.1 g of catalyst was loaded into a quartz reactor and reduced under a hydrogen-helium mixture (40 sccm, 50% H2/He) at 723 K for 1 h. After cooling in He, pulse CO chemisorption was performed at room temperature using pulses of 37 cm3 min1 CO in a He carrier gas. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the flow of CO out of the quartz reactor. Metal dispersion was calculated assuming a stoichiometry of M:CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni).
2.2.2. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the gas-phase concentrations of reactants and products during the hydrogenation of acetone. The construction of the IR cell was based on a design reported elsewhere
[24]
. Spectra were recorded with 4 cm1 resolution using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT-A) detector. The procedure for preparing samples, the details of the sample holder, and the reduction conditions have been previously reported
[23]
.
The hydrogenation of acetone was performed by monitoring the gas molecules using FTIR in a batch reactor mode. The purity of the acetone vapor was verified in situ prior to experimentation by comparing the IR spectrum with standard reference reported in literature
[25]
. During the reaction the gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording IR spectra (32 scans) every 30 s. For acetone hydrogenation, hydrogen gas and acetone vapor were mixed at a partial pressure ratio of 2:1. To start the reaction, the reactant gas mixture was quickly dosed into the IR cell while holding the catalyst at 308 K. The concentrations of the acetone and 2-propanol were estimated using the intensities of their characteristic vibrational modes, ν(CO) at 1738 cm1 and ν(OH) at 3656 cm1, respectively. The different extinction coefficients for gas-phase acetone and 2-propanol were accounted for by calibrating the intensity of the ν(CO) or ν(OH) mode as a function of concentration of each molecule. The intensity of each peak was measured at a number of pressures in a range relevant to the hydrogenation reaction. Using the volume of the reactor cell and the ideal gas law, gas-phase concentrations were calculated based on the pressure-intensity calibration for each molecule.
2.2.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM analysis was performed using a JEOL 2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200 keV. Imaging was performed in scanning mode using a 20 nm camera length and a 0.5 nm diameter nanoprobe. Reduced catalyst samples were prepared by grinding and suspending the catalysts in ethanol, followed by dropping then a small amount of this solution onto a carbon coated copper grid and drying before loading the sample in the TEM.
2.2.4. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
In order to confirm the presence of the PtNi bimetallic bonds, EXAFS measurements of the Pt LIII-edge were performed on the X19A beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. Sample preparation procedures have been described previously
[26]
. The catalysts were reduced under a diluted hydrogen flow (5% H2 in He, 40 sccm) at 723 K for 1 h and EXAFS data of the Pt LIII-edge were collected at room temperature. The incident and transmitted X-ray signals were collected with ionization chambers while the fluorescence signal was collected using a 12-channel germanium detector. The EXAFS spectra from the samples were calibrated to the Pt LIII-edge energy from a Pt reference foil collected in transmission mode.
The transmission signal was analysed using the IFEFFIT 1.2.11 data analysis package (Athena, Aretmis, Atoms, and FEFF6)
[27]
,
[28]
. Local structural information was obtained by Fourier-transforming the EXAFS signal into R-space and using Artemis to fit each data set to the theoretical standards generated in FEFF6
[29]
. The theoretical PtPt photoelectron amplitudes and phases were calculated for the bulk Pt fcc structure. The PtNi contribution was modeled by replacing Pt with Ni in the first nearest-neighbor shell. The seven parameters used in the fitting procedure were the correction to the edge energy, the coordination numbers of the PtPt and PtNi bonds, corrections to their model interatomic distances and their mean square deviations in interatomic distances (EXAFS Debye-Waller factors). The passive electron reduction factor
, which was fixed throughout the fitting of the Pt/Ni catalysts, was determined by fitting the Pt reference foil.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Theoretical prediction and experimental verification on Pt/Ni bimetallic catalyst
As verified in previous studies of the hydrogenation of alkenes, the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC bond occurs on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures due to the relatively weak binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes
[9]
,
[30]
. A similar hypothesis is used in the current study for promoting the low temperature hydrogenation of acetone. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the acetone binding energies on several monometallic and bimetallic 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) and Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) surfaces using the VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulations Package) code. The PW91 functional was applied in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculations and a 396 eV cutoff energy was used for the plane wave truncation. A periodic 3 × 3 unit cell structure with four layers of metal atoms was used as the slab, separated by six equivalent layers of vacuum. For the four layers of metal, the bottom two layers were frozen with a PtPt distance of 2.83 Å, while the top two layers were allowed to relax. Acetone was placed onto the surface in the perpendicular (η1μ1) adsorption mode, which was found to be the most stable configuration reported in the literature
[31]
.
The value of the surface d-band center is a useful parameter to describe the modification effects on bimetallic surfaces due to the formation of bimetallic bond
[9]
. It has been shown that the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level correlates nearly linearly with the binding energies of various adsorbates on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces
[30]
.
Fig. 1
shows that the binding energy of acetone follows a similar trend, with binding energy increasing as the d-band center is moved closer to Fermi level. It is apparent that the general trends follow two sets of slopes, as illustrated in the solid lines, for the Pt-terminated and 3d-terminated surfaces. Such distinct slopes are related to the different matrix elements for 5d (Pt) and 3d metals, as described previously

Fig. 1. Correlation between DFT predicted binding energy of acetone and surface d-band center of several monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.
As compared in
Fig. 1
, acetone is more weakly bonded on Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) than on either 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) or the corresponding monometallic surfaces, suggesting that the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structure should be more effective in the hydrogenation of acetone. The DFT prediction is verified in
Fig. 2
by comparing the hydrogenation activity of acetone over γ-Al2O3 supported monometallic 1.7 wt.% Pt, 5 wt.% Ni and bimetallic 1.7 wt.% Pt/5 wt.% Ni (atomic Ni/Pt ratio = 10:1) catalysts using a FTIR batch reactor. The sum of gas phase concentration of acetone and 2-propanol is constant during the reaction time of 3 h, indicating that 2-propanol is the only gas-phase hydrogenation product. The consumption of acetone and the production of 2-propanol over the Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst are much faster than those over the monometallic Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The experimental results confirm the enhanced activity of the bimetallic catalyst toward CO bond hydrogenation, which is consistent with previous studies of low temperature hydrogenation of alkenes and cycloalkenes
[18]
,
[19]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. The observation of an enhanced hydrogenation activity in the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalyst suggests the presence of Pt-terminated bimetallic structures, similar to the Pt-terminated subsurface structure used in DFT calculations. One explanation is that Ni atoms diffuse into the region beneath the surface while Pt atoms segregate to the surface during the reduction. It is in agreement with DFT predictions that for Ni/Pt surfaces, the segregation of Pt atoms to the top-most layer is thermodynamically favored both in the presence of atomic hydrogen and in vacuum

Similarly enhanced acetone hydrogenation activity was also observed over Pt/Ni bimetallic catalyst with a lower Ni/Pt atomic ratio (3:1), which was used as the bimetallic formulation for comparing the effect of oxide supports, as described below.
3.2. Effect of oxide supports on Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts
3.2.1. TEM analysis of particle size distribution
TEM was used to determine the particle size distribution of the reduced bimetallic catalysts. To maximize the contrast between the metal and the support, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging was used to image the catalysts. Representative images of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts on SiO2 and TiO2 are shown in
Fig. 3
. The statistics from the particle size distribution, estimated by measuring horizontal particle diameters in several different images for each catalyst, are shown in
Table 1
. It was found that both median and average particle size distributions are very similar for the three supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, with the exception that the Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows a wider standard deviation

3.2.2. EXAFS characterization of formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds
Analysis of the Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS allows one to make the following preliminary conclusions about the state of the reduction in each sample
[35]
, the presence of bimetallic bonds and the extent of bimetallic formation.

shows the Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra of a Pt foil and the three supported Pt/Ni catalysts. The characteristic peak of PtO in the fresh samples is no longer present after reduction in hydrogen. All spectra after H2 treatment are similar to that of the Pt foil, suggesting that Pt atoms in all three Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were fully reduced.

The experimental data after reduction in H2 were fitted using FEFF6

in R-space for the three supported bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts. The k-ranges used in the fitting were chosen in order to exclude regions of noise at high-k. A Hanning window with sill width of 2 Å1 was used in Fourier-transforming the spectra into R-space. The best fit results are summarized in
Table 2
. In the bulk phase, Ni and Pt have first nearest neighbor distances of 2.492 Å (NiNi) and 2.774 Å (PtPt). For the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, the first nearest neighbor distance should be a value in between those for the two monometallic distances. As shown in
Table 2
, the PtNi distance is between 2.54 and 2.58 Å for the three supported catalysts, confirming the formation of the PtNi bonds.

The extent of bimetallic formation appears to be different on the different supports. The PtNi coordination numbers were found to be 3.2  0.5 on γ-Al2O3, 5.3  0.3 on SiO2 and 2.8  0.9 on TiO2. The ratio of the PtNi to PtPt coordination numbers characterizes the extent of bimetallic bond formation. For the SiO2 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, this ratio of coordination numbers is greater than one, signifying that most Pt atoms are primarily coordinated with Ni atoms. In comparison, the ratios for the γ-Al2O3 and TiO2 supported catalysts are less than one, suggesting that the first coordination shell around each Pt atom consists of more Pt atoms than Ni on these two supports.
3.2.3. Catalytic evaluations from batch reactor studies
Acetone hydrogenation was used as a probe reaction to compare the catalytic properties of the three catalysts. The consumption of acetone and production of 2-propanol are presented in
Fig. 5
A and B, respectively. It should be noted that the Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in
Fig. 5
, with a Ni/Pt atomic ratio of 3:1, has lower hydrogenation activity than the catalyst (Ni/Pt ratio of 10:1) in
Fig. 2
. This observation is consistent with our previous studies of hydrogenation of the CC bonds in benzene and 1,3-butadiene
[23]
, where bimetallic catalysts with higher Ni/Pt ratios are found to possess higher hydrogenation activity.

The comparison in
Fig. 5
reveals that the Pt/Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows much higher hydrogenation activity than either the γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 supported catalysts. The hydrogenation rate, estimated by fitting a first order rate equation for the consumption of acetone, is compared in
Table 3
. To correlate the hydrogenation rate with the number of active sites, the rate constant was also normalized to the CO uptake of each catalyst obtained from the CO chemisorption measurements. In order to assure that the CO uptake values reflect the chemisorption of CO on the metal sites instead of supports, identical chemisorption measurements were performed on SiO2, γ-Al2O3 and TiO2. The adsorption of CO on these oxide supports is negligible, with CO uptake values less than 2 μmol g1 oxides. To avoid the influence of the reverse dehydrogenation reaction at higher 2-propanol concentrations, the fitting was performed for the concentration profiles of acetone in the first 60 min of reaction.

As summarized in
Table 3
, the number of active sites from CO chemisorption capacity on the bimetallic catalysts follows the trend of γ-Al2O3 > SiO2 > TiO2, while the normalized hydrogenation activity follows the trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The activity trend can be correlated with the PtNi coordination number obtained from EXAFS analysis, suggesting that the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation is related to the enhanced hydrogenation activity. This observation is consistent with previous studies of CC bond hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene
[23]
. In that work a variety of Pt/Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared using different Ni/Pt ratios and different impregnation sequences. A strong correlation was observed between the extent of PtNi bond formation from EXAFS measurements and CC bond hydrogenation activity from reactor evaluations
[23]
.
In addition to differences in the extent of PtNi coordination, the low hydrogenation activity and low value of CO uptake of the Pt/Ni/TiO2 catalyst suggests that strong interaction between TiO2 and active metal reduces the number of active sites and further prevent the effective hydrogenation of acetone. More detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to further understand the nature of the support effect on bimetallic catalysts. It will be important to determine how the interaction between bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports is affected on other type of oxide supports such as TiO2 with lower surface areas, as well as on other early transition metal oxides such as ZrO2. Because these oxides are potentially more hydrothermally stable than SiO2 and γ-Al2O3, a systematic understanding of the interaction of bimetallic particles on TiO2 and ZrO2 will be critical in the identification of bimetallic catalysts with desirable activity and hydrothermal stability.
4. Conclusions
Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 have been prepared by co-impregnation and evaluated using the FTIR batch reactor for acetone hydrogenation at 308 K and atmospheric pressure. Overall, catalyst supports have a significant effect on the catalytic hydrogenation activity, with a trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2 after normalizing the rate by the number of chemisorption sites. The trend is consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts. The lower hydrogenation activity and the smaller number of chemisorption sites on TiO2 supported catalyst are also likely related to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and supported metal particles. Furthermore, Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than Pt or Ni, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
