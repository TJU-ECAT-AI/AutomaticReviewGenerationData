Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or related experimental techniques and DFT predictions. The document focuses on methanol and water decomposition on Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces, and does not discuss Pt-Ni or Pt-Co systems or surface segregation effects. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or related experimental techniques and DFT predictions. The document focuses on methanol and water decomposition on Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces, and does not discuss Pt-Ni or Pt-Co systems or quantification of surface segregation using HREELS or AES. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or related experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to verify this. The document primarily focuses on the decomposition of methanol and water on Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces, and does not discuss Pt-Ni or Pt-Co systems. There is no mention of segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these specific systems, nor any comparison to DFT predictions. The question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this document.
