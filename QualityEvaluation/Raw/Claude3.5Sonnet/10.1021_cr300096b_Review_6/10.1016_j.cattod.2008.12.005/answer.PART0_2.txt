The literature provided does not contain any information about using HREELS or AES to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. There is also no mention of segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for these specific systems. The text focuses primarily on TPD studies of ethanol and ethylene glycol reactions on Fe/Pt(111) and Ti/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, as well as some discussion of surface preparation methods. It does not address the specific experimental techniques and comparisons to DFT that are asked about in the question.

所提供的文献中没有关于使用HREELS或AES来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子(如Ni和Co)的氧诱导表面偏析的信息。文中也没有提到这些特定系统的偏析动力学、活化能垒或DFT预测。该文本主要集中在Fe/Pt(111)和Ti/Pt(111)双金属表面上乙醇和乙二醇反应的TPD研究，以及一些表面制备方法的讨论。它没有涉及问题中所询问的具体实验技术和与DFT的比较。
