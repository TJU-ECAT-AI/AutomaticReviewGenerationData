Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to study such systems. The literature focuses on adsorption and reactivity studies of linear C6 hydrocarbons on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces, which is unrelated to the question asked.

This document does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems or related experimental techniques like HREELS and AES. The literature focuses on the adsorption and reactions of hydrocarbons (n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene) on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces. It does not discuss oxygen interactions, surface segregation, or 3d metals like Ni or Co. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

这份文献没有包含任何关于氧诱导的3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面偏析的信息,也没有提到相关的实验技术如HREELS和AES。文献主要讨论了烃类(正己烷、1-己烯和1,5-己二烯)在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)合金表面上的吸附和反应。它没有涉及氧的相互作用、表面偏析或镍、钴等3d金属。因此,无法根据这份文献中提供的信息来回答这个问题。
