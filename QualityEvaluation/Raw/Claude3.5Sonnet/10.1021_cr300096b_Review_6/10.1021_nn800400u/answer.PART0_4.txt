The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text appears to be a citation for an article about cobalt-doped platinum nanocatalysts for hydrogenation, but does not include any content about the specific experimental techniques, surface segregation, or DFT predictions mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given information.

所提供的文献不包含任何与回答关于HREELS和AES等实验技术如何验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析的问题相关的信息。该文本似乎是一篇关于用于氢化的钴掺杂铂纳米催化剂的文章引用，但不包含任何关于问题中提到的特定实验技术、表面偏析或DFT预测的内容。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答这个问题。
