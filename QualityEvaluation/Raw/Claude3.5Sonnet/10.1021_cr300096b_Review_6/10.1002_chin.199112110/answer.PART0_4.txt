The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about HREELS and AES techniques for verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text does not discuss these experimental techniques, segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for such systems. The literature appears to be about the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and methylcrotonaldehyde over Pt and PtFe catalysts, which is unrelated to the question asked.

给出的文献中没有任何与回答关于HREELS和AES技术验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中3d原子氧诱导表面偏析的问题相关的信息。文本没有讨论这些实验技术、偏析动力学、活化能垒或此类系统的DFT预测。这篇文献似乎是关于巴豆醛和甲基巴豆醛在Pt和PtFe催化剂上的氢化反应，与所问的问题无关。
