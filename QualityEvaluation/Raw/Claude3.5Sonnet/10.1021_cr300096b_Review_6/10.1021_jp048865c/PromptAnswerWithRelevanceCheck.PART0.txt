Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about experimental techniques like HREELS or AES to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. There is no mention of segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for these specific systems. The literature focuses on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of NO decomposition on PtAu alloy surfaces, which is unrelated to the topics asked about in the question.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

根据所给文献无法回答这个问题。文档中没有包含任何关于使用HREELS或AES等实验技术来验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的3d原子表面偏析的信息。文中也没有提到这些特定系统的偏析动力学、活化能垒或DFT预测。该文献主要关注PtAu合金表面上NO分解的动力学蒙特卡罗模拟,这与问题中询问的主题无关。
