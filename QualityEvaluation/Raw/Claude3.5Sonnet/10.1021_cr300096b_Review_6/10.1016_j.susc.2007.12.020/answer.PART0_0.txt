[1] "DFT modeling indicates that the d-band center of Pt is modified by the presence of Ni directly underneath Pt in the PtNiPt(111) structure, and trends in the calculated binding energies of various adsorbates have been confirmed experimentally [6]."

[2] "DFT modeling suggests that the second layer Ni should segregate to the top-most surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, which has been confirmed experimentally [41]."

[3] "The novel chemistry of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure is always observed by annealing the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600700 K. If the annealing temperature is above 800 K, at which temperature the Ni starts to diffuse into the bulk of Pt(111) based on AES measurements, the surface essentially behaves as Pt(111) and the Ni atoms no longer segregate to the surface after exposing to oxygen."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how HREELS and AES specifically verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) systems. However, it does mention that AES is used to monitor Ni diffusion into the bulk Pt(111) at higher temperatures. The document also states that oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface has been experimentally confirmed, but does not specify the techniques used or provide quantitative data on segregation kinetics or activation barriers. DFT modeling is mentioned as predicting the segregation behavior, but no comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions are provided. Overall, while the literature touches on some aspects of the question, it lacks the specific details requested about experimental verification, quantification, and comparison to DFT predictions for oxygen-induced segregation in these bimetallic systems.

文献没有提供关于HREELS和AES如何具体验证和量化PtNiPt(111)系统中亚表面Ni原子的氧诱导表面偏析的详细信息。然而，它确实提到AES被用来监测Ni在更高温度下向体相Pt(111)的扩散。文档还指出，亚表面Ni向表面的氧诱导偏析已经得到实验证实，但没有具体说明所使用的技术或提供关于偏析动力学或激活能障的定量数据。文中提到DFT建模预测了偏析行为，但没有提供实验测量与DFT预测之间的比较。总的来说，虽然文献涉及了问题的某些方面，但缺乏关于这些双金属系统中氧诱导偏析的实验验证、量化和与DFT预测比较的具体细节。
