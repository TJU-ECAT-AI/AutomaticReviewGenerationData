If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to study such phenomena. The document focuses on ethylene adsorption and reaction on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is no mention of Ni, Co, oxygen-induced segregation, or the experimental techniques specified in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给出的科学文献中没有包含关于Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导3d原子表面偏析的信息,也没有提到使用HREELS和AES等实验技术来研究这种现象。该文档主要集中讨论了在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上乙烯的吸附和反应,这与所问的问题无关。文中没有提到镍、钴、氧诱导偏析,或问题中指定的实验技术。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to study such phenomena. The document focuses on ethylene adsorption and reaction on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, and does not discuss Ni, Co, or oxygen-induced segregation. There is no mention of HREELS or segregation kinetics/barriers. The paper does use AES, but only to measure carbon coverage from ethylene adsorption on Pt(111), not to study 3d metal segregation. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

这篇文献不包含任何关于氧诱导3d原子在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中表面偏析的信息,也没有提到使用HREELS和AES等实验技术来研究这种现象。该文档主要关注乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和反应,并未讨论Ni、Co或氧诱导的偏析。文中没有提到HREELS或偏析动力学/能垒。该论文确实使用了AES,但仅用于测量Pt(111)上乙烯吸附的碳覆盖率,而不是研究3d金属的偏析。因此,根据给定的文献无法回答这个问题。

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to verify and quantify such segregation. The document focuses on the influence of coadsorbed hydrogen on ethylene adsorption and reaction on a (3×3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. It does not discuss Ni, Co, or oxygen-induced segregation in Pt-based alloys. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to verify and quantify such segregation. The document primarily discusses ethylene adsorption and reaction on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, with a focus on the influence of coadsorbed hydrogen. It does not mention oxygen, nickel, cobalt, or surface segregation kinetics. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems or experimental techniques like HREELS and AES to study such phenomena. The document focuses on ethylene and hydrogen adsorption on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is no mention of Ni, Co, or oxygen-induced segregation. The experimental techniques discussed (TPD and AES) are used for different purposes than what the question inquires about. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
