Molybdenumplatinum bimetallic catalysts supported on alu-
mina exhibited high activities in CO hydrogenation than supported
monometallic catalysts of Mo or Pt. The structure of MoPt bimetal-
lic catalysts, which were prepared by incipient wetness impreg-
nation of γ -alumina with the variation of the order of Mo and
Pt addition, was studied by XAFS and CO chemisorption. Since
molybdenum contains overlapping contribution of the first and the
second shells, EXAFS of these two shells and the first shell of plat-
inum was analyzed for the bimetallic catalysts. EXAFS showed
equivocally the formation of bimetallic bonds between Mo and Pt
for all bimetallic catalysts. For all bimetallic catalysts, molybdenum
seemed to segregate to the surface irrespective of the sequence of
the impregnation. Strong interaction of Mo atoms with the support
was also identified with EXAFS and XANES for both monometal-
lic Mo catalysts and bimetallic catalysts. Regarding the activities
of CO hydrogenation, it was concluded that reduced Mo sites were
responsible for the high activity and that Pt helped Mo sites become
more reduced.

INTRODUCTION
Bimetallic catalysts which consist of Mo and Pt have
shown high activity in hydrogenolysis of alkanes (13) and
dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (4), while comparable ac-
tivity was not observed for the monometallic catalysts. In
hydrogenolysis of ethane, Yermakov et al. (1) suggested
that the higher activity of the bimetallic catalyst was due to
the change in electronic properties of the platinum caused
by its interaction with the molybdenum on a support. Tri
et al. (2, 3) concluded that the addition of Mo made initially
electron deficient Pt particles be similar to bulk Pt, but that
the enhanced activity was due to complementary role of
Pt and Mo on adsorption of reactants. Leclercq et al. (4)
approached the problem with a more detailed adsorption
measurement and XPS study. By measuring the degree of
oxidation of molybdenum, they related the higher activity
to molybdenum, modified by addition of Pt in the bimetallic

catalyst. From these studies, it is clear that the each metal
component has a specific role on the effectiveness of the
bimetallic catalyst. Thus, it is expected that understanding
of the structure of PtMo bimetallic catalysts would help
clarify the role of each metal.
The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) has been
of great use in studying the structure of supported cata-
lysts, and of multicomponent catalysts in particular. The
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which
is one area of XAFS, contains information on local atomic
arrangement about each individual type of absorber atom
as described in theoretical formula based on the single con-
tribution to XAFS (5). On the other hand, X-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES), which represents electronic
transitions from inner electronic levels to outer unoccu-
pied levels caused by X-ray absorption, reveals information
on the electronic structure of condensed matter, including
differences in chemical environment, the oxidation state
in complex, and so on (6, 7). Since this short-range order
characteristic of XAFS avoids the limitations of some other
physical and chemical probes, many investigators have ap-
plied XAFS to obtain information on supported catalysts
since the seventies. Sinfelt extensively studied bimetal-
lic catalysts such as rutheniumcopper, osmiumcopper,
platinumiridium, and platinumruthenium by means of
EXAFS as a structural tool (8). For PtMo catalyst, Samant
et al. have employed EXAFS and anomalous wide-angle
X-ray scattering (AWAXS) to investigate the structure of
PtMo bimetallic clusters which were prepared by the de-
position of Mo(CO)6 vapor on preformed Pt/Yzeolites
(9, 10). It was concluded that Pt in the bimetal clusters had
an atomic structure similar to that of bulk Pt and was sur-
rounded by epitaxially deposited Mo. Because of the epi-
taxy, MoMo and MoPt distances in the bimetallic clusters
were found to be identical to that of PtPt.
The unique structural features of MoPt/Y-zeolite re-
ported by Samant et al. (9, 10) may have originated from the
unconventional preparation method, of chemical vapor de-
position on preformed Pt clusters. Hence, in the present
work, we have studied the MoPt bimetallic catalysts

prepared by the conventional method of impregnation us-
ing aqueous solutions of inorganic metal salts. The se-
quence of metal addition and the temperature of reduction
were varied and the catalysts were characterized mainly by
XAFS. The activity in CO hydrogenation of bimetallic cat-
alysts was compared with that of monometallic Pt or Mo
catalysts.
EXPERIMENTAL
Sample Preparation
The
materials
for
the
catalyst
preparation
were
(NH4)6Mo7O24 · 4H2O
(Aldrich)
and
H2PtCl6 · 6H2O
(Strem Chemicals, 38.85% Pt) as the metal precursors.
The support for the metals was γ -Al2O3 (Alfa, 99%,
3.2 mm pellets) crushed into the powder of 60100 mesh
(BET area, 202 m2 g1; porosity which is defined as pore
volume of a particle divided by the total volume of the
particle, 0.43). For the monometallic catalysts, a solution
of a metal salt was added to γ -Al2O3 by incipient wetness
impregnation in an amount that would give 5 wt% loading
of the metal. The catalysts were then dried for 12 h at 380 K
and calcined for 12 h at 770 K. The three kinds of bimetallic
catalysts denoted as MoPt/γ -Al2O3, PtMo/γ -Al2O3,
and Mo + Pt/γ -Al2O3 were prepared with variation of the
order of addition of molybdenum and platinum. In the
case of MoPt/γ -Al2O3, Mo/γ -Al2O3 was prepared first
and following the drying and calcination steps, the solution
of platinum salt was added by incipient impregnation with
the 1 : 1 atomic ratio of molybdenum to platinum keeping
the Pt loading at 5 wt%. The resulting bimetallic catalysts
were then treated by the same drying and calcination
procedures as in the case of monometallic catalysts.
Similarly, the PtMo/γ -Al2O3 catalysts were prepared
by the addition of the solution of molybdenum salt to
calcined Pt/γ -Al2O3 and treated under the same drying
and calcination conditions. Mo + Pt/γ -Al2O3 catalysts
were prepared by coimpregnation.
XAFS Measurements and Data Analysis
For the XAFS measurements, the prepared catalysts
were pelletized into a appropriate thickness that would give
the absorbance of ca. 1 at the edge energy. Thus, the opti-
mum thickness depended on the kind of metal and X-ray
absorption edge. The sample disc was placed in a cell de-
signed for in situ experiments (11). The catalyst discs in the
U-tube reactor with the attached spectroscopic cell were
reduced in flowing H2 at one of three temperatures: either
773, 973, or 1073 K, for 2 h. After the sample treatment,
the reactor was inverted for the sample to be sent into the
bottom part of the cell and located between two Kapton
windows where X-ray would pass through during the mea-
surement. Then, the cell was disconnected from the reactor
by a flame, with the sample still under the same gas atmo-
sphere as for the reduction.
XAFS measurements for the samples in the sealed spec-
troscopic cell were performed on BL10B of Photon Factory
(electron energy in the storage ring, 2.5 GeV; maximum
current, 360 mA) in National Laboratory for High Energy
Physics (KEK) in Japan. At room temperature, the spectra
were taken for K-edges of Mo with the detector gases of
Ar(100%) for the incident beam and N2(85%) + Ar(15%)
for the transmitted beam, and LIII-edges of Pt with detector
gases of Ar(100%) and N2(75%) + Ar(15%), respectively.
The
obtained
XAFS
data
were
analyzed
by
the
R-space method with UWXAFS 3.0 package and FEFF
6 code with the license from University of Washington
(5). The initial data, which had been converted to the
proper format for UWXAFS program, were first subject
to preedge subtraction so as to remove the effects due
to absorption by another edge or by other components.
The preedge region was fitted with a polynomial spline
and then extrapolated beyond the edge and subtracted
from total absorption to give the elemental absorption
(E). To get EXAFS function χ(k), which is defined by
χ(E) = [(E)0(E)]/0(E), the unknown 0(E) was ap-
proximated by a smooth curve spline(E). Then, the post-
edge background removed 1(E) = (E)0(E) was nor-
malized with respect to 0(E). The EXAFS function χ(k) of
momentum space was converted to real space, i.e., R-space
by the Fourier transformation to obtain the radial struc-
tural function (RSF) for each sample (12, 13). The range 1k
for the Fourier transformation was 2.3014.45 ( 
A1) for Pt
LIII-edges and 2.2012.80 ( 
A1) for Mo K-edges, with Han-
ning window sills and window sill width of dk = 1.0. The
standards for fitting were theoretically synthesized with the
FEFF code and the data were fitted in the R-space. A single
adjustable parameter in XAFS analysis, amplitude reduc-
tion factor (S2
0) was taken to be 0.95 for Pt and 0.83 for Mo,
which were found by fitting of experimental RSFs of metal
foils with theoretical ones.
CO Chemisorption
About 0.25 g of catalyst was loaded into a cell for
chemisorption, reduced in flowing H2, and then purged with
He at temperature slightly higher than the reduction tem-
perature to remove all hydrogen adsorbed during the re-
duction. The cell was moved to a conventional volumet-
ric adsorption apparatus (Micrometrics Model AccuSorb
2100E) without exposure of the sample to air. Before mea-
suring CO uptake, the sample was evacuated for 2 h at
423 K to a pressure less than 103 Pa and cooled under
vacuum to room temperature. The first CO isotherm was
taken at increasing CO pressures and following evacuation
at room temperature for 1 h, the second isotherm was taken
in a similar way. The amount of irreversible CO uptake was
366
CHOI AND LEE
obtained from the difference between the two isotherms
which were extrapolated to zero pressure.
CO Hydrogenation
Before the reaction, the catalysts were treated under the
same pretreatment conditions as those for XAFS measure-
ments. CO hydrogenation was carried out in a flow reactor
at 573 K and atmospheric pressure with H2/CO feed ratio of
3.0. The reaction products were analyzed using a gas chro-
matograph (Perkin Elmer, Model 8500) equipped with a
thermal conductivity detector and a 1.5 m long, 3.2 mm di-
ameter column packed with Porapak-Q materials by which
CO, CO2, and CH4 were analyzed, and a flame ionization
detector and a 3.0 m long, 3.2 mm diameter column packed
with Porapak-Q materials by which hydrocarbons including
CH4 were analyzed.
RESULTS
CO Chemisorption and CO Hydrogenation
The result of CO Chemisorption for (Mo,Pt)/γ -Al2O3 is
given in Table 1. The CO uptakes of Pt/γ -Al2O3 are gener-
ally large. However, CO uptakes of Mo/γ -Al2O3 are very
small on three reduction temperatures, indicating the dif-
ficulty involved in the reduction of Mo/γ -Al2O3. For the
bimetallic catalysts, CO uptakes stand between those of
Pt/γ -Al2O3 and Mo/γ -Al2O3 and decrease slightly as the
reduction temperature increases.
Meanwhile, the activities for CO hydrogenation of the
catalysts reduced at 773 K (A), 973 K (B), and 1173 K (C)
are given in Fig. 1. In almost all cases, the CO activities
are very large for bimetallic catalysts compared with those
for monometallic catalysts. The activities are expressed in
terms of apparent turnover frequencies (TOF) defined as
numbers of CO molecule converted to products per second
per site measured by CO chemisorption at room tempera-
ture. As the reduction temperature of the catalyst increases,
increase in activity was evident. Furthermore, there was a
rapiddecreaseincatalyticactivityasthereactionproceeded
for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at 1173 K.

EXAFS and XANES of Monometallic Catalysts
The weighted EXAFS function k3χ(k) and RSF for Pt/γ -
Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2. The peak position and the shape
in RSF are nearly same as those of Pt foil. The coordina-
tion numbers of monometallic catalysts are all similar and
substantially smaller than that of bulk platinum metal as
shown in Table 2. The PtPt interatomic distance is con-
sistently smaller than that of bulk Pt. The DebyeWaller
factors for supported catalysts, which are an index of the
disorder both in structural and thermal aspects, are larger
than that of bulk Pt.
The EXAFS analysis of Mo/γ -Al2O3, shown in Fig. 3,
is more complicated due to the substantial overlap of two
peaks located at radial distances between 2 and 3 
A that
resulted from the backscattering by the first and the second
nearest neighbor molybdenum atoms. The actual distances
corresponding to these peaks are 2.725 and 3.149 
A. This
was also confirmed by a theoretical calculation with FEFF6.
The calculation with only the first nearest neighbor atoms
gave a peak at the same position as for the first peak in
Fig. 3B between 2 and 3 
A and the calculation with only the
second nearest neighbors gave a peak at the same position
as that for the second peak. Samant et al. also treated this
problem in their study by using a two-shell fit of χ(k) for
the Mo foil (10). Accordingly, we used two paths as the

Mo might be well dispersed on the support. This is consis-
tent with the qualitative result that the magnitude of the
MoMo peak in Mo/γ -Al2O3 is just one-seventh of that in
Mo foil (Fig. 3).
As shown in Fig. 4, the XANES of Pt LIII-edge of Pt/γ -
Al2O3 does not show any difference from that of Pt foil,
whereas there exists significant difference between the
XANES of Mo foil and that of Mo/γ -Al2O3.
EXAFS and XANES of Bimetallic Catalysts
Owing to the contribution from the second shell atoms
in Mo, we considered the following EXAFS functions for
the bimetallic catalysts,

all bimetallic samples were carried out first for Pt LIII-edges
using three standards, then, based on the criterion for fit-
ting of bimetallic catalysts that the distance on absorber
backscatterer pair on either side of edge should be the same
(8), the second fitting was performed for Mo K-edges with

spectra contain about 12 structural parameters, it becomes
less meaningful to get all the parameters for each standard.
Thus we did not considered the DebyeWaller factors for
the standards containing the second shell Mo atom whose
effect was found to be insignificant.
The RSFs of PtMo/γ -Al2O3 are given in Fig. 5 for Pt
LIII-edge (A) and for Mo K-edge (B), respectively. There
are no extra metalmetal peaks which would represent the
alloy formation between Pt and Mo in either case. Yet, this
is an expected result because of the similarity between in-

asymmetric peak shape in the RSF for Pt LIII-edge strongly
suggests the presence of a metalmetal distance other than
the PtPt distance.
The curve fitting results of PtMo/γ -Al2O3 are given in
Table 3. With increasing treatment temperatures, the dis-
tance between molybdenum atoms decreases, while that
between platinum and molybdenum increases slightly. But,
the distance between platinum atoms does not show any
variation with the treatment temperature. The coordina-
tion numbers of PtPt in PtMo/γ -Al2O3 are about 7, and
those of MoPt and PtMo increase with increasing treat-
ment temperature, implying increased formation of an al-
loy. However, the coordination number of MoMo is very
small, like that of MoMo in Mo/γ -Al2O3, and shows a

rapid increase with increasing reduction temperatures. In
PtMo/γ -Al2O3 reduced at 773 K, the existence of MoMo
distances is barely identified with a very small magnitude
of the peak, in Fig. 5B.
The results of curve fitting of MoPt/γ -Al2O3 and Mo +
Pt/γ -Al2O3 are also given in Table 4. In two systems, for
each absorberbackscatterer pair, the coordination num-
bers are nearly the same as those in PtMo/γ -Al2O3. Only
the coordination number of PtPt in MoPt/γ -Al2O3 is a
little smaller than those found in other samples.
As far as XANES of Pt LIII-edge is concerned, there is
no difference in shape among Pt/γ -Al2O3, PtMo/γ -Al2O3,
and Pt foil, as shown in Fig. 4A. Nevertheless, white line ar-
eas of Pt LIII-edge for bimetallic catalysts, which are known
to be proportional to the number of d-band holes (7), are
smaller than those of Pt/γ -Al2O3 catalysts and similar to
that of Pt foil (Table 5). XANES of Mo K-edge for MoPt/
γ -Al2O3 shown in Fig. 4B has significantly different shapes
from that of Mo foil, and is very similar to that of Mo/γ -
Al2O3 reduced at 773 K. As the reduction temperature in-
creases, XANES of Pt LIII-edge for PtMo/γ -Al2O3 does
not show any change, but that of Mo K-edge shows a sig-

nificant change that makes the spectra look more like the

DISCUSSION
The coordination number of PtPt in Pt/γ -Al2O3, which
is smaller than that in Pt foil, indicates that platinum is well
dispersed over the γ -Al2O3 support. Also, a larger Debye
Waller factor suggests that the supported platinum particles
have more disordered structure compared to bulk Pt. The
differenceinPtPtdistanceissmall,butconsistentlyshorter
for supported samples. As shown in Table 5, the supported
Pt shows increased white line area of Pt LIII-edge relative to
Pt foil, indicating an electron deficient state in Pt/γ -Al2O3.
The addition of Mo reduces the white line areas of Pt to-
ward the values of Pt foil. The contraction of PtPt distance
and increased white line areas for supported Pt catalysts rel-
ative to bulk Pt are often observed (14, 15) and have been
attributed to the small size of metal clusters (16). The con-
version of the state of Pt in Pt/γ -Al2O3 into a state closer
to that of bulk Pt by the addition of Mo may be taken as
evidence for an electronic interaction between two metals.
Unlike the RSF of Pt/γ -Al2O3, the RSF of Mo/γ -Al2O3
shows unusual peaks in the distances of 12 
A, indicating
the existence of light backscatterer atoms. These peaks are
not originated from the presence of molybdenum oxides
in the samples, because RSF and XANES of MoO2 and
MoO3 are markedly different from that of Mo/γ -Al2O3.
The other possibility is the interaction between Mo and
the support γ -Al2O3. If this is the case, an intermetallide
species such as Al2(MoO4)3 may be formed during the cal-
cination and/or reduction process. The theoretical RSF of
Al2(MoO4)3, synthesized with the theoretical XAFS code
FEFF 6, is shown in Fig. 3B. The position of the major peaks
does not correspond exactly to those of the peaks observed
for Mo/γ -Al2O3. Yet, the closeness in positions of these
peaks suggests the presence of similar intermetallic species
in Mo/γ -Al2O3. After all, it is not expected that the species
would have the stoichiometry and structure as well defined
as theoretical Al2(MoO4)3.

CHOI AND LEE
Such a strong interaction is also reflected in XANES
of Mo/γ -Al2O3. The marked difference between Mo foil
and Mo/γ -Al2O3 in peak shape represents the different
states of molybdenum in catalyst and Mo foil. The shape
of XANES observed for Mo/γ -Al2O3 was usually observed
when molybdenum forms a compound (1719). Incomplete
reduction of molybdenum oxide does not appear to be the
main cause of the XANES feature, because it would have
shifted the edge position to a higher energy. Therefore, a
strong interaction between molybdenum and the support
appears responsible.
The coordination numbers for Mo/γ -Al2O3 are too small
even considering the possibility of small particle sizes. Their
shape is probably not sphere but like a raft. It is well
known that MoO3 forms two-dimensional islands of one
to several atoms thick on alumina (20). This morphology of
the precursor may be maintained to some degree in reduced
catalysts.
An interesting observation for the bimetallic catalysts is
that the presence of the PtMo pair is indicated in RSF of
Pt EXAFS by the asymmetric shape of the largest peak be-
fore performing curve fitting. Unlike the result of Samant
et al. (9, 10), the PtMo distance is not same as the PtPt
distance. Thus, the asymmetric shape of peaks in RSFs in
Fig. 5 suggests the presence of PtMo scattering at a shorter
distance in addition to usual PtPt scattering. The results
of curve fitting of PtMo/γ -Al2O3 summarized in Table 3
confirm this observation. The result is not consistent with
that reported by Samant et al. who observed a single peak
in RSF and same distance for PtPt, PtMo, and MoMo
for PtMo/Y-zeolite catalysts prepared by the deposition
of Mo(CO)6 vapor on Pt/Y-zeolite. They concluded that
Mo was deposited epitaxially on Pt so that the MoMo and
PtMo distances were identical to the PtPt distance. It is
not clear if the difference stems from the different prepa-
ration methods or from the improved resolution of data
in the present study. In any case, the differences in PtPt,
PtMo, and MoMo distances are small (less than 0.12 
A)
and PtPt and MoMo distances are almost the same for
PtMo/γ -Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 773 and 973 K.
From the relative magnitudes of coordination numbers
of four absorberscatterer pairs, the PtMo/γ -Al2O3 can be
described as alloy clusters where platinum atoms are sur-
rounded by molybdenum. Thus, the MoMo coordination
number becomes smaller than PtPt because Mo is located
at the outer surface region, while Pt resides near the core
of the cluster. Furthermore, the MoMo distance is elon-
gated to accommodate itself to the underlying Pt lattice.
Hence, except for some minor details, the overall structure
of PtMo cluster described by Samant et al. (9, 10) is sim-
ilar to what is observed in the present work despite of the
widely different preparation methods.
An interesting observation was made when the MoPt/γ -
Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 973 K was exposed to air before

XAFS measurement. As shown in Fig. 6, the RSF for the
Pt LIII-edge does not change compared with that for unex-
posed samples. In contrast, new peaks appears below 2 
A
in the RSF from the Mo K-edge, which could be assigned
to the formation of molybdenum oxides. This is an indica-
tion that the molybdenum surrounds platinum core in the
bimetallic cluster.
The coordination numbers of MoPt/γ -Al2O3 and
Mo + Pt/γ -Al2O3 were similar to those of PtMo/γ -Al2O3.
Consequently, the overall structures of MoPt/γ -Al2O3
and Mo + Pt/γ -Al2O3 are not greatly different from that
of PtMo/γ -Al2O3. Thus, it is concluded that structure of
(Mo,Pt)/γ -Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts is not significantly af-
fected by the sequence of impregnation of each metal. The
result is a rather unexpected one because a stable structure
of the initially added metal oxide would have been formed
during the calcination step before the second metal was
added. The observation is understood if at least one compo-
nent is highly mobile during the final calcination or reduc-
tion steps. MoO3 is probably the mobile species which could
even be volatile at the calcination temperature of 770 K.
The structural feature of MoPt/Al2O3 discussed so far
has many things in common with that of CoPt/Al2O3 stud-
ied by Guczi and co-workers (2123). A structural model
based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
temperature-programmed reduction, and chemisorption of
CO and H2 suggested the presence of highly dispersed
PtMo BIMETALLIC CATALYSTS
371
platinum covered by metallic cobalt and a PtCo interphase.
In addition, the presence of hardly reducible cobalt oxide
layer was suggested. In the present study, no evidence has
been found for the formation of a molybdenum oxide al-
though molydenum oxides are known to be more difficult
to be reduced than cobalt oxides (24). The much higher re-
duction temperatures employed in the present study (773
1173 K) compared to those of their work (570720 K) may
be responsible for the difference.
All bimetallic catalysts showed higher CO conversions
and, in most cases, higher TOF values than monometal-
lic catalysts for CO hydrogenation. The low activity of
Pt/γ -Al2O3 is due to the intrinsic reactivity of the metal
which is fully reduced as indicated by a large amount of
CO chemisorption and XAFS results. Platinum is a known
poor catalyst for CO hydrogenation with turnover frequen-
cies (rate of CO conversion per site per unit time) about
two orders of magnitude smaller than that of Ru at 548 K
(25). In contrast, the low activity of Mo/Al2O3 appears to
be due to insufficient reduction as indicated by the very
small amount of CO uptake. As discussed under Intro-
duction, many early workers (13) attributed the high ac-
tivity of bimetallic PtMo catalysts to Pt which was elec-
tronically modified by the presence of Mo. This notion
has been changed, however, since the reactivity of well-
reduced molybdenum catalysts was recognized. Fully re-
duced Mo catalysts are highly active in CO hydrogenation
with turnover rates as high as those of Ru (26). Hence, in
CO hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts, the active site
should be reduced Mo and the addition of Pt may have
helped the reduction of molybdenum (22).
The conclusion that the active site of CO hydrogena-
tion is reduced Mo with insignificant contribution from Pt
sites makes CO chemisorption a less useful tool to count
the number of catalytically active sites. CO chemisorption
titrates both Mo and Pt nonselectively. Since the surface
fraction of reduced molybdenum is unknown, TOF values
represent weighted averages composed of low activity Pt
sites and high activity Mo sites.
Temperature of reduction had a complicated influence
on the bimetallic catalysts. EXAFS fitting showed similar
structural parameters such as coordination number and
interatomic distance for catalysts reduced at three tem-
peratures. However, TOF values of CO hydrogenation
show a substantial increase with the increase of reduction
temperature. Furthermore, as the reaction progressed, the
catalysts reduced at 1173 K lost its activity faster than those
reduced at 773 and at 973 K. Both effects appear to have
been due to a higher degree of reduction of active Mo sites
in bimetallic catalysts reduced at a higher temperature.
As indicated, as the reduction temperature increased,
XANES of Mo K-edge (Fig. 4B) for the catalysts became
more similar to that of Mo foil, indicating the existence of
more metallic Mo phase.
CONCLUSIONS
XAFS demonstrated the formation of PtMo alloy clus-
ters on γ -alumina when the bimetallic catalysts were pre-
pared by impregnation with respective metal salts. In the
alloy clusters, molybdenum seemed to segregate to the
surface and to adjust its metalmetal distance to that of
platinum which resides near the core of the clusters. This
structure did not depend on the sequence of metal ad-
dition onto the support. Almost all bimetallic (Mo,Pt)/
γ -Al2O3 catalysts were much more active in CO hydro-
genation than monometallic catalysts, Pt/γ -Al2O3 or Mo/γ -
Al2O3. Reduced Mo appeared to be the active sites for
the reaction and Pt seemed to help Mo sites become more
reduced.
