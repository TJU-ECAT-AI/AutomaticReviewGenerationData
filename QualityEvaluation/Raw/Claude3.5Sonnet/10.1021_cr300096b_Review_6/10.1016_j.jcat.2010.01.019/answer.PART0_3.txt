[1] "Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films [25] and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles [26] have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2."

[2] "The PtPt interatomic distances obtained through EXAFS fitting (Table 4) suggest that Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are in a strained state (the bulk PtPt distance is 2.77 Å; the PtPt distance in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is 2.75 Å)."

[3] "Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed in order to verify the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation, which was found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity."

The literature does not provide specific information about HREELS or AES techniques to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni or Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. The document mainly focuses on supported Pt/Ni catalysts rather than model surfaces. It mentions XPS studies showing Pt surface segregation after H2 reduction, and EXAFS measurements to characterize PtNi bimetallic bond formation, but does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation or compare experimental results with DFT predictions for these specific systems. The question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

文献中没有提供关于使用HREELS或AES技术来验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中氧诱导的Ni或Co表面偏析的具体信息。该文档主要关注负载型Pt/Ni催化剂，而不是模型表面。它提到了XPS研究显示H2还原后Pt表面偏析，以及使用EXAFS测量来表征PtNi双金属键形成，但没有讨论氧诱导的偏析或将实验结果与这些特定系统的DFT预测进行比较。仅基于本文档提供的信息无法完整回答该问题。
