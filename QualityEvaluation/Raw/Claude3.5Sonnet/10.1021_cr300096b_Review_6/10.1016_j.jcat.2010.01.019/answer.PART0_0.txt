The given literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, or oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on supported Pt/Ni catalysts and their characterization using FTIR, TEM, and EXAFS, as well as their performance in benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss the specific experimental techniques or systems mentioned in the question.
