If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, or oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on supported Pt/Ni catalysts and their characterization using FTIR, TEM, and EXAFS, as well as their performance in benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss the specific experimental techniques or systems mentioned in the question.

[1] "Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films [25] and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles [26] have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2."

[2] "The PtPt interatomic distances obtained through EXAFS fitting (Table 4) suggest that Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are in a strained state (the bulk PtPt distance is 2.77 Å; the PtPt distance in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is 2.75 Å)."

[3] "Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed in order to verify the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation, which was found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about HREELS or AES techniques to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of Ni or Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. The document mainly focuses on supported Pt/Ni catalysts rather than model surfaces. It mentions XPS studies showing Pt surface segregation after H2 reduction, and EXAFS measurements to characterize PtNi bimetallic bond formation, but does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation or compare experimental results with DFT predictions for these specific systems. The question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

文献中没有提供关于使用HREELS或AES技术来验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中氧诱导的Ni或Co表面偏析的具体信息。该文档主要关注负载型Pt/Ni催化剂，而不是模型表面。它提到了XPS研究显示H2还原后Pt表面偏析，以及使用EXAFS测量来表征PtNi双金属键形成，但没有讨论氧诱导的偏析或将实验结果与这些特定系统的DFT预测进行比较。仅基于本文档提供的信息无法完整回答该问题。
