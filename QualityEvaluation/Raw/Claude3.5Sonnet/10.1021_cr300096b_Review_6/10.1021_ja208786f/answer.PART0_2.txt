<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, or comparisons between measured segregation kinetics and DFT predictions. The document appears to be about glycolaldehyde reactions on monolayer Ni surfaces, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所提供的文献中没有包含任何关于HREELS和AES等实验技术、Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析、或测量的偏析动力学与DFT预测之间比较的信息。该文档似乎是关于单层Ni表面上的乙醛酸反应，与所问的问题无关。因此，无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
