The given scientific literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms like Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, or related DFT predictions. The document appears to focus on the preparation and catalytic properties of a bimetallic SnPt complex in NaY zeolite, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的科学文献不包含任何关于HREELS、AES、Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子(如Ni和Co)的氧诱导表面偏析,或相关DFT预测的信息。该文档似乎主要关注NaY沸石中双金属SnPt复合物的制备和催化性质,这与所问问题无关。因此,无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
