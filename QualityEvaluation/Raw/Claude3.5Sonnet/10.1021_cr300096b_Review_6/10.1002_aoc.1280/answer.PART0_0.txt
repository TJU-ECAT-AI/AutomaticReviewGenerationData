The given scientific literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, or Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on the preparation and catalytic properties of a bimetallic SnPt complex in NaY zeolite, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
