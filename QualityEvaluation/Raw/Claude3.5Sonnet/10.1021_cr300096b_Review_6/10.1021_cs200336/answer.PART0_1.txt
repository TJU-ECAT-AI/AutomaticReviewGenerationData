The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques like HREELS or AES being used to verify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. There is also no mention of segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for these specific systems. The document focuses on different topics related to catalysis of oxygenated compounds and does not cover the specific experimental techniques or bimetallic systems mentioned in the question.
