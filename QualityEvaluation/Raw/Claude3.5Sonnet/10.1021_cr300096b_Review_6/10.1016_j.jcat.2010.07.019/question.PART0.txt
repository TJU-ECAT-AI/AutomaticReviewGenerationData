Reaction pathways have been explored with periodic DFT calculations in order to understand the origin of
the high selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 surface
alloy. The adsorption structures of butadiene, 1- and 2-butenes and all the intermediate species have
been studied. Compared to the reference catalyst Pt(1 1 1), there is a change both in geometries and in
relative energies: for instance, the best adsorption mode of butadiene is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, while it is
trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, all the adsorption energies are reduced compared to pure
platinum, and the adsorption structures implying many PtAC bonds are more destabilized. The different
pathways leading to partial hydrogenation products (1-butene, 2-butene) or other intermediate surface
species (1,3- and 1,4-metallacycles) have been explored. The first hydrogenation step is clearly preferred
at a terminal carbon, and the further hydrogenation to 1-butene has by far the lowest barrier. Other path-
ways exhibit larger activation barriers, particularly those leading to metallacycles, which is the key to
explain the high selectivity to butene, in contrast to Pt(1 1 1). The role of tin is dual: a role of site blocking
that forces unselective pathways to adopt distorted, high-energy transition states and a role of ligand that
weakens the molecular adsorption and allows decoordination of double bonds prior to the hydrogena-
tion, which decreases the energy barriers for the selective pathway to butene.

1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of dienes into mono-olefins is an
important industrial process for the purification of the alkene
streams used in polymerization. Group VIII metals like platinum
or palladium have been used for a long time as hydrogenation cat-
alysts for this reaction. Most of the studies are devoted to the partial
hydrogenation of the simplest diene, 1,3-butadiene, into butene. In
order to elucidate the origin of the selectivity (formation of butene
rather than butane), many experimental studies have been carried
out for two decades on the adsorption and hydrogenation of buta-
diene and butene on metallic single crystals [17] or on metal par-
ticles dispersed on silica or alumina [811]. The following
conclusions arose from these various works: Pd is almost totally
selective in butene, whereas Pt leads to a mixture of butene and bu-
tane, the latter being partly formed as primary product of the reac-
tion. Depending on the experimental conditions and on the
percentage of conversion, the selectivity to butenes is in the range
6587%, with about 7080% of 1-butene and 3020% of 2-butenes.
The most commonly admitted interpretation of this different
behavior rests on the different competitive adsorption energies of
butadiene and butene on the two metals. To verify this assumption,
the adsorption structures of 1,3-butadiene and of butenes (1- and
2-butene) have been investigated by theoretical calculations [12
14]. In the two latter papers, the difference between the adsorption
energies of butadiene and butenes has been found very similar on
Pt and Pd and hence it cannot account for the observed selectivity.
Moreover, the formation of butane as a primary product cannot be
explained by considering only reaction thermodynamics.
To solve this question, a theoretical study of the hydrogenation
mechanism on Pt and Pd has been tackled recently [15]. In this
work, the role of dihydrogenated C4H8 metallacycle intermediate
species, obtained by 1-3 or 2-3 hydrogenation, is underlined. These
species cannot desorb from the surface and can evolve to butane by
hydrogenation. The activation barriers for the formation of such
species are high on Pd(1 1 1) and they cannot compete with the
formation of butene. Conversely on Pt(1 1 1), their formation is
as probable as that of butene, which explains the lower selectivity
toward this compound and the formation of butane as a primary
product.
To enhance the selectivity toward butene, other types of cata-
lysts have been tested, namely alloys of platinum or palladium. It
is well known that alloying these metals with another one deeply
modifies their catalytic properties. Tin is often used as second me-
tal. For example, one can cite PdSn particles deposited on alumina

[16,17], the (1 1 1) surface of the Pt3Sn alloy [18] or ordered PtxSn/
Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys [19]. These model catalysts are less active
than the pure metal but more selective toward butene. In the case
of the Pt/Sn alloys, the selectivity to butenes ranges from 98% to
100%, with about 80% of 1-butene. The same behavior has also
been found for the Pd/Au alloy [20]. These results raise the ques-
tion of the role of the second metal in the selectivity enhancement.
In order to answer this question, we have explored the path-
ways for butadiene hydrogenation on the Pt/Sn surface alloys,
more precisely on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)-(p3  p3)R30 on the basis of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In the present paper,
we first report on the adsorption structures of butadiene, 1- and
2-butenes, and hydrogen on this surface. In a second part, we
address the mechanism of the butadiene partial hydrogenation
and compare it with the one found for Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1). More
particularly, we compare the formation of the various C4H8 species
that we have shown to be the key of the selectivity on these two
metals.
2. Computational details
The calculations were performed in the framework of the den-
sity functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation
Program (VASP) [2123]. The one-electron functions are developed
on a basis of plane waves. The electronion interactions were de-
scribed by the projector-augmented wave method (PAW) intro-
duced by Blchl [24] and adapted by Kresse and Joubert [25]. A
tight convergence of the plane-wave expansion was obtained with
a cutoff of 400 eV. The exchangecorrelation energy and potential
were described by the generalized gradient approximation (Per-
dewWang 91) [26].
The surface alloy was modeled by a periodic four-layer slab,
where only the first layer contains Sn atoms in a stoichiometry
Pt2Sn. Indeed, by Sn vapor deposition on Pt(1 1 1) followed by
annealing, two structures are formed depending on the amount
of Sn, namely (2  2) with stoichiometry Pt3Sn and (p3 
p3)R30 with stoichiometry Pt2Sn [27]. XPD data have shown that
these compounds are two-dimensional surface alloys [28]. Each
slab is separated from its periodic image in the z direction by a suf-
ficiently large vacuum space corresponding to five layers (11.5 Å).
3  3 supercells containing nine atoms per layer are used (see
Fig. 1). The 2D Brillouin zone integrations have been performed
on a 3  3  1 MonkhorstPack grid since it was found to be
accurate as well as computationally efficient for this cell size.
The PtPt distance optimized from Pt bulk calculations (2.82 Å)
has been used for the frozen part of the slab. This is justified by
the fact that experimentally the lattice parameter is imposed by
the underlying Pt bulk, and the Sn atoms in the uppermost layer
accommodate this constraint by an outward displacement, induc-
ing a PtSn distance of 2.86 Å.
Adsorption and reaction were performed on one side of the me-
tal slab with one molecule adsorbed per unit cell, which gives a
coverage h = 1/9. The geometries of the two uppermost layers of
the surface together with the adsorbate (C4Hx , x = 68 species)
were fully optimized, whereas the two lowest metal planes were
kept fixed. The adsorption modes and the corresponding adsorp-
tion energies for all the C4Hx moieties were determined. The reac-
tion intermediates were studied on different adsorption sites. For
sake of simplicity, only the most stable structures are reported
here. Coadsorption with hydrogen has also been explored in detail
by comparing various possible situations.
The energy along the reaction (Ereact) was calculated using buta-
diene and H2 in the gas phase as the energy reference with the fol-
lowing expression:
Ereact  Esyst=surface  Esurface  EC4H6g  EH2g
A negative value indicates an exothermic chemisorption process.
The system is a C4Hx species and (8  x) hydrogen atoms (x = 6, 7,
8) adsorbed on the surface. If we consider that the hydrogen atoms
and the hydrocarbon do not initially interact, the Esyst/surface term is
then obtained by combining the results from independent slab cal-
culations for the molecular species and the hydrogen atoms:
Esyst=surface  EC4Hx=surface  8  xEH=surface  Esurface
In order to directly compare with previous results, the adsorption
energy for the species existing in the gas phase has also been re-
ported (Eads  EC4Hx=surface  Esurface  EC4Hx). The energies of the tran-
sition states (ETS) were calculated with respect to adsorbed
butadiene and two adsorbed hydrogen atoms without interaction.
In order to obtain more detailed insights into the changes of
adsorption energy, it is decomposed in deformation energy and
interaction energy terms following the equation:
Eads  EInt  EDef;Mol  EDef;Surf
where EDef,Mol and EDef,Surf are the deformation energies of the mol-
ecule and of the surface, respectively, calculated as the difference
between the energies of the optimized geometry of the considered
moiety and of the geometry it has in the adsorbed system. EInt is the
interaction energy between the two moieties in their deformed
geometry.
The Nudged Elastic Band method (NEB), developed by Jnsson
and coworkers [29], has been used to determine the transition
states, with sets of 8 or 16 intermediate images along the reaction
pathways. The obtained approximate transition states have been
refined by minimizing residual forces below 0.01 eV/Å with the
quasi-Newton algorithm implemented in VASP. To validate the
saddle points, a vibrational analysis including adsorbate and re-
laxed substrate degrees of freedom has been performed. The pres-
ence of a single imaginary frequency (negative force constant) and
the consistency of the corresponding normal mode with the reac-
tion path have been checked.
The prediction of atomistic thermodynamics in reaction condi-
tions is crucial here. A simple way to estimate the stability of the
reactant and the products on the catalytic surface is the prediction
of the Gibbs free adsorption energy DGads, according to the follow-
ing formula (see [30] and references therein for the elaboration of
the corresponding model):

3. Adsorption of the species involved in the mechanism, C4Hx
(x = 68) and H
Scheme 1 summarizes the different steps for the dihydrogena-
tion of 1,3-butadiene. The first hydrogen can attack at C1 or C2 giv-
ing either 3-buten-1-yl or 1-buten-3-yl, respectively, adsorbed on
the surface. These species can be further hydrogenated at three
possible positions giving either 1-butene or 2-butene that can des-
orb in the gas phase or butan-1,3 and 1,4-diyls that remain ad-
sorbed on the surface and can evolve to butane by further
hydrogenations. The study of the adsorption structures and corre-
sponding energies of all these species is a prerequisite to the inves-
tigation into the reactivity and selectivity. The molecules existing
in the gas phase are first explored.
3.1. Adsorption of 1,3-butadiene and butenes on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)
A large number of adsorption geometries have been considered
for 1,3-butadiene on the surface alloy. We have previously noticed
that the binding of the carbon atoms to tin atoms is not favored
[31]. Hence, the presence of tin reduces the number of adsorption
possibilities and favors some conformations over others. As a
result, the trans 1,2,3,4-tetra-r structure that is the most stable
on Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1) does not exist anymore on the Pt2Sn/
Pt(1 1 1) alloy, since the necessary ensemble of 4 Pt atoms is not
found on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1). The most stable adsorbed structure
on the alloy is cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p, as it can be seen in Table 1,
followed by trans 1,2-p-3,4-p. Two other structures have also
favorable
adsorption
energies,
trans
1,2-p-3,4-di-r
and
cis
1,2-p-3,4-p, although 20 kJ mol1 less stable. The structures where
the molecule is bound by only one double bond are significantly
less stable (40 kJ mol1), with nevertheless a smaller difference
than on Pt(1 1 1) (60 kJ mol1). The various optimized adsorption
geometries are shown in Fig. 2.
Hence, the most stable conformation of butadiene on Pt2Sn/
Pt(1 1 1) is the cis one (by 11 kJ mol1), whereas in the gas phase,
it is the trans one (by 17 kJ mol1). However, the inter-conversion
is associated with a low barrier. In gas phase, this barrier is
31 kJ mol1. On the surface, a complex multistep low-energy path-
way was found. From the trans 1,2-p-3,4-p structure, the molecule
first moves to the trans 1,2-p-3,4-di-r geometry with a barrier of
40 kJ mol1 (see Fig. 2). Then, the C1AC2 double bond decoordi-
nates and the trans 3,4-di-r form is obtained with a barrier of
30 kJ mol1. The rotation around C2AC3 occurs at this stage with
a barrier of 26 kJ mol1, giving the cis 3,4-di-r structure. Finally,
the most stable cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form is obtained by a rotation
of the molecule and the recoordination of the C1AC2 double bond
with almost no barrier (3 kJ mol1). Hence, in gas phase or on the
surface, transcis isomerization is fast, and hence the butadiene
structures will quickly equilibrate to a predominant most stable
cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p structure, which has been selected as the start-
ing point for the hydrogenation pathway exploration.
For 1- and 2-butenes, the two possible adsorption geometries
(di-r and p) have also been compared. There is a change in the rel-
ative order of this two geometries compared to Pt(1 1 1): on the al-
loy, the p form becomes as stable as the di-r one, and even more
stable in the case of 2-butene. All these results are also collected in
Table 1, and the structures are shown in Fig. 3.
For all the species, the PtAC bond lengths are in the same range
as those found on Pt(1 1 1) (2.132.23 Å) [14] except for the trans
1,2-p-3,4-di-r structure, where a long PtAC2 bond is found. The

CAC bonds involved in the adsorption have the characteristic
lengths for a di-r adsorption (1.471.53 Å) or a p adsorption
(1.411.43 Å), the difference being explained by a stronger hybrid-
ization toward sp3 in the case of the di-r adsorption type. Com-
pared to the values previously found on Pt(1 1 1) [14], the
adsorption energies on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) are much smaller. A de-
crease of 76 kJ mol1 is observed for butadiene (74 vs. 150 kJ mol1
for the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form), of 52 kJ mol1 for 1-butene and of
51 kJ mol1 for 2-butene. The calculated adsorption energies of
butadiene and 1-butene on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) (74 and 49 kJ mol1)
are in very good agreement with the values deduced from TPD
experiments (75 and 54 kJ mol1, respectively) [32,33]. Such a de-
crease in the adsorption energy of alkenes on the Pt/Sn alloys com-
pared to pure Pt has been observed experimentally [33] and has
been explained by DFT calculations [31,34,35]. The occupied d-
band center is lower below the Fermi level for Pt2Sn (2.57 eV)
than for Pt (2.39 eV) [35]. This results in a smaller interaction
with the p system of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, an elec-
tronic transfer occurs from Sn to Pt, and the surface Pt atoms are
more negatively charged on the alloy, which induces larger Pauli
repulsions.
An interesting feature on the alloy is the similarity between the
adsorption energies of the di-r and the p structures in the case of
the butene molecules, whereas these energies are very different on
pure platinum. For the cis 2-butene, the p form is even more stable
than the di-r one. An explanation can be derived from the decom-
position of the adsorption energy into deformation energy and
interaction energy. Results for this decomposition are given in Ta-
ble 2. At first glance, it is obvious that the di-r geometries are
more deformed than the p ones and that the trans 2-butene is more
deformed than the cis 2-butene. Such a decomposition has already
been performed on Pt(1 1 1) for the two isomers of 2-butene [36].
The given explanation rests on the fact that cis 2-butene can more
easily accommodate on the surface than trans 2-butene which has
to distort much. When compared to Pt(1 1 1), the total deformation
energy is globally higher on the alloy, the increase being larger for
the di-r forms than for the p ones. This is essentially due to the
surface deformation, as it was already pointed out that the Pt/Sn
alloy surface deforms more than that of Pt(1 1 1) upon alkene
adsorption [37]. It results that the adsorption energy of the p forms
is less decreased than that of the di-r forms when Pt is alloyed
with Sn. This change in the relative stability of the di-r and p
forms on the alloy explains the large decrease of the adsorption en-
ergy of butadiene on the alloy compared to pure platinum and the
change in the relative stability order of the structures.

experiments on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) single-crystal surfaces were per-
formed at 360 K for a total pressure of reactant of 15 Torr [18].
The Gibbs free adsorption energy diagrams of 1,3-butadiene, 1-bu-
tene, and cis and trans 2-butene have been plotted in Fig. 4 for
Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) at fixed pressure or fixed temperature.
In each case, only the most stable adsorption structure has been
considered. On Pt(1 1 1), the reactant and the first hydrogenation
products are adsorbed on the catalyst around 360 K and at 15 Torr,
the butenes being far less strongly adsorbed than butadiene. For a
larger partial pressure of 1 atm, our results for butadiene and 1-bu-
tene differ significantly from those published previously in terms
of desorption temperature [13]. This results from the different
choice of the coverage (lower coverage in our case). More impor-
tantly, the implementation of the vibrational entropic contribu-
tions for both the adsorbed and the gas phases is essential to
predict these diagrams according to our more complete thermody-
namic model. On the alloy, the systematic marked weakening of
the adsorption significantly shifts the stability domains to lower
temperature regions. The major consequence is a weak adsorption
for butadiene in the 360 K region and a spontaneous desorption of
the butenes from the surface alloy, without possible further hydro-
genation, as soon as these products are formed during the reaction.
This thermodynamic result is one argument in favor of a high
selectivity to butenes on the alloy. However, this explanation is
only valid if the partial hydrogenation selectively forms butene
by 1-2 or 1-4 hydrogenation and not metallacycle intermediates
by 1-3 or 2-3 hydrogenation. These strongly bound metallacycles
would yield butane as a primary product as on Pt(1 1 1) [15].
Hence, in order to resolve this point, we have explored the possible
hydrogenation pathways on the alloy.
3.3. Adsorbed structures of the radical (C4H7) and diradical (C4H8)
species on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)
Since we will only focus in the present study on the cis confor-
mation of 1,3-butadiene for studying the reactivity, all the derived
species will have the cis configuration. Fig. 5 shows the adsorption
structures of the radicals obtained after the first and the second
hydrogenation.
1-buten-3-yl
and

are
adsorbed
through three carbons giving a p-r and a tri-r arrangement,
respectively. The butan-1,3 and 1,4-diyl diradicals are bound to
the surface by two carbon atoms forming five-member and six-
member metallacycles, respectively. The PtAC and CAC bond
lengths of all these species are given in Table 2. The PtAC bonds
are in the same range as before (2.122.21 Å) with only an excep-
tion for 1-buten-3-yl (2.27 Å). The C3AC4 bond length in 3-buten-
1-yl corresponds to a strong di-r adsorption type (1.50 Å). 1-bu-
ten-3-yl presents an allylic arrangement and the C2AC3 and
C3AC4 bond lengths are rather similar (1.42 and 1.47 Å).
In order to compare the relative stability of all the species in-
volved in the study, the reaction energies, which are calculated fol-
lowing the formulae given in Section 2, have been collected in
Table 3. Like in the case of pure Pt, the allylic 1-buten-3-yl radical
is more stable than the 3-buten-1-yl radical. However, contrary to
the case of pure Pt, the hydrogenation reaction is exothermic on
the alloy. Indeed, we have noticed previously that 1,3-butadiene,
being bound to the surface by four bonds, is far more destabilized
by the presence of tin than the butene molecules, only adsorbed
through two bonds. If we consider the stability of the metallacycle
structures, butan-1,4-diyl is 7080 kJ mol1 less stable than the
butenes, and its formation is hence unlikely. In contrast, butan-
1,3-diyl is only 1020 kJ mol1 less stable than the butenes, and

its presence on the surface cannot be excluded from the single
thermodynamic argument.
3.4. Adsorption of hydrogen on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and coadsorption with
C4Hx species
The hydrogenation of the various C4Hx species following a Hor-
iutiPolanyi-type mechanism requires the presence of coadsorbed
hydrogen atoms on the surface. The possible adsorption sites for H
atom have been compared: two apical sites, one atop a Pt atom and
one atop a Sn atom (Scheme 2), one bridge site PtPt and the two
hollow sites (hcp and fcc) formed by two Pt and one Sn atoms. The
site atop a Sn atom is not stable (99 kJ mol1 less stable than the
atop Pt one), and the hollow sites evolve to the bridge PtPt site,
with a binding energy of 11 kJ mol1 relatively to 1/2 H2(g). The
most stable site is apical atop a Pt atom with a binding energy of
30 kJ mol1 relatively to 1/2 H2(g). The H atoms are less strongly ad-
sorbed on Pt2Sn than on Pt and are not on the same site since, on
Pt(1 1 1), the best adsorption site is the hollow hcp one with an en-
ergy of 50 kJ mol1, the top site being only slightly less stable
(45 kJ mol1). Hence, hydrogen, like carbon, does not bind to Sn
atoms. These results are at variance with those obtained by Fearon
et al. who found the PtPt bridge site more stable than the atop Pt
one [38].
The next step is the study of the coadsorption of the C4Hx spe-
cies with hydrogen. The C4Hx species have been considered in their
most stable adsorption site, and hydrogen has been placed at atop
Pt sites close to the C atom to be hydrogenated. Several atop Pt
positions around each species have been compared, and the most
stable have been chosen as initial for the search of the reaction
pathways. The various positions of the hydrogen atom around
butadiene, 1-buten-3-yl and 3-buten-1-yl are shown in Fig. 6.
The coadsorption induces a small destabilization not exceeding
0.1 eV, compared to the species adsorbed at infinite distance from
each other.

4. Reaction pathways
Starting from the previously described coadsorption systems,
the various hydrogenation steps shown in Scheme 1 have been ex-
plored and the corresponding transition states (TS) determined. For
each TS, the three important bond lengths, CAH, PtAH and PtAC,
are reported in Table 4 along with the TS energy relative to the sys-
tem formed by 1,3-butadiene and two hydrogen atoms adsorbed at
infinite distance (without any interaction) in their most stable
positions.
Following Scheme 1, the first hydrogenation step can occur at
C2, leading to 3-buten-1-yl or at C1 forming 1-buten-3-yl. The
starting point for the hydrogenation at C2 is H3 (Fig. 6). It is evident
that the approach of hydrogen is hindered by the tin atom. The
transition state TS1, shown in Fig. 7, looks like those already de-
scribed for hydrogenation of acrolein [39] or butadiene on
Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1) [15]: the three atoms Pt, C2 and H form a
three-member ring TS. However, the particular case here is that
C3 is adsorbed on the same platinum atom than H, which leads
to a Pt atom with too many ligands. This is the reason of the high
activation barrier (136 kJ mol1, see Table 4).
The starting point for the hydrogenation at C1 is either H1 or H2
(see Fig. 6). In each case, H can reach C1 without coming too close
to Sn. Whatever the starting point, the same TS is found (TS2) after
having passed through a hardly marked bridge intermediate (B in
Fig. 6). TS2 is also depicted in Fig. 7. The comparison of TS1 and
TS2 from Table 4 shows that TS2 is earlier than TS1 with shorter
PtAH and PtAC bonds and a longer CAH bond, which is related
to the lower barrier (92 kJ mol1).
Besides this classical mechanism, a second pathway exists
where the double bond to be hydrogenated decoordinates first,
leading to a di-r initial structure called butadiene g2, correspond-
ing to the cis 3,4-di-r form of butadiene (Fig. 2) coadsorbed with H.
This structure is 50 kJ mol1 less stable than the g4 form
corresponding to the cis 1,4-di-r-2,3-p form of butadiene (Fig. 2)
coadsorbed with H (see Fig. 8). The transition state for this decoor-
dination step (TS3) in only 2 kJ mol1 above g2 butadiene and has a
close geometry (compare Figs. 2 and 7 and Tables 1 and 3). Then,
the hydrogenation proceeds with a small barrier of 21 kJ mol1
through TS4. This pathway has hence the lowest overall barrier,
71 kJ mol1. The TS structure is a six-center member ring (Fig. 7),
in contrast to the usual three-center hydrogenation transition
states. The occurrence of such a TS has been recently commented
[40]. Attack at C2 leading to 3-buten-1-yl has also been tested
starting from butadiene g2. However, hydrogenation at C2 does
not occur on the decoordinated C@C bond because of high strain
in the molecule since C1 needs to bind on the surface. The pathway
leads to a recoordination to butadiene g4 and then follows the path
already described.
Starting from 3-buten-1-yl, three different attacks of a second H
atom are possible, leading to 1-butene, butan-1,3-diyl and butan-
1,4-diyl (Scheme 1) from positions H2, H4 and H3, respectively
(Fig. 6). The three pathways are single steps and the TS (TS5, TS6
and TS7) are close in energy, within 11 kJ mol1. Their activation
energies between 88 and 99 kJ mol1 are in the same range as
the ones found on Pt and Pd [15] and also in the case of the C@C
bond hydrogenation in acrolein [39]. These TS are represented in
Fig. 7 and described in Table 4. TS5 is reactant-like with short PtAH
and PtAC bonds and a long CAH bond. TS6 and TS7 are more prod-
ucts-like with slightly longer PtAH and PtAC bonds and a shorter
CAH bond.
Starting from 1-buten-3-yl, three different pathways are also
possible, leading to 1-butene, 2-butene and butan-1,3-diyl from
positions H3, H4 or H5 and H3, respectively (see Fig. 6). Both paths
leading to 2-butene from H4 and H5 are single steps. The corre-
sponding barriers differ by 4 kJ mol1 and only the path starting
from H4 will be described further. The transition state (TS8) has
intermediate bond lengths compared to TS1TS2 and TS5TS7,
which gives a not too high barrier (70 kJ mol1). The path leading
to butan-1,3-diyl can also be considered as a single step although
a shallow bridge intermediate (B in Fig. 6) has been found, as in
the case of TS2. The associated transition state (TS9) is more prod-
uct-like and is associated with a energy of 92 kJ mol1. The path
leading to 1-butene is more complicated since it presents three
steps. First, the hydrogen atom remains in position H3 and the or-
ganic species changes its adsorption mode from g3 to g1: carbon
atoms C2 and C3 decoordinate so that only C4 is bound to the sur-
face and a free double bond is restored between C2 and C3 (see
Fig. 9). This is reflected in the short C2AC3 bond, as shown in Table
2 for intermediate I1. The second step consists in the migration of H
to a second atop position nearer the organic species that keeps the
same structure (see Fig. 9). This second intermediate I2 has bond
lengths very similar to those of I1 (Table 3). The transition state
TS10 between the starting point and I1 represents the decoordina-
tion of the two carbon atoms and requires 29 kJ mol1. The second
transition state TS11 corresponds to the H migration between two
atop sites and needs 28 kJ mol1. Finally, the hydrogenation step
only requires 21 kJ mol1 (TS12). The three transition states are also
depicted in Fig. 7. Distances are not given in Table 3 for TS10 and
TS11 because they are not hydrogenation transition states. In
TS11, the hydrogen atom is in a real atop position with a short PtAH
bond (1.58 Å) and the organic moiety has a geometry close to that
of intermediate I1. It differs by a longer C2AC3 bond, which indi-
cates that the double bond is not totally formed, and by a shorter
bond between C3 and the Pt atom (3.0 Å in TS10 compared to
3.63 Å in I1). The geometry difference between TS11 and I2 comes
only from the position of the H atom that lies between two Pt
atoms in TS11. Finally, the transition state for hydrogenation,

TS12, has both a long PtAH and a long CAH bond. It must be spec-
ified that 1-butene is obtained here in the p adsorbed geometry,
which avoids the presence of a PtAC bond and a PtAH bond on
the same platinum atom. This path leading from 1-buten-3-yl to
1-butene illustrates again the existence of a six-member ring TS
where the decoordination of the double bond occurs prior to its
hydrogenation [40].
The hydrogenation at carbon C3 of intermediate I2 can also lead
to butan-1,3-diyl. However, this pathway is disfavored by ca.
40 kJ mol1 compared to the initial pathway occurring through
TS9. This is due to the difficult recoordination of C2, like in the case
of the hydrogenation of butadiene-g2 leading to 3-buten-1-yl. In
these two cases, the prior decoordination of the double bond is
not a favorable pathway.
Finally, 1-buten-3-yl can also adsorb on the surface through C2,
regenerating a double bond between C3 and C4. This species is
called I3 and is depicted on Fig. 9. The corresponding distances
are given in Table 3. It is 55 kJ mol1 less stable than 1-buten-3-
yl adsorbed in a g3 geometry. The hydrogenation at carbon C4
leading to 2-butene through TS13 only requires 15 kJ mol1. TS13
is described in Fig. 7 and Table 4. It is 20 kJ mol1 more stable than
TS8, showing the advantage of the prior decoordination in this case.
The comparison of the imaginary frequencies in Table 4 shows
that those corresponding to the hydrogenation of a decoordinated
double bond are smaller, which indicates softer modes along the
CAH bond formation process.
Fig. 8 summarizes the competitive reaction pathways starting
from butadiene and coadsorbed hydrogen to give the partial
hydrogenation products (C4H8), namely 1-butene, 2-butene and
metallacycles butan-1,3 and 1,4-diyl. The energy reference is the
energy of adsorbed 1,3-butadiene and two adsorbed hydrogen
atoms at infinite distances (without interaction). The pathway
passing through the formation of 3-buten-1-yl is represented at
the top of Fig. 8 and the one passing through the formation of 1-bu-
ten-3-yl is represented at the bottom. The difference between the
two paths is obvious. In the former, the first step leading to 3-bu-
ten-1-yl by attack at carbon C2 is highly activated (136 kJ mol1)
compared to that leading to 1-buten-3-yl by attack at the terminal
carbon C1 (71 kJ mol1). Then, the three transition states leading to
butan-1,4-diyl, butan-1,3-diyl and 1-butene are close in energy so

that the three products should be produced competitively. How-
ever, the high barrier of the first step prevents this path to be kinet-
ically relevant. Hence, only the bottom path will be considered
further for explaining the selectivity. It immediately appears from
Fig. 8 that the pathway leading to 1-butene from 1-buten-3-yl is
far less energetic than the two other ones, with an overall barrier
of 33 kJ mol1, although it occurs in several steps. The final result
is that 1-butene will be obtained preferentially in agreement with
the experimental results. The transition state yielding 2-butene is
the second less energetic one (50 kJ mol1), which explains that
2-butene is also obtained. Nevertheless, the difference with the
barrier leading to 1-butene is too large to explain the experimental
ratio. A possible reason could be the isomerization of 1-butene into
2-butene as observed experimentally [8,39], likely through a pro-
cess of dehydrogenationrehydrogenation steps, the occurrence
of which depends on the coverage in hydrogen. The transition state
leading to butane-1,3-diyl is much higher in energy, and the metal-
lacycle will not be formed, which is a key point for not obtaining
butane as a primary product. Moreover, the previous thermody-
namic argument explains why butene is not further hydrogenated
to butane. Hence, the calculated pathways and thermodynamics
completely explain the high selectivity to butenes observed exper-
imentally on Pt/Sn alloy and the absence of butane as primary
product. The rate-limiting step for the formation of 1-butene is
the first hydrogenation with a barrier of 71 kJ mol1, in very good
agreement with the experimental activation energy of 72 kJ mol1
determined from temperature-programmed desorption on the
Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy [19].
The whole reactivity study has been made on the adsorbed cis
isomer of butadiene that is the most stable one. Nevertheless, we
have tested qualitatively if the trans isomer behaves similarly.
Effectively, the transition state to obtain the 3-buten-1-yl interme-
diate has been located at high energy, 122 kJ mol1 above the
coadsorbed precursor state. The path leading to 1-buten-3-yl is
also a two-step mechanism with decoordination of one double
bond, giving a di-r or p butadiene, only 2730 kJ mol1 less stable.
From the latter, 1-buten-3-yl is obtained with a barrier of
23 kJ mol1. Hence, the behavior of the trans isomer of butadiene
is the same as that of the cis isomer. Further steps have not been
considered so far.
Let us compare now the present results with those obtained for
Pt(1 1 1). The situation is totally different [15]. In the Pt case, the
two paths leading to 3-buten-1-yl and 1-buten-3-yl have a similar
energy barrier (97 kJ mol1), while on the alloy, the path yielding
3-buten-1-yl requires a much higher barrier (136 kJ mol1) than
the one leading to 1-buten-3-yl (92 kJ mol1, without decoordina-
tion). A first explanation can be the stability difference between
these two intermediates on the various metal surfaces. This differ-
ence is smaller on Pt(1 1 1) (17 kJ mol1) than on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)
(37 kJ mol1, Table 3). This can be connected to the ability of
Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) to favor the p adsorption mode of alkenes relatively
to the di-r mode (compare the butene adsorption in [15] and in
the present work). Following the Hammond principle, the TS lead-
ing to 3-buten-1-yl is higher on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) than on Pt(1 1 1).
Besides, the comparison of the SnAH distances in the two corre-
sponding transition states TS2 and TS1 (Fig. 7) shows that in TS1,
H is closer to Sn than in TS2 (2.64 vs. 3.02 Å). This is due to the po-
sition of the C2 carbon atom in adsorbed butadiene (Fig. 5) that lies
closer to Sn than C1. Moreover, the structure of TS2 is more flexible
than the one of TS1 since the attack is at one end of the molecule.
Hence, the attacking H passes and stays closer to Sn in TS1, which is
destabilizing as we have observed that hydrogen tends to avoid tin
(Section 3.2). Thus, Sn blocks the formation of 3-buten-1-yl and
forces the mechanism to pass through the 1-buten-3-yl monohy-
drogenated intermediate for which the barrier is smaller than on
Pt(1 1 1): 92 vs. 97 kJ mol1. Moreover, the formation of 1-buten-
3-yl is even easier (barrier 71 kJ mol1) than on Pt if the second ele-
mentary mechanism, with partial decoordination of butadiene to a
di-r form and attack of H on the decoordinated double bond, is
considered. Such a mechanism is also possible on Pt(1 1 1) but

leads to a high-energy TS from a larger cost for the partial butadi-
ene decoordination.
If the second hydrogenation is concerned, there is a competition
on Pt(1 1 1) between the formation of 1-butene and butan-1,3-diyl
starting from both 3-buten-1-yl and 1-buten-3-yl. In the case of
the alloy, the conversion of 1-buten-3-yl to butan-1,3-diyl requires
a similar energy to the one calculated on Pt(1 1 1) (92 vs.
99 kJ mol1). However, the conversion to 1-butene is far less acti-
vated (33 kJ mol1). The reason is that the C@C double bond deco-
ordinates
from
the
surface
in
a
first
step.
Again,
such
a
decoordination would cost too much energy in the case of Pt.
From these comparisons, one can conclude that the hydrogena-
tion of butadiene on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) alloy surface is different
from the reaction on Pt(1 1 1). On the alloy, the hydrogenation
through 3-buten-1-yl is not favored, and in the pathway passing
through 1-buten-3-yl, the barrier leading to the metallacycle is
much higher than the one leading to 1-butene. This explains why
the alloy Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) is totally selective contrarily to Pt(1 1 1).
Except TS1, TS4, TS12 and TS13 that have been discussed above,
the other transition states behave similarly on the alloy and on
Pt(1 1 1), with activation energies ranging from 70 to 99 kJ mol1
compared to 99125 kJ mol1 on platinum. In all these cases, the
attacking H is nearly atop the involved Pt atom, far from the Sn
atoms. The activation barriers are smaller than on Pt(1 1 1) because
of the weaker bonds on the alloy between the adsorbed species and
the surface. The weakening of the adsorption strength is all the
more large as the species create more bonds with the surface.
Hence, the transition states are less destabilized on the alloy than
the starting points, which reduces the barriers, if no other factor
intervenes.
Finally, the role of tin in the enhancement of the selectivity to-
ward 1-butene compared to Pt(1 1 1) is dual. First, by a repulsive
effect on H, it helps preventing the hydrogenation from going
through 3-buten-1-yl, of which the further hydrogenation is not
selective. Secondly and more importantly, by a ligand effect, it al-
lows the easy decoordination of the C@C double bond prior to
hydrogenation, hence opening a new low-energy hydrogenation
pathway and favoring the formation of 1-buten-3-yl and of 1-
butene.
Here, a parallel can be drawn with the case of acrolein hydroge-
nation at the C@O double bond [41]. In that case indeed, the lowest
energy path is also a multistep one. In both cases, there is decoor-
dination of the double bond to be hydrogenated prior to hydroge-
nation, the molecule remaining bound to the surface through
another unsaturated carbon atom. Such a mechanism is possible
when the double bond in question is sufficiently weakly bound.
This is the case for the C@O bond on Pt(1 1 1) and for the C@C bond
on Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) since it is known that the presence of tin reduces
considerably the C@C bond adsorption strength.
The behavior of Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) can also been compared to that
of another catalyst providing a high selectivity to butene, namely
palladium. The comparison of the energy profiles obtained in the
present study with those obtained for Pd(1 1 1) [15] reveals a
great similarity. Indeed, there is the same marked discrimination
between the pathways with initial CAH formation at the C2 or C1
carbons, in disfavor of the former. Then, the second step starting
from 1-buten-3-yl (product of attack at C1) is clearly selective to-
ward the formation of butene against the formation of butan-1,3-
diyl, with a smaller barrier. However, if the energy profiles look
similar, the reasons for the improved selectivity for PtSn and
Pd, vs. Pt, are different. In the case of Pd(1 1 1), our argumenta-
tion to explain the high selectivity rested on the energy difference
between the two monohydrogenated intermediates or between
the products, inducing a difference in energy barrier from a
BrnstedEvansPolanyi-type relation [42]. This argument still
holds for the first hydrogenation step in the case of Pt2Sn/
Pt(1 1 1), where a significant energy difference exists also be-
tween 3-buten-1-yl and 1-buten-3-yl, favoring the attack at C1.
This

to
the
ability
of
Pd(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) to favor the p adsorption mode of
alkenes relatively to the di-r mode (See Fig. 5, Table 1 and Ref.
[14]), in contrast to Pt(1 1 1). This thermodynamic argument is
however not valid at all for the second hydrogenation step on
Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and the high barrier for butane-1,3-diyl vs. butene
formation, since chemisorbed butane-1,3-diyl is only 10 kJ mol1
less stable than 1-butene (this energy difference is 11 kJ mol1
on the non-selective Pt(1 1 1) surface and 40 kJ mol1 on the
selective Pd(1 1 1)). The effect of Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy
stems from the weakening of the butadiene adsorption, with re-
spect to Pt(1 1 1) and Pd(1 1 1), which favors partial decoordina-
tion of butadiene and triggers the CAH bond formation on the
non-coordinated C@C bond, hence markedly lowering the barrier
for 1-butene or 2-butene formation. Indeed, this non-coordinated
pathway is not possible for the second CAH bond formation at C3,
which leads to butane-1,3-diyl, since the carbon framework
would be too strained in that case.
5. Conclusion
The thermodynamic and kinetic properties ruling the high
selectivity of a Pt/Sn alloy surface toward butadiene hydrogenation
have been explored from DFT calculations. An exhaustive study of
the adsorption modes of 1,3-butadiene, of 1- and 2-butenes and of
the metallacycle isomers on the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has
been performed, at a low coverage of 1/9 ML. Both the adsorption
energies and the stability order change from Pt(1 1 1) to the alloy.
For instance, adsorbed cis-butadiene becomes more stable than
trans-butadiene and the p adsorption mode of cis 2-butene pre-
vails over the di-r one. Some structures do no longer exist because
carbon atoms do not bind favorably on surface tin atoms. The
adsorption energies are all markedly smaller than on Pt(1 1 1), as
it is generally the case for alkenes on Pt/Sn alloys.
The calculation of the Gibbs free adsorption energy shows that
only butadiene is adsorbed on the surface alloy in the experimental
conditions (360 K, 15 Torr). Hence, it can be assumed that the
formed
butene
desorbs
immediately
without
being
further
hydrogenated.
The exploration of all the hydrogenation steps leads to the con-
clusion that the behavior of the Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy is to-
tally different from the one of Pt(1 1 1). In the case of the alloy, the
first hydrogenation at a central carbon is inhibited and only hydro-
genation at a terminal carbon can occur, whereas on Pt(1 1 1), they
are competitive. Then, among the three possible second hydroge-
nations, those leading to 1-butene and 2-butene are easier than
the one leading to 1-3 metallacycle because of the easy decoordi-
nation of the central double bond before hydrogenation, the forma-
tion of 1-butene being even more favored.
Therefore, the absence of butane in the reaction products on the
alloy can be explained by two reasons, the low desorption temper-
ature of butene on the one hand, which prevents its hydrogenation,
and the avoided formation of 1-3 metallacycle that could be hydro-
genated to butane on the other hand.
Tin plays a dual role. First, a role of site blocking: since hydro-
gen tends to avoid the tin atoms, some transition states are dis-
torted,
which
increases
the

barriers.
Secondly and mainly, its ligand effect on the Pt surface atoms de-
creases the strength of the PtAC bonds, which allows the decoordi-
nation of the double bond in the intermediates leading to 1- and 2-
butenes, reducing the activation barrier.
Hence, the DFT calculations presented in the present work al-
low the qualitative understanding of the high selectivity of the

Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) alloy compared to Pt(1 1 1) in the hydrogenation of
butadiene into butene. The comparison with Pd(1 1 1) can lead to
some suggestions for the design of efficient catalysts. Pure metals
would be selective if they have the propensity of adsorbing alkenes
in the p mode. Alloys of a noble metal would be efficient if the sec-
ond element plays a dual role as tin does: a repulsive interaction
with carbon and hydrogen atoms, modifying the active surface
topology with metallic ensembles, and an electronic effect from
its electronegativity assuring an electron transfer toward Pt atoms
and a weaker adsorption strength of the C@C double bonds. The
weaker coordination allows a partial decoordination of butadiene
and an easy CAH bond formation on the non-coordinated C@C
bond for pathways leading to butene.
