Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the
hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal
either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate. Temperature programmed
desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional
theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selec-
tivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.
The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt
NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields. The absolute yield toward 2-
propenol is also the highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1), which is further enhanced by the presence of pre-
adsorbed hydrogen. In contrast, the selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer
3dPt(1 1 1) structures. The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibra-
tional features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface
3dPt(1 1 1) structures. In addition, DFT calculations suggest that the different hydrogenation activities
between the subsurface and surface structures appear to be related to the differences in the binding
energy of acrolein on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.

1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to
unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsatu-
rated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of
fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. In addition, such
studies also offer the opportunity to understand the origin of selec-
tive hydrogenation of molecules with multiple unsaturated func-
tional groups [13].
Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydro-
genation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the
synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts. Galvagno et al. ob-
served that the addition of Sn to the Ru/C catalyst increased the
selective hydrogenation of citral toward nerol and genariol; how-
ever, the overall activity for the reaction was decreased. The addi-
tion of Sn was found to have two effects: the poisoning of the Ru
sites that decreased the overall activity and the activation of the
carbonyl group due to the presence of Snd+ ions [4]. Neri et al. stud-
ied the same reaction over PtSn supported on activated carbon. By
adding small amounts of Sn to the Pt catalysts, the selectivity to
unsaturated alcohol was found to increase, reaching a maximum
at Sn loadings of 0.30 wt.% with a fixed Pt loading of 2 wt.%. In this
case, the overall hydrogenation activity was also increased [5].
Raab and Lercher studied the selective hydrogenation of crotonal-
dehyde on supported NiPt on SiO2 [6] and TiO2 [7], with SiO2-
supported
bimetallic
catalysts
showing
higher
selectivity.
However, the overall hydrogenation activity was the highest for
the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The preferred activation of the C@O double
bond on the bimetallic catalysts was attributed to the presence
of negatively charged Pt and positively charged Ni [6]. Lucas and
Claus recently reported that AgIn supported on silica showed a
conversion greater than 90% and a selectivity to 2-propenol around
60%, using a micro plug-flow reactor at 513 K and pressures higher
than 2 MPa with H2 to acrolein molar ratio around 20 [8]. In this
case, the presence of partially reduced metals was found to be
responsible for the enhancement in the hydrogenation of the car-
bonyl group since a di-r-CO adsorption configuration was pre-
ferred over these active polar sites [1,8].
In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of
a,b-unsaturated aldehydes on catalysts without the effect of the
catalyst support, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and
Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been carried out by adding Sn
to Pt(5 5 3) [9] and Sn, Fe, and Ni to Pt(1 1 1) [2,3,1018]. For

example, recent results reported by our research group have sug-
gested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms
residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted
the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding
unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions
[18,19]. The combined experimental and DFT results suggested
that the presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a di-r-C
O configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydro-
genation pathway [18].
In the current paper we extend our studies to other 3d/Pt(1 1 1)
bimetallic surfaces, including Co and Cu, to determine the general
trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on
subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.
In addition to experimental studies using TPD and HREELS, DFT cal-
culations are also performed to correlate the hydrogenation activ-
ity with the binding energy and adsorption geometry of acrolein on
these bimetallic surfaces.
2. Experimental and DFT methods
A two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure
less than 1  1010 Torr was used to carry out the TPD experiments.
This UHV chamber has been described elsewhere [20]. In brief,
bimetallic surfaces were prepared using a Pt(1 1 1) single crystal
(Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge) as a substrate for the
different 3d transition metals. This crystal was spot welded directly
to two tantalum posts for resistive heating and thermal contacts for
cooling with liquid nitrogen. The Pt(1 1 1) surface was prepared by
cycles of sputtering, oxygen treatment, and annealing, as described
previously [21]. The cleanliness of the surface was checked by Au-
ger electron spectroscopy (AES). After dosing acrolein or hydro-
gen/acrolein at 100 K, the TPD experiments were performed
with the surface placed at a distance of 5 mm from the opening
of the random flux shield of the mass spectrometer. A heating rate
of 3 K/s was used to a maximum of 800 K while collecting 10
masses simultaneously. The TPD yields were estimated by using
the procedure reported by Ko et al. and the sensitivity factors rela-
tive to CO as explained in previous studies [19,22].
The vibrational spectroscopic measurements were carried out
in a separate UHV chamber equipped with an LK-3000 double-pass
HREEL spectrometer for vibrational analysis, as described previ-
ously [23,24]. The intensity of the elastic peak was in the range be-
tween 3  104 and 3  105 counts per second (cps) with a spectral
resolution between 30 and 40 cm1 full-width at half maximum
(FWHM). The exposure of acrolein or hydrogen/acrolein was made
with the Pt(1 1 1) or bimetallic 3dPt(1 1 1) surface held at <120 K.
The initial spectrum was scanned at low temperature (110120 K).
The adsorbed layer was then annealed to a specific temperature
with a linear rate of 3 K/s, held for 5 s, then cooled down to
120 K for data collection.
Acrolein (Alfa Aesar, 99.9% stabilized with 0.1% hydroquinone)
was purified by successive freezepumpthaw cycles prior to
use. The purity was verified in situ by mass spectrometry. Hydro-
gen,
oxygen,
and
neon
were
all
of
research
grade
purity
(99.999%) and were introduced into the UHV chamber without fur-
ther purification. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1 Langmuir
(L) = 1  1010 Torr s) and are not corrected for ion gauge sensitiv-
ities. Acrolein, hydrogen, and oxygen were dosed through direc-
tional dosing tubes with a diameter of 5 mm. For H2 dosing, the
exposure of 0.5 L in the TPD chamber and 5 L in the HREELS cham-
ber resulted in 50% saturation coverage of hydrogen.
As reported earlier for the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) system, a surface NiPt
Pt(1 1 1) structure was prepared by depositing one monolayer
(ML) of Ni at 300 K, while the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure
was obtained by the deposition of one ML Ni at 600 K [25]. In the
current study bimetallic surfaces were prepared by evaporating
approximately one ML of 3d transition metal (Ni, Co, and Cu) on
the Pt(1 1 1) surface by maintaining the crystal at 300 and 600 K
to prepare the surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) and subsurface Pt3d
Pt(1 1 1) structures, respectively. The evaporative 3d metal doser
consisted of a metal wire (at least 99.99% purity) wrapped around
a resistively heated tungsten wire. This metal filament was enclosed
in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening of 1 cm in diameter.
During the metal evaporation, the UHV pressure remained below
5  1010 Torr. The metal coverage was estimated using AES by
monitoring the 3d(LMM)/Pt(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio.
Self-consistent periodic slab calculations were performed by
density functional theory (DFT) using the code VASP (Vienna ab
initio Simulation Package) [26]. A plane-wave basis set with a cut-
off energy of 396 eV was used to solve the KohnSham equations.
The PW91 functional was utilized to describe the exchange corre-
lation term. Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential was used to de-
scribe the core electrons and the nuclei of the atoms, as
described previously [27,28]. The different electronic energies
were calculated using a 3  3  1 k-point grid mesh. The bimetallic
surfaces were modeled using 3  3 super cells of four layers of
thickness, which were separated by a vacuum region equivalent
in thickness to six metal layers to prevent electronic interaction
between slabs. The binding energy of acrolein was calculated with
one acrolein molecule adsorbed per unit cell, with the top two me-
tal layers allowed to relax. Calculations for gas-phase acrolein and
adsorbatemetal systems were carried out spin-unpolarized, as de-
scribed previously [18].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. TPD of acrolein on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces
3.1.1. Reaction products from Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
Fig. 1 shows the TPD spectra after the adsorption of 0.5 L acro-
lein, corresponding to a coverage near the saturation of the first
monolayer, on PtNiPt(1 1 1), H/PtNiPt(1 1 1) (representing
PtNiPt(1 1 1) with 50% saturation coverage of pre-adsorbed
hydrogen), NiPtPt(1 1 1), and Pt(1 1 1). The TPD results on these
surfaces have been described previously [18,19]; they are shown
here to provide a reference to compare with other Pt3d
Pt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. In brief, masses characteris-
tic of different desorption products are compared in Fig. 1, includ-
ing
hydrogen
(H2,
2 amu),
carbon
monoxide
(CO,
28 amu),
molecular desorption of acrolein (CH2@CHCH@O, 56 amu), 1-pro-
panol (CH3CH2CH2OH, 60 amu), propanal (CH3CH2CH@O,
58 amu), and 2-propenol (CH2@CHCH2OH, 31 amu). Consistent
with that observed by Zaera et al., acrolein undergoes mainly
decarbonylation on the Pt(1 1 1) surface [29]. No noticeable
desorption features are observed from 31, 58, or 60 amu from
Pt(1 1 1). In comparison, both propanal and 2-propenol are de-
tected at 272 K from the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface. When acrolein
is adsorbed on the hydrogen pre-dosed H/PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface,
a small desorption peak of 1-propanol is observed at 268 K, and
the desorption of propanal at 193 and 272 K and 2-propenol at
272 K is enhanced due to the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
The molecular desorption of acrolein is noticeable from both Pt
NiPt(1 1 1) and H/PtNiPt(1 1 1). On the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface,
the molecular desorption of acrolein occurs at 190 K, and a desorp-
tion peak of propanal is observed at 302 K and a very weak peak of
2-propenol is detected at 304 K.
3.1.2. Reaction products from Co/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
The TPD spectra after the exposure of 0.5 L acrolein on different
Co/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces are displayed in Fig. 2. The characterization of

the Co/Pt(1 1 1) surface structures has been described in the liter-
ature by different groups using LEED, STM, AES, UPS, and hydrogen
TPD [3033]. Similar diffusion of Co atoms to the subsurface of
Pt(1 1 1), as the one described for the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface
[25,34], has been reported to occur when Co is deposited at
600 K [3133]. Correspondingly, an enriched Co surface layer on
Pt(1 1 1) can be prepared when Co is evaporated at a substrate
temperature of 300 K [30,31,33]. As shown in Fig. 2, the desorption
of the H2 product from the PtCoPt(1 1 1) surface takes place at
288 and 381 K, with the desorption of the CO product occurring
at 336 K. Acrolein desorbs molecularly at 228 K. The desorption
of both propanal and 2-propenol occurs at a peak centered at
273 K. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) surface leads
to an enhancement in the production of both propanal and 2-pro-
penol. In comparison, from the CoPtPt(1 1 1) surface the H2 and
CO products desorb at higher temperatures, with CO desorbing at
409 and 619 K. The molecular desorption of acrolein is observed
as a relatively sharp peak at 175 K. Finally, hydrogenated products,
propanal and a smaller amount of 2-propenol, are detected at
259 K from this surface.
3.1.3. Reaction products from Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
The deposition of Cu on Pt(1 1 1) at around 350 K was studied
using LEED and AES by Tsay et al. [35]. At this temperature, a Cu
film on top of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate was suggested to be formed
[35]. In the experiments mentioned here, deposition was carried
out at 300 K for up to 1 ML based on AES measurements. When
Cu is deposited at 600 K, the diffusion of Cu atoms to the bulk is
suggested from AES measurements. However, previous studies
proposed that the formation of a CuPt alloy takes place when
Cu is deposited at 350 K and then annealed to 600700 K [35].
For consistency with the other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic structures,
this surface is referred to as a PtCuPt(1 1 1) structure in the cur-
rent study.
The TPD spectra after the adsorption of 0.5 L acrolein on Cu/
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3. The H2 and CO products
desorb from the PtCuPt(1 1 1) surface at 452 K and 360 K,
respectively. The desorption of propanal occurs at 270 K, with a
very weak peak of 2-propenol occurring at the same temperature.
The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on PtCuPt(1 1 1) does
not enhance the desorption of either propanal or 2-propenol. On

The characteristic cracking patterns are: 2 amu (hydrogen); 28 amu (CO and

lein. The characteristic cracking patterns are: 2 amu (hydrogen); 28 amu (CO and

the CuPtPt(1 1 1) surface, there is only a weak desorption peak
of CO at around 243 K and the molecular desorption of acrolein oc-
curs at the same temperature. Hydrogenation products are not de-
tected from the CuPtPt(1 1 1) surface.
3.1.4. Comparison of TPD yields on different 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
Activities toward the formation of gas-phase hydrogenation and
decomposition products are calculated based on the areas of TPD
peaks that contribute to the cracking patterns of each gas-phase
reaction product, as explained elsewhere [19]. In brief, measure-
ments of TPD peak areas for 2-propenol, propanal, 1-propanol, eth-
ylene, and CO were used to estimate the yields of these products
from the different surfaces following the empirical procedure
developed by Ko et al. [22] for the correction of mass spectrometer
sensitivity. The absolute TPD yields are expressed in the unit of
molecule per surface metal atom and are shown in Table 1 for
the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and H/Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The sensitivity
factors are calculated relative to the absolute CO coverage, which is
the main product from the decarbonylation of acrolein. The abso-
lute CO coverage was estimated by TPD following the saturation
exposure of CO on clean Pt(1 1 1) [19]. The absolute yields of car-
bon adsorbed on the surface (Cads) and H2 were estimated based
on the carbon balance considering the formation of CO from the
decarbonylation and the complete decomposition of acrolein to
carbonaceous species and hydrogen, as explained elsewhere [19].
As shown in Table 1, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of
C@O bond to produce 2-propenol increases from 3% to 17% by
the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) sur-
face [19]. The overall yields of the main hydrogenated products
from acrolein on PtCoPt(1 1 1) are similar to the ones observed
on PtNiPt(1 1 1). However, the ones on the H/PtCoPt(1 1 1)
surface are smaller than those observed on the respective H/Pt
NiPt(1 1 1) counterparts. Although the hydrogenation selectivity
toward 2-propenol, defined as the amount of 2-propenol divided
by all three hydrogenation products, is higher on H/PtCo
Pt(1 1 1) than on H/PtNiPt(1 1 1), the absolute TPD yield is smal-
ler. In comparison, the overall hydrogenated product yield on the
PtCuPt(1 1 1)
surfaces
is
the
smallest
among
the
Pt3d
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces shown in Table 1.
The main hydrogenated products on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface
structures are also calculated and reported in Table 2. Due to the
absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, the production of propanal
and 2-propenol on these surfaces is from the self-hydrogenation
(disproportionation) reaction of acrolein. In general, the yield of
the desirable product, 2-propenol, is lower on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) sur-
faces than on their subsurface counterparts. This difference be-
comes more obvious in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen,
which does not lead to any enhancement in the hydrogenation
activity on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures (spectra not
shown).
3.2. HREELS results of acrolein on 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
In order to further understand the different reaction pathways
of acrolein on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces,
vibrational spectra of adsorbed acrolein and its reaction intermedi-
ates were recorded after different annealing temperatures. The ef-
fect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen was also compared for several
bimetallic surfaces. Due to the complexity of the HREEL spectra
of acrolein and its reaction intermediates, definitive assignments
of the vibrational features of the surface species would only be pos-
sible with the assistance of theoretical calculations and isotope
labeling experiments, which are beyond the scope of the current
paper. In the current study we will focus primarily on the interac-
tions of the C@C and C@O bonds of acrolein and its intermediates
on the different bimetallic surfaces to provide a qualitative inter-
pretation to support the TPD results.
3.2.1. HREEL spectra of acrolein on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPt
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
Fig. 4a compares the HREEL spectra after acrolein adsorption at
120 K followed by annealing to 200 K on Pt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1),
PtCoPt(1 1 1), and PtCuPt(1 1 1). As discussed previously, the
observation of the characteristic modes of liquid-phase acrolein,
m(C@C) at 1630 cm1, m(C@O) at 1670 cm1, and d(CCO) at
561 cm1, indicates the presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein on
Pt(1 1 1) [19]. The vibrational features are in general agreement
with those observed by Loffreda et al. when acrolein is dosed on
Pt(1 1 1) at around 180 K [15]. In contrast, the m(C@C) and
m(C@O) modes are no longer well-resolved and appear as a single
peak at 1644 cm1 on PtNiPt(1 1 1), suggesting that the interac-
tion of acrolein on this surface modifies both the C@C and C@O
moieties. The detection of the intense d(CCO) at 534 cm1 indicates
that the skeletal bonds of acrolein remain intact on the surface. The
vibrational spectra on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtCuPt(1 1 1) sur-
faces are in general similar to that on PtNiPt(1 1 1), suggesting
that acrolein interacts with the surfaces through both C@C and
Fig. 3. TPD spectra of the reaction products of acrolein from Pt(1 1 1), PtCu
Pt(1 1 1), H/PtCuPt(1 1 1), and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces after dosing 0.5 L acro-
lein. The characteristic cracking patterns are: 2 amu (hydrogen); 28 amu (CO and
ethylene); 56 amu (acrolein); 60 amu (1-propanol); 58 amu (propanal); and 31 amu
(2-propenol).
338

C@O moieties. The presence of the CO species at 2036 cm1 on all
three Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces is from either a low temperature
decarbonylation pathway or accumulation of CO from the UHV
background.
In comparison, Fig. 4b shows the HREEL spectra of acrolein on
the corresponding 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The most obvious dif-
ference between Fig. 4a and b is the absence of a well-resolved
d(CCO)
mode
at
534 cm1
on
NiPtPt(1 1 1)
and
CoPt
Pt(1 1 1), suggesting a strong interaction between the CCO skeletal
bond of acrolein with these two surfaces at 200 K. The presence of
well-resolved features at 1360, 1440, and 2949 cm1 on CoPt
Pt(1 1 1) indicates the formation of ethylidyne-type species, likely
due to a low temperature decarbonylation pathway. The HREEL
spectrum on CuPtPt(1 1 1) is rather complicated, with many
well-resolved features ranging from 311 to 3017 cm1, suggesting
the presence of weakly adsorbed species. The absence of the
m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes is somewhat unexpected for weakly ad-
sorbed acrolein, although this could be due to an adsorption geom-
etry with both the C@C and C@O bonds of acrolein parallel to the
surface. Based on the TPD spectra depicted in Fig. 3, the only
desorption features at greater than 200 K are unreacted acrolein
(56 amu) and trace amount of CO. This in turn suggests that the
vibrational features on CuPtPt(1 1 1) in Fig. 4b are likely related
to either acrolein or an intermediate that can readily combine to
produce gas-phase acrolein at above 200 K.
The HREEL spectra of the surface intermediates after annealing
to 300 K on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) are displayed in Fig. 5a. It is important
to point out that the main desorption products, other than H2 and

CO, reach a maximum in the desorption peaks below or near 300 K.
Vibrational features in the m(C@C) and m(C@O) regions are nearly
absent at 300 K in Fig. 5a, consistent with the TPD results that acro-
lein and the hydrogenation products already desorbed from the
surfaces by this temperature. In addition to the intense CO mode
at 2036 cm1, a CHx stretching mode is observed at 2949 cm1
on all these surfaces, suggesting the presence of hydrocarbon frag-
ments from the dissociation of acrolein. The appearance of the
vibrational features at 913, 1224, 1326, 1440, and 2949 cm1 indi-
cates the presence of ethylidyne or propylidyne reaction interme-
diates on the surfaces.
Fig. 5b shows the vibrational features of the surface intermedi-
ates after annealing to 300 K on the corresponding 3dPtPt(1 1 1)
surfaces. Unlike the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, the Ni
PtPt(1 1 1) surface shows an intense feature at 1725 cm1, which
is likely related to the m(C@O) mode of the propanal species or
other intermediate that contains the C@O functional group, consis-
tent with the desorption of propanal and CO from this surface at
above 300 K. For the CoPtPt(1 1 1) surface, an intense CO feature
is observed at 1948 cm1 along with the ethylidyne-like vibrations
at 913, 1069, and 1324 cm1, resulting from decarbonylation path-
way. In comparison, the vibrational features on CuPtPt(1 1 1) are
not as well defined at the same annealing temperature, except the
presence of an intense and sharp m(CO) mode at 2063 cm1; the
surface CO species is from the adsorption from the UHV back-
ground, instead of reaction of acrolein, based on the absence of
CO desorption peak at above 300 K in the TPD measurement
(Fig. 3).
The HREELS results on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces are in gen-
eral consistent with the TPD data shown earlier. As expected based
on the TPD results, the vibrational features on the PtCoPt(1 1 1)
surface are similar to the ones observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) sur-
face at the different annealing temperatures, indicating similar
hydrogenation pathways on the two surfaces. The absence of
well-resolved m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes on the two surfaces at
200 K is consistent with the interaction of both moieties with the
surface, consistent with the TPD detection of hydrogenation prod-
ucts via both C@C and C@O hydrogenation pathways. In compari-
son, the absence of the d(CCO) mode on the NiPtPt(1 1 1) and
CoPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces at 200 K suggests a stronger interaction
with adsorbed acrolein, consistent with the higher peak areas of
H2 and CO from the decomposition of acrolein. Finally, the HREELS
results on the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces do not
resemble those of the Ni and Co counterparts, again consistent
with the lower hydrogenation and decomposition activities of
the Cu/Pt bimetallic surfaces in the TPD measurements.
Lastly, it is interesting to point out that there is no apparent
shift in the m(CO) mode at 2036 cm1 on the three Pt3d
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces (Fig. 5a), indicating that CO occupies the same
type of metal sites, which are likely to be Pt sites modified by
the presence of the 3d metals in the subsurface layer. This observa-
tion indirectly confirms that the idealized Pt3dPt(1 1 1) subsur-
face structure is most likely produced for Ni, Co, and Cu upon the
deposition of these metals on Pt(1 1 1) at 600 K. In comparison,
the m(CO) feature is observed at 2029, 1948, and 2063 cm1 for
the corresponding 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, further indicating the
different surface composition between the surface and subsurface
structures.
3.2.2. HREEL spectra of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(1 1 1) and H/PtCo
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
As summarized in Table 1, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydro-
gen enhances the production of 2-propenol from the PtNi
Pt(1 1 1) and PtCoPt(1 1 1) surfaces. A comparison of the corre-
sponding vibrational spectra is shown in Fig. 6. The spectra were
obtained after the adsorption of acrolein on surfaces pre-dosed

by half saturation of hydrogen followed by annealing the surfaces
to 200 K, which is below the onset temperature for the desorption
of the 2-propenol product. As described in a previous paper [18],
the detection of the mode at 1569 cm1 on the H/PtNiPt(1 1 1)
suggests the presence of a preferred di-r-CO configuration for
acrolein. In comparison, a vibrational feature at 1623 cm1 is ob-
served on H/PtCoPt(1 1 1), which is likely from the contribution
from both the m(C@C) and m(C@O) modes. Such a difference in the
bonding configuration of acrolein is consistent with the TPD re-
sults. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the TPD
yield of 2-propenol on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, which is likely
due to the presence of the di-r-CO bonded acrolein that facili-
tates the hydrogenation of the C@O bond on H/PtNiPt(1 1 1).
In contrast, the TPD yield is not enhanced to the same extent by
pre-adsorbed H on PtCoPt(1 1 1), which is consistent with the
presence of both di-r-CO and di-r-CC species that can undergo
both C@C and C@O bond hydrogenation on this surface.
3.3. General trend between Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1)
surfaces
Many previous studies have utilized DFT modeling to under-
stand the hydrogenation mechanisms of unsaturated C@C and
C@O bonds [18,3639]. In the current study, DFT calculations of
binding energies of acrolein were performed to help understand
the difference between the hydrogenation activities observed on
the different 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surface and the subsurface structures. Ta-
ble 3 shows the results for the acrolein binding energies through
three different geometries, di-r-CC, di-r-CO, and g4(C,C,C,O)
on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding
energies of acrolein through the different geometries are similar
for the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces. Moreover, these calculated bind-
ing energies are very low, suggesting weak interactions of acrolein
with the subsurface structures. As reported previously for the
hydrogenation of cyclohexene [40], the binding energies of atomic
hydrogen on bimetallic surfaces, including all the surface and sub-
surface structures in the current paper, are weaker on Pt3d
Pt(1 1 1) than on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) for any given 3dPt pair. In that
study the hydrogenation activity was higher on Pt3dPt(1 1 1)
than on 3dPtPt(1 1 1) due to the fact that weaker binding ener-
gies of cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen favor the hydrogenation
on the subsurface structures. Similar argument can be made in the
current study for the higher hydrogenation activity of acrolein ob-
served on Pt3dPt(1 1 1) than on the corresponding 3dPt
Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. However, minor differences in binding energies
among the three Pt3dPt(1 1 1) surfaces are not sufficient to the
different hydrogenation activity and selectivity on these surfaces.
Weak interactions, such as the dispersive van der Waals type that
are not currently possible to include in DFT, should be taken into
account in a different modeling approach to better differentiate
these three binding configurations. In addition, the calculation of
activation barriers would be necessary for a thorough analysis
and better explanation of the difference in selectivities between
the different 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. As explained elsewhere, these
calculations are computationally more expensive than the ones
shown in this study [18].
As compared in Table 3, the three surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) struc-
tures show higher binding energies, through either the di-r-CC or
the g4(C,C,C,O) configuration. The strong binding energies on the
3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are most likely the origin of the lower
hydrogenation activities. Furthermore, DFT results show that the
di-r-CO configuration always converges to either di-r-CC or
g4(C,C,C,O) during the calculation; the absence of the di-r-CO
configuration is consistent with the relatively low C@O bond
hydrogenation activity on these surfaces.
4. Conclusions
The trends in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acro-
lein are reported here on several subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and
surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures. The combination of TPD and
HREELS experiments and DFT calculations leads to the following
conclusions:
(1) TPD experiments show that a higher activity toward self-
hydrogenation (disproportionation) and hydrogenation of
acrolein is observed on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) struc-
tures in comparison with that observed on the correspond-
ing
surface
3dPtPt(1 1 1)
structures.
The
highest
hydrogenation activity of acrolein and yield toward the 2-
propenol are observed on the H/PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, in
agreement with the preferred di-r-CO adsorption mode
of acrolein from the HREELS measurement.
(2) The lower hydrogenation activity to 2-propenol on the cor-
responding 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures are related
to the stronger binding energy, as well as a preferred di-r
or g4 configuration involving the interaction of the C@C

bond of acrolein on these surfaces, which diminishes the
interaction of the carbonyl group with the bimetallic sur-
faces. The stronger binding also favors the dissociation of
the skeletal bonds of acrolein on these surfaces.
(3) Similar vibrational features are observed for the subsurfaces
PtCoPt(1 1 1) and the PtNiPt(1 1 1). This is in agreement
with the general similarity in the TPD spectra for both bime-
tallic systems and the fact that the PtCoPt(1 1 1), with and
without pre-adsorbed hydrogen, exhibits the second highest
overall hydrogenation activity and yield toward 2-propenol
among the bimetallic series reported in this study.
(4) Recent DFT modeling results indicate that the Pt3dPt sub-
surface structures are thermodynamically preferred with
adsorbed hydrogen [41], suggesting that surface science
results from the current study should be relevant to hydro-
genation activities of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts.
