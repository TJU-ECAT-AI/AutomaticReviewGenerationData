The given literature does not contain information about using HREELS or AES to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on the hydrogenation of acrolein on various Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces, but does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation or provide comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions of segregation kinetics and activation barriers. To answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing oxygen-induced segregation in these systems would be needed.

给定的文献中没有关于使用HREELS或AES来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析的信息。该文档主要关注各种Pt-3d双金属表面上丙烯醛的氢化，但没有讨论氧诱导的偏析，也没有提供实验测量与DFT预测的偏析动力学和活化能障之间的比较。要回答这个问题，需要额外的专门讨论这些系统中氧诱导偏析的资料。
