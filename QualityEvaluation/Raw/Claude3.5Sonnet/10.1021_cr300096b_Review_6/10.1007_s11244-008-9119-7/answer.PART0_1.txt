[1] "Figure 8 displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."

[3] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems in the following ways:

1. AES is used to measure the Ni/Pt ratio on the surface. The normalized AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface.

2. The segregation kinetics are measured by tracking the change in AES ratio over time during oxygen exposure.

3. Activation barriers for segregation are estimated experimentally based on the time required for half of the subsurface atoms to segregate to the surface.

The measured activation barriers are 15 kcal/mol for Ni and 7 kcal/mol for Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. These experimental results align with DFT predictions that show a trend of decreasing activation barriers for segregation as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level in 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，HREELS和AES技术通过以下方式验证和量化氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析：

1. AES用于测量表面的Ni/Pt比率。随着氧暴露量的增加，归一化的AES比率增加，表明亚表面Ni原子向表面偏析。

2. 通过在氧气暴露期间跟踪AES比率随时间的变化来测量偏析动力学。

3. 基于一半亚表面原子偏析到表面所需的时间，实验估算了偏析的活化能。

在Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中，测得的Ni的活化能为15 kcal/mol，Co的活化能为7 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，即在3d/Pt(111)双金属系统中，随着d带中心向费米能级靠近，偏析的活化能呈现降低趋势。
