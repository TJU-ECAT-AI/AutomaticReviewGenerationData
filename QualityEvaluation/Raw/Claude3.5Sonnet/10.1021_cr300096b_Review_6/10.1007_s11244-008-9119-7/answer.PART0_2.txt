[1] "Figure 8 displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."

[3] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

HREELS and AES techniques verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems by measuring changes in the surface composition. Specifically, AES is used to track the Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure. An increase in this ratio indicates segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface.

The segregation kinetics are measured by observing the time-dependent changes in the AES ratios. The activation barriers are estimated based on the time required for half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. For Ni/Pt(111), the experimentally determined activation barrier is 15 kcal/mol, while for Co/Pt(111) it is 7 kcal/mol.

These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which suggest that the presence of strongly adsorbed species like atomic oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration in vacuum. DFT calculations also predict that the thermodynamic preference for the surface structure in the presence of atomic oxygen increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, which is consistent with the lower activation barrier observed for Co compared to Ni.

HREELS和AES技术通过测量表面组成的变化来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。具体来说，AES用于跟踪Ni/Pt或Co/Pt比率随氧暴露的变化。这个比率的增加表明亚表面3d原子向表面偏析。

偏析动力学通过观察AES比率的时间依赖变化来测量。激活能障是根据一半亚表面3d原子偏析到表面所需的时间来估算的。对于Ni/Pt(111)，实验确定的激活能障为15 kcal/mol，而对于Co/Pt(111)则为7 kcal/mol。

这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，后者表明强吸附物种（如原子氧）的存在可以克服真空中亚表面构型的热力学偏好。DFT计算还预测，在原子氧存在的情况下，随着d带中心向费米能级靠近，表面结构的热力学偏好会增加，这与Co相比Ni观察到的较低激活能障一致。
