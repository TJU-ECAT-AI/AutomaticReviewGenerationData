[1] "Figure 8 displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."

[3] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems as follows:

1. AES is used to measure the Ni/Pt ratio on the surface. The normalized AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface.

2. The kinetics of segregation are quantified by measuring the time required for half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface.

3. From these kinetic measurements, activation barriers for segregation are experimentally determined. For Ni, the barrier is 15 kcal/mol, while for Co it is 7 kcal/mol.

4. These experimental results align with DFT predictions that oxygen adsorption can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration in vacuum, favoring surface segregation of 3d atoms.

5. The trend in activation barriers (lower for Co than Ni) is consistent with DFT calculations showing that the thermodynamic driving force for segregation increases as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level.

While HREELS is mentioned in the text, its specific use in studying surface segregation is not detailed in the given excerpts.

HREELS和AES技术用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子表面偏析，具体如下：

1. AES用于测量表面的Ni/Pt比率。随着氧暴露量的增加，归一化的AES比率增加，表明亚表面Ni原子偏析到表面。

2. 通过测量一半亚表面3d原子偏析到表面所需的时间来量化偏析动力学。

3. 根据这些动力学测量，实验确定了偏析的活化能。对于Ni，活化能为15 kcal/mol，而对于Co，活化能为7 kcal/mol。

4. 这些实验结果与DFT预测一致，即氧吸附可以克服真空中亚表面构型的热力学优势，有利于3d原子的表面偏析。

5. 活化能的趋势（Co低于Ni）与DFT计算结果一致，即随着d带中心向费米能级靠近，偏析的热力学驱动力增加。

虽然文中提到了HREELS，但在给出的摘录中并未详细说明其在研究表面偏析中的具体应用。
