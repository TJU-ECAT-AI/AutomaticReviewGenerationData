[1] "Figure 8 displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms."

[3] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

The experimental techniques of HREELS and AES are used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems as follows:

1. AES is used to measure the Ni/Pt ratio on the surface. As oxygen exposure increases, the AES ratio increases, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms are segregating to the surface.

2. The AES ratio is normalized based on measurements taken during the formation of clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces, allowing quantification of the degree of segregation.

3. The kinetics of segregation are measured by tracking the change in AES ratio over time with oxygen exposure.

4. Activation barriers for segregation are estimated experimentally based on the time required for half of the subsurface atoms to segregate to the surface.

The measured activation barriers are 15 kcal/mol for Ni and 7 kcal/mol for Co. These experimental results align with DFT predictions that the surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration becomes thermodynamically preferred in the presence of strongly adsorbed species like oxygen. The experimental data also supports the DFT-predicted trend of decreasing activation barriers for segregation as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level across the 3d series.

HREELS和AES等实验技术用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析,具体如下:

1. AES用于测量表面的Ni/Pt比率。随着氧暴露量的增加,AES比率增加,表明亚表面Ni原子正在向表面偏析。

2. AES比率基于形成干净Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面过程中的测量进行标准化,允许量化偏析程度。

3. 通过跟踪氧暴露过程中AES比率随时间的变化来测量偏析动力学。

4. 根据一半亚表面原子偏析到表面所需的时间来实验估计偏析的活化能垒。

测得的活化能垒对Ni为15 kcal/mol,对Co为7 kcal/mol。这些实验结果与DFT预测一致,即在存在氧等强吸附物种的情况下,表面3d-Pt-Pt(111)构型在热力学上更受青睐。实验数据还支持DFT预测的趋势,即随着3d系列中d带中心向费米能级靠近,偏析的活化能垒降低。
