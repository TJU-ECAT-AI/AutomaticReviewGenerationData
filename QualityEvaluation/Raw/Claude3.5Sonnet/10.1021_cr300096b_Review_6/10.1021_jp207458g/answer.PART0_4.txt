The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document appears to be about the oxidation of methanol on oxygen-covered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, which is unrelated to the specific question asked. There is no mention of HREELS, AES, surface segregation, nickel, cobalt, or DFT predictions in the provided text. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

给出的文献不包含任何与回答问题相关的信息,该问题涉及实验技术如HREELS和AES验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。该文档似乎是关于氧覆盖的Ptn/Ru(0001)层上甲醇的氧化,这与所问的具体问题无关。在提供的文本中没有提到HREELS、AES、表面偏析、镍、钴或DFT预测。因此,无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。
