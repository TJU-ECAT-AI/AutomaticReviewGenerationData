Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information related to the question about experimental techniques like HREELS and AES verifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document appears to be about the oxidation of methanol on oxygen-covered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, which is unrelated to the specific question asked. There is no data provided about segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems.

给出的文献不包含任何与问题相关的信息,该问题是关于HREELS和AES等实验技术如何验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。该文档似乎是关于氧覆盖的Ptn/Ru(0001)层上甲醇的氧化,这与所问的具体问题无关。文中没有提供关于Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统中Ni和Co的偏析动力学、活化能障或DFT预测的数据。
