Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about HREELS, AES, oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, or DFT predictions for Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text focuses on acetic acid reduction by hydrogen over supported PtFe catalysts, and does not discuss the specific experimental techniques or systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献中没有关于HREELS、AES、氧诱导的3d亚表面原子表面偏析或Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统的DFT预测的任何信息。该文本主要讨论了支持的PtFe催化剂上乙酸被氢还原的问题，并没有涉及问题中提到的特定实验技术或系统。因此，基于所提供的文档无法回答这个问题。
