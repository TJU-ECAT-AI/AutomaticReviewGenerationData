Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This document does not contain any information about oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The literature focuses on the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a (√3×√3)R30° Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, and does not discuss Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems or surface segregation phenomena. There is no data presented on segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or DFT predictions for such systems. The experimental techniques mentioned (HREELS, AES) are used to study NO2 adsorption and reaction, not surface segregation of 3d atoms.

本文档不包含关于氧诱导的Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中亚表面3d原子(特别是Ni和Co)表面偏析的任何信息。该文献主要关注NO2在(√3×√3)R30° Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和反应,并未讨论Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统或表面偏析现象。文中没有提供关于此类系统的偏析动力学、活化能障或密度泛函理论(DFT)预测的数据。所提到的实验技术(HREELS、AES)用于研究NO2的吸附和反应,而非3d原子的表面偏析。
