AES is used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The normalized Ni/Pt or Co/Pt AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface. The segregation kinetics are measured by tracking the change in AES ratio over time during oxygen exposure. Activation barriers for segregation are estimated experimentally based on the time required for half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. For Ni/Pt(111), the activation barrier is 15 kcal/mol, while for Co/Pt(111) it is 7 kcal/mol.

These experimental results align with DFT predictions that oxygen adsorption can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration in vacuum, favoring the surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structure. The measured activation barriers follow the trend predicted by DFT calculations, decreasing as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level for different 3d metals.

HREELS is not explicitly mentioned in relation to verifying surface segregation in this context, although it could potentially be used to detect changes in surface composition by observing shifts in vibrational modes associated with surface species.

HREELS and AES techniques were used to experimentally verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems.

HREELS was employed to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which indicated the segregation of Ni or Co to the surface. The appearance of specific ν(NiO) or ν(CoO) modes in the HREEL spectra signaled the presence of these metals on the surface.

AES measurements tracked the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios over time under oxygen exposure at different temperatures. This allowed for the estimation of activation barriers for the segregation process.

The experimentally determined activation barriers were 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni segregation (in the 400-475 K range) and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co segregation (in the 300-350 K range). These values quantify the kinetics of the segregation process.

The experimental results generally aligned with DFT predictions. DFT calculations showed that:
1. The 3dPtPt surface structures were more stable than Pt3dPt structures in the presence of oxygen, consistent with the observed segregation.
2. Oxygen binding was stronger on 3dPtPt surfaces compared to Pt, which agrees with the experimental observation of segregation driven by oxygen adsorption.
3. The activation barriers for other 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) were predicted to be even lower than those for Co or Ni.

The lower activation barrier for Co segregation compared to Ni matches the DFT-predicted trend of easier segregation for earlier 3d transition metals.

However, the experiments revealed some nuances not captured by DFT, such as the coexistence of outward segregation and inward diffusion processes, particularly for Co. This highlights the complementary nature of experimental and theoretical approaches in understanding these complex systems.

The literature provides limited information on the experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) systems. AES is mentioned as a technique used to monitor Ni diffusion into bulk Pt(111) at higher temperatures. The document states that oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface has been experimentally confirmed, but does not specify the techniques used or provide quantitative data on segregation kinetics or activation barriers. DFT modeling is mentioned as predicting the segregation behavior, but no detailed comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions are provided. The literature touches on some aspects of the question but lacks specific details about experimental verification, quantification, and comparison to DFT predictions for oxygen-induced segregation in these bimetallic systems.

HREELS and AES techniques are used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems:

1. HREELS monitors the segregation by detecting the onset of characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes after oxygen exposure at different temperatures.

2. AES quantifies segregation kinetics by measuring the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt, which increase with oxygen exposure, confirming the segregation of subsurface atoms.

3. The activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation are estimated using Arrhenius equation analysis of AES data: 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni.

These experimental results align with DFT predictions, which suggest that Ni should have a higher activation barrier for segregation compared to Co due to its smaller driving potential. The combination of experimental techniques and theoretical predictions provides a comprehensive understanding of the segregation process in these bimetallic systems.

The provided information does not directly address how HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text only mentions that experimental studies have shown surface monolayers to be more stable in the presence of oxygen, without specifying the techniques used. Some data on segregation kinetics is provided, noting that Ni atoms diffuse to the surface at 450 K and Co atoms at 350 K under 10-8 Torr of O2. However, the document does not provide information on activation barriers or compare experimental results to DFT predictions in detail. The text suggests that more comprehensive experimental studies, such as in-situ EXAFS, would be needed to further investigate this phenomenon under reaction conditions and to fully answer the question.

The literature does not provide specific details about how HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. However, it mentions that experimental techniques confirmed DFT predictions about the stability of surface vs subsurface configurations in the presence of oxygen.

          The document states that exposure to oxygen caused subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure conditions. This supports the idea that oxygen induces surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in this bimetallic system.

          The literature does not provide information on measured segregation kinetics or activation barriers for these systems, nor does it compare these to DFT predictions. It only mentions that DFT calculations showed the surface configuration to be more stable than the subsurface configuration for oxygen adsorbates, which was then confirmed experimentally.

          The relative thermodynamic stability of surface and subsurface structures is said to depend on adsorbate coverage and electronegativity. A similar stability was predicted for NiPtPt surfaces with nitrogen adsorbates as with oxygen.
