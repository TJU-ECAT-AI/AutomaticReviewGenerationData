          "Recent experimental and DFT studies show that the surface monolayer is more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface monolayer in the presence of oxygen. For example, in the presence of 10-8 Torr of O2, subsurface Ni atoms start to diffuse on top of Pt(111) at 450 K, while the diffusion of Co in PtCoPt(111) occurs at temperatures as low as 350 K."

          "More direct measurements, such as careful EXAFS (extended X-ray adsorption fine structure) studies under in situ reaction conditions, would reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during reforming."

          The provided information does not directly address how HREELS and AES verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text only mentions that experimental studies have shown surface monolayers to be more stable in the presence of oxygen, without specifying the techniques used. Some data on segregation kinetics is provided, noting that Ni atoms diffuse to the surface at 450 K and Co atoms at 350 K under 10-8 Torr of O2. However, the document does not provide information on activation barriers or compare experimental results to DFT predictions in detail. The text suggests that more comprehensive experimental studies, such as in-situ EXAFS, would be needed to further investigate this phenomenon under reaction conditions and to fully answer the question.

          提供的信息并未直接说明HREELS和AES如何验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析。文本仅提到实验研究表明，在氧存在的情况下，表面单层更稳定，但没有具体说明所使用的技术。文中提供了一些关于偏析动力学的数据，指出在10-8 Torr的O2下，Ni原子在450 K时扩散到表面，而Co原子在350 K时就开始扩散。然而，文档没有提供活化能障或详细比较实验结果与DFT预测。文本建议进行更全面的实验研究，如原位EXAFS，以进一步研究反应条件下的这种现象，并完整回答这个问题。
