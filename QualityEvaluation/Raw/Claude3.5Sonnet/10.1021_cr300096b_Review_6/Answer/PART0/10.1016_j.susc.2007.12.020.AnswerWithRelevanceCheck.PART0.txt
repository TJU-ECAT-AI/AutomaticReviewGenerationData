          [1] "DFT modeling indicates that the d-band center of Pt is modified by the presence of Ni directly underneath Pt in the PtNiPt(111) structure, and trends in the calculated binding energies of various adsorbates have been confirmed experimentally [6]."

[2] "DFT modeling suggests that the second layer Ni should segregate to the top-most surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, which has been confirmed experimentally [41]."

[3] "The novel chemistry of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure is always observed by annealing the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600700 K. If the annealing temperature is above 800 K, at which temperature the Ni starts to diffuse into the bulk of Pt(111) based on AES measurements, the surface essentially behaves as Pt(111) and the Ni atoms no longer segregate to the surface after exposing to oxygen."

          The literature provides limited information on the experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface Ni atoms in PtNiPt(111) systems. AES is mentioned as a technique used to monitor Ni diffusion into bulk Pt(111) at higher temperatures. The document states that oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface has been experimentally confirmed, but does not specify the techniques used or provide quantitative data on segregation kinetics or activation barriers. DFT modeling is mentioned as predicting the segregation behavior, but no detailed comparisons between experimental measurements and DFT predictions are provided. The literature touches on some aspects of the question but lacks specific details about experimental verification, quantification, and comparison to DFT predictions for oxygen-induced segregation in these bimetallic systems.

          文献提供了有关PtNiPt(111)系统中亚表面Ni原子的氧诱导表面偏析的实验验证和定量的有限信息。提到AES被用作监测Ni在高温下向体相Pt(111)扩散的技术。文档指出，亚表面Ni向表面的氧诱导偏析已经得到实验证实，但没有具体说明所使用的技术或提供关于偏析动力学或激活能障的定量数据。提到DFT建模预测了偏析行为，但没有提供实验测量与DFT预测之间的详细比较。文献涉及了问题的某些方面，但缺乏关于这些双金属系统中氧诱导偏析的实验验证、量化和与DFT预测比较的具体细节。
