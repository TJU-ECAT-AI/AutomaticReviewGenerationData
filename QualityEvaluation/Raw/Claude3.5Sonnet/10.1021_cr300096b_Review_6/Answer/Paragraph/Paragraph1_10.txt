Experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, specifically focusing on subsurface Ni and Co atoms, have provided valuable insights into the behavior of these complex materials. Researchers have employed various advanced techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), to observe and measure the migration of 3d atoms to the surface when exposed to oxygen. The kinetics of this segregation process have been studied in detail, revealing the time-dependent nature of the phenomenon and the factors influencing its rate. Comparisons between experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) predictions have shown both agreements and discrepancies, highlighting the importance of experimental validation in refining theoretical models. These findings have significant implications for catalysis and materials science, as they contribute to a better understanding of how surface composition changes under reactive conditions, potentially affecting the performance and durability of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.
