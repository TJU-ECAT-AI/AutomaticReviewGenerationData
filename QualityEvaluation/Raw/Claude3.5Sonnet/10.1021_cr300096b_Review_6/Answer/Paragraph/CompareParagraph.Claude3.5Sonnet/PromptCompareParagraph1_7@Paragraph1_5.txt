Experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems have been achieved through the use of High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques provide complementary information on the segregation process and its kinetics.

HREELS has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. The onset of characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes in the HREEL spectra confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. This technique provides a qualitative verification of the segregation process.

AES measurements have been employed to quantify the segregation kinetics [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt are used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. The normalized Ni/Pt or Co/Pt AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, indicating segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface [10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7].

The segregation kinetics are measured by tracking the change in AES ratio over time during oxygen exposure [10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7]. Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the AES data, the activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation have been estimated. For Ni, the activation barrier is 15 ± 2 kcal/mol (in the 400-475 K range), while for Co, it is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol (in the 300-350 K range) [10.1021/jp061697z][10.1021/cr300096b\_6].

These experimental results align well with DFT predictions. DFT calculations show that:

1. The 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structures are more stable than Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures in the presence of oxygen, consistent with the observed segregation [10.1021/jp061697z].
2. Oxygen binding is stronger on 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces compared to Pt, which agrees with the experimental observation of segregation driven by oxygen adsorption [10.1021/jp061697z].
3. The activation barriers for other 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) are predicted to be even lower than those for Co or Ni [10.1021/jp061697z].

The lower activation barrier for Co segregation compared to Ni matches the DFT-predicted trend of easier segregation for earlier 3d transition metals [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. This trend is attributed to the shift of the d-band center closer to the Fermi level for different 3d metals [10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The combination of experimental techniques (HREELS and AES) with DFT predictions has provided a comprehensive understanding of oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. This synergy between theory and experiment has revealed not only the occurrence of segregation but also its kinetics and thermodynamic driving forces.

Looking forward, there are several directions for future research:

1. Extending the study to other 3d metals: While Ni and Co have been well-studied, investigating the segregation behavior of other 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) experimentally could validate the DFT predictions of even lower activation barriers for these elements.

2. In-situ studies under reaction conditions: As suggested in the literature, more direct measurements such as in-situ EXAFS studies under reaction conditions could reveal whether the diffusion of subsurface 3d metals occurs during actual catalytic processes like reforming [10.1021/jp0548927].

3. Exploring the impact of other adsorbates: Given that the stability of surface vs. subsurface structures depends on adsorbate electronegativity, investigating the effects of other relevant adsorbates beyond oxygen could provide insights into segregation behavior under various reaction environments.

4. Developing predictive models: By combining the experimental data with DFT calculations, more accurate predictive models for segregation behavior in bimetallic systems could be developed, potentially aiding in the design of more efficient catalysts.

5. Investigating the reversibility of segregation: Understanding the conditions under which segregation can be reversed could lead to the development of catalysts with dynamically controllable surface compositions.

These future directions could significantly enhance our understanding of bimetallic catalysts and potentially lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalytic systems for various applications.

Experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems have been achieved through the combined use of High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques provide complementary information on the surface composition and segregation kinetics.

HREELS has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. The onset of characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes in the HREEL spectra confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. This spectroscopic evidence provides a qualitative verification of the segregation process.

AES measurements have been employed to quantify the segregation kinetics by tracking the increase in surface Ni/Pt or Co/Pt ratios as a function of oxygen exposure time and temperature [10.1021/jp061697z]. The normalized AES intensity ratios are used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures. For instance, Figure 8 in one study displays the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for an initially Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface as a function of oxygen exposure [10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7]. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms [10.1021/cr300096b\_6].

The kinetics of the segregation process have been quantified by estimating activation barriers using Arrhenius equation analysis of the AES data [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. The activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Ni is estimated to be 15 ± 2 kcal/mol in the temperature range of 400-475 K [10.1021/jp061697z]. For Co, the activation barrier is estimated to be 7 ± 1 kcal/mol in the temperature range of 300-350 K [10.1021/jp061697z].

These experimental results align well with Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions. DFT calculations indicate that in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable [10.1021/jp061697z]. Instead, the stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface (3d-Pt-Pt), leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms [10.1021/jp061697z].

The trend in activation barriers observed experimentally follows the predictions from DFT calculations. DFT results suggest that Ni should have a smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co, corresponding to a higher activation barrier [10.1021/cr300096b\_6]. This is consistent with the experimentally determined activation barriers of 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co.

Furthermore, DFT results predict that the activation barriers for the segregation of other subsurface 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) should be even lower than those for Co or Ni [10.1021/jp061697z]. This trend is related to the shifting of the d-band center closer to the Fermi level for different 3d metals.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The combination of experimental techniques (HREELS and AES) with theoretical predictions (DFT) has provided a comprehensive understanding of oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. This integrated approach has revealed not only the occurrence of segregation but also its kinetics and energetics.

Future research directions could focus on:

1. Extending these studies to a wider range of 3d metals and more complex multi-metallic systems to develop a more general understanding of segregation phenomena in catalytic materials.

2. Investigating the impact of other adsorbates, such as hydrocarbons or sulfur compounds, on segregation behavior to better mimic real catalytic conditions.

3. Developing in situ and operando characterization techniques that can monitor segregation under realistic reaction conditions, as suggested by the potential use of EXAFS for studying diffusion during reforming reactions [10.1021/jp0548927].

4. Exploring the relationship between surface segregation and catalytic performance, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for various industrial processes.

5. Investigating the reversibility of the segregation process and its implications for catalyst regeneration and long-term stability.

These future directions could significantly advance our understanding of the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts and contribute to the rational design of more effective catalytic systems for various applications.
