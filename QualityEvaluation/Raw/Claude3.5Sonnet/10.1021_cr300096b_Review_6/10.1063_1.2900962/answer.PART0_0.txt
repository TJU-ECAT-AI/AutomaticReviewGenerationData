The provided literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES for verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document also does not discuss measured segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or comparisons with DFT predictions for these specific systems. The literature appears to focus more on DFT calculations and some experimental results, but does not provide the detailed experimental data requested in the question.
