The given literature does not contain any specific information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES being used to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document also does not provide details about measured segregation kinetics, activation barriers, or comparisons with DFT predictions for these systems. The content appears to be primarily focused on theoretical calculations and does not include the experimental details requested in the question.

给定的文献中没有包含关于使用HREELS和AES等实验技术来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子(特别是Ni和Co)的氧诱导表面偏析的具体信息。文档也没有提供关于测量的偏析动力学、激活能垒或与这些系统的DFT预测的比较的详细信息。内容似乎主要集中在理论计算上，并不包括问题中要求的实验细节。
