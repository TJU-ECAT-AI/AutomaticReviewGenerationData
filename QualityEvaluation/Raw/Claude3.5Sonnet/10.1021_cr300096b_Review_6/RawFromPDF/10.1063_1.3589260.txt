We investigate the decomposition of ammonia on bimetallic surfaces prepared by the deposition of a monolayer of Fe, Co, or Cu on a Pt(111) surface computationally and experimentally. We explore the correlation between predicted activities based on the nitrogen binding energies with experimental decomposition activity on these bimetallic and corresponding monometallic surfaces. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, it is predicted that the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Co-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces, with a monolayer of Fe or Co on top of Pt(111), are active toward decomposing ammonia. In contrast, the corresponding subsurface configurations, Pt-Fe-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) are inactive. These predictions were confirmed experimentally through temperature programmed desorption experiments. Decomposition was seen at temperatures below 350 K for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Co-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces. For the Cu/Pt(111) system, the surface, subsurface and parent metals were each predicted to be inactive, consistent with experiments, further validating the model predictions. The stability of these bimetallic surfaces in the presence of adsorbed nitrogen is also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ammonia has recently been considered as a chemical hydrogen storage medium due to its high energy density and ability to be liquefied at relatively low pressures of 9 atmospheres at 293 K.1 In this application, the hydrogen in the ammonia would be released via catalytic decomposition to run a fuel cell. The decomposition reaction occurs according to the following elementary reactions:

The decomposition reaction has mainly been studied on single metals and Ru has been shown to be the most active among single metals.2 Ru is very expensive and its activity toward ammonia decomposition is low below 600 K, whereas the thermodynamic equilibrium for decomposition is already at 97% (at 1 atm). Theoretical studies, such as those by Hansgen et al.3 and Jacobsen et al.,4 found the nitrogen binding energy to be a good descriptor for catalytic activity for this reaction, allowing correlation of the activity to the nitrogen binding energy for different catalysts. Several research groups have used such a correlation to explore bimetallic catalysts for the decomposition reaction.3,5
Surface and subsurface bimetallic catalysts have been shown to have properties that differ from the parent metals. This “emergent” behavior provides an opportunity to develop new catalysts that are superior to the parent metals. The specific molecular architecture of the two metals in a bimetallic catalyst greatly affects the catalytic properties. A uniform distribution of the metal atoms throughout the surface and core of the catalyst gives rise to properties that are a linear combination of the parent metals.4 For monolayer bimetallic systems, where the top layer or second layer is enriched by a second metal, giving the surface and subsurface configuration, respectively, the properties typically are not an interpolating function of the parent metals and usually result in binding energies lower or higher than either parent metal.6,7 In these systems, the unique properties have been attributed to the strain and ligand effects, where the strain is a result of constraining the metal monolayer (either surface or subsurface) to the lattice constant of the host metal, and the ligand effect is the result of an electronic interaction between the two metals.6,8 The nonlinear behavior of these bimetallic catalysts creates an opportunity to design and optimize bimetallic catalysts.
Previous work of Hansgen et al. utilized the nonlinear properties of the monolayer bimetallics to find active catalysts from parent metals that were not active for the decomposition reaction.3 They found that the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface was active at decomposing ammonia at 325 K and able to achieve a saturation coverage of 0.3 ML atomic nitrogen at temperatures and exposures much lower than those on Ru(0001). Additionally, the nitrogen desorption temperature on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface was lower than on Ru(0001), indicating a very active catalyst since both the NH-H bond breaking and nitrogen desorption can be rate limiting steps.3 
In this paper, we extend the bimetallic surfaces to other 3d metals on the left and right sides of Ni in the Periodic Table, including Fe, Co, and Cu. We explore the activity of both the surface and subsurface monolayer bimetallic configurations toward ammonia decomposition. We use the microkinetic model results of Hansgen et al.3 to predict the activity of the Fe/Pt, Co/Pt, and Cu/Pt bimetallic systems. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were performed as experimental validation of the activity predictions and designed to probe the two kinetically sensitive reaction steps, the decomposition of the ammonia and the desorption of nitrogen. As we show in Table I and Fig. 1, the proposed set of (active and inactive) catalysts is fairly diverse and forms a strong basis for qualitative assessment of the microkinetic model predictions.

Predicted conversions at 850 K for the ammonia decomposition reaction as a function of the nitrogen binding energy, using the microkinetic model developed by Hansgen et al. (Ref. 3). Surfaces studied along the top axis show the computed binding energies using VASP. These surfaces provide a wide range of predicted catalytic activities.
II. METHODS
A. Computational
Binding energies on the different monolayer bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic surfaces were calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) version 4.6,9 utilizing the PW91 functional10 with ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials11 and a cut off energy of 396 eV. All calculations were performed spin polarized, using a 3×3×1 Monkhorst k-point grid12 and a 3 × 3 supercell with 4 layers of metal, with the bottom two layers frozen. The nitrogen atom was then placed in multiple adsorption sites to determine the most thermodynamically stable site and the binding energy was calculated based on the following equation:

where E(slab) is the energy of the slab, E(adsorbate) is the energy of the adsorbate in vacuum, in this case a nitrogen atom, E(slab+X adsorbates) is the energy of the slab system with adsorbates on the surface, and X is the number of adsorbates in the supercell.
To calculate nitrogen binding energies on Fe and Cu, the lattice constants were first optimized for Fe in a body centered cubic and Cu in a face centered cubic bulk structure. The equilibrium lattice constants were calculated to be 2.89 and 3.64 Å for Fe and Cu, respectively. These values compare well with the experimental lattice constants which are 2.87 Å for Fe and 3.61 Å for Cu.13 The most stable adsorption site was determined on the closed-packed (110) face for Fe and the (111) face for Cu. Nitrogen binding energies on the closed-packed Co(0001) and Ru(0001) surfaces had been previously calculated3 and are listed in Table I.
Calculations of nitrogen binding energies on the Pt based bimetallic surfaces were carried out by first creating a Pt slab of 4 layers with a Pt lattice constant of 4.01 Å, cut along the closed-packed (111) orientation. To create the surface or subsurface configurations, the top or second layer was replaced with the second metal, as described previously.3 
The thermodynamic stability in the presence of adsorbates was also studied through density functional theory calculations. The energy of the system with nitrogen coverages varying from 1/9 to 1 monolayer was calculated on both the surface and subsurface configurations and used to determine the thermodynamic potential for segregation through Eq. (2), defined by Menning et al.,14

where A is the adsorbate, in this case nitrogen, EA/3d − Pt − Pt(111) and EA/Pt − 3d − Pt(111) are the total energies with adsorbate A at a certain coverage for the surface and subsurface configurations, respectively, and M is the number of admetal–platinum pairs per unit cell.
Since the current work builds on the microkinetic models from Hansgen et al.,3 we will give a brief overview of the methods and main conclusions of the previous study. Full microkinetic models for the ammonia decomposition reaction containing elementary reactions R1-R12 were used. Activation barriers for the elementary reactions were calculated through the unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) method15 using coverage dependent atomic binding energies as inputs to the method (obtained from the DFT calculations mentioned above), resulting in coverage dependent activation barriers. Pre-exponentials for the reaction steps were taken from a previous literature study in which they were fit to Ru experimental data16 and were assumed to be valid over the range of metals studied. Through a sensitivity analysis, both the removal of the second hydrogen, R5, and the nitrogen desorption, R9, were determined to be kinetically significant elementary reaction steps, with the relative sensitivities changing along the volcano curve.
For the specific data reproduced in Fig. 1 (from Fig. 1 of Hansgen et al.3), the nitrogen binding energies were varied between 70 and 160 kcal/mol and the hydrogen binding energy was calculated based on a correlation between nitrogen and hydrogen binding energies. Additionally, average coverage interactions (from the 9 metals reported) were used in calculating the activation barriers through the UBI method from the atomic binding energies.3 The nitrogen binding energy was shown as the descriptor for this volcano curve, although a number of descriptors for the catalytic activity were discussed in the supplemental section of Hansgen et al.3 It was found that all NHx species could be used as descriptors, although they are not independent since the NHx binding energies depend on nitrogen binding energies, as the UBI-QEP method15 or linear correlations recently developed via DFT (Ref. 17) indicate.
B. Experimental
A two level stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, with a typical base pressure around 4 × 10−10 Torr, was used for the TPD experiments as previously described.18 The chamber included an ion sputtering gun, an Auger electron spectrometer (AES), and a quadropole mass spectrometer. A Pt(111) single crystal, of 99.999% purity and cut to within 0.5° of the (111) orientation, was connected to the copper leads of the manipulator via 1.0 mm tantalum posts spot welded to the sides of the crystal. Cooling of the copper leads was achieved through direct contact to a liquid nitrogen reservoir. The crystal was resistively heated through the tantalum leads and the temperature was measured by a chromel-alumel thermocouple spot welded to the back of the Pt(111) crystal. A heating rate of 3 K/s was used for the TPD experiments. With this set-up, the crystal temperature could be controlled between 110 and 1100 K. Anhydrous ammonia, of 99.99% purity, was used and the purity was checked in situ with the mass spectrometer before experiments each day. Ammonia was dosed in the background for all experiments and after dosing, the temperature was held constant for 10 min to allow the residual ammonia in the UHV background to be pumped away before ramping the temperature up for a TPD experiment.
The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by neon ion bombardment for 30 min at 10 μA at 300 K and repeated until all foreign metal atoms were removed as determined by AES. The crystal was then heated to 890 K in 10 L (1 L = 1 × 10−6 Torr s) oxygen, of 99.998% purity, to burn off any remaining surface carbon. Crystal heating was then resumed to 1100 K and held at this temperature for 8 min to anneal the crystal.
Each of the bimetallic surfaces, Fe/Pt(111), Co/Pt(111), and Cu/Pt(111), was prepared by depositing the metal on the clean, freshly annealed Pt(111) surface. The Fe, Co, and Cu metal sources were created by wrapping a metal wire of 0.25 mm thickness and 99.994% purity around a tungsten wire. The tungsten wire was resistively heated above the vaporization temperature of the metal to physically vapor deposit the metal onto Pt(111).
When the Pt(111) sample was held at 300 K during the deposition of the second metal, the second metal would remain on the surface, giving rise to the surface monolayer configuration, designated as 3d-Pt-Pt(111). When the temperature was held at 600 K during deposition, the monolayer metal would diffuse into the second layer with the first layer enriched in Pt, giving rise to the subsurface configuration, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), as characterized previously.19 After deposition, Auger electron spectroscopy was used to quantify the amount of the deposited metal on the surface. The metal was deposited at 300 K until an Auger ratio of Fe(646 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ∼ 1.6, Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ∼ 2.4, or Cu(922 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ∼ 1.8 was achieved, at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, for each respective 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration as previously determined.19 For the subsurface configurations, the metal was deposited for the same amount of time at the elevated temperature of 600 K. If more than 5 monolayers of a second metal are deposited onto the surface, the properties of the Pt substrate are shielded out, resulting in properties that are representative of the 3d metal being deposited.20 Therefore, to make a thin film of 3d metal surface, the metal was deposited for over five times the amount of time needed to deposit one monolayer.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Density functional theory and microkinetic modeling results
Hereafter, M2-M1-M1(111) represents the surface configuration with a monolayer of a second metal on top of the base metal cut in the (111) orientation, and M1-M2-M1(111) represents the subsurface configuration, with the second metal sandwiched between two layers of the bulk metal. Table I lists the nitrogen binding energies on the monometallic and bimetallic systems studied at 1/9 ML nitrogen along with the most stable adsorption site. The most stable binding site for the nitrogen atom was found to be either a 3-fold or 3-fold hollow site for the fcc(111) and hcp(0001) surfaces, and a 4-fold site for the iron bcc(110) surface, with nitrogen binding energies ranging from 75 kcal/mol on Cu(111) to 155 kcal/mol on Fe(110).
Figure 1 shows the predicted activity as a function of nitrogen binding energy for each of the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces based on the microkinetic models reported by Hansgen et al.3 The top horizontal axis indicates the binding energies computed via VASP for the specific systems of interest. From Fig. 1, all of the subsurface configurations, Pt-3d-Pt(111), are predicted to be inactive because of the low nitrogen binding energies. In addition, monometallic Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) are also predicted to be inactive toward the decomposition reaction. The Fe-Pt-Pt(111), Fe(110), Co-Pt-Pt(111), and Co(0001) surfaces are all predicted to be active, although the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Co-Pt-Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces are predicted to have a higher activity than the monometallic surfaces. Due to the large range of predicted activities, this set of systems serves as a fairly diverse experimental means to validate the model predictions.
B. Experimental results
The catalytic activity of the Fe, Co, Cu monometallic and Fe/Pt, Co/Pt, Cu/Pt bimetallic surfaces toward the ammonia decomposition were tested using TPD experiments. Each of the surfaces was prepared and then exposed to 3 L of ammonia at 350 K before performing the TPD experiment. The dosing temperature of 350 K is above the ammonia desorption temperature. Therefore, the experiments measure the decomposition under conditions where the ammonia is adsorbing and desorbing from the surface, similar to practical conditions. In order to compare the relative decomposition activity, it was assumed that the ammonia sticking coefficients are the same on each surface since the initial sticking coefficient on several surfaces has been shown to be unity.21 Additionally, similar exposures were shown to result in similar ammonia coverages for the Ni/Pt system, suggesting similar sticking probabilities on the bimetallic and monometallic surfaces.3 Figure 2 shows the desorption spectra of the decomposition product, nitrogen, for each of the surfaces. The m/z = 14 amu was used rather than m/z = 28 amu to eliminate any overlap with the desorption of background CO. Figure 2 shows that none of the subsurface configurations, Pt-Fe-Pt(111), Pt-Co-Pt(111), and Pt-Cu-Pt(111), are active toward ammonia decomposition, consistent with the model predictions in Fig. 1. Additionally, the surface configuration Cu-Pt-Pt(111), thick Cu, and Pt(111) are inactive toward decomposition, again in agreement with model predictions. The Fe-Pt-Pt(111), Co-Pt-Pt(111), thick Co, and thick Fe are all active toward the decomposition of ammonia. For both of the surface configurations, Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Co-Pt-Pt(111), more N2 is produced from the bimetallic surface than on either of the parent metals.

Temperature programmed desorption spectra for Co/Pt, Fe/Pt, and Cu/Pt bimetallic and monometallic surfaces.
The nitrogen coverages were quantified by comparing the integrated area of the nitrogen desorption peak to the integrated area produced by a saturation coverage of CO (θCO = 0.68) on the Pt(111) surface after taking into account the difference in sensitivity factors for N2 and CO, as described previously.3,18 The nitrogen coverage on each of the surfaces was θN = 0.30 ML for Co-Pt-Pt(111), θN = 0.14 ML for thick Co, θN = 0.18 ML for Fe-Pt-Pt(111), and θN = 0.12 for thick Fe.
The nitrogen desorption temperature should be related to the nitrogen binding energy on the surface. The nitrogen binding energy (from Table I) shows the trend of Co(0001) < Co-Pt-Pt(111) < Fe-Pt-Pt(111) < Fe(110) and experimental nitrogen desorption temperatures follow the trend of Co-Pt-Pt(111) < Fe-Pt-Pt(111) = thick Co < thick Fe. Both Co and Fe are known to form bulk nitrides,22 which would increase the desorption temperature and explain the higher desorption temperature of nitrogen on Co than that expected from the DFT binding energy calculations. Since Fe, a body centered cubic lattice, is epitaxially grown on a face centered lattice structure, residual strain cannot be ruled out for the Fe film which might increase the binding energy. Additionally, undercoordinated defects created through the synthesis method of physical vapor deposition may also increase the nitrogen binding energy.
Due to the high activity on the Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces, additional experiments were performed on those two surfaces by varying dosing temperature before the TPD experiment. A monolayer bimetallic surface was prepared and then exposed to 3L NH3 at a set temperature, ranging from 150 K to 500 K and a TPD was then performed. Using the resulting spectra, the temperature at which the ammonia starts decomposing during dosing as well as the saturation coverage and conditions to achieve saturation have been determined.
The TPD spectra for nitrogen desorption on the Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The inset in each figure shows the coverage of nitrogen after dosing 3 L ammonia at each temperature (quantified from the area under each nitrogen desorption peak). For the Co-Pt-Pt(111) system, the amount of nitrogen on the surface starts increasing at a dosing temperature of 325 K, showing that the ammonia is decomposing at that temperature. At a temperature of 350 K (3L NH3), the nitrogen has already reached saturation, θN = 0.30 ML, and further increasing the dosing temperature does not increase the amount of nitrogen on the surface. For Fe-Pt-Pt(111), the amount of nitrogen on the surface after dosing increases significantly between a dosing temperature of 325 K and 350 K, indicating that the onset for decomposition happens at temperatures slightly above 325 K. Additionally, a saturation coverage of θN = 0.29 ML for this surface occurs at 400 K at 3 L NH3. The decomposition behavior for these two systems is very similar, with the onset for decomposition happening within 25 K of each other and saturation coverage being achieved within 50 K of each other (350 K vs. 400 K). Barriers for the decomposition reactions (R3, R5, R7) were calculated through the unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) method15 from the nitrogen binding energies, assuming a correlation between nitrogen and hydrogen binding energies, and are shown in Table II along with a full potential energy diagram in Fig. 4. It was found that the decomposition barriers are very similar for both surfaces, consistent with the experimental findings. Additionally, the results are consistent with TPD results of ammonia decomposition on Ni-Pt-Pt(111),3 where decomposition was seen at 325 K and saturation seen at 375 K and 3 L NH3.

One difference between the bimetallic surfaces is the temperature at which the nitrogen desorbs. The peak desorption temperature is 745 K for the Co-Pt-Pt(111) surface compared to 826 K for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) surface. It is expected that nitrogen desorption temperature on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface should be between the Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) values based on the trend in nitrogen binding energy (Table I). However, experimental nitrogen desorption temperatures on both Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) are higher than on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), which shows a desorption temperature of 630 K.3 Additionally, the desorption temperatures on Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) are higher than that on Ru(0001), which has a peak desorption temperature of 680 K at a saturation coverage of 0.28 ML,23 even though Ru has a slightly higher calculated nitrogen binding energy than either of the surfaces (Table I). These higher than expected desorption temperatures may be due to nitrogen binding strongly to defect sites or may indicate that the nitrogen atoms diffuse into the Co and Fe layer to form surface nitride, which would increase the nitrogen binding energy and correspondingly the desorption temperature. The latter hypothesis is consistent with Fe and Co forming bulk nitride structures.22 Another reason for the higher than expected experimental desorption temperatures, compared to DFT binding energies, may be from the systematic errors of DFT calculations. Although these two surfaces have slightly higher nitrogen desorption temperatures than the Ru(0001) and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces, where nitrogen desorption is a kinetically significant reaction step, they are still promising catalysts toward the decomposition of ammonia. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis.
C. Stability Results and Discussion
It is also important to determine whether the desirable surface monolayer Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) structures are thermodynamically stable under ammonia decomposition conditions. Figure 5 shows the stability of the bimetallic surface in the presence of surface nitrogen for the Fe/Pt, Co/Pt, and Cu/Pt systems. A positive segregation energy (ΔEseg.) means that the subsurface configuration is thermodynamically favored and a negative value means that the surface configuration is favored. For the Cu/Pt system, the subsurface configuration is preferred at all coverages and the thermodynamic preference towards the subsurface configuration increases with nitrogen coverage. For both the Co/Pt and Fe/Pt systems, the most stable surface configuration switches with nitrogen coverage. At low coverages, the subsurface configuration is preferred, but at higher coverages the active surface configuration is more stable thermodynamically. The coverage at which the thermodynamically stable configuration switches, based on fitting the DFT calculations with a linear line and calculating the x-intercept, is 0.35 ML nitrogen for the Co/Pt system and 0.38 ML nitrogen for the Fe/Pt system. Since only the surface configurations are active for the ammonia decomposition reaction, this implies that the process needs to operate under conditions that would result in nitrogen coverages above ∼0.35 ML to stabilize the desired surface configurations. Since the saturation coverage of nitrogen on the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface under UHV conditions is ∼0.3ML, it would be difficult to achieve nitrogen coverages of ∼0.35 ML needed to stabilize the desired high activity surface. As described below, when considering bimetallic particles, additional factors may influence the stability.

The thermodynamic potential for segregation for the Fe/Pt, Co/Pt and Cu/Pt systems as a function of surface nitrogen coverage. A positive value means that the subsurface configuration is preferred and a negative value means the surface configuration is thermodynamically favored.
The nitrogen coverages predicted to stabilize the surface configuration were calculated on extended slabs using the (111) facet with an infinite reservoir of Pt in the bulk. An actual catalyst particle will be supported and have edges, defects, and multiple exposed planes and a finite composition which may change the stability thermodynamics. Tao et al. have shown that the relative composition of the two metals forming a core-shell type of structure has a dominant effect on the composition of the top surface layers in the nanoparticle, although the overall segregation trends in oxidizing, reducing, and catalytic environments remain unchanged.24 Bridging the materials gap, Grass et al. have compared 15 nm bimetallic particles and a bulk crystal of the same composition (Rh0.5Pd0.5) and have shown that the segregation is more pronounced on the nanoparticles (higher concentration of segregated metal on the surface with lower temperatures needed to drive the segregation reaction),25 showing that defects and particle structure do influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of segregation. Although optimizing the particle composition and size is outside of the scope of this paper, we believe that these factors could contribute to the stable bimetallic structure for the ammonia decomposition reaction.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The ammonia decomposition activity of Fe/Pt, Co/Pt, and Cu/Pt monolayer bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic surfaces was predicted based on DFT calculated nitrogen binding energies and microkinetic modeling. Microkinetic model predictions indicated the Co-Pt-Pt(111) and Fe-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces as potentially active catalysts for this reaction. These surfaces were tested using TPD experiments and found to have higher decomposition activity compared to the parent metals. Additionally, the Cu/Pt system (Cu-Pt-Pt(111), Pt-Cu-Pt(111), Cu(111), and Pt(111) surfaces) were all predicted to be inactive toward decomposing ammonia, a finding that was confirmed experimentally. The diverse set of binding energies and activity of the catalysts studied herein provides further evidence that microkinetic modeling can be invaluable in predicting catalyst activity. Furthermore, our study shows that the nitrogen binding energy can be used as a descriptor to predict catalytic activity. Finally, Co/Pt and Fe/Pt bimetallic catalysts could potentially be active catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction if the Co or Fe are stabilized in the surface layer of the catalyst particle in a core-shell type of structure.
