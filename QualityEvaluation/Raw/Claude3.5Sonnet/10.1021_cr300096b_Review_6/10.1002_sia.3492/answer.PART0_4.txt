The given literature does not contain any information about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES to verify and quantify oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The document focuses on methanol decomposition on Pt/Ni(111) surface alloy studied by XPS and does not discuss oxygen-induced segregation or comparisons with DFT predictions for Ni and Co segregation kinetics and activation barriers. The question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this literature.

给定的文献中没有包含关于使用HREELS和AES等实验技术来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属体系中氧诱导的亚表面3d原子(特别是Ni和Co)表面偏析的信息。该文档主要关注通过XPS研究的Pt/Ni(111)表面合金上甲醇分解过程,并未讨论氧诱导的偏析或与DFT预测的Ni和Co偏析动力学和活化能障比较。基于本文献提供的信息无法回答该问题。
