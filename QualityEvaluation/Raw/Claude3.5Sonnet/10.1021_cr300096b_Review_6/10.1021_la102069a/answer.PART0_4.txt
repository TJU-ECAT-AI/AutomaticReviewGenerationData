The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, or about measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compared to DFT predictions. The document appears to be about adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone on different platinum surfaces, which is unrelated to the question asked.

所给的文献中没有任何与回答问题相关的信息,该问题是关于HREELS和AES等实验技术如何验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析,以及测量的偏析动力学和活化能障如何与DFT预测相比较。该文档似乎是关于环己酮在不同铂表面上的吸附和分解,这与所问的问题无关。
