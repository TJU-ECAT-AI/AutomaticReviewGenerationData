Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verifying and quantifying oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The text does not discuss HREELS, AES, oxygen-induced segregation, or Pt-3d-Pt(111) systems. It appears to be about a different topic entirely, focusing on the adsorption and decomposition of cyclohexanone on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. Therefore, this question cannot be answered using the provided literature.

给出的科学文献中没有任何相关信息可以回答关于HREELS和AES等实验技术如何验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中亚表面3d原子的氧诱导表面偏析的问题。文本没有讨论HREELS、AES、氧诱导偏析或Pt-3d-Pt(111)系统。它似乎是关于一个完全不同的主题，主要集中在环己酮在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和分解。因此，无法使用提供的文献来回答这个问题。
