[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence of CO2 was carried out at 600 C; the results, along with the BET surface areas of the catalysts, are given in Table 4 and Fig. 2."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C; the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."

[3] "The addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has different effects on the Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts."

[4] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

[5] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

The literature does not specifically address chromium oxide catalysts, but instead focuses on supported gallium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of supports and CO2 on dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Different supports (TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, MgO) significantly affect catalyst activity and the impact of CO2 on the reaction.

2. CO2 can have both promoting and inhibiting effects depending on the support material. It promotes activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but inhibits Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. CO2 partial pressure influences reaction performance, with an optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio existing for some catalysts.

4. CO2 plays dual roles: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through reverse water-gas shift, and negatively by displacing adsorbed propane.

5. Support effects arise from differences in acid-base properties and metal-support interactions, influencing H2 adsorption capacity and reaction pathways.

Key challenges likely involve balancing the positive and negative effects of CO2, optimizing support properties, and maintaining catalyst stability. Trade-offs exist between activity, selectivity, and resistance to coking/deactivation.

文献并未特别讨论氧化铬催化剂，而是集中于研究负载型氧化镓催化剂在丙烷CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，我们可以从中得到一些关于载体和CO2对脱氢反应影响的见解：

1. 不同的载体（TiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2、MgO）显著影响催化剂活性和CO2对反应的影响。

2. CO2可能具有促进或抑制作用，取决于载体材料。它促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。

3. CO2分压影响反应性能，某些催化剂存在最佳CO2/C3H8比例。

4. CO2具有双重作用：通过逆水气变换反应去除吸附的H2起到正面作用，通过取代吸附的丙烷起到负面作用。

5. 载体效应源于酸碱性质和金属-载体相互作用的差异，影响H2吸附能力和反应途径。

主要挑战可能涉及平衡CO2的正负面效应、优化载体性质以及维持催化剂稳定性。活性、选择性和抗积碳/失活性之间存在权衡取舍。

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."

[2] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."

[3] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

[4] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it provides insights into the behavior of supported gallium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, which may be relevant to understanding similar systems:

1. Support materials significantly influence catalyst performance. TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 supports result in better dehydrogenation catalysts than SiO2 and MgO due to their higher surface acidity.

2. CO2 partial pressure affects catalyst activity differently depending on the support. It promotes activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but inhibits it for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. The main mechanistic pathway appears to be heterolytic dissociation rather than a redox mechanism.

4. CO2 plays dual roles: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing adsorbed propane on basic sites.

5. Key challenges include optimizing the balance between acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surface, and managing the competing effects of CO2 on reaction kinetics and adsorption equilibria.

6. The interaction between the support and the active metal oxide species (gallium oxide in this case) is crucial in determining catalyst properties and performance.

While these findings are for gallium oxide catalysts, they suggest that similar considerations may apply to chromium oxide systems, particularly regarding support effects, CO2 partial pressure influences, and mechanistic pathways.

该文献并未直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于负载型氧化镓催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的行为洞察，这可能与理解类似系统有关：

1. 载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。TiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2载体由于表面酸性较高，比SiO2和MgO载体产生更好的脱氢催化剂。

2. CO2分压对不同载体的催化剂活性影响不同。它促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。

3. 主要的机理途径似乎是异裂解离反应，而不是氧化还原机制。

4. CO2起双重作用：正面作用是通过逆水煤气反应除去吸附的H2，负面作用是置换催化剂碱性位点上吸附的丙烷。

5. 主要挑战包括优化催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点之间的平衡，以及管理CO2对反应动力学和吸附平衡的竞争效应。

6. 载体与活性金属氧化物物种（在本例中为氧化镓）之间的相互作用对确定催化剂性质和性能至关重要。

虽然这些发现是针对氧化镓催化剂的，但它们表明类似的考虑可能适用于铬氧化物系统，特别是在载体效应、CO2分压影响和机理途径方面。

The literature does not specifically discuss chromium oxide catalysts, but instead focuses on gallium oxide catalysts supported on different materials for propane dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn from the gallium oxide catalysts that may be relevant to chromium oxide catalysts:

1. Support materials significantly influence catalyst performance. TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 supports resulted in better dehydrogenation catalysts compared to SiO2 and MgO supports. This was attributed to the higher number of medium-strong and strong acid sites on the surface.

2. The effect of CO2 addition varies depending on the support material. For Ga2O3/TiO2, CO2 had a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity, while it had a negative effect for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. CO2 partial pressure influences the reaction in two ways: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing adsorbed propane from basic sites on the catalyst surface.

4. The interaction between the active metal oxide and the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalyst behavior, as evidenced by the different effects observed for various supported gallium oxide catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely include balancing the positive and negative effects of CO2, maximizing the number of appropriate acid sites on the catalyst surface, and optimizing the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support material.

1. 载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。TiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2载体比SiO2和MgO载体产生更好的脱氢催化剂。这归因于表面上具有更多的中强度和强度酸性位点。

2. CO2添加的效果因载体材料而异。对于Ga2O3/TiO2，CO2对脱氢活性有促进作用，而对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3则有负面影响。

3. CO2分压以两种方式影响反应：正面影响是通过逆水气变换反应去除吸附的H2，负面影响是从催化剂表面的碱性位点置换吸附的丙烷。

4. 活性金属氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用在决定催化剂行为方面起着至关重要的作用，这从各种负载的氧化镓催化剂观察到的不同效果可以看出。

1. Support materials significantly influence catalyst activity. TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 supports led to high activity for Ga2O3 catalysts, while SiO2 and MgO supports were ineffective.

2. CO2 can have both promoting and inhibiting effects depending on the support. It promoted activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed activity for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. CO2 plays dual roles: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by competing with propane for adsorption sites.

4. The CO2/C3H8 ratio affects performance, with an optimal ratio existing (e.g. 2 for Ga2O3/TiO2) beyond which activity decreases.

5. The paper mentions that silica-supported Cr2O3 shows a promoting effect with CO2, suggesting support and CO2 effects may be similar for chromium oxide catalysts.

Key challenges likely include balancing the positive and negative effects of CO2, optimizing the support-metal oxide interaction, and finding the ideal CO2/hydrocarbon ratio. Trade-offs may exist between activity, selectivity, and stability as reaction conditions are varied.

Different supports significantly impact catalyst performance. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective for propane dehydrogenation.

CO2 partial pressure influences activity differently depending on the support. For Ga2O3/TiO2, activity initially increased with CO2/C3H8 ratio, peaking at 2, then decreased. CO2 promoted activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Key challenges include optimizing CO2 partial pressure and selecting appropriate supports to balance promoting and inhibiting effects of CO2. The trade-off between enhanced activity and potential catalyst deactivation or selectivity changes with increasing CO2 pressure needs careful consideration.

While not directly applicable to chromium oxide catalysts, these findings suggest that support choice and CO2 partial pressure are critical factors to investigate for optimizing catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

主要挑战包括优化CO2分压和选择适当的载体，以平衡CO2的促进和抑制作用。需要仔细考虑CO2压力增加带来的活性增强与潜在的催化剂失活或选择性变化之间的权衡。

虽然这些发现不能直接应用于氧化铬催化剂，但它们表明载体选择和CO2分压是优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能需要研究的关键因素。
