[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."

[2] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."

[3] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

[4] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it provides insights into the behavior of supported gallium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, which may be relevant to understanding similar systems:

1. Support materials significantly influence catalyst performance. TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 supports result in better dehydrogenation catalysts than SiO2 and MgO due to their higher surface acidity.

2. CO2 partial pressure affects catalyst activity differently depending on the support. It promotes activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but inhibits it for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. The main mechanistic pathway appears to be heterolytic dissociation rather than a redox mechanism.

4. CO2 plays dual roles: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing adsorbed propane on basic sites.

5. Key challenges include optimizing the balance between acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surface, and managing the competing effects of CO2 on reaction kinetics and adsorption equilibria.

6. The interaction between the support and the active metal oxide species (gallium oxide in this case) is crucial in determining catalyst properties and performance.

While these findings are for gallium oxide catalysts, they suggest that similar considerations may apply to chromium oxide systems, particularly regarding support effects, CO2 partial pressure influences, and mechanistic pathways.

该文献并未直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于负载型氧化镓催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的行为洞察，这可能与理解类似系统有关：

1. 载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。TiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2载体由于表面酸性较高，比SiO2和MgO载体产生更好的脱氢催化剂。

2. CO2分压对不同载体的催化剂活性影响不同。它促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。

3. 主要的机理途径似乎是异裂解离反应，而不是氧化还原机制。

4. CO2起双重作用：正面作用是通过逆水煤气反应除去吸附的H2，负面作用是置换催化剂碱性位点上吸附的丙烷。

5. 主要挑战包括优化催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点之间的平衡，以及管理CO2对反应动力学和吸附平衡的竞争效应。

6. 载体与活性金属氧化物物种（在本例中为氧化镓）之间的相互作用对确定催化剂性质和性能至关重要。

虽然这些发现是针对氧化镓催化剂的，但它们表明类似的考虑可能适用于铬氧化物系统，特别是在载体效应、CO2分压影响和机理途径方面。
