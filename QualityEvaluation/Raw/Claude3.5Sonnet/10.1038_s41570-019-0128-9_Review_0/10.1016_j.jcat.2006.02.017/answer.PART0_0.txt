[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence of CO2 was carried out at 600 C; the results, along with the BET surface areas of the catalysts, are given in Table 4 and Fig. 2."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C; the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."

[3] "The addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has different effects on the Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts."

[4] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

[5] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

The literature does not specifically address chromium oxide catalysts, but instead focuses on supported gallium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of supports and CO2 on dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Different supports (TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, MgO) significantly affect catalyst activity and the impact of CO2 on the reaction.

2. CO2 can have both promoting and inhibiting effects depending on the support material. It promotes activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but inhibits Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

3. CO2 partial pressure influences reaction performance, with an optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio existing for some catalysts.

4. CO2 plays dual roles: positively by removing adsorbed H2 through reverse water-gas shift, and negatively by displacing adsorbed propane.

5. Support effects arise from differences in acid-base properties and metal-support interactions, influencing H2 adsorption capacity and reaction pathways.

Key challenges likely involve balancing the positive and negative effects of CO2, optimizing support properties, and maintaining catalyst stability. Trade-offs exist between activity, selectivity, and resistance to coking/deactivation.

文献并未特别讨论氧化铬催化剂，而是集中于研究负载型氧化镓催化剂在丙烷CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，我们可以从中得到一些关于载体和CO2对脱氢反应影响的见解：

1. 不同的载体（TiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2、MgO）显著影响催化剂活性和CO2对反应的影响。

2. CO2可能具有促进或抑制作用，取决于载体材料。它促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。

3. CO2分压影响反应性能，某些催化剂存在最佳CO2/C3H8比例。

4. CO2具有双重作用：通过逆水气变换反应去除吸附的H2起到正面作用，通过取代吸附的丙烷起到负面作用。

5. 载体效应源于酸碱性质和金属-载体相互作用的差异，影响H2吸附能力和反应途径。

主要挑战可能涉及平衡CO2的正负面效应、优化载体性质以及维持催化剂稳定性。活性、选择性和抗积碳/失活性之间存在权衡取舍。
