[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively."

[4] "Propane conversion over Ga2O3/TiO2 initially increased with the CO2/C3H8 ratio, reaching its peak when the CO2/C3H8 ratio equaled 2, then decreased with further increases in the CO2/C3H8 ratio."

[5] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts, but provides insights on gallium oxide catalysts that may be relevant:

Different supports significantly impact catalyst performance. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective for propane dehydrogenation.

CO2 partial pressure influences activity differently depending on the support. For Ga2O3/TiO2, activity initially increased with CO2/C3H8 ratio, peaking at 2, then decreased. CO2 promoted activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Key challenges include optimizing CO2 partial pressure and selecting appropriate supports to balance promoting and inhibiting effects of CO2. The trade-off between enhanced activity and potential catalyst deactivation or selectivity changes with increasing CO2 pressure needs careful consideration.

While not directly applicable to chromium oxide catalysts, these findings suggest that support choice and CO2 partial pressure are critical factors to investigate for optimizing catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

虽然文献没有直接讨论氧化铬催化剂，但它对氧化镓催化剂的见解可能具有相关性：

不同的载体对催化剂性能有显著影响。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对丙烷脱氢反应无效。

CO2分压对活性的影响因载体而异。对于Ga2O3/TiO2，活性最初随CO2/C3H8比例增加而增加，在比例为2时达到峰值，然后降低。CO2促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。

主要挑战包括优化CO2分压和选择适当的载体，以平衡CO2的促进和抑制作用。需要仔细考虑CO2压力增加带来的活性增强与潜在的催化剂失活或选择性变化之间的权衡。

虽然这些发现不能直接应用于氧化铬催化剂，但它们表明载体选择和CO2分压是优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能需要研究的关键因素。
