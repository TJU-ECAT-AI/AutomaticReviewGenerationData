Catalysts
 containing
 4.5  wt%
 cobalt  supported
 on  single
 oxides
 of
 SiO2,
 Al2O3,  TiO2 and  ZrO2 and  on
mixed
 ones
 of  SiO2-Al2O3,  SiO2-TiO2,
 SiO2-ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 were  produced
 in a
 single  step  by  flame
spray
 pyrolysis
 and  tested
 in
 the  CO2-assisted
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of  ethane
 in a
 continuous
fixed-bed
 microreactor.
 Structural
 and  chemical
 properties
 of the  nonporous
 catalysts
 were character-
ized
 by nitrogen
 adsorption,
 XRD,
 HR-TEM,
 EDXS,
 NH3-TPD,  H2-TPR,  TGA,  DRIFTS,
 XPS
 and  Raman
 and
UVvis
 spectroscopy.
 Depending
 on  the  supporting
 oxides  the  reducibility
 of
 the  cobalt  species
 varied
in
 a broad  range,  indicating
 vastly
 different
 interaction
 of  the  cobalt
 species
 with  the  oxidic  support.
 For
catalysts
 supported
 on  Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 no  significant
 H2 consumption
 was
 observed  up  to  840 C,
while
 ZrO2-supported
 CoOx was  already
 reduced
 at  T <500 C.  The  silica-supported
 catalysts
 showed
 a
broad
 reduction
 peak
 at  780 C  attributed
 to  well  dispersed
 CoOx embedded
 in  the
 SiO2 matrix
 forming
cobalt
 silicate,  consistent
 with  HR-TEM,
 XPS  and UVvis  analyses.
 Among
 all  catalysts,
 silica-supported
cobalt
 showed
 the
 best  catalytic
 performance
 under
 the  test  conditions
 used  (700 C with  CO2/C2H6 =  2.5).
Admixing
 Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 to SiO2 did not  result
 in  improved
 catalytic
 performance.
 Reducibility of
the
 CoOx species  as  well  as  the  strength
 and  surface
 density
 of  acidic  sites  were  identified
 as  crucial
 cat-
alyst
 properties
 for  optimal
 ethene
 yield.  Control
 of the  surface
 acidity  seems
 particularly
 important
 to
avoid
 undesired
 side  reactions
 (cracking,
 coking)
 impairing
 activity
 and selectivity.
 Parametric
 sensitivity
studies
 of the  silica  supported
 cobalt  catalyst,
 including
 reaction  temperature,
 CO2/C2H6 feed  ratio  and
space
 velocity,
 revealed
 the  important
 role  of  CO2.  In  the  absence
 of  CO2,  only  low  C2H6 conversion
 was
observed
 and  change
 of  the  oxidant
 to O2 resulted
 in  poorer
 catalytic  performance.

 Introduction
Increasing
 demand
 for
 ethene
 (C2H4)
 derivatives
 such
 as
polyethene,
 ethene
 oxide,
 ethylbenzene
 and
 many
 more
 has
 made
ethene
 one
 of
 the
 main
 chemical
 feedstocks
 in
 the
 chemical
 indus-
try
 [1,2].
 Conventionally,
 ethene
 is
 made
 by
 naphtha
 and
 ethane
(C2H6)
 cracking,
 both
 energy
 intensive
 processes
 that
 promote
 high
rate
 of
 coke
 deposition,
 a
 continuous
 operation
 hurdle,
 apart
 from
high
 CO2 emission
 [3,4].
 Recently,
 ethane
 cracking
 has
 significantly
picked
 up
 the
 pace,
 due
 to
 current
 growth
 in
 discoveries
 of
 natu-
ral
 gas,
 especially
 shale
 gas
 in
 the
 US,
 making
 it
 a
 cheap
 feed
 for
ethene
 production
 [5].
 The
 aforementioned
 inherent
 problems
 of
these
 processes
 can
 be
 tackled
 by
 developing
 a
 relatively
 low
 tem-
perature
 catalytic
 process.

(ODHE)
 [6]
 takes
 place
 at
 lower
 temperatures
 where
 oxidants
 such
as
 oxygen
 [7],
 carbon
 dioxide
 [8]
 and
 nitrous
 oxide
 [9]
 are
 utilized.
However,
 O2 results
 in
 an
 exothermic
 reaction
 requiring
 efficient
heat
 removal
 and
 it
 also
 easily
 oxidizes
 ethane,
 whereas
 utilizing
N2O
 in
 large
 scale,
 is
 rather
 challenging
 due
 to
 its
 limited
 availabil-
ity.
 Therefore,
 CO2,
 a
 greenhouse
 gas,
 comes
 as
 an
 obvious
 choice
due
 to
 its
 high
 availability
 and
 relatively
 low
 cost
 [10].
Studies
 on
 ODHE
 employing
 CO2 have
 been
 reported
 over
Cr2O3-
 [11,12]
 and
 Ga2O3-based
 [1315]
 catalysts,
 where
 the
former
 showed
 superior
 activity.
 However,
 the
 use
 of
 Cr2O3 is
 prob-
lematic
 due
 to
 toxicity
 issues
 while
 Ga2O3 is
 relatively
 expensive
and
 shows
 severe
 sintering
 and
 coking.
 The
 latter
 metal
 oxide
 has
been
 reported
 to
 exhibit
 higher
 activity
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 the
 for-
mer
 [16].
 But
 when
 supported
 on
 generic
 supports
 (e.g.
 Al2O3,
 SiO2
etc)
 [8,17],
 the
 observed
 activity
 was
 reversed,
 i.e.
 the
 Cr-based
 cat-
alyst
 was
 superior.
 One
 of
 the
 issues
 that
 crippled
 the
 performance
of
 Ga3O3-based
 catalyst
 is
 high
 rate
 of
 coke
 deposition
 resulting
in
 gradual
 and
 early
 deactivation
 [17],
 requiring
 frequent
 regen-

eration
 [13].
 By
 tuning
 the
 acidity
 and
 basicity
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 to
some
 extent,
 the
 coke
 deposition
 has
 been
 minimized
 [15],
 how-
ever,
 the
 necessity
 of
 catalyst
 regeneration
 seemed
 to
 be
 inevitable.
The
 reported
 initial
 ethane
 conversion
 and
 ethene
 selectivity
 over
Ga2O3-based
 catalysts
 are
 in
 the
 range
 of
 2030%
 and
 8090%,
respectively,
 which
 gradually
 decrease,
 primarily
 ethane
 conver-
sion,
 with
 time
 [17,18].
 In
 contrast,
 relatively
 high
 and
 stable
 ethane
conversion
 of
 around
 50%
 and
 ethene
 selectivity
 of
 >90%
 were
obtained
 over
 SiO2-supported
 Cr2O3 compared
 to
 that
 of
 other
 sup-
ported
 catalysts
 (e.g.
 Al2O3,
 TiO2,
 and
 ZrO2)
 [8].
 The
 observed
 high
activity
 was
 attributed
 to
 the
 redox
 property
 and
 acidity/basicity
of
 the
 Cr2O3/SiO2.
 Some
 improvement
 on
 the
 Cr2O3/SiO2 activity
has
 been
 achieved
 by
 addition
 of
 acidic
 and
 basic
 oxide
 promoters
[19].
Cobalt
 oxide
 based
 catalysts
 are
 attractive
 for
 oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 ethane
 [2022],
 propane
 [23,24]
 and
 isobutene
 [25]
using
 O2 and
 also
 for
 dry
 reforming
 of
 methane
 [26,27].
 Li
 et
 al.
[28]
 used
 3%Co-MCM-41
 with
 CO2 as
 oxidant
 and
 reported
 ethane
conversion
 of
 about
 40%
 with
 a
 selectivity
 of
 99%.
 Zhang
 et
 al.
 [29]
found
 7%
 Co
 loading
 on
 BaCO3 to
 be
 optimal
 with
 a
 very
 stable
 (>5
 h)
ethane
 conversion
 of
 48%
 at
 a
 C2H4 selectivity
 of
 92%.
 The
 high
activity
 and
 the
 stable
 performance
 was
 attributed
 to
 the
 redox
property
 of
 CoOx as
 well
 as
 synergism
 between
 BaCO3 and
 BaCoO3.
The
 support
 characteristics
 have
 major
 influence
 on
 the
 perfor-
mance
 in
 ODHE,
 as
 has
 been
 shown
 for
 Cr2O3-
 [8]
 and
 Ga2O3-based
[17]
 catalysts.
 To
 our
 knowledge,
 there
 exists
 no
 systematic
 study
of
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 single
 and
 mixed
 oxide
 supported
cobalt
 catalysts
 on
 CO2-assisted
 ODHE.
 With
 this
 in
 mind,
 we  inves-
tigated
 the
 influence
 of
 single
 and
 mixed-oxide
 supports
 on
 the
performance
 of
 Co-based
 ODHE
 catalysts.
 A
 scalable
 single-step
flame
 spray
 pyrolysis
 (FSP)
 method
 was
 used
 for
 their
 preparation
[30].
 This
 synthesis
 technique
 is
 flexible,
 easily
 operable
 and
 offers
high
 possibility
 of
 metastable
 phase
 formation
 due
 to
 which
 rapid
growth
 in
 its
 utilization
 for
 catalyst
 synthesis
 is
 observed
 in
 recent
years
 [31].
In
 this
 comparative
 study
 we
 report
 the
 physicochemical
properties
 of
 flame-made
 single
 and
 mixed-oxide
 supported
 Co
 cat-
alysts
 and
 their
 performance
 in
 ODHE
 using
 CO2 as
 a
 mild
 oxidant.
The
 physicochemical
 properties
 of
 the
 catalysts
 were
 analyzed
 by
nitrogen
 adsorption,
 XRD,
 HR-TEM,
 EDXS,
 NH3-TPD,
 TPR,
 DRIFTS,
XPS
 and
 Raman-
 and
 UVvis
 spectroscopy
 and
 crucial
 properties
for
 optimal
 catalytic
 performance
 were
 identified.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
All
 catalysts
 were
 made
 by
 FSP
 [13].
 Briefly,
 precursor
 solutions
were
 prepared
 by
 mixing
 appropriate
 amounts
 of
 metal-precursors
in
 toluene
 (Sigma
 Aldrich),
 except
 for
 catalysts
 containing
 (a)
 Al2O3,
where
 diethylene
 glycol
 monobutyl
 ether
 (SigmaAldrich)
 and
acetic
 anhydride
 (Sigma-Aldrich)
 (vol.
 ratio
 of
 2:1)
 and
 (b)
 ZrO2,
where
 a
 mixture
 of
 toluene,
 2-ethylhexanoate
 (Sigma-Aldrich,
purity
 >99%)
 and
 acetonitrile
 (Sigma-Aldrich,
 purity
 >99.5%)
 at
vol.
 ratio
 of
 3:1:1
 were
 used.
 All
 the
 metal
 precursors,
 cobalt
(III)
 acetylacetonate
 (98%),
 hexamethyldisiloxane
 (98%),
 titanium
iso-propoxide
 (>97%
 purity)
 and
 aluminum
 tri-sec-butoxide
 (97%
purity)
 from
 Sigma-Aldrich
 and
 zirconium
 2-ethylhexanoate
 (6%
Zr)
 from
 Strem
 chemicals,
 were
 used
 as
 received.
 The
 total
 molar
concentration
 of
 metal
 (i.e.
 Co
 +
 metal
 in
 support(s))
 was
 set
 to
0.45
 M
 except
 for
 Zr-containing
 catalysts
 where
 the
 molarity
 was
set
 to
 0.31
 M
 due
 to
 solubility
 limitation.
 When
 preparing
 mixed-
oxide
 supports,
 both
 oxides
 were
 of
 equivalent
 weight
 (i.e.
 1:1
 ratio
of
 95.5
 wt%).
 The
 cobalt
 content
 was
 always
 4.5
 wt%.
 During
 FSP,
 the
precursor
 solution
 was
 pumped
 at
 5
 mL/min
 into
 the
 flame
 reac-
tor
 nozzle
 using
 a
 syringe
 pump
 (Lambda,
 VIT-FIT).
 The
 feed
 was
dispersed
 into
 fine
 droplets
 by
 co-flowed
 O2 of
 5
 L/min
 (>99.9%
 Pan-
Gas)
 and
 immediately
 ignited
 by
 a
 pilot
 flame
 fed
 by
 CH4/O2 of
1/2
 L/min
 (>99.9%
 PanGas).
 The
 pressure
 drop
 at
 the
 nozzle-tip
 was
maintained
 at
 2
 bar.
 Product
 powders
 were
 collected
 on
 glass
 fiber
filter
 (ALBET
 GF
 6,
 25.7
 cm
 in
 diameter)
 with
 the
 aid
 of
 a
 vacuum
pump
 (Busch,
 Seco
 SV
 1040C).
 All
 gas
 flow
 rates
 were
 regulated
 by
mass
 flow
 controllers
 (Bronkhorst).
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
X-ray
 diffractograms
 were
 recorded
 on
 a
 Bruker
 D8
 Advance
diffractometer
 (40
 kV,
 20
 mA,
 Cu
 K)
 over
 the
 2
 range
 of
 1070
with
 a
 step
 size
 of
 0.019and
 scan
 speed
 of
 0.1
 s/step.
 Nitrogen
adsorption-desorption
 isotherms
 were
 measured
 on
 a
 Micromerit-
ics
 Tristar
 instrument
 and
 the
 specific
 surface
 area
 (SSA)
 of
 both
fresh
 and
 spent
 catalyst
 powders
 was
 determined
 by
 applying
 the
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
 (BET)
 method
 at
 77
 K.
 All
 samples
 were
kept
 at
 150 C
 in
 N2-atmosphere
 for
 1
 h
 prior
 to
 measurements.
Micromeritics
 Autochem
 2920
 was
 used
 for
 H2-temperature
programmed
 
reduction
 
(H2-TPR)
 
and
 
NH3-temperature
 
pro-
grammed
 desorption
 (NH3-TPD).
 For
 all
 measurements,
 a
 sample
mass
 of
 ca.
 100
 mg,
 a
 temperature
 ramp
 rate
 of
 10 C/min
 and
 total
gas
 flow
 rate
 of
 20
 mL/min
 were
 applied.
 The
 NH3-TPD
 was
 per-
formed
 by
 heating
 the
 sample
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 400 C
 in
5%
 O2 in
 He
 and
 maintaining
 it
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 2
 h
 before
cooling
 down
 to
 50 C
 in
 helium.
 Then,
 the
 gas
 flow
 was
 switched
 to
10%
 NH3 in
 Ar,
 which
 was
 passed
 over
 the
 sample
 for
 90
 min.
 Tem-
perature
 was
 increased
 to
 100 C
 and
 the
 gas
 flow
 switched
 back
 to
helium
 to
 remove
 physisorbed
 NH3 from
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 sample.
Finally,
 the
 temperature
 was
 ramped
 to
 840 C
 and
 the
 desorbed
NH3 was
 monitored
 by
 a
 mass
 spectrometer
 (m/z
 =
 15).
 For
 H2-TPR
measurements,
 the
 samples
 were
 heated
 from
 room
 temperature
to
 200 C
 in
 helium
 and
 held
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 2
 h
 before
cooling
 down
 to
 50 C.
 Then
 the
 gas
 flow
 was
 switched
 to
 5%H2/Ar
before
 ramping
 to
 840 C.
 The
 H2-consumption
 was
 monitored
 by
a
 mass
 spectrometer
 (m/z
 =
 2).
Diffuse
 reflectance
 infrared
 Fourier
 transform
 spectroscopy
(DRIFTS)
 of
 all
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
 performed
 on
 a
 Vertex
 70
 v
 spec-
trometer
 (Bruker
 Optics).
 The
 powder
 samples
 were
 placed
 in
 an
in-situ
 DRIFTS
 cell
 that
 was
 heated
 to
 400 C
 in
 5%O2 in
 He
 at
20
 mL/min
 and
 held
 at
 this
 temperature
 for
 30
 min.
 After
 cooling
down
 to
 40 C
 in
 helium
 at
 20
 mL/min,
 background
 (sample
 +
 KBr)
was
 taken
 and
 then
 the
 gas
 was
 switched
 to
 10%
 NH3/Ar,
 which
 was
passed
 over
 the
 sample
 for
 15
 min.
 Afterward
 the
 weakly
 adsorbed
NH3 was
 flushed
 by
 helium
 for
 15
 min
 before
 measuring
 the
 spec-
tra.
UVvis
 diffuse
 reflectance
 spectra
 (Cary
 500
 UVvis-NIR
 Spec-
trophotometer)
 were
 recorded
 from
 300
 to
 800
 nm
 for
 the
 fresh
supported
 Co-catalysts
 and
 bare
 single
 metal
 oxides.
 The
 samples
were
 diluted
 with
 BaSO4 keeping
 constant
 the
 mass
 ratio
 of
 the
sample
 and
 BaSO4 and
 spectra
 were
 measured
 against
 a
 BaSO4
background.
 Raman
 (Renishaw
 InVia
 Raman
 microscope)
 spectra
of
 both
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts
 were
 obtained
 using
 a
 785
 nm
laser
 with
 5%
 of
 the
 laser
 power
 (500
 mW)
 and
 an
 exposure
 time
 of
10
 s.
 Accumulation
 of
 spectra
 was
 set
 to
 20
 for
 better
 resolution.
XPS
 measurements
 were
 performed
 using
 a
 VG
 ESCALAB
 220iXL
spectrometer
 (Thermo
 Fisher
 Scientific)
 with
 monochromatic
 Al
 K
source
 (spot
 size:
 500
 m,
 power:
 150
 W).
 The
 powder
 samples
were
 placed
 on
 an
 adhesive
 copper
 tape
 which
 was
 mounted
 on
 a
stainless
 steel
 holder
 that
 was
 later
 transferred
 to
 the
 instrument
chamber
 and
 kept
 under
 vacuum.
 In
 built
 electron
 and
 ion
 neu-
tralizers
 were
 used
 to
 compensate
 the
 charge
 generated
 from
 the
samples.
 The
 spectra
 were
 recorded
 in
 constant
 analyzer
 energy
 of
30
 eV.
 The
 XPS
 system
 was
 calibrated
 using
 the
 Ag
 3d5/2,
 the
 Cu
2p3/2 and
 the
 Au
 4f7/2 peaks.

 (Gemini

 in
 the

 was
 quantified
 using
 a

 (TGA/SDTA851e,

 A

 as
 reactant

 was
 passed
over
 the

 to

 Approximately
20
 mg of
 each

 was
 taken
 for
 the

2.3.
 Catalyst
 testing
The
 catalysts
 were
 tested
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 in
 a
 tubu-
lar
 continuous
 flow
 reactor
 with
 4
 mm
 inner
 diameter
 that
 was
contracted
 to
 2
 mm
 after
 the
 catalyst
 bed.
 Prior
 to
 use,
 the
catalyst
 powders
 were
 pelletized,
 crushed
 and
 sieved,
 afford-
ing
 a

 Mixtures
 of
 150
 mg
 of

(80140

 50
 mg  SiC
 (160190

 were
 used
 to
 establish
 a
catalyst
 bed,
 which
 was
 fixed
 at
 the
 center
 using
 quartz
 wool
 [32].
The
 tubular
 reactor
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 temperature-controlled
 electri-
cally
 heated
 furnace
 which
 was
 ramped
 (10 C/min)
 to
 the

 Crystallinity,
 surface
 area
 and
 morphology
The
 flame-made
 catalytic
 powders
 were
 nonporous
 as
 evi-
denced
 by
 their
 nitrogen
 adsorption-desorption
 isotherms
 (Fig.
S1)
 [13]. Particle
 formation
 in
 flame
 depends
 on
 the
 volatility
 of
the
 materials
 i.e.
 material
 with
 high
 melting
 temperature
 con-
denses
 first
 [31,33].
 Therefore
 since
 the
 cobalt
 oxide
 is
 more
 volatile
than
 other
 metal
 oxides,
 cobalt
 constituents
 must
 be
 preferentially
located
 at
 the
 outer
 surface
 of
 the
 catalysts.
 This
 postulate
 is
 also
supported
 by
 the
 XPS
 analysis,
 which
 will
 be
 discussed
 later.

 the
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 fresh
 powders
 containing
 4.5
 wt%
 Co
supported
 on
 SiO2,
 Al2O3,
 TiO2,
 ZrO2 and
 corresponding
 mixed
oxide
 supports.
 The
 SiO2-
 and
 SiO2-Al2O3-supported
 catalysts
 were
XRD-amorphous
 while
 -Al2O3 patterns
 were
 observed
 with
 pure
Al2O3 support.
 As
 XRD
 reflections
 of
 -Al2O3 and
 CoAl2O4 are
similar,
 small
 amounts
 of
 CoAl2O4 could
 be
 present
 [34].
 In
 TiO2-
supported
 catalyst,
 both
 anatase
 and
 rutile
 TiO2 reflections
 were
observed
 with
 the
 latter
 being
 dominant,
 indicating
 that
 cobalt
 pro-
motes
 rutilization.
 This
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 substitution
 of
 Co3+
(0.55
 Å)
 into
 the
 Ti4+ (0.61
 Å)
 lattice,
 due
 to
 the
 difference
 in
 their
ionic
 radii
 [35]
 similar
 to
 Al3+ substitution
 of
 Ti4+ [36].
 The
 intensity
of
 anatase
 and
 rutile
 reflections
 is
 lower
 in
 the
 SiO2-TiO2-supported
catalyst
 than
 for
 the
 TiO2-supported
 catalyst,
 because
 SiO2 sup-
presses
 TiO2 crystallization
 and/or
 there
 is
 a
 significant
 amorphous
fraction.
 In
 the
 ZrO2-supported
 catalyst
 essentially
 all
 reflections
can
 be
 assigned
 to
 tetragonal
 zirconia
 (t-ZrO2).
 Slightly
 broader
reflections
 implying
 smaller
 crystallite
 size
 were
 observed
 in
 SiO2-
ZrO2-supported
 catalysts,
 a
 similar
 action
 to
 Si-doping
 of
 TiO2 and
SnO2 where
 amorphous
 interstitial
 Si
 leads
 to
 smaller
 crystals
 and
blocks
 crystal
 growth
 during
 their
 co-oxidation.
 In
 the
 TiO2-ZrO2-
supported
 catalyst,
 only
 reflections
 corresponding
 to
 the
 mixed
oxide
 phase,
 (ZrTiO4)
 srilankite
 [37],
 were
 observed.
 No
 reflections
belonging
 to
 the
 crystalline
 TiO2 and
 ZrO2 were
 observed
 but
 their
presence
 in
 amorphous
 form
 and/or
 as
 very
 small
 crystals
 cannot
be
 ruled
 out.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
