Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 over CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with Cr loading
between 0.720.4 wt% was discussed. It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the
dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the
yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested
catalysts was also discussed.
KEY WORDS: propane; dehydrogenation with CO2; supported chromium oxide catalysts.
1. Introduction
In the last decade several research groups found that
introduction of CO2 into the feed gas improved catalysts
performance in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
These results concern mainly the dehydrogenation of
ethane [15], propane [4,69], butanes [4,9,10] and eth-
ylbenzene [1115] in the presence of CO2. The generally
accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation
of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppres-
sion of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. How-
ever, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear.
It is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with
hydrogen to make the water gas (CO + H2O) or can act
as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation. It is
difficult to estimate which of the pathways predomi-
nates. The oxidative pathway has been proposed for
dehydrogenation
of
hydrocarbons
over
vanadium,
chromium, cerium and iron oxide catalysts, whereas
over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more
likely.
It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as
redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies
have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays
some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydro-
carbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the
yield of reaction product [16].
In the present work, we have studied the dehydro-
genation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2
over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on two
very different oxide supports (SiO2 and Al2O3).
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Two kinds of oxides were used as supports; c-Al2O3
(BET surface 155 m2/g, 507C Aldrich), SiO2 (BET sur-
face 304 m2/g, POCH Poland). Supported catalysts were
prepared by impregnation technique from an aqueous
solution of Cr(NO3)3 (POCH, Poland). The chromium
loading in the catalyst was regulated by varying the
concentration of chromium salt in the impregnation
solution. The solutions were mixed with the supports
(SiO2, Al2O3), followed by evaporation under constant
stirring and calcined at 923 K for 3 h in air. The nota-
tions such (0.7)CrOx/SiO2 or (0.7)CrOx/Al2O3 were
employed for the chromium oxide-based catalysts sup-
ported on SiO2 and Al2O3, respectively, with the value in
parenthesis indicating the Cr loading.
2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction-H2
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the
catalyst was performed by using a He + H2 (90/
10 vol%) gas mixture. The flow rate of the carrier gas
was 30 ml/min. 200 mg sample was used and heated
(10 K/min) to the final temperature of 873 K. The H2
consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity
detector.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the
presence or absence of CO2 was carried out at atmo-
spheric pressure in a flow-type stainless steel reactor,
packed with 0.5 g of the catalyst. The feed was a mixture

of 12.5 vol% of propane and 87.5 vol% of carbon
dioxide (or helium). The total flow rate was 30 ml/min.
The catalysts were first preheated in a helium stream at
873 K and then the reaction was started at 673873 K
temperature range. The reverse watergas shift reactions
were conducted under the same conditions, by replacing
propane with hydrogen. The reactants and products
were analysed online using two gas chromatographs.
One of them was equipped with a 3 m glass column
(3 mm i.d.), packed with Porapak Q and a flame ioni-
zation detector. This chromatograph was used to ana-
lyse hydrocarbons C1C3. The second chromatograph
was equipped with a 3 m stainless steel column of the
same diameter, packed with Carboxen 1000 and, a
thermal conductivity detector (for CO, H2 and CO2
analyses).
The conversion, yield and selectivity were calculated
by the following equation:
Conversion (%) = (ng / ff(npa+ng)) · 100
Yield (%) = (npe/(npa+ng)) · 100
Selectivity (%) = (npe/ng) · 100
where npe, npa are the number of moles of propene and
propane at the exit of the reactor, respectively, ng is the
number of moles of propane converted into the gaseous
products (propene, ethane, ethene and methane). The
calculations do not consider the conversion of propane
to coke, as its instantaneous formation is time depen-
dent and difficult to estimate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. TPR results
The TPR curves of the catalysts are given in figure 1.
Bulk Cr2O3 shows a peak around 543 K. The samples of
the
(3.4)CrOx/SiO2
and
(3.4)CrOx/Al2O3
catalysts
exhibit only one reduction maximum at about 680 and
590 K, respffectively. These results suggest that the
oxygen is more strongly bound in the supported chro-
mium catalysts than in bulk Cr2O3.
3.2. Effect of temperature and feed composition
The effect of temperature on propene yield and
selectivity is shown in figure 2. In all cases the yield of
propene increased with temperature, but the detailed
behavior varied with a type of support and the feed
composition.
Figure 2a shows the changes in the yield and selec-
tivity of propene as a function of temperature over the
(3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst. Both in the presence and
absence of carbon dioxide the yield of propene increased
with temperature, while the selectivity was high at low

temperature but it gradually decreased with increasing
temperature. Over the whole temperature range the yield
of propene was higher in the presence of CO2 then its
absence. On the other hand, over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3
catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the
yield and selectivity of propene (figure 2b). The intro-
duction of CO2 to the feed decreased the selectivity and
yield of propene.
The effect of feed composition on the dehydrogena-
tion activity of the (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 and (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3
catalysts is shown in figure 3. The promoting effect of
CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica sup-
ported catalyst. CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation
of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. More-
over, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly
decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide.
Figure 4 shows the influences of steam on yield and
selectivity
of
propene
over
(3.4)CrOx/SiO2
and
(3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The introduction steam to
the reaction zone strongly decreased dehydrogenation
activity of the tested catalysts.
The steam effect is irreversible in the case of
(3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas over the (3.4)CrOx/
Al2O3 catalyst it is reversible and similar to that of CO2.
It has to be pointed out that this effect is unfavorable,
however unavoidable in the reaction with CO2, because
the water is produced by the reactions (1) and (2).

The catalytic properties of the supported chromium
catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of
the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of
CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3
catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3 [17]. However,
Nakagawa et al. [16] suggested that in the dehydroge-
nation of ethane with CO2, the decrease of the ethene
yield over Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by modifica-
tion of acidity of the catalyst surface with water. This

effect could be also responsible for low activity of the
CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane
with CO2.
3.3. Effect of chromium content
Table 1 lists the propane conversion and hydrocar-
bons selectivity for the CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/SiO2
catalysts with chromium content 0.7, 3.4 and 13.7 wt%.
In addition to propene, the by-products attributed to
cracking, such as ethene, ethane and methane were fund
in the product flow.
The effect of the chromium loading level (0.7
20.1 wt% of Cr) on the poisoning/promoting effect of
CO2, measured as the ratio of yield in He to the yield in
CO2 (YHe/YCO2) is shown in figure 5.
Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chro-
mium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas
over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the load-
ing level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased.
4. Conclusion
The results obtained prove that the nature of support
strongly influences on the effect of CO2 in the dehy-
drogenation of propane. The promoting effect of CO2
on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 cata-
lyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide
did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2
and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation
with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3
catalyst.
