I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Portable spectrometers implications for court cases
As a defense lawyer in Toronto, I read with interest Portable Spectrometers Give On-Site Testing a Boost, by Carolyn Wilke (C&EN, April 17/24, 2023, page 28). These new, often handheld, devices may well be better than the more traditional color tests or wet-chemistry kits. But the article doesnt go into detail about the important distinction between these valuable law enforcement investigative tools and eventual proof in court to convince a judge for the criminal law requirement of beyond a reasonable doubt.
And it would appear that neither these new devices nor the color tests measure quantity, which may be important for eventual court determination of guilt and sentencing.
In Canadian law, there is another, more problematic concern, for which these new devices would not help. It is apparent government policy and practice to not reveal the science behind drug determinations. There is no proper scientific report. For years, qualitative disclosure has effectively been prevented with Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51. More recently, disclosure of the science behind quantitative measurements has simply been declined by Crown counsel.
This is a matter of both science policy and justice:
 Unexplained science is bad sciencefor that reason alone.
 Nondisclosure by the Canadian federal government strikes at the heart of the concepts of justice. This is perhaps especially important for police stings wherein the target may be an individual with addiction or other disadvantages trading in small quantities of drugin serious jeopardy for significant jail time.
Perhaps of greatest concern is that hardly any of the personnel of the Canadian legal system would seem to be concerned with these problems of science policy and justice. Or concerned that the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act s. 51 remains as law. And perhaps the coming availability of the new devices would falsely allay that there are serious problems of scientific and legal principle.

Industry membership
When I read in your editorial in the April 10 issue about the decline in American Chemical Society industry memberships (page 2), a possible explanation was given in the same place. As a businessperson, Rothrock doesnt get as much out of ACS meetings as she once did.
I work in industrial R&D and attended the ACS Spring meeting in Indianapolis. It is very obvious that these meetings are heavily focused on academics. Companies send representatives to many other more industry-focused conferences and trade shows and dont see the value of an academia-heavy additional conference. But in industrial conferences, companies dont share details of the chemistry they are doing with othersobviously. And this is exactly the advantage of ACS meetings: most chemistry is openly shared and discussed. I saw this as a great opportunity to get ideas and inspiration for my work projects in industry, even though we are actually working on entirely different things than what was shown at the ACS meeting. However, you know what you work on and check out related chemistry shown in talks and posters. Students and professors happily discuss their work with you. And the combined costs of ACS membership and conference registration are far less than the fees typically paid at many industrial conferences.
It may depend on what you do in industry. But companies should realize that attending ACS meetings and being a member can add a lot of value to them as well.

Slogan for ACS
After reading Donna Petersons letter in the May 1 issue of C&EN (page 3), I propose that all readers of this quality publication help further craft an American Chemical Society slogan that might catch public attention. My suggestions would be Chemistry for better living on a better planet! or Better living on a better planet through chemistry!

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
