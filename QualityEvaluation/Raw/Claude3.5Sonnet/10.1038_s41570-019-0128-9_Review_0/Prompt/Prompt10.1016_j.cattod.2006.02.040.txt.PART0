Abstract
Two kinds of Cr-based mesoporous materials, Cr incorporated and supported silicate MSU-1, were synthesized at room temperature and
characterized with XRD, N2 adsorptiondesorption, FT-IR, DR UVvis and H2-TPR techniques. Both Cr-based catalysts exhibited similar
mesoporous channels and textural properties. The catalytic performances of two catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
with CO2 were investigated. They both showed high activities, providing 58.0 and 68.1% ethane conversion and 53.4 and 55.6% ethylene yield at
700 8C, respectively. The catalysts were prone to deactivate in the reaction but could be partially regenerated by oxygen. Cr species formed in high
oxidation state were reduced during the reaction. It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts.

1. Introduction
The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), as one of the most
important green house gases, has been paid worldwide
attention. In the past decades, most efforts have concentrated
on the utilization of CO2 as a source of carbon. Just recently, it
is realized that CO2 might also be utilized as a nontraditional
oxygen source or oxidant [1,2]. CO2 has been found to enhance
the dehydrogenation of ethane [3,4] and propane [5,6]. The use
of CO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of lower alkanes into corresponding alkenes is becoming
important because of the growing requirement for alkenes. The
catalytic oxidehydrogenation of lower alkanes with CO2 can
overcome high energy consumption derived from the highly
endothermic thermal pyrolysis and avoid deep oxidation
occurred in those process using oxygen as oxidant. Chro-
mium-based catalysts were high active and selective since
silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides have been
industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as
ethylene, propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation
of the corresponding alkanes [2].
The promoting effect of CO2 in the ODH of ethane was first
reported by Wang et al. [7]. Nakagawa et al. [8] studied the
dehydrogenation of ethane by CO2 over several oxides and
reported that gallium oxide is an effective catalyst for this
reaction, resulting a ethylene yield of 18.6% with a selectivity
of 94.5% at 650 8C. Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of
support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic
ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported
Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a
61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield. The
distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium
species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts,
was influenced by the nature of supports. Xu et al. [10]
investigated catalytic performance of 5K0.5Ni9Mn7Cr/Si-2
catalyst in detail and 66.9% conversion to ethane and 85.3%
selectivity to ethylene were achieved at 800 8C. We have
prepared nano-sized composite catalyst Cr2O3/MgO, which
produced 61.54% conversion to ethane and 94.79% selectivity
to ethylene in the ODH of ethane with CO2 at 700 8C [11].

sizes as well as a high surface area, was discovered in the 1990s
[1214]. They could be used as a promising catalyst support [15
18]. In all kinds of mesostructure molecular sieves, MSU-x was
characterized by3Dworm-like holeswhichfavorthe diffusionof
molecular objects [19,20]. Polyethylene oxides, used as
templates in the synthesis of MSU-x, are characteristically
low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable. It is well known that the
dispersion, the oxidation state and the structural features of
supported species may strongly depend on the support. There-
fore, studies of chromium species introduced into MSU-x would
thus be useful in developing Cr-containing catalysts with
desirable catalytic activities for ethane dehydrogenation.
In this paper, we investigated the catalytic performance of
chromium-based mesoporous molecular sieves for this reac-
tion, including Cr incorporated MSU-1 (Cr-MSU-1) and Cr
supported MSU-1 (Cr/MSU-1). Sodium silicate, chromium
nitrate and fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (A(EO)9) were
used as the source of silicone, metal and mesostructure-
directing agent, respectively. MSU-1 and Cr-MSU-1 were
prepared at room temperature; Cr/MSU-1 was prepared by wet
impregnation method. The catalysts are characterized with
XRD, N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm, FT-IR, DR UVvis
and H2-TPR techniques. The reactivity and stability tests of the
catalysts were performed in a micro-reactor and the composi-
tion of the tail gas was analyzed by gas chromatograph on line.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Cr-MSU-1: The synthesis proceeded with molar composi-
tion SiO2:0.1A(EO)9:0.05Cr(NO3)39H2O:250H2O. In a typi-
cal synthesis, 2.26 g of A(EO)9 and 0.8 g of Cr(NO)39H2O
were dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water at 60 8C, cooled by
a mixture of water and ice. The resulting solution was then
mixed with another solution prepared by dissolving 9.40 g of
Na2SiO39H2O in 100 ml of deionized water under vigorous
stirring. The mixed solution was clear but a precipitate
appeared after 40 ml of 1 M HCl solution was added to the
mixed solution. The resulting gel was stirred at room
temperature moderately for 20 h. After separation by filtration,
the solid phase was washed with deionized water and air-dried
at 60 8C. The obtained samples were calcined under air with a
heating rate of 2 8C/min until 600 8C and held for 4 h.
Cr/MSU-1: MSU-1 was synthesized firstly by above method
without the addition of Cr(NO3)3 and then impregnated with
Cr(NO3)3 solution containing the desired amount of chromium.
The obtained sample was dried at 120 8C and calcined at 600
8C for 2 h. The content of Cr was calculated to be 5 wt% Cr2O3
in the final catalyst product.
All the catalyst samples were screened to particles of 2040
mesh before reaction.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
XRD measurements were performed on Xpert Pro MPD X-
ray diffractometer from PANalytical with Cu Ka radiation
(l = 0.154187 nm), Generator Settings 40 kV, 30 mA, scanning
speed at 0.0178 and scanning regions at 0.56.08. N2 adsorption
studies were used to examine the porous properties of each
sample. The measurements were carried out on Autosorb series
ASIMP apparatus from Quantachrome. Before measurements,
the samples were degassed at 200 8C under vacuum for 5 h.
Calculation of the specific surface area (BET), the pore volume
and the pore size distribution (BJH method) were performed
with the software of the apparatus.
FT-IR patterns of samples were obtained on SPECTRUM
GX II apparatus from Perkin-Elmer. Two milligram sample and
200 mg KBr were mixed and crushed to a wafer. Diffuse
reflectance UVvis spectroscopic measurements were recorded
on a UV2100 spectrometer. The spectra were collected at 200
700 nm referenced to BaSO4.
The actual Cr content in the catalyst was determined by
using OPTIMA 5300DV inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) manufactured by Perkin-
Elmer. The known weight of Cr-MSU-x sample was dissolved
in the mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO3)
with the volume proportion as 3:1. The solution obtained after
complete dissolution was diluted to required volume. The
samples were analyzed to determine Cr content by using most
sensitive wavelength of 267.716 nm.
H2-TPR of the catalysts was performed on CHEMBET3000
chemical adsorption apparatus from Quantachrome by using a
mixture of 5 vol% H2/Ar as reducing gas. A 50 mg sample was
heated from room temperature to 800 8C at a heating rate of
16 8C/min after pretreated at 300 8C for 1 h in He gas flow. The
reduction signal was recorded by a TCD.
2.3. Catalytic test
The catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of ethane with CO2 was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz
tubular reactor with inner diameter of 5.0 mm at 550700 8C
and atmospheric pressure. The gas reactant was constituted of
V(CO2)/V(C2H6) equal to 3 (molar ratio) and a total flow rate of
12 ml/min. Catalyst load is 0.2 g. The catalyst was pretreated in
CO2 gas flow during the calefactive process. The products were
analyzed on line by a gas chromatograph equipped with a
packed column Parapork QS and a thermal conductivity
detector (Shimadzu GC 14B). The investigations of stability
and regeneration were performed at 700 8C on the same
apparatus. The reaction was carried out for 3 h with analyzing
products every 20 min. Then reactant gases were switched to air
gas flow and the catalyst was regenerated in situ by air at
reaction temperature for 3 h. The reaction was again started by
replacing the air gas flow with a mixture of ethane and CO2 for
another 1 h after regeneration.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural and structural properties
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples prepared,
including MSU-1, Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1. Like other
L. Liu et al. / Catalysis Today 115 (2006) 235241
236
mesoporous MSU-x materials, they exhibited only one broad
XRD peak at low angle region corresponding to d1 0 0 reflection
[20]. The introduction of Cr atoms had no obvious influence to
the meso-structure of MSU-1. The peak intensity of Cr/MSU-1
was lower than those of MSU-1 and Cr-MSU-1. This may arise
from the decrease of long-range order of MSU-1 supported with
chromium oxides after the second calcination. The peak
intensity of MSU-1 was close to Cr-MSU-1 according to the
measurements.
The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms of Cr-MSU-1 and
Cr/MSU-1 were typical of well-defined structural porous
framework (Fig. 2), and belong to type IV isotherm indicative
of the presence of uniform channels in the super-microporous
region as we believed [21]. Zhai et al. [22] prepared
mesoporous AlMSU-x molecular sieves in the presence of
nonionic TX-100 as template. But they considered that the N2
adsorption isotherm of some calcined samples, which were
similar to ours, exhibited type I corresponding to IUPACs
classification. It is the character of porous materials with type I
adsorption isotherm that the adsorption achieves saturation at
relatively lower pressure and only mono-layer molecular
adsorption takes place, which results from either the strong
interaction between adsorbent and material or the equal size of
adsorbent molecular and pore diameter. The adsorption
isotherms of samples we obtained showed an ascending trend
with the relative pressure (P/P0) and achieved saturation at
about P/P0 = 0.45. Besides, the pore diameter (23 nm) of
samples we prepared was larger than N2 molecular diameter
(0.38 nm). So multi-layer molecular adsorption and capillary
coacervation should take place, indicating type IV adsorption
isotherm. The pore size distribution curves, as presented by the
0.65 nm (Cr-MSU-1) and 0.72 nm (Cr/MSU-1) width at
half height, showed that both samples contained narrow pore
size distribution.
Table 1 summarizes some textural properties and structural
parameters of MSU-1, Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 samples from
XRD and N2 adsorptiondesorption measurements. Most
structural properties of Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 were close
to each other except d1 0 0 spacing (4.75 and 4.25 nm,
respectively) and wall thickness (2.05 and 1.61 nm, respec-
tively). This may be attributed to more Cr atoms incorporated
into the framework of Cr-MSU-1. The surface area of Cr/MSU-
1 (964.6 nm) was very close to that of its predecessor MSU-1
(963.6 nm). The introduction of Cr (by incorporation or
impregnation) did not destroy the meso-structure of MSU-1.
3.2. Characterization results of FT-IR and DR UVvis
FT-IR patterns of mesoporous Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1
samples (Fig. 3) showed a broad band in the hydroxyl region
between 3700 and 3000 cm1 with maximum in the range
34003450 cm1. This band can be assigned due to surface
silanols and adsorbed water molecules [23]. The band at
1630 cm1 can also be assigned to adsorption of physical
adsorbed water. Other bands between 1400 and 370 cm1 arise
from the framework vibration of molecular sieves, including nas

(SiOSi), ns (SiOSi) and d (SiOSi) at 1090, 810 and
460 cm1, respectively [24]. Interestingly, a weak adsorption
band at 900 cm1 appeared for Cr/MSU-1. It may be attributed
to the vibration of CrO4 [25,26]. This band was not observed in
the FT-IR spectra of Cr-MSU-1, but the presence of CrO4
tetrahedra was confirmed by the DR UVvis spectra of Cr-
MSU-1 (Fig. 4). UV bands at 260 and 370 nm and a shoulder
around 440 nm are usually assigned to O ! Cr(VI) charge
transfer absorption bands, indicating that most chromium is
Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination.
3.3. Catalytic performance
Based on the product distributions, which mainly consist of
ethylene, methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and based
on other proposed reaction pathways [9,29], we assumed that
the following reactions would mostly take place:
C2H6 ! C2H4  H2
(1)
CO2  H2 ! H2O  CO
(2)
CO2  C2H6 ! C2H4  H2O  CO
(3)
C2H6  H2 ! 2CH4
(4)
C2H6  CO2 ! CO  H2
(5)
The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of
ethane (1) and the oxidehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3),
which could also be seen as the summation of reactions (1) and
(2). The hydrocracking of ethane (4) and reforming reaction
between ethane and CO2 (5) were the main side reaction. The
catalytic performances of Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 varied
with reaction temperature are shown in Table 2. Conversions of
ethane and CO2 of two samples both increased with elevation of
reaction temperature. The dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2
exhibited high selectivity to ethylene over Cr-MSU-1 catalyst.
It had a bit decrease but still above 90% with elevation of
temperature. On the other hand, selectivity to methane
increased little by little with temperature, which indicates
the elevation of temperature favors hydrocracking of ethane (4).

a CO total amounts in the products.
b CO produced by ethane reforming.
Similar trends on the variation of conversion and selectivity can
be obtained over Cr/MSU-1 catalyst. But lower selectivity to
ethylene and higher selectivity to methane were detected.
Selectivity to ethylene was only 70.4% at 823 K over Cr/MSU-
1 while selectivity to carbon monoxide was 25.7%. It may
account for this phenomenon that the reforming reaction of
ethane and CO2 (5) prevails under such condition. However, the
production of CO was trivial at other conditions on both
catalysts. The CO/H2 molar ratio increased with temperature
because
the
distinct
increase
of
CO2
conversion
with
temperature caused a remarkable increase in the yield of CO.
The actual Cr loading in Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 was
determined as 0.86 and 1.20 wt%, respectively, by using ICP-
OES. The lower Cr content than that calculated in the synthesis
of Cr-MSU-1 is attributed to the high solubility of Cr cations in
strong acid solution, resulting in the leaching of Cr during
filtration. For Cr/MSU-1, the impregnated and dried sample has
been washed once to remove clusters of Cr species on the outer
surface and only keep them in the mesoporous channels of
MSU-1; this would lead to decrease of Cr loading in the final
catalyst. The TOF value was calculated based on the dispersion
of Cr on the catalyst surface. Owing to the low Cr loading, Cr
dispersions on both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 were hypothe-
sized to be 100% active [27]. The TOF values (Table 2) on Cr-
MSU-1 were larger than that on Cr/MSU-1 in the range of
measured temperatures except at 823 K, suggesting that active
Cr sites in Cr-MSU-1 was more effective to turn over ethane
molecules. It has been a general consensus that chromate and
less polychromate (Cr6+ and traces of Cr5+) are formed on the
surface of supported chromium catalysts at about 1 wt% Cr
oxide loading or less [28]. This point is also proved by above
FT-IR and DR UVvis results. In addition, the polychroma-
te:chromate ratio increases with Cr loading [29]. Thus we
supposed that monochromate (Cr6+) was the main surface
composition of Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 and some poly-
chromate (much more than that on Cr-MSU-1) are formed on
the surface of Cr/MSU-1. The higher Cr loading of Cr/MSU-1,
which results in the formation of polychromate and more
reactive sites provided on catalyst, could well explain that Cr/
MSU-1 catalyst exhibited higher activity than Cr-MSU-1 in this
reaction under the same conditions [27]. However, the
monochromate:polychromate ratios on the surface of catalysts
probably influence their selectivity to products. The poly-
chromate and possible small Cr2O3 particles formed on Cr/
MSU-1 favor some side reactions such as hydrocracking and
reforming [30]. Cherian et al. studied the activity of alumina
supported chromium oxide for the ODH of propane and found
that the activity and selectivity increased with Cr loading under
monolayer and decreased for higher loading [31].
3.4. The effect of Cr loading on Cr/MSU-1
It has been generally recognized that the surface chromium
species strongly depends on the surface density of chromium
oxide [27]. So the effect of Cr loading in Cr/MSU-1 on catalytic
performance at reaction temperature 700 8C was investigated.
It could be seen from Fig. 5A that 5 wt%Cr/MSU-1 gave the
highest activity at this condition. The change of catalytic
activity with the variance of Cr2O3 loading was related to not
only the amount of active sites provided by Cr species but also
chromium oxide species [27,28]. When Cr loading was 8 wt%,
the diffraction peaks of crystalline a-Cr2O3 appeared in the
XRD patterns (Fig. 5B). The color of catalysts changes from
yellow to green with the growing of Cr content is in accordance
with above phenomenon, indicating the formation of Cr(III) at
high loadings of Cr. It was similar to the discovery of Hakuli
that CrOx was inclined to form clusters rather than well-
dispersed phase with the increase of Cr content on CrOx/SiO2
[32]. Yim et al. confirmed that mono, di, tri and tetrachromate
species of Cr(VI) and crystalline a-Cr2O3 were gradually
formed on the surface of Al2O3 with increase in the Cr content
from 1 to 17 wt% [27]. The formation of crystalline a-Cr2O3
correlates well to our result.
3.5. Deactivation and regeneration
The catalytic performance over Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1
with reaction time and the regeneration by oxygen were
investigated, as shown in Fig. 6. Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-
1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the
reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a
visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some
degree. For example, conversion of ethane decreased from
primal 50.1 to 37.6% over Cr-MSU-1 and 65.0 to 49.2% over
Cr/MSU-1, respectively, after reacting for 3 h. However,

different Cr2O3 loading (a) 1 wt%, (b) 5 wt% and (c) 8 wt%.
selectivity to ethylene gave a slight increase with proceeding
reaction, especially over Cr/MSU-1 catalyst. Two kinds of
catalysts showed an insufficient but adequately detectable
recovery of the activity after treated with air at 700 8C. It is
noted that the activity of Cr-MSU-1 got more recovery from the
air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1. Conversion of ethane
over Cr-MSU-1 recovered from 37.6 to 45.9%, while that over
Cr/MSU-1 recovered from 49.2 to 56.3%. Takehiras investiga-
tion revealed that Cr-MCM-41 could be recovered almost
completely after reacting for 3 h and treated with O2 for 5 h
whereas Cr/SiO2 showed an insufficient recovery of the activity
after O2 treatment [2]. These results showed resemblance to
ours.
Fig. 7 showed the H2-TPR profiles of the two catalysts of
Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1, including before and after reaction
and after regeneration. Before the reaction, Cr-MSU-1 sample
was reduced from about 350 8C, only one reduction peak was
detected between 350 and 600 8C, which could be attributed
to the reduction of Cr(VI) or Cr(V) to Cr(III) [2]. Similarly,
only one peak was observed between 400 and 600 8C over Cr/
MSU-1, which can also be attributed to reduction of Cr(VI) to
Cr(III). This is confirmed from FT-IR and UVvis data
showing the presence of Cr(VI) in CrO4 in two fresh catalysts.
After reaction, the reduction peak became smaller, almost
disappearing, over both catalysts, suggesting that most Cr(VI)
species were reduced to Cr(III) in the reaction. After treated
by air at 700 8C for 3 h, Cr(III) species of two catalysts were
reoxidized to Cr(VI) (Fig. 7, curves c), the reduction peaks
appeared again. Some TPR data, including Tmax and H2
consumption (calculated by the peak area for comparative
study), are summarized in Table 3. The values in bracket were
achieved from Gaussian curve fit of each reduction peak. The
peak area in TPR profiles after regeneration were 91% to Cr-
MSU-1 and 78% to Cr/MSU-1 of those observed before
reaction, suggesting that reoxidation of Cr(III) formed on Cr/
MSU-1 was more difficult than that on Cr-MSU-1. It was
noteworthy that the Tmax of both samples moved to high-
temperature region after regeneration, compared with that
before reaction, although a movement to low-temperature
region was observed initially after reaction. This suggested

that the interaction between Cr species and MSU-1 changed
in the reaction and regeneration treatment. For fresh catalyst,
the Tmax of Cr/MSU-1 was lower than that of Cr-MSU-1.
Thus, a conclusion was probably made that the Cr(VI) species
which were prone to be reduced served as the more active
sites in catalyst. Combined with the foregoing supposition,
these more active Cr(VI) species are related to surface
polychromate
which
are
more
readily
reducible
than
monochromate [33]. Contrarily, the reduced polychromate
are hard to reoxidized to the original form. Therefore, the
above phenomenon that the activities of Cr-MSU-1 recover
well by the air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1 could be
explained as the incomplete reoxidation of Cr(VI) species
(polychromate) on Cr/MSU-1.
From XANES and EXAFS spectra, Takehira et al. [2]
concluded that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an
aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra in Cr-MCM-41
during the reaction of propane and CO2 and this as the main
reason led to the deactivation of Cr-MCM-41. In our
experiment, the reduction of Cr(VI) was also observed
during reaction. It may play an important role for the
deactivation of Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 catalysts. Taka-
haras investigation [34] showed the partially oxidized Cr2O3
supported on SiO2 catalyst was active for the dehydrogena-
tion of propane and the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be
maintained to be partially oxidized in the presence of CO2.
Thus, we believed that Cr(VI) was responsible for the initial
high activity of the catalysts, both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1,
for the oxidehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2.
We still investigated the influence of catalyst pretreatment
with different gas flow, CO2 and oxygen. The results
suggested that catalyst pretreated with oxygen for 30 min
before reaction gave higher conversion of ethane than
pretreated with CO2, for example, 60.0 and 55.9% over
Cr-MSU-1. The pretreatment with oxygen could make Cr
species in catalyst to be oxidized to higher oxidation state,
thus lead to higher activity. This confirmed the conclusion we
proposed from another aspect.
4. Conclusion
Mesoporous materials MSU-1 and Cr incorporated Cr-
MSU-1
were
successfully
synthesized
with
A(EO)9
as
template.
Chromium
supported
Cr/MSU-1
prepared
by
impregnation showed higher activity than Cr-MSU-1 for the
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with carbon
dioxide. Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial
high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the
reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst. Both catalysts
could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen.
