Dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene in the presence of CO2 was performed over binary
In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides prepared by alcoholic coprecipitation. Synergistic effect of different composi-
tion on the catalytic performance has been observed. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy revealed that the combination of the two components can result in significant
modification in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of the In2O3 phase, which in turn leads to a
higher reducibility of the InAlO composite. A correlation between the temperature-programmed
reduction data and the PDH activity for In2O3Al2O3 revealed that the creation of surface metallic indium
species during the reaction is crucial for the dehydrogenation performance. The promoting effect of CO2
on the yield of propylene has been attributed to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling
with the reverse water gas shift reaction based on the results from temperature-programmed reaction of
CO2 with H2.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane,
into the corresponding alkenes has attracted significant attention
since the alkenes constitute an important and versatile class of
intermediates in the chemical industry [1,2]. At present, propylene
is typically obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane
(PDH) [3,4] and as a by-product of steam cracking or a fluidized
catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha. UOP and AAB Lummus Global,
two of the world leaders of catalytic dehydrogenation technology,
have licensed eight commercial process units [5], which currently
can provide propylene with an aggregate capacity of about 2.1 mil-
lion metric tons per year. Dehydrogenation of propane, however, is
an equilibrium-limited and endothermic reaction [6,7]. For ther-
modynamics reasons, significant yield of alkene requires operation
at relatively high temperatures and thus high-energy costs. More-
over, such process conditions favor undesired thermal cracking
reactions to lighter hydrocarbons and notoriously rapid catalyst
deactivation due to coke formation [8,9].
An alternative to this process is the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen [10,11], which has attracted
increasing attention due to its higher efficiency of using light alkane
resource with minimum energy consumption when compared to
the conventional direct dehydrogenation. The ODH gives the follow-
ing benefits: the reaction is irreversible and exothermic; process can
be carried out at lower temperatures without carbon deposition
deactivating the catalyst [1214]. However, using oxygen as an oxi-
dant brings several problems to the reaction [15], such as flammabil-
ity, necessity of heat removal and deep oxidation, which reduces the
process selectivity due to the production of undesired carbon oxides
[16] and is hard to control. Therefore, it is expected that replacing
oxygen in the ODH reactions by soft oxidants, such as N2O and CO2
[1720], will suppress these disadvantages.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the
use of CO2 as a milder and safer oxidant in the ODH of propane
[6,7,16,2026]. It is worth noting that the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane in the presence of CO2 can proceed by two different reaction
pathways. The first is a direct process, in which CO2 promotes the
dehydrogenation through re-oxidizing the catalyst surface as re-
duced by propane. This one-step pathway is in agreement with
the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [16,22,24]. The second one,
known as a two-step pathway, is a simple dehydrogenation fol-
lowed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [7,25,26].
In this case, CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction system and
releases the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium. Many re-
sults indicate that propylene is formed by both presented mecha-
nisms [20]. Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process, carbon
dioxide can act as a diluent [27], which delivers the required heat
and reduces coking of catalyst by coke gasification.
To date, the catalysts suggested for propane dehydrogenation
with CO2 are mainly based on supported (transition) metal oxides

that allow effective hydrocarbon activation at temperatures signif-
icantly lower than conventional dehydrogenation process. Among
all the studied catalysts, supported gallium oxides have recently
been recognized as one of the most promising materials due to
their excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional
Cr2O3- or Pt-based systems [7,2833]. One critical limitation asso-
ciated with the Ga2O3-catalyzed PDH process, however, is the dras-
tic deactivation during a few hours on stream [29,30]. Very
recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides
are highly active and stable catalysts for PDH in the presence of
CO2 [25,26]. The superior performance of the Ga2O3Al2O3 system
has been attributed to the formation of gallia-alumina solid solu-
tion between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 [26], which allows the favorable cre-
ation of a high abundance of coordinatively unsaturated surface
Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity. However, the development of
new improved catalytic system exhibiting desirable stability and
activity still remains a major challenge.
In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of
mixed oxides containing group III elements (Al, Ga and In) in
propane dehydrogenation [25,26], herein, we report for the first
time the use of InAl mixed oxide as a new efficient catalyst in
the dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene. In2O3
Al2O3 mixed oxides, previously established as an excellent sys-
tem for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx owing to its
unique low-temperature redox properties [3438], have shown
to be particularly efficient for PDH in the presence of CO2. Our
results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the
catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface
concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation
of propane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of mixed In2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts with various com-
positions as well as the simple oxide of Al2O3 and In2O3 were pre-
pared through a previously developed alcoholic coprecipitation
pathway [39]. In a typical synthesis, concentrated aqueous ammo-
nia and ethanol (50:50 in volume) was added dropwise to the eth-
anol solution of indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)35H2O, Aldrich,
99.99%) and aluminum nitrate hydrate (Al(NO3)39H2O, Fluka,
99.9%) with different In:Al molar ratio until no more precipitation
occurred (pH = 8.5). The resulting gel was quickly filtered and
washed by ethanol, dried at 373 K overnight, and finally calcined
at 873 K for 6 h. The final catalyst is denoted as InAl-n hereinafter
where n represents the mole percentage of In2O3.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET-specific surface areas of the samples were determined
by adsorptiondesorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen tempera-
ture, using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 equipment. The X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was carried out on a Bru-
ker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka
radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The acidic and basic properties of
each catalyst were characterized by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, respectively [26]. In a typical
experiment for TPD studies, about 200 mg of the oven-dried sam-
ple (dried at 383 K overnight) was placed in a U-shaped quartz
sample tube. NH3 (or CO2) was saturated at 413 K after pre-treat-
ment at 773 K in a He stream. The NH3 (or CO2) desorbed was
determined by gas chromatography at temperatures from 413 to
873 K at a ramp rate of 10 K min1 and subsequently maintained
at 873 for 20 min.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on
a Perkin Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system with Mg Ka excitation line
(hm = 1253.6 eV). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the
C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV with an uncertainty of
0.2 eV. Elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plas-
ma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy on a Thermo Electron IRIS
Intrepid II XSP spectrometer. Temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) results were obtained on a homemade apparatus loaded with
20 mg of catalyst. The samples were pretreated in flowing nitrogen
at 773 K for 1 h. After cooled to room temperature, the samples
were subsequently contacted with an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar
ratio of 5/95 and a total flow of 40 mL min1) and heated at a rate
of 5 K min1, to a final temperature of 1073 K. The H2 consumption
was monitored by an on-line thermal conductivity detector. Since
water is produced during reduction, the gas exiting from the reac-
tor was passed through a cold trap before entering the thermal
conductivity detector.
2.3. Activity measurement
Catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow microreactor
at atmospheric pressure, and the catalyst amount was 200 mg.
Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL min1.
The catalysts were pretreated at 873 K for 1 h in nitrogen flow, and
the reaction temperature was 873 K. During reaction, the gas reac-
tant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 530 vol% CO2, and a balance of
nitrogen. The feed and the reaction products were analyzed using
an on-line gas chromatograph (Type GC-122, Shanghai) equipped
with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a flame ionization
detector (FID). The permanent gas products, including N2, CO,
and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped with a
TDX-01 column and a TCD detector. All carbon balances closed
within 9295%. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as
follows:
C3H8 conversion  C3H8in  C3H8out
C3H8in
 100%
C3H6 selectivity 
C3H6out
C3H8in  C3H8out
 100%
2.4. Temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2
A temperature-programmed CO2H2 test was carried out to
investigate the activity of the InAl mixed oxide catalysts for the
RWGS reaction. The measurements were performed in a flow mic-
roreactor system. Prior to the experiment, a sample (100 mg) was
outgassed in a flow of pure helium at 873 K for 30 min. Subse-
quently, the microreactor was cooled down to about 443 K. Reac-
tion was performed using CO2/H2/He gas mixture with the ratio
of 1:1:4 and total flow rate of 12 mL min1. The experiment was
carried out with a linear heating rate of 10 K min1 up to the final
temperature of 973 K. The reactants and all possible products of
reaction were continuously monitored by the QMS detector (Bal-
zers OmniStar). The signal of the helium line served as the internal
standard to compensate fluctuations of the operating pressure.
