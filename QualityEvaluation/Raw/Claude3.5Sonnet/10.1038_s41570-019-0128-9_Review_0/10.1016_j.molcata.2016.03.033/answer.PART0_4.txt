The given literature does not contain any information directly relevant to answering the question about how various support materials and reaction conditions influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature only provides the title and author information for a paper on CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts, but does not include the full text or results. Without access to the full paper, it is not possible to accurately answer the detailed questions about different support materials, reaction conditions, and their effects on catalyst performance.
