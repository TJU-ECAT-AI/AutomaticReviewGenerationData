Unfortunately, this question cannot be fully answered based on the limited information provided in the given literature. The document only contains the title and some basic publication details for a paper about CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over Cr/MCM-41 catalysts. It does not provide any specific information about the effects of different support materials, reaction conditions, or challenges in optimizing catalyst performance. To properly address this complex question would require access to the full text of the paper and likely additional sources.
