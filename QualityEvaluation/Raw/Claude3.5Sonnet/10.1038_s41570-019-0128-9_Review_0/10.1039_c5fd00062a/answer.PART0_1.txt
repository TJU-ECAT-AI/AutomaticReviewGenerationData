[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600°C for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[3] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[4] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of ZrO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts and the influence of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study focuses on ZrO2 as a support for Cr2O3 catalysts. No direct comparison with other supports is provided.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the partial pressure of reactants (including CO2) led to improved C3H6 selectivity while inhibiting C3H8 conversion. This suggests that CO2 partial pressure plays a role in controlling the reaction pathways.

3. Activity and selectivity: Higher C3H8 partial pressure resulted in lower C3H8 conversion but improved C3H6 selectivity. This indicates a trade-off between activity and selectivity that can be influenced by reaction conditions.

4. Stability: The Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed high stability in terms of C3H8 conversion over the course of the reaction.

5. Mechanistic pathways: CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction without significantly gasifying carbon deposits. It also participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity
- Minimizing further cracking of C3H6 to maintain selectivity
- Managing carbon deposition and catalyst stability
- Optimizing CO2 utilization for both equilibrium shift and coke removal

The study does not provide information on other support materials or a comprehensive comparison of their performance in this reaction.

该文献没有对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的不同载体材料进行全面比较。但是，它确实讨论了ZrO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂的一些方面以及反应条件的影响：

1. 载体材料：该研究主要关注ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的载体。没有提供与其他载体的直接比较。

2. CO2分压：增加反应物(包括CO2)的分压导致C3H6选择性提高，同时抑制C3H8转化率。这表明CO2分压在控制反应途径方面起作用。

3. 活性和选择性：较高的C3H8分压导致较低的C3H8转化率，但提高了C3H6选择性。这表明活性和选择性之间存在权衡，可以通过反应条件来影响。

4. 稳定性：Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂在整个反应过程中表现出C3H8转化率的高度稳定性。

5. 机理途径：CO2作为温和的氧化剂，在不显著气化碳沉积的情况下移动脱氢反应的平衡。它还参与逆水气变换反应。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性
- 最小化C3H6的进一步裂解以保持选择性
- 管理碳沉积和催化剂稳定性
- 优化CO2利用，既用于平衡移动又用于焦炭去除

该研究没有提供其他载体材料的信息，也没有对它们在这个反应中的性能进行全面比较。
