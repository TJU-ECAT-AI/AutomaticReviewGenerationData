[1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "It was shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about various support materials beyond ZrO2 for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. ZrO2 was used as a support material for the Cr2O3 catalyst in this study.

2. Increasing C3H8 partial pressure improved C3H6 selectivity but inhibited C3H8 conversion.

3. The trade-off between selectivity and conversion was attributed to competitive adsorption between C3H6 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface.

4. Higher C3H8 partial pressure inhibited further cracking of C3H6, which is beneficial for selectivity.

5. The study did not directly compare different support materials or extensively explore other reaction conditions beyond C3H8 partial pressure and gas hourly space velocity.

Key challenges appear to be optimizing the balance between conversion and selectivity, and minimizing further cracking of the desired C3H6 product. The study suggests that manipulating reactant partial pressures may be one approach to addressing these challenges, but more comprehensive research would be needed to fully answer the question about various support materials and reaction conditions.

这篇文献并未提供关于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的各种载体材料(除ZrO2外)的全面信息。但是可以提取一些关键点：

1. 在这项研究中，ZrO2被用作Cr2O3催化剂的载体材料。

2. 增加C3H8分压提高了C3H6的选择性，但抑制了C3H8的转化率。

3. 选择性和转化率之间的权衡被归因于C3H6和C3H8在催化剂表面的竞争吸附。

4. 较高的C3H8分压抑制了C3H6的进一步裂解，这有利于选择性。

5. 该研究没有直接比较不同的载体材料，也没有广泛探索C3H8分压和气体小时空速之外的其他反应条件。

主要挑战似乎是优化转化率和选择性之间的平衡，并最大限度地减少所需C3H6产物的进一步裂解。该研究表明，操纵反应物分压可能是解决这些挑战的一种方法，但需要更全面的研究才能完全回答有关各种载体材料和反应条件的问题。
