[1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "It was shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about various support materials beyond ZrO2 for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. ZrO2 was used as a support material for the Cr2O3 catalyst in this study.

2. Increasing C3H8 partial pressure improved C3H6 selectivity but inhibited C3H8 conversion.

3. The trade-off between selectivity and conversion was attributed to competitive adsorption between C3H6 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface.

4. Higher C3H8 partial pressure inhibited further cracking of C3H6, which is beneficial for selectivity.

5. The study did not directly compare different support materials or extensively explore other reaction conditions beyond C3H8 partial pressure and gas hourly space velocity.

Key challenges appear to be optimizing the balance between conversion and selectivity, and minimizing further cracking of the desired C3H6 product. The study suggests that manipulating reactant partial pressures may be one approach to addressing these challenges, but more comprehensive research would be needed to fully answer the question about various support materials and reaction conditions.

这篇文献并未提供关于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的各种载体材料(除ZrO2外)的全面信息。但是可以提取一些关键点：

1. 在这项研究中，ZrO2被用作Cr2O3催化剂的载体材料。

2. 增加C3H8分压提高了C3H6的选择性，但抑制了C3H8的转化率。

3. 选择性和转化率之间的权衡被归因于C3H6和C3H8在催化剂表面的竞争吸附。

4. 较高的C3H8分压抑制了C3H6的进一步裂解，这有利于选择性。

5. 该研究没有直接比较不同的载体材料，也没有广泛探索C3H8分压和气体小时空速之外的其他反应条件。

主要挑战似乎是优化转化率和选择性之间的平衡，并最大限度地减少所需C3H6产物的进一步裂解。该研究表明，操纵反应物分压可能是解决这些挑战的一种方法，但需要更全面的研究才能完全回答有关各种载体材料和反应条件的问题。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600°C for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[3] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[4] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of ZrO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts and the influence of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study focuses on ZrO2 as a support for Cr2O3 catalysts. No direct comparison with other supports is provided.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the partial pressure of reactants (including CO2) led to improved C3H6 selectivity while inhibiting C3H8 conversion. This suggests that CO2 partial pressure plays a role in controlling the reaction pathways.

3. Activity and selectivity: Higher C3H8 partial pressure resulted in lower C3H8 conversion but improved C3H6 selectivity. This indicates a trade-off between activity and selectivity that can be influenced by reaction conditions.

4. Stability: The Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed high stability in terms of C3H8 conversion over the course of the reaction.

5. Mechanistic pathways: CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction without significantly gasifying carbon deposits. It also participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity
- Minimizing further cracking of C3H6 to maintain selectivity
- Managing carbon deposition and catalyst stability
- Optimizing CO2 utilization for both equilibrium shift and coke removal

The study does not provide information on other support materials or a comprehensive comparison of their performance in this reaction.

该文献没有对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的不同载体材料进行全面比较。但是，它确实讨论了ZrO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂的一些方面以及反应条件的影响：

1. 载体材料：该研究主要关注ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的载体。没有提供与其他载体的直接比较。

2. CO2分压：增加反应物(包括CO2)的分压导致C3H6选择性提高，同时抑制C3H8转化率。这表明CO2分压在控制反应途径方面起作用。

3. 活性和选择性：较高的C3H8分压导致较低的C3H8转化率，但提高了C3H6选择性。这表明活性和选择性之间存在权衡，可以通过反应条件来影响。

4. 稳定性：Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂在整个反应过程中表现出C3H8转化率的高度稳定性。

5. 机理途径：CO2作为温和的氧化剂，在不显著气化碳沉积的情况下移动脱氢反应的平衡。它还参与逆水气变换反应。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性
- 最小化C3H6的进一步裂解以保持选择性
- 管理碳沉积和催化剂稳定性
- 优化CO2利用，既用于平衡移动又用于焦炭去除

该研究没有提供其他载体材料的信息，也没有对它们在这个反应中的性能进行全面比较。

4. Stability: The catalyst showed high stability in C3H8 conversion over the course of the reaction.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: There appears to be a trade-off between C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Increasing C3H8 partial pressure enhances selectivity but reduces conversion.

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500,It is for this reason that the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 should be operated with very low partial pressure of C3H8 when designing experiments."

[4] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

1. Support material: The study uses ZrO2 as a support for the Cr2O3 catalyst. The specific properties of ZrO2 (90 m2/g surface area) are mentioned, suggesting its importance in catalyst performance.

2. Reaction conditions: 
   - CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the partial pressure of reactants (including CO2) improved C3H6 selectivity while inhibiting C3H8 conversion.
   - Temperature: The reactions were studied in the range of 300-500°C.
   - Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV): Higher GHSV decreased C3H8 conversion but did not improve C3H6 selectivity as effectively as increasing partial pressure.

3. Activity and selectivity: Increasing C3H8 partial pressure inhibited C3H8 conversion but improved C3H6 selectivity. This suggests a trade-off between activity and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic insights: The study indicates that competitive adsorption between C3H6 and other substances on the catalyst surface plays a role in inhibiting further cracking of C3H6.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: The main challenge appears to be balancing C3H8 conversion with C3H6 selectivity. Increasing reactant partial pressure improves selectivity but decreases conversion, while increasing GHSV decreases conversion without significantly improving selectivity.
