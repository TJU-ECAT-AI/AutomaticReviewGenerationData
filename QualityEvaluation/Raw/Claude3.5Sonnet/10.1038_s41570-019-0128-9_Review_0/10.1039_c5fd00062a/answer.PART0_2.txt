[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[3] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."

[4] "This phenomenon can be attributed to competitive adsorption on the catalyst between the generated C3H6 and inactivated C3H8, which inhibits any further cracking effect on C3H6 to produce by-products."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the influence of various support materials on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of ZrO2 as a support and the effects of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study focuses on ZrO2 as a support for Cr2O3 catalysts. No comparison with other support materials is provided.

2. Reaction conditions: Increasing C3H8 partial pressure was found to inhibit C3H8 conversion but enhance C3H6 selectivity. This is attributed to competitive adsorption between C3H6 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface, which inhibits further cracking of C3H6.

3. Mechanistic pathway: The reaction involves primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, while CO2 shifts the equilibrium by oxidizing H2 generated from C3H8 dehydrogenation via the reverse water gas shift reaction.

4. Stability: The catalyst showed high stability in C3H8 conversion over the course of the reaction.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: There appears to be a trade-off between C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Increasing C3H8 partial pressure enhances selectivity but reduces conversion.

The study does not provide information on other support materials or a comprehensive comparison of different reaction conditions. More research would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding various supports and their impacts on catalyst performance.

该文献并未提供关于各种载体材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂影响的全面信息。但是，它确实讨论了ZrO2作为载体的一些方面以及反应条件的影响：

1. 载体材料：该研究主要关注ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的载体。没有提供与其他载体材料的比较。

2. 反应条件：增加C3H8分压会抑制C3H8转化率，但提高C3H6选择性。这归因于C3H6和C3H8在催化剂表面的竞争吸附，从而抑制了C3H6的进一步裂解。

3. 机理途径：反应涉及C3H8在催化剂表面的初级活化，而CO2通过逆水煤气反应氧化C3H8脱氢产生的H2来移动平衡。

4. 稳定性：催化剂在反应过程中表现出C3H8转化率的高稳定性。

5. 挑战和权衡：C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性之间似乎存在权衡。增加C3H8分压会提高选择性但降低转化率。

该研究没有提供其他载体材料的信息，也没有对不同反应条件进行全面比较。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答问题中关于各种载体及其对催化剂性能影响的范围。
