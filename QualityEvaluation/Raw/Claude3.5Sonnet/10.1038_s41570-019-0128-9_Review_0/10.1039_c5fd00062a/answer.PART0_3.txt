[1] "5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500,It is for this reason that the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 should be operated with very low partial pressure of C3H8 when designing experiments."

[4] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

The literature provides limited information on various support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of ZrO2 as a support and the influence of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study uses ZrO2 as a support for the Cr2O3 catalyst. The specific properties of ZrO2 (90 m2/g surface area) are mentioned, suggesting its importance in catalyst performance.

2. Reaction conditions: 
   - CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the partial pressure of reactants (including CO2) improved C3H6 selectivity while inhibiting C3H8 conversion.
   - Temperature: The reactions were studied in the range of 300-500°C.
   - Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV): Higher GHSV decreased C3H8 conversion but did not improve C3H6 selectivity as effectively as increasing partial pressure.

3. Activity and selectivity: Increasing C3H8 partial pressure inhibited C3H8 conversion but improved C3H6 selectivity. This suggests a trade-off between activity and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic insights: The study indicates that competitive adsorption between C3H6 and other substances on the catalyst surface plays a role in inhibiting further cracking of C3H6.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: The main challenge appears to be balancing C3H8 conversion with C3H6 selectivity. Increasing reactant partial pressure improves selectivity but decreases conversion, while increasing GHSV decreases conversion without significantly improving selectivity.

The study does not provide direct comparisons with other support materials or detailed mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding various support materials and their influence on catalyst performance.

该文献对于铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中使用的各种载体材料提供了有限的信息。然而，它确实讨论了ZrO2作为载体的一些方面以及反应条件的影响：

1. 载体材料：研究使用ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的载体。提到了ZrO2的特定性质（90 m2/g比表面积），表明其对催化剂性能的重要性。

2. 反应条件：
   - CO2分压：增加反应物（包括CO2）的分压提高了C3H6的选择性，同时抑制了C3H8的转化率。
   - 温度：研究了300-500°C范围内的反应。
   - 气体空速（GHSV）：更高的GHSV降低了C3H8的转化率，但在提高C3H6选择性方面不如增加分压效果显著。

3. 活性和选择性：增加C3H8分压抑制了C3H8的转化，但提高了C3H6的选择性。这表明活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

4. 机理洞察：研究表明，C3H6与其他物质在催化剂表面的竞争性吸附在抑制C3H6进一步裂解中起作用。

5. 挑战和权衡：主要挑战似乎是平衡C3H8的转化率和C3H6的选择性。增加反应物分压提高了选择性但降低了转化率，而增加GHSV降低了转化率但并未显著提高选择性。

该研究没有提供与其他载体材料的直接比较或详细的机理途径。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答问题中涉及的各种载体材料及其对催化剂性能影响的范围。
