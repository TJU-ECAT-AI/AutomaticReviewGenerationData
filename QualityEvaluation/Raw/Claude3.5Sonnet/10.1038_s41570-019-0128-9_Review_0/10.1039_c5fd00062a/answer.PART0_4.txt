[1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

[3] "As a comparison, the increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to the similar extent. However, the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited because only the contacting time of C3H8 on the catalyst surface was shortened from this micro perspective."

The literature provides limited information on different support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It mainly focuses on ZrO2 as a support material for Cr2O3. 

Regarding reaction conditions, the study shows that increasing C3H8 partial pressure enhances C3H6 selectivity but reduces C3H8 conversion. This is due to competitive adsorption between C3H6 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface, which inhibits further cracking of C3H6.

Increasing the overall Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) also decreases C3H8 conversion but does not limit further cracking of C3H6, as it only reduces the contact time of C3H8 on the catalyst surface.

The main challenge appears to be balancing C3H6 selectivity and C3H8 conversion. Increasing C3H8 partial pressure improves selectivity but reduces conversion, while increasing GHSV reduces conversion without improving selectivity.

The study does not provide comprehensive information on the influence of various support materials or detailed mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding different supports and their effects on catalyst performance.

该文献对于在CO2氧化脱氢反应中使用不同载体材料的铬氧化物催化剂提供的信息有限。它主要关注ZrO2作为Cr2O3的载体材料。

关于反应条件，研究表明增加C3H8分压可以提高C3H6选择性，但会降低C3H8转化率。这是由于C3H6和C3H8在催化剂表面的竞争吸附，从而抑制了C3H6的进一步裂解。

增加整体气体小时空速(GHSV)也会降低C3H8转化率，但不会限制C3H6的进一步裂解，因为它只是减少了C3H8在催化剂表面的接触时间。

主要挑战似乎是平衡C3H6选择性和C3H8转化率。增加C3H8分压可以提高选择性但会降低转化率，而增加GHSV会降低转化率但不会提高选择性。

这项研究没有提供关于各种载体材料影响或详细反应机理途径的全面信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答该问题中关于不同载体及其对催化剂性能影响的范围。
