[1] "To date, in the field of PDH by CO2, Cr2O3-, V2O5- and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."

[2] "For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14]."

[3] "The Ga2O3-based catalysts is proposed to obey a two-step pathway mechanism, which is a simple dehydrogenation step coupled with a subsequent reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [15,16]."

[4] "However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition."

[5] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."

[6] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about chromium oxide catalysts specifically for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on various support materials. However, it does offer some general insights on catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with CO2:

1. Cr2O3-based catalysts are among the most frequently reported for PDH with CO2, along with V2O5- and Ga2O3-based systems.

2. Cr2O3-based catalysts follow a one-step pathway consistent with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism.

3. Fast deactivation is a common challenge for these catalyst systems, caused by exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition.

4. The choice of support material plays an important role in influencing the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, which can further tune catalytic performance.

5. The acid-base properties of supports strongly affect selectivity to propylene.

The literature does not provide specific information on how different supports (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) or CO2 partial pressure affect chromium oxide catalysts' performance. It also doesn't discuss specific challenges or trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. More targeted research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

这篇文献并没有提供关于各种载体材料上的氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的综合信息。然而,它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)的催化剂的一般见解:

1. 基于Cr2O3的催化剂是使用CO2进行PDH最常报道的催化剂之一,与基于V2O5和Ga2O3的系统并列。

2. 基于Cr2O3的催化剂遵循与Mars-Van Krevelen机理一致的单步反应途径。

3. 快速失活是这些催化剂系统的一个常见挑战,原因是活性晶格氧原子耗尽或积碳。

4. 载体材料的选择在影响活性物种的分散和电子性质方面起着重要作用,这可以进一步调节催化性能。

5. 载体的酸碱性质强烈影响丙烯的选择性。

文献没有提供关于不同载体(SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2)或CO2分压如何影响氧化铬催化剂性能的具体信息。它也没有讨论优化CO2氧化脱氢反应整体性能的具体挑战或权衡。需要进行更有针对性的研究才能全面解答这些问题。
