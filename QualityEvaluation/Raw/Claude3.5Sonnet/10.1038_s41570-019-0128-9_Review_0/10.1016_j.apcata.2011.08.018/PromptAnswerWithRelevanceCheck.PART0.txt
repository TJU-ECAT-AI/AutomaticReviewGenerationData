[1] "To date, in the field of PDH by CO2, Cr2O3-, V2O5- and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."

[2] "For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14]."

[3] "The Ga2O3-based catalysts is proposed to obey a two-step pathway mechanism, which is a simple dehydrogenation step coupled with a subsequent reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [15,16]."

[4] "However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition."

[5] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."

[6] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about chromium oxide catalysts specifically for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on various support materials. However, it does offer some general insights on catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with CO2:

1. Cr2O3-based catalysts are among the most frequently reported for PDH with CO2, along with V2O5- and Ga2O3-based systems.

2. Cr2O3-based catalysts follow a one-step pathway consistent with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism.

3. Fast deactivation is a common challenge for these catalyst systems, caused by exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition.

4. The choice of support material plays an important role in influencing the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, which can further tune catalytic performance.

5. The acid-base properties of supports strongly affect selectivity to propylene.

The literature does not provide specific information on how different supports (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) or CO2 partial pressure affect chromium oxide catalysts' performance. It also doesn't discuss specific challenges or trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. More targeted research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

这篇文献并没有提供关于各种载体材料上的氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的综合信息。然而,它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)的催化剂的一般见解:

1. 基于Cr2O3的催化剂是使用CO2进行PDH最常报道的催化剂之一,与基于V2O5和Ga2O3的系统并列。

2. 基于Cr2O3的催化剂遵循与Mars-Van Krevelen机理一致的单步反应途径。

3. 快速失活是这些催化剂系统的一个常见挑战,原因是活性晶格氧原子耗尽或积碳。

4. 载体材料的选择在影响活性物种的分散和电子性质方面起着重要作用,这可以进一步调节催化性能。

5. 载体的酸碱性质强烈影响丙烯的选择性。

文献没有提供关于不同载体(SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2)或CO2分压如何影响氧化铬催化剂性能的具体信息。它也没有讨论优化CO2氧化脱氢反应整体性能的具体挑战或权衡。需要进行更有针对性的研究才能全面解答这些问题。

[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support effect has been investigated in detail by testing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2."

[2] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Instead, it focuses on indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts supported on various metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. 

However, some general principles regarding support effects can be inferred:

1. Support materials influence the dispersion of active species, which affects catalytic performance. Higher dispersion of In2O3 on supports led to better propylene production.

2. The acid-base properties of supports play a crucial role in determining selectivity to the desired product (propylene in this case).

3. Balancing acidic/basic properties of the catalyst system is important for achieving synergy between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.

4. The choice of support can tune the catalytic performance by affecting both the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species.

5. Different supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) were found to have varying effects on catalyst performance, with Al2O3 showing the best results for In2O3 catalysts.

While these findings are for In2O3 catalysts, similar principles may apply to chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, specific effects, challenges, and trade-offs for chromium oxide catalysts would require further research focused on that particular system.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注了负载在各种金属氧化物（Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2）上的氧化铟（In2O3）催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应。

然而，我们可以从中推断出一些关于载体效应的一般原则：

1. 载体材料影响活性物种的分散度，从而影响催化性能。In2O3在载体上的分散度越高，丙烯的产量就越好。

2. 载体的酸碱性质在决定目标产物（在这种情况下是丙烯）的选择性方面起着关键作用。

3. 平衡催化剂系统的酸碱性对于实现脱氢反应和逆水气变换反应之间的协同作用很重要。

4. 载体的选择可以通过影响活性物种的分散度和电子性质来调节催化性能。

5. 不同的载体（Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2）对催化剂性能的影响各不相同，其中Al2O3对In2O3催化剂表现出最好的效果。

虽然这些发现是针对In2O3催化剂的，但类似的原则可能也适用于铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，要确定铬氧化物催化剂的具体效果、挑战和权衡，还需要进行针对该特定系统的进一步研究。

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on indium oxide catalysts supported on various metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. 

Based on the information provided, some key insights that may be relevant to other catalyst systems including chromium oxide are:

1. Support material effects: The choice of support material significantly influences catalyst performance. A higher dispersion of the active species (In2O3 in this case) on the support is favorable for propylene production. The best performance was achieved with Al2O3 as the support.

2. Importance of balanced properties: High dispersion of the active species and balanced acidic/basic properties of the catalyst are essential for achieving high catalytic performance. This balance enables synergy between the dehydrogenation reaction and the reverse water gas shift reaction.

3. Role of CO2: CO2 serves multiple functions in the dehydrogenation reaction:
   - Acts as a milder oxidant compared to oxygen
   - Supplies heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction
   - Enhances equilibrium conversion by acting as a diluent
   - Helps remove coke formed on the catalyst

4. Challenges and trade-offs: While not explicitly stated for chromium oxide catalysts, the literature suggests that balancing various catalyst properties and reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing overall performance. This likely applies to other catalyst systems as well.

To fully answer the question about chromium oxide catalysts, additional research specific to those systems would be needed.
