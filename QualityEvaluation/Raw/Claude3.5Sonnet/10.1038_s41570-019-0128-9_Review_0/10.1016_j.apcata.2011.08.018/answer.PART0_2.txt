[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support effect has been investigated in detail by testing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2."

[2] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

[4] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."

[5] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts or CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on indium oxide catalysts supported on various metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. However, some general principles regarding support effects can be inferred:

1. Support materials influence catalyst activity and selectivity by affecting the dispersion of active species and modifying electronic properties.

2. The acid-base properties of supports play a crucial role in determining selectivity towards the desired product (in this case, propylene).

3. Higher dispersion of active species (In2O3 in this study) on the support leads to better catalytic performance.

4. Balanced acidic/basic properties of the catalyst system are important for achieving high catalytic performance.

5. The support can influence the synergy between different reaction pathways (dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift in this case).

6. Different supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) result in varying catalytic performances, with Al2O3 showing the best results in this study.

The study does not address the specific challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance for chromium oxide catalysts or the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂或CO2氧化脱氢反应。相反，它关注的是在CO2存在下,以各种金属氧化物(Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2)为载体的氧化铟催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。然而，可以推断出一些关于载体效应的一般原则：

1. 载体材料通过影响活性物种的分散和修改电子性质来影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 载体的酸碱性质在决定对目标产物(在本研究中为丙烯)的选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。

3. 活性物种(本研究中的In2O3)在载体上的高度分散导致更好的催化性能。

4. 催化剂系统的酸碱性能平衡对于实现高催化性能很重要。

5. 载体可以影响不同反应途径之间的协同作用(在本例中为脱氢和反向水煤气变换反应)。

6. 不同的载体(Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2)会导致不同的催化性能，在本研究中Al2O3显示出最佳结果。

该研究没有讨论优化铬氧化物催化剂整体性能的具体挑战和权衡，也没有讨论CO2分压对反应的影响。
