[1] "To date, in the field of PDH by CO2, Cr2O3-, V2O5- and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."

[2] "For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14]."

[3] "The Ga2O3-based catalysts is proposed to obey a two-step pathway mechanism, which is a simple dehydrogenation step coupled with a subsequent reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [15,16]."

[4] "However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition."

[5] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."

[6] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the influence of various support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts specifically for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some general insights on catalyst supports and dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Cr2O3-based catalysts are among the most frequently reported for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with CO2.

2. Cr2O3-based catalysts follow a one-step pathway mechanism consistent with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism.

3. The choice of support material plays an important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species, which can further tune the catalytic performance.

4. Acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene.

5. A common challenge for catalysts in this field is fast deactivation due to exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition.

The literature does not specifically address the influence of CO2 partial pressure or provide detailed information on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts on different supports like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2. To fully answer the question, more specific research on chromium oxide catalysts and their behavior on various supports under different reaction conditions would be needed.

该文献并未提供关于各种载体材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的影响的全面信息。但是，它确实提供了一些关于催化剂载体和脱氢反应的一般见解：

1. Cr2O3基催化剂是CO2存在下丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中最常报道的催化剂之一。

2. Cr2O3基催化剂遵循与Mars-Van Krevelen机理一致的单步反应路径机制。

3. 载体材料的选择对活性物种的分散和电子性质起着重要作用，这可以进一步调节催化性能。

4. 载体的酸碱性质强烈影响丙烯的选择性。

5. 该领域催化剂的一个共同挑战是由于活性晶格氧原子耗尽或积碳沉积导致的快速失活。

该文献并未具体讨论CO2分压的影响，也没有提供铬氧化物催化剂在不同载体（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）上性能的详细信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对铬氧化物催化剂及其在不同载体上在不同反应条件下的行为进行更具体的研究。
