[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support effect has been investigated in detail by testing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2."

[2] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."

[3] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

[4] "The choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."

[5] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. Instead, it focuses on indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts supported on various metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. 

However, some general principles regarding support effects can be inferred:

1. Support materials influence the dispersion of active species, which affects catalytic performance. Higher dispersion of In2O3 on supports led to better propylene production.

2. The acid-base properties of supports play a crucial role in determining selectivity to the desired product (propylene in this case).

3. Balancing acidic/basic properties of the catalyst system is important for achieving synergy between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.

4. The choice of support can tune the catalytic performance by affecting both the dispersion and electronic properties of the active species.

5. Different supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) were found to have varying effects on catalyst performance, with Al2O3 showing the best results for In2O3 catalysts.

While these findings are for In2O3 catalysts, similar principles may apply to chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, specific effects, challenges, and trade-offs for chromium oxide catalysts would require further research focused on that particular system.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注了负载在各种金属氧化物（Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2）上的氧化铟（In2O3）催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应。

然而，我们可以从中推断出一些关于载体效应的一般原则：

1. 载体材料影响活性物种的分散度，从而影响催化性能。In2O3在载体上的分散度越高，丙烯的产量就越好。

2. 载体的酸碱性质在决定目标产物（在这种情况下是丙烯）的选择性方面起着关键作用。

3. 平衡催化剂系统的酸碱性对于实现脱氢反应和逆水气变换反应之间的协同作用很重要。

4. 载体的选择可以通过影响活性物种的分散度和电子性质来调节催化性能。

5. 不同的载体（Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2）对催化剂性能的影响各不相同，其中Al2O3对In2O3催化剂表现出最好的效果。

虽然这些发现是针对In2O3催化剂的，但类似的原则可能也适用于铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，要确定铬氧化物催化剂的具体效果、挑战和权衡，还需要进行针对该特定系统的进一步研究。
