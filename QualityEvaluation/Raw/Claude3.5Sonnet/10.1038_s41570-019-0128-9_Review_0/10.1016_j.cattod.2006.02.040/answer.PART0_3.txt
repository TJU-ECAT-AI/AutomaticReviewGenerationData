[1] "Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield."

[2] "The distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts, was influenced by the nature of supports."

[3] "It has been generally recognized that the surface chromium species strongly depends on the surface density of chromium oxide [27]."

[4] "When Cr loading was 8 wt%, the diffraction peaks of crystalline α-Cr2O3 appeared in the XRD patterns (Fig. 5B). The color of catalysts changes from yellow to green with the growing of Cr content is in accordance with above phenomenon, indicating the formation of Cr(III) at high loadings of Cr."

[5] "Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some degree."

[6] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst. Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

The literature provides some insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2) affect the distribution of Cr2O3 and surface chromium species structure, which in turn influences catalyst activity. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed good performance, with 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield.

2. Chromium loading: The surface chromium species depend strongly on the surface density of chromium oxide. Higher Cr loading (8 wt%) led to the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, indicating a change in the oxidation state from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) at higher loadings.

3. Stability and deactivation: Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 catalysts showed higher initial activities but experienced deactivation over time. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction was identified as a main cause of deactivation.

4. Regeneration: Partial regeneration of the catalysts was possible through oxygen treatment, suggesting that maintaining the Cr(VI) oxidation state is crucial for catalyst performance.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing Cr loading to maximize active sites while preventing the formation of less active crystalline Cr2O3.
2. Maintaining the Cr(VI) oxidation state during the reaction to prevent deactivation.
3. Developing effective regeneration strategies to restore catalyst activity.
4. Optimizing support materials to enhance Cr2O3 distribution and stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways. Further research would be needed to address these aspects and fully optimize the catalysts' performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献为我们提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

1. 支撑材料：不同的支撑材料（Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2、ZrO2）影响Cr2O3的分布和表面铬物种结构，进而影响催化剂活性。SiO2负载的Cr2O3表现良好，乙烷转化率为61%，乙烯收率为55.5%。

2. 铬负载量：表面铬物种强烈依赖于氧化铬的表面密度。较高的Cr负载量（8 wt%）导致结晶α-Cr2O3的形成，表明在较高负载量下氧化态从Cr(VI)变为Cr(III)。

3. 稳定性和失活：Cr-MSU-1和Cr/MSU-1催化剂都显示出较高的初始活性，但随时间推移而失活。反应过程中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)被认为是失活的主要原因。

4. 再生：通过氧气处理可以部分再生催化剂，表明维持Cr(VI)氧化态对催化剂性能至关重要。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡Cr负载量，以最大化活性位点，同时防止形成活性较低的结晶Cr2O3。
2. 在反应过程中维持Cr(VI)氧化态，防止失活。
3. 开发有效的再生策略以恢复催化剂活性。
4. 优化支撑材料以增强Cr2O3分布和稳定性。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或详细反应机理途径的具体信息。需要进一步研究以解决这些方面，并全面优化催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。
