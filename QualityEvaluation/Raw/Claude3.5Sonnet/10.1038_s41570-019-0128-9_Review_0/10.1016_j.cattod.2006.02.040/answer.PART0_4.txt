[1] "Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield."

[2] "The distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts, was influenced by the nature of supports."

[3] "It is well known that the dispersion, the oxidation state and the structural features of supported species may strongly depend on the support."

[4] "Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction. It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts."

[5] "Two kinds of catalysts showed an insufficient but adequately detectable recovery of the activity after treated with air at 700 8C. It is noted that the activity of Cr-MSU-1 got more recovery from the air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2) affect the distribution and surface structure of Cr2O3, which in turn determines catalyst activity. SiO2 support showed good performance, with 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 achieving 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield.

2. The support influences the dispersion, oxidation state, and structural features of the supported chromium species. This impacts the catalytic properties.

3. High-valent Cr species are responsible for high catalytic activity. These get reduced during the reaction, leading to deactivation. 

4. Catalyst regeneration is possible by air treatment, but the extent of recovery depends on the support. Cr-MSU-1 showed better recovery compared to Cr/MSU-1.

Key challenges include:
- Optimizing Cr dispersion and oxidation state on different supports
- Maintaining high-valent Cr species during reaction to prevent deactivation
- Improving regeneration efficiency, which varies with support material
- Balancing activity and selectivity, as more active catalysts may promote side reactions

Trade-offs exist between activity, selectivity, and stability. Highly dispersed Cr species on certain supports may offer high initial activity but poor stability. Optimizing overall performance requires careful tuning of support properties, Cr loading, and reaction conditions.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effects of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways for different supports. Further research in these areas could provide valuable insights for catalyst optimization.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 不同的载体（Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2、ZrO2）影响Cr2O3的分布和表面结构，从而决定催化剂活性。SiO2载体表现出良好的性能，8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2实现了61%的乙烷转化率和55.5%的乙烯产率。

2. 载体影响负载的铬物种的分散度、氧化态和结构特征。这影响了催化性能。

3. 高价铬物种负责高催化活性。这些物种在反应过程中被还原，导致失活。

4. 通过空气处理可以实现催化剂再生，但恢复程度取决于载体。Cr-MSU-1相比Cr/MSU-1表现出更好的恢复能力。

主要挑战包括：
- 优化不同载体上的铬分散度和氧化态
- 在反应过程中维持高价铬物种以防止失活
- 提高再生效率，这因载体材料而异
- 平衡活性和选择性，因为活性更高的催化剂可能促进副反应

活性、选择性和稳定性之间存在权衡。某些载体上高度分散的铬物种可能提供高初始活性但稳定性差。优化整体性能需要仔细调整载体性质、铬负载量和反应条件。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或不同载体详细机理途径的具体信息。在这些领域进行进一步研究可能为催化剂优化提供宝贵见解。
