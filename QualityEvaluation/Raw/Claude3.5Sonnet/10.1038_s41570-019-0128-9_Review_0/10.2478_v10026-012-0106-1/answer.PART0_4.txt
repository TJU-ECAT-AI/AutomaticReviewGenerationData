[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "Such great differences in the effects of CO2 are probably caused by the difference in supports nature."

[5] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: Cr-O/SiO2 shows a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, while Cr-O/Al2O3 experiences a dramatic decrease in propene yield with even small amounts of CO2 in the feed. 

2. Stability: The document does not provide specific information about catalyst stability for different supports.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The nature of the support affects CO2 adsorption. On Al2O3, CO2 adsorption reduces propane adsorption, leading to decreased propane conversion. SiO2 shows weaker CO2 adsorption, allowing for better catalyst performance.

4. Reaction conditions: Increasing temperature leads to higher propane conversion and propene yield, but lower propene selectivity. CO2 partial pressure affects the CO/H2 ratio in the product.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity with temperature.
2. Choosing the appropriate support material to promote desired reactions while minimizing inhibitory effects of CO2.
3. Optimizing CO2 concentration in the feed to achieve the desired CO/H2 ratio without negatively impacting propene yield.

The document does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, so their specific effects cannot be addressed.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到载体材料的显著影响：

1. 活性和选择性：Cr-O/SiO2表现出CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用，而Cr-O/Al2O3即使在进料中加入少量CO2也会导致丙烯产率急剧下降。

2. 稳定性：文献没有提供不同载体对催化剂稳定性的具体信息。

3. 机理路径：载体的性质影响CO2的吸附。在Al2O3上，CO2的吸附减少了丙烷的吸附，导致丙烷转化率降低。SiO2表现出较弱的CO2吸附，从而使催化剂性能更好。

4. 反应条件：温度升高导致丙烷转化率和丙烯产率增加，但丙烯选择性降低。CO2分压影响产物中的CO/H2比率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡温度对活性和选择性的影响。
2. 选择适当的载体材料以促进所需反应，同时最小化CO2的抑制作用。
3. 优化进料中的CO2浓度，以达到所需的CO/H2比率，同时不对丙烯产率产生负面影响。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2载体的信息，因此无法讨论它们的具体影响。
