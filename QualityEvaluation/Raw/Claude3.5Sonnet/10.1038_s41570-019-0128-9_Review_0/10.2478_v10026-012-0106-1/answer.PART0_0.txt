[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[5] "The low ratio of CO/H2 suitable for a direct application of synthesis gas in chemical processes can be obtained over Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst using feed gas with low CO2 concentration."

The support material significantly influences the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: Cr-O/SiO2 shows a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, while Cr-O/Al2O3 experiences a dramatic decrease in propene yield with even small amounts of CO2 in the feed.

2. Stability: The study does not provide direct information on catalyst stability for different supports.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The nature of the support affects CO2 adsorption. On γ-Al2O3, CO2 adsorption reduces propane adsorption, leading to decreased conversion. SiO2 does not show this effect.

4. Reaction conditions: Increasing temperature leads to higher propane conversion and propene yield but lower propene selectivity. The CO/H2 ratio changes slightly with temperature.

5. CO2 partial pressure: Lower CO2 concentrations in the feed gas produce a lower CO/H2 ratio, which is more suitable for direct application in chemical processes.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing propene yield and selectivity with temperature
- Optimizing CO2 concentration to promote propene yield without negatively impacting catalyst performance
- Selecting appropriate support materials that enhance rather than inhibit the desired reactions
- Achieving the right CO/H2 ratio for downstream applications while maintaining high propene production

The study suggests that Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts with low CO2 concentrations in the feed gas offer a promising direction for optimizing overall performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 活性和选择性：Cr-O/SiO2显示出CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用，而Cr-O/Al2O3即使在进料中添加少量CO2也会导致丙烯产率大幅下降。

2. 稳定性：该研究没有直接提供不同支持材料的催化剂稳定性信息。

3. 机理途径：支持材料的性质影响CO2的吸附。在γ-Al2O3上，CO2的吸附减少了丙烷的吸附，导致转化率降低。SiO2没有显示这种效应。

4. 反应条件：温度升高会导致丙烷转化率和丙烯产率增加，但丙烯选择性降低。CO/H2比率随温度变化不大。

5. CO2分压：进料气中较低的CO2浓度会产生较低的CO/H2比率，这更适合直接应用于化学工艺。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡温度与丙烯产率和选择性
- 优化CO2浓度以促进丙烯产率，同时不对催化剂性能产生负面影响
- 选择适当的支持材料，增强而不是抑制所需反应
- 在保持高丙烯产量的同时，为下游应用获得适当的CO/H2比率

研究表明，在进料气中使用低CO2浓度的Cr-O/SiO2催化剂为优化CO2氧化脱氢反应的整体性能提供了一个有前景的方向。
