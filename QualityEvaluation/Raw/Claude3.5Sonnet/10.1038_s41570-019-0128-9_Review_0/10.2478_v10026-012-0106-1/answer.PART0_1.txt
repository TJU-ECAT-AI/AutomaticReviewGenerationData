[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "Such great differences in the effects of CO2 are probably caused by the difference in supports nature."

[5] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

- Cr-O/Al2O3 shows decreased propene yield with CO2 addition, while Cr-O/SiO2 exhibits improved propene yield. 

- The difference is attributed to the nature of the supports. γ-Al2O3 has stronger basicity and Lewis acidity compared to SiO2, leading to stronger CO2 adsorption that inhibits propane adsorption and conversion on Cr-O/Al2O3.

- Temperature affects conversion, yield and selectivity. Higher temperatures increase propane conversion and propene yield but decrease propene selectivity.

- CO2 partial pressure impacts the CO/H2 ratio in the product. Increasing CO2 concentration generally increases the CO/H2 ratio.

Key challenges include:
- Balancing propene yield/selectivity with catalyst stability
- Optimizing CO2 concentration to promote yield without inhibiting reactions
- Selecting appropriate supports to enhance desired reactions
- Controlling reaction temperature to maximize conversion while maintaining selectivity

Trade-offs exist between maximizing propene production and tuning synthesis gas composition. The choice of support and reaction conditions needs to be optimized based on the specific goals of the process.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到载体材料的显著影响：

- Cr-O/Al2O3在添加CO2后丙烯产率降低，而Cr-O/SiO2的丙烯产率有所提高。

- 这种差异归因于载体的性质。与SiO2相比，γ-Al2O3具有更强的碱性和路易斯酸性，导致CO2吸附更强，从而抑制了Cr-O/Al2O3上丙烷的吸附和转化。

- 温度影响转化率、产率和选择性。温度升高会增加丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，但降低丙烯选择性。

- CO2分压影响产物中的CO/H2比率。增加CO2浓度通常会提高CO/H2比率。

主要挑战包括：
- 平衡丙烯产率/选择性与催化剂稳定性
- 优化CO2浓度以提高产率而不抑制反应
- 选择适当的载体以增强所需反应
- 控制反应温度以最大化转化率，同时保持选择性

在最大化丙烯产量和调节合成气组成之间存在权衡。需要根据工艺的具体目标来优化载体选择和反应条件。
