[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[3] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[4] "The thermodynamic calculations for the simplified model and the catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled easily by changing the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed."

The support material significantly influences the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Cr-O/Al2O3 catalysts show decreased propene yield with CO2 addition, while Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts exhibit a promoting effect.

2. The unfavorable effect on Cr-O/Al2O3 is attributed to the nature of γ-Al2O3, where CO2 adsorption reduces propane adsorption on the catalyst surface.

3. Reaction temperature affects catalyst performance: higher temperatures increase propane conversion and propene yield but decrease propene selectivity.

4. The CO2:C3H8 ratio in the feed can be used to control the synthesis gas composition (CO/H2 ratio).

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing propene yield and selectivity with reaction temperature.
2. Choosing appropriate support materials to enhance rather than inhibit the reaction.
3. Optimizing CO2 concentration to promote the reaction without negatively impacting propane adsorption.
4. Controlling the synthesis gas composition while maintaining high propene yield.

The study does not provide specific information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, indicating a need for further research on these materials to fully optimize chromium oxide catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

支撑材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响：

1. Cr-O/Al2O3催化剂在添加CO2时显示丙烯产率下降，而Cr-O/SiO2催化剂则表现出促进效果。

2. Cr-O/Al2O3的不利影响归因于γ-Al2O3的性质，CO2吸附减少了丙烷在催化剂表面的吸附。

3. 反应温度影响催化剂性能：更高的温度增加丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，但降低丙烯选择性。

4. 进料中的CO2:C3H8比率可用于控制合成气组成（CO/H2比率）。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡反应温度与丙烯产率和选择性。
2. 选择适当的支撑材料以增强而非抑制反应。
3. 优化CO2浓度以促进反应，同时不对丙烷吸附产生负面影响。
4. 在保持高丙烯产率的同时控制合成气组成。

该研究未提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2支撑材料的具体信息，表明需要对这些材料进行进一步研究，以全面优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。
