[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2  in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[5] "The low ratio of CO/H2 suitable for a direct application of synthesis gas in chemical processes can be obtained over Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst using feed gas with low CO2 concentration."

The support material significantly influences the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and yield: Cr-O/SiO2 shows improved propene yield with increasing CO2, while Cr-O/Al2O3 experiences a dramatic decrease in propene yield even with small amounts of CO2.

2. Selectivity: For both catalysts, selectivity to propene decreases as reaction temperature increases.

3. Stability: The literature does not provide specific information on catalyst stability for different supports.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The nature of the support affects CO2 adsorption. On γ-Al2O3, CO2 adsorption reduces propane adsorption, leading to decreased conversion. SiO2 does not show this effect.

5. CO2 partial pressure: Lower CO2 concentrations in the feed gas produce a more favorable CO/H2 ratio for Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity, as higher temperatures increase conversion but decrease selectivity.
2. Optimizing CO2 concentration to enhance propene yield without negatively impacting the CO/H2 ratio.
3. Choosing appropriate support materials that promote CO2 activation without inhibiting propane adsorption.

Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 on catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 活性和产率：Cr-O/SiO2随着CO2的增加显示出丙烯产率的提高，而Cr-O/Al2O3即使在少量CO2存在的情况下也会导致丙烯产率急剧下降。

2. 选择性：对于两种催化剂，随着反应温度的升高，丙烯的选择性都会降低。

3. 稳定性：文献没有提供关于不同支持材料对催化剂稳定性的具体信息。

4. 机理途径：支持材料的性质影响CO2的吸附。在γ-Al2O3上，CO2的吸附减少了丙烷的吸附，导致转化率降低。SiO2没有显示这种效果。

5. CO2分压：对于Cr-O/SiO2催化剂，进料气中较低的CO2浓度产生更有利的CO/H2比率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性，因为更高的温度会增加转化率但降低选择性。
2. 优化CO2浓度以提高丙烯产率，同时不对CO/H2比率产生负面影响。
3. 选择适当的支持材料，促进CO2活化而不抑制丙烷吸附。

需要进一步研究以充分了解其他支持材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2）对CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的影响。
