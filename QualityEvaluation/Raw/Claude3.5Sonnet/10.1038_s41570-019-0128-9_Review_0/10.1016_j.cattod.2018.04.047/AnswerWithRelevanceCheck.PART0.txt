          [1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The ability of ZrO2 support to activate CO2 over basic sites improves the activity in the ODH process."

[6] "The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small amount of reducible Cr V/VI."

[7] "Thus, the control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

          The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show the highest ethylene formation rates, while CrOx/CeO2 exhibits lower activity due to the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase.

2. Selectivity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 promotes direct dehydrogenation (DDH) with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), while CrOx/ZrO2 facilitates selective oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Stability: The stability of the catalysts is influenced by the support's ability to stabilize CrV/VI species.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The reaction pathway depends on the chromium oxidation state and support properties, particularly acid-base and redox characteristics.

5. CO2 activation: ZrO2 support's ability to activate CO2 over basic sites improves ODH activity.

Reaction conditions, especially CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role. A high CO2/C2H6 ratio (≥2) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve ethylene yield.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
1. Balancing activity and stability
2. Optimizing selectivity while maintaining high activity
3. Controlling chromium oxidation state
4. Managing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
5. Tailoring support properties to achieve desired performance

The control of support's redox properties to stabilize CrV/VI species is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in CO2-ODH of ethane.

          支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示出最高的乙烯生成速率，而CrOx/CeO2由于形成α-Cr2O3相而表现出较低的活性。

2. 选择性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3促进直接脱氢（DDH）和逆水气变换（RWGS）反应，而CrOx/ZrO2促进选择性氧化脱氢。

3. 稳定性：催化剂的稳定性受支持材料稳定CrV/VI物种能力的影响。

4. 机理途径：反应途径取决于铬的氧化态和支持材料的性质，特别是酸碱性和氧化还原特性。

5. CO2活化：ZrO2支持材料通过碱性位点活化CO2的能力提高了ODH活性。

反应条件，尤其是CO2分压，起着至关重要的作用。需要高CO2/C2H6比率（≥2）来移动平衡并提高乙烯产率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡活性和稳定性
2. 在保持高活性的同时优化选择性
3. 控制铬的氧化态
4. 管理积碳形成和催化剂失活
5. 定制支持材料性质以实现所需性能

控制支持材料的氧化还原性质以稳定CrV/VI物种对于优化乙烷CO2-ODH中的催化剂性能至关重要。
