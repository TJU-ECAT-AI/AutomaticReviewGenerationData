The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on
γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2
as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2). The catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation and characterized as-pre-
pared and after catalytic tests using N2 adsorption, XRD, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (DR) and Raman spectro-
scopies, TPR-H2 and TPO-CO2. The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene for-
mation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed
by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by
selective oxidative dehydrogenation. The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium
species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and
support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties.
1. Introduction
Currently, high demand in light olefins, such as ethylene and pro-
pylene, is caused by continuous growth of polymer industry that in-
vokes high research interest in the field of light alkene production.
Moreover, ethylene and propylene are important building blocks in
organic and polymeric synthesis for production of valuable chemicals
(ethylene oxide, polyethylene, propylene oxide, ethylene glycol, acet-
aldehyde, etc.) [1]. Steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic
cracking (FCC) are traditional ways of olefin production [2,3]. How-
ever, these methods have some disadvantages, including high energy
consumption and a wide product distribution, low selectivity and yield.
The mixture of products requires the use of a complex of separation
methods. In this regard, the alternative ways utilizing non-oil-based
feedstock attract more attention due to high level of extraction of shale
gas, natural gas and depletion of easily retrievable oil deposits. The
oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) [4], methanol-to-olefins tech-
nology (MTO) [5], and direct (DDH) [69] or oxidative (ODH) [1012]
dehydrogenation of alkanes are the main alternative routes for olefin
production. Unfortunately, OCM and MTO technologies still require
many improvements due to complexity, CO2 emissions, low ethylene
yield and selectivity towards ethylene, while all implementations of
propylene and ethylene require high purity of raw materials [3,13].
Another promising way is a direct transformation of alkanes into olefins
by catalytic dehydrogenation. Several processes were commercialized
to produce isobutylene and propylene by DDH of isobutane and pro-
pane (Catofin, Oleflex), respectively, using modified Cr2O3/Al2O3 and
PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts [14,15]. The thermodynamic limitations and
coke formation are the main unsolved problems of direct alkane de-
hydrogenation. Thermodynamic limitations increase in the raw of al-
kanes: C4 < C3 < C2. Thus, DDH of ethane is difficult to implement at
a large scale due to low ethylene yield [16]. ODH reaction is a pro-
mising way to produce ethylene from ethane. The ODH of ethane in the
presence of oxygen is thermodynamically unrestricted and occurs
without coke deposition. However, most catalysts presented in the lit-
erature (V- and Mo-containing catalysts, composite oxides, etc.) provide
low selectivity towards ethylene due to deep oxidation of ethane that
limits their application [17]. The ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2
as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2) has the advantage of higher selectivity
than in case of O2-assisted dehydrogenation. Moreover, ecological
problems connected with CO2 utilization may be solved using ODH-CO2
process [18]. The generally accepted point of view on the influence of
CO2 addition on the ODH process is as follows. The equilibrium of
dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2 is shifted due to re-
verse watergas shift reaction (RWGS) that leads to increase of ethylene
yield [19]:

Dehydrogenation:CnH2n+2 CnH2n + H2
(1)
RWGS: CO2 + H2 CO + H2O
(2)
Overall: CnH2n+2 + CO2 CnH2n + CO + H2O
(3)
Another point of view is based on direct participation of oxygen-
containing sites [O] of the surface of metal oxide in alkane dehy-
drogenation followed by recovery of oxygen vacancy (re-oxidation) by
gaseous CO2 (Mars-van Krevelen mechanism) [20]:
[O]s + CnH2n+2 CnH2n + H2O + []s
(4)
[]s + CO2 CO + [O]s
(5)
where []s is an oxygen vacancy on the surface of metal oxide.
In both cases ODH-CO2 provides higher conversion of alkane with
remaining high selectivity towards olefin in comparison with non-oxi-
dative DDH under the same operating conditions (temperature, GHSV,
alkane concentration, etc.) [21]. The rate of reaction (4) depends on the
concentration of oxygen sites that, in its turn, is affected by the rate of
re-oxidation (5) of the oxide surface. The latter is connected with the
ability of the surface to activate CO2. Thus, variation of the nature of
the metal oxide, namely acid-base and red-ox properties, is an efficient
approach to control the re-oxidation rate and catalytic activity in ODH-
CO2.
Due to high temperature of the ODH-CO2 process, deactivation of
the catalysts by coke formation is unavoidable under operation condi-
tions. According to the literature data, the higher the density of basic
sites on the catalyst surface, the higher the stability of the catalysts in
the presence of CO2 is achieved [22]. In this case, a strongly adsorbed
CO2 may oxidize carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. The catalytic
performance modulation by changing of the nature of support and ac-
tive component may be used to achieve high conversion of ethane,
selectivity to ethylene and stability of the catalyst [23].
Among the supported metal oxides (In2O3, Ga2O3, V2O5) studied for
this reaction, chromium oxide is a promising candidate due to its high
catalytic activity towards dehydrogenation of alkanes [24]. Chromia-
alumina catalysts are commonly used in industry for DDH of light
paraffins in Catofin and Catadiene processes. Moreover, supported Cr-
containing catalysts show high activity in ODH-CO2 of propane and
isobutane [25]. However, the performance of existing catalysts is not
enough for industrial application of ODH and strongly depends on the
chromia content, type of support and operation conditions (CO2 partial
pressure, GHSV, etc.). From this point of view, the research and de-
velopment of new catalysts for ODH-CO2 is an important challenge.
It is noteworthy that the active Cr species in ODH are still under
discussion. Red-ox scheme of ODH-CO2 that includes direct participa-
tion of Cr6+/Cr3+ or Cr5+/Cr3+ [26,27] and Cr3+/Cr2+ [28] pairs was
proposed. Also Cr-containing catalysts tend to deactivate under ODH-
CO2 conditions due to coke formation [29]. Thus, the use of oxide
supports for Cr catalysts with active oxygen is preferable for stable
operation of the catalyst.
Another cause of catalyst deactivation is sintering of chromium
species with formation of the inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 [30]. Thus,
oxide supports with high ability to stabilize amorphous CrOx species in
the highly dispersed state may prevent the deactivation of catalyst
caused by aggregation of CrOx species. ZrO2, CeO2 and mixed cer-
iazirconia oxides are the best candidates as supports for ODH catalysts
due to their unique red-ox properties. Different metal oxide catalysts
(NbOx, V2O5, etc.) [3133] supported on CeO2 and ZrO2 are active in
this process. However, the CrOx species supported on CexZr(1-x)O2 and
CeO2 are poorly studied as catalysts in the ODH of ethane.
Therefore, the purpose of the present work is to study the influence
of the nature of oxide supports on the performance of CrOx-containing
catalysts for ODH of ethane with CO2. The red-ox properties of the
supports and catalysts as well as the states of Cr are mainly discussed.
The aluminachromia catalysts with inert support (towards red-ox
properties) were used as a reference.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 were used as supports.
Aluminum, cerium and zirconium oxides were prepared by thermal
decomposition
of
AlO(OH),
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O
and
ZrO(NO3)2·H2O
(Across) at 600 C for 4 h under static air atmosphere. Mixed CexZr(1-
x)O2 oxide was synthesized by co-precipitation method. The amounts of
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·H2O calculated to get molar ratio of
Ce:Zr = 1:1 were dissolved in water. Then, 2 M aqueous solution of
ammonia was added dropwise to obtain the precipitate. The precipitate
was dried at 90 C overnight and calcined at 600 C for 4 h.
Chromia containing catalysts were prepared by wetness impregna-
tion of γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 with aqueous solution of
CrO3. Chromium loading corresponded to 1 theoretical monolayer (5
atoms Cr per nm2 of the support). The calculated content of Cr in wt. %
is presented in Table 1. The catalysts obtained were dried at 95 C
overnight than calcined in air at 600 C for 4 h. The prepared catalysts
were denoted as CrOx/γ-Al2O3, CrOx/ZrO2, CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/
CexZr(1-x)O2.
2.2. Sample characterization
The prepared catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray
diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Raman

spectroscopy (RS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and oxi-
dation in CO2 (TPO-CO2), thermogravimetric analysis and differential
scanning calorimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-DSC-MS).
The specific surface area (SSA) and pore diameter of the samples
were measured by nitrogen sorption at 196 C using a TriStar II 3020
analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Prior to experiments, all samples were
degassed at 200 C up to constant mass for 2 h. SSA was determined by
the BET method. The pore size distribution was calculated from the
desorption branch of the adsorptiondesorption isotherm by the
Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the range 2θ from
10 to 90 with a scanning rate of 2/min on a MiniFlex 600 (Rigaku,
Japan)
diffractometer
using
monochromatized
Cu-Kα
radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å) with a power setting of 40 kV and 15 mA. The phase
identification was made according to PCPDFWIN database.
UVvis disffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were recorded using a Cary
100 SCAN spectrophotometer with DRA-CA-30I, Labsphere attachment
(Varian, Australia) in the wavelength range of 200900 nm, with a step
of 1 nm, and a spectral resolution up to 0.1 nm. MgO was used as a
standard sample.
Raman spectra were obtained at ambient conditions using inVia
confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK) with a spectral resolution
of 2 cm1. The samples were excited with the 532 nm line and a laser
power of 4 mW (5% from initial laser power). The spectra were re-
corded at an exposure time of 1 s, an accumulation number of 50, and
an objective with magnification x20 was used.
The red-ox properties of the catalysts were investigated by TPR-H2
using a ChemiSorb 2750 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics)
equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TPR experi-
ments were performed in the temperature range from room tempera-
ture (RT) to 650 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min using a 10 vol. % H2/
Ar mixture (flow rate of 20 cm3/min). To avoid the effect of water
formed, a cold trap with a mixture of liquid nitrogen and isopropanol
(ca. 90 C) was set prior to the detector. Prior to the TPR experiments,
the catalysts were pre-oxidized in a TPO mode in an air flow (20 cm3/
min) with a heating rate of 10 C/min up to 650 C.
TPO-CO2 experiments were performed in a U-shaped quartz reactor
using a ChemiSorb 2750 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) coupled with a
quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) UGA 300 (Stanford Research
Systems, USA). Prior to experiment the sample (0.2 g) was reduced in
10%H2/Ar flow (20 cm3/min) in a TPR mode up to 650 C and kept at
this temperature for 20 min. After cooling to RT in the 10%H2/Ar
mixture, the sample was purged with He flow (27 cm3/min). Then the
flow was switched to 10%CO2/He mixture (30 cm3/min), and sample
was heated from RT to 950 C with a rate of 10 C/min. Concentrations
of CO2 (m/z = 44), CO (m/z = 28), H2O (m/z = 18) and O2 (m/
z = 32) were monitored by MS. To remove the trace amounts of oxygen
and water from the 10%CO2/He mixture, two traps filled with reduced
Cu/SiO2 (maintained at 340 C) and calcined alumina (maintained at
RT) were used, respectively.
The TG-DSC-MS analysis of the samples was performed using a STA
449 F1 Jupiter analyzer (Netzsch, Germany) coupled with quadrupole
mass spectrometer QMS 403D Aolos (Netzsch, Germany). The samples
(510 mg) were placed in Al2O3 crucible and heated from 25 to 900 C
at a heating rate of 10 C/min in air flow (10 cm3/min Ar + 80 cm3/
min air).
2.3. Catalytic test
The catalytic activity in the ODH-CO2 of ethane was tested at
Microactivity-Reference unit (PID Eng&Tech, Spain). The experiments
were carried out in a stainless steel, down flow reactor (305 mm long,
9 mm i.d.) operating at atmospheric pressure [34]. During the experi-
ment the reactor was placed in electrical furnace located inside a hot
box at 175 C. Reaction temperature was controlled by coaxial K-type
thermocouple inserted in the center of catalyst bed without thermowell.
The catalyst sample (0.25 g with a grain size 0.250.42 mm) was di-
luted by SiC (0.420.84 mm) in volume ratio 1:2 and put into the re-
actor between two quartz wool plugs. Pre- and post-catalytic zones in
the reactor were filled with SiC grains to reduce the gas-phase reaction
extent. The reaction mixture, 5% C2H6-10% CO2 in He, was passed
through the reactor at a total flow rate of 200 cm3/min. Gas flows were
controlled by Bronkhorst mass flow controllers. Reaction temperature
range was from 500 to 700 C. The reactor effluents were passed
through a condenser and then analyzed by an on-line gas chromato-
graph Varian MicroGC equipped with a Pora Plot Q capillary column
and a TCD.
The catalytic tests for each sample were conducted successively at
temperatures from 500 to 700 C in increasing steps of 50 C, kept for
30 min each. After each temperature setting increase, the new tem-
perature became stabilized after around 10 min. Only measurements
made in the isothermic portion of each step were considered valid for
analysis and discussion.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic properties
It is known that dehydrogenation of alkanes in the presence of CO2
is accompanied by a wide variety of side reactions due to high process
temperature [12]. The following reactions take place:
selective ODH: C2H6 + CO2 C2H4 + CO + H2O
(6)
DDH: C2H6 C2H4 + H2
(7)
non-selective reaction: C2H6 + 5 CO2 7 CO + 3 H2O
(8)
watergas shift reaction: CO + H2O CO2 + H2
(9)
cracking: C2H6 + H2 2 CH4
(10)
disproportionation: 2 C2H6 C3H8 + CH4
(11)
coke formation: C2H4 2 C + 2H2
(12)
C2H6 2 C + 3H2
(13)
Boudouard reaction: C + CO2 2 CO
(14)
dry reforming: C2H6 + 2 CO2 4CO + 3H2
(15)
Moreover, gas-phase processes (homogeneous reactions) cannot be
excluded, especially above 650 C [35]. Thermodynamic calculations of
ΔGr of these reactions are presented as a function of temperature in
Fig. 1. One can see that all side reactions are thermodynamically more
favorable especially at high temperatures than the target reactions
(ODH and DDH of ethane). Dry reforming and non-selective reactions
take place only at high temperatures. Therefore, the selectivity toward
ethylene strongly depends on the properties of the active sites of the
catalyst. It is known that high acidity of the catalyst surface provokes
cracking and coke formation leading to selectivity decrease. Coke for-
mation via ethylene decomposition is more favorable than via ethane
decomposition due to higher polymerization ability of the former. This
means that a higher formation rate of ethylene (higher activity of cat-
alyst) will lead to more rapid deactivation due to coke deposition.
However, oxidation of coke via Boudouard reaction is possible for
supports with active oxygen species. The temperature dependencies of
ΔGr for DDH and selective ODH reactions are similar due to low ability
of CO2 to oxidize H2. Equilibrium of the RWGS shifts to CO formation
(K > 1) only at 1100 K. Therefore, both processes have thermo-
dynamic limitations. High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to
shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield (Fig. 2). The ad-
vantage of the ODH-CO2 of ethane in comparison with the DDH may be
connected with the kinetic reasons rather than thermodynamic ones.

through dissociation of CO2 probably occurs more easily (with lower
activation energy).
The specific rates of ethylene and CO formation per catalyst mass
unit for all catalysts during the ODH-CO2 are presented in Fig. 3(a,b). It
can be seen that the rate of C2H4 formation was higher than the one of
CO for CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, though the difference was small, even at
700 C. Thus, the process consists of two reactions: direct dehy-
drogenation and RWGS. The equilibrium of the latter reaction is shifted
to CO and H2O and is accompanied by a temperature increasing, which
leads to reduction in the difference between the C2H4 and CO formation
rates. The rate of ethylene production at 500650 C for CrOx/ZrO2
catalysts is slightly higher than for CrOx/Al2O3. However, the rates of
CO formation for these catalysts differ significantly. The CrOx/ZrO2
catalyst is characterized by similar rates of CO and ethylene formation
at 500550 C, which means that the reaction occurs via selective ODH.
When the temperature increases, the formation rate of CO rises in a
higher extent than the one for ethylene due to non-selective reaction
and/or dry reforming of ethane. Both CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 are
characterized by fast deactivation that occurs mainly at 650-700 C.
The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the lowest rate of C2H4 formation,
and, hence, higher stability among all studied catalysts. The CO for-
mation rate is fourfold that of C2H4, which may be associated with non-
selective reaction or dry reforming of ethane. The rate of C2H4 forma-
tion is higher for CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 in comparison with CrOx/CeO2. The
CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is characterized by slightly faster deactivation than
CrOx/CeO2 and similar rate of CO formation. The difference between
the rates of CO and C2H4 formation gradually increases with the tem-
perature increase for CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 and CrOx/CeO2, which means
that both catalysts intensively accelerate the non-selective reactions of
ethane transformation. One of the possible reasons for low rate of
catalyst deactivation is the oxidation of carbon deposits on the catalyst
surface.
Due to the big differences in SSA of the catalysts, the surface-specific
rates of ethylene and CO formation (i.e., per m2 of catalyst SSA) were
also calculated and are plotted in Fig. 3(c,d). Indeed, the ratios between
the formation rates of CO and C2H4 are the same as those calculated per
catalyst mass. However, in this case the CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/CeO2
catalysts exhibit the lowest surface-specific rate of C2H4 formation at
500650 C. This means that the highest activity of CrOx/Al2O3 is
mainly caused by the higher SSA of this catalyst (Table 1). The CrOx/
ZrO2 catalyst showed the higher ethylene formation rate. The rate of
ethylene production at 500650 C for CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts is
slightly lower than for CrOx/ZrO2. The surface-specific rates of CO
formation
for
CrOx/ZrO2,
CrOx/CeO2,
and
CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2
at
500650 C are similar, but differed significantly at 700 C.
The evolution of ethane conversion and C2H4 selectivity with re-
action temperature and time is shown in Fig. 4. One can see that CrOx/
CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 possess the lowest ethane conversion
(210%) and selectivity towards ethylene at 550700 C. This se-
lectivity noticeably decreases from 95 to 45% as the reaction tem-
perature increases. These catalysts are characterized by the highest
ratios of CO-to-ethylene formation rates, which indicate non-selective
and/or dry reforming side reactions. The highest selectivity was ob-
served for CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, for which it slowly
decreased to 90 and 80%, respectively, during the reaction time. CrOx/
Al2O3 was the most selective catalyst due to the absence of non-selec-
tive oxidation and/or dry reforming reactions. The main side reactions
for this sample are cracking and coke deposition. The highest conver-
sion of ethane (521%) was observed for CrOx/ZrO2 at 550650 C.
Rapid deactivation of catalyst at temperatures above 600 C can be
associated with its active oxide sintering.
Thus, the deactivation of all catalysts is mainly connected with coke
deposition and possibly with agglomeration of active component. The
rate of deactivation gradually increased with the temperature and de-
pended on the ethylene formation rate. High activity of CrOx/ZrO2 and
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts toward ethylene production leads to their rapid
deactivation.
3.2. Textural properties and phase composition of the samples
The porous structure of the supports and catalysts was studied by
low-temperature N2 sorption. The presence of a hysteresis loop on the
isotherms at relative pressures from 0.45 to 1.0 for all supports (not
shown) indicates formation of mesoporous structure. According to pore
size distributions (Fig. 5a), the porous structure of the supports con-

CexZr(1-x)O2. Incorporation of chromium oxide into chromia-containing
catalysts caused an important decrease of the surface area and pore
volume (Table 1) excepting for CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst which maintained
the properties of ZrO2 support. This may be explained by stabilization
of mononuclear chromia species on the surface of zirconia and addi-
tional stabilization of zirconia towards sintering by chromia at high
temperatures [36].
The most dramatic changes in the porous structure are observed for
CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts: in comparison with CeO2
and CexZr(1-x)O2 supports (Fig. 5), their SSAs decrease by 77 and 62%,
respectively. Pore size distributions for catalysts CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/
CexZr(1-x)O2 in the range of higher pore diameter was shifted from
average pore size 9.1 and 3.1 nm to 29.7 and 5.5 nm, respectively
(Table 1). The described changes in porous structure may be caused by
the filling of the smaller pores of ceria with chromium oxide during the
impregnation with chromic acid solution or possible sintering after the
second calcination.
The phase composition of supports and catalysts is also presented in
Table 1. The absence of reflections of Cr-containing phases indicates the
stabilization of CrOx in an amorphous state on the surface of Al2O3,
ZrO2
and
CexZr(1-x)Ox
supports.
Reflections
of
α-Cr2O3
phase
(2θ = 24.50, 33.61 and 36.20) are observed only for CrOx/CeO2 cat-
alysts. CeO2 particle sizes grow from 5.9 nm (reflection of CeO2(111) at
28.6) for CeO2 support to 18.9 nm for CrOx/CeO2 catalyst. Thus, sin-
tering of ceria together with agglomeration of chromia in α-Cr2O3
phase is observed for CrOx/CeO2 catalyst.
3.3. The state of supports and active component
Fig. 6 shows the UVvis DR and Raman spectra of supports and
catalysts. UVvis spectra of all catalysts (Fig. 6(a)) two main absorption
bands at 275 and 376 nm attributed to CrVI species [37]. The ab-
sorption at 200500 nm observed for CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 supports
can be attributed to the presence of cubic CeO2 and mixed Ce-Zr oxide
[38]. The two bands at 460 and 582 nm observed for CrOx/CeO2
catalyst indicate the presence of CrIII species in the octahedral

symmetry (α-Cr2O3) [37,39]. The presence of α-Cr2O3 in CrOx/CeO2
catalyst is also confirmed by XRD.
According to Raman spectra (Fig.6(b)), the CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is only
characterized by those bands originating from vibrations of chromium
oxides. The spectrum contains a weak band at 630 cm1, which
probably corresponds to υs(CreOeCr). Two bands and shoulders ob-
served at 865, 1003 cm1 and at 787, 920 cm1 are assigned to the
υs(OeCreO), υs(Cr]O), υas(CreOeCr) and υs of CrO2 units that ter-
minate the surface polymeric species, respectively [40,41]. All these
bands and shoulders can be attributed to poly-, mononuclear CrVI
species.
In the case of ZrO2 and CrOx/ZrO2, the bands at 145, 178, 219, 266,
330, 380, 476, 537, 556, 615 and 634 cm1 correspond to tetragonal
and monoclinic zirconia [42]. These bands are slightly shifted for the
CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst. The bands at 780, 817, 854, 890, 1009 and
1028 cm1 attributed to CrVI species are found in the range from 650 to
1400 cm1. The most intense Raman band at 854 cm1 may be as-
signed to isolated tetrahedral surface-mononuclear (CrVI) species dis-
torted by the interaction with the support surface [43], while the peaks
at 780, 817 and 890 cm1 as shoulders to the main band probably
correspond to CreO vibrations in higher polymerization degree species
(polynuclear CrVI). Two bands at 1009 and 1028 cm1 are attributed to
mono- and dioxo Cr]O vibrations [44].
The Raman spectra of CeO2 contain strong F2g band of the fluorite
phase at 460 cm1 and weak bands at 260, 600 and 1170 cm1 related
to the second-order transverse acoustic mode (2 TA), defect-induced
mode (D) and a second overtone band (2LO), respectively [45]. The
spectra of the CrOx/CeO2 catalyst differ significantly from those of

CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2. Besides the bands of CeO2, weak bands at
537, 837 and 1018 cm1 are observed for the CrOx/CeO2 catalyst. The
bands at 837 and 1018 cm1 can be attributed to CreO and Cr]O
vibrations of CrVI species, while the bands at 537 and 600 cm1 are
characteristic for the crystalline Cr2O3 nanoparticles (CrIII
octeO bond)
[39,44]. These results are in agreement with the DRS and XRD data.
The bands for CexZr(1-x)O2 support are the same as those for CeO2
support that confirms formation of mixed CeeZr oxide with cubic
phase. The bands of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 are not observed.
In comparison with spectrum of pure CeO2 the increased intensity of
the bands at 230 and 615 cm1 attributed to oxygen vacancies [46]
indicates the growth of number of defects of the mixed oxide. The bands
at 834, 863, 1008 and 1023 cm1 can be attributed to poly(mono-)
nuclear CrVI species as described above. It is noteworthy that the bands
of vibrations of CrIII species (537 cm1) are not observed.
After ODH-CO2 (Fig. 7), two strong bands at 1598 and 1343 cm1
assigned to the structured carbon [47] are observed for CrOx/γ-Al2O3,
CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts. These bands are also pre-
sent in the spectra of the CrOx/CeO2, but their intensity is low. The
vibrations of chromium species are not found for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and
CrOx/ZrO2 due to carbon deposits on the catalyst surface and are weak
for the CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 and CrOx/CeO2 possibly due to reduction of
CrVI species.
The TPR profiles for supports, as-prepared catalysts and catalysts
after catalytic test are shown in Fig. 8. The amount of H2 consumed is
summarized in Table 1. The intensive H2 consumption peak with a
maximum at 379 C observed for the as-prepared CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is
attributed to reduction of CrV/VI to CrII/III species [48]. The decrease of
intensity of this peak and a shift in a high-temperature region are ob-
served for the used catalyst. This indicates the decreased amount of red-
ox chromia (i.e. CrOx that can be reversibly oxidized-reduced (CrV/
VICrII/III)) due to its agglomeration, with stabilization in inactive α-
Cr2O3 state and formation of mixed chromiaalumina phases [30]. Both
processes lead to irreversible catalyst deactivation.
The H2 consumption peak at temperatures above 450 C for the ZrO2
support is attributed to partial reduction of Zr4+ to Zr3+ in the struc-
ture of zirconia [49]. The TPR peak above 400 C for CeO2 support is
associated with the reduction of the surface Ce4+ to Ce3+ [5052]. Two
peaks at temperatures above 350 C for the CexZr(1-x)O2 can be attrib-
uted to reduction of Zr4+ and Ce4+. The reducibility of mixed cer-
iazirconia oxides is known to be higher of than those of individual
CeO2 and ZrO2 [53]. These results are in agreement with increased
number of defects of CexZr(1-x)O2 observed during the Raman studies.
The TPR profile for the CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts is characterized by an in-
tensive peak with maximum at 340 C, which can be attributed to
reduction of Crn+ from the high valence state to Cr2+/3+ [54]. The shift
of this peak in comparison with the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst may indicate
the stabilization of isolated CrV and/or CrVI species on the ZrO2 surface
[23,37] that is confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy. The H2 con-
sumption at 400600 C for the CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst may be attributed to
reduction of CrOx species strongly bonded with the support or reduction
of zirconia catalyzed by chromia [25,55]. The decrease of this peak
intensity is observed for the catalysts after the catalytic process, while
the peak area at 350 C did not change significantly. This indicates
higher stability of red-ox chromia species on the zirconia surface (in
comparison with the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst). The same results are ob-
served for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts. The difference
between the maximum of peak reduction of CrV/VI may be attributed to
both, different interaction of chromia with the support and different
nuclearity of CrV/VI species.
TPO-CO2 experiments were carried out to investigate the ability of
catalyst for re-oxidation by CO2 (Figs. 9 and 10). One can see that no re-
oxidation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst by CO2 was detected. This phenom-
enon may be associated with poor basicity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.
According to literature data [18], the active sites for CO2 activation

should possess electron donor properties (basic properties). After elec-
tron acceptance, a linear CO2 molecule transforms into bended charged
active species CO2
 on the oxide surface and can dissociate with filling
of oxygen vacancy and CO formation. Similarly the absence of re-oxi-
dation was observed for CrOx/CeO2, though the re-oxidation of pure
CeO2 took place (Fig. 9). This means that addition of chromia to CeO2
leads to a significant change of electronic and acid-base properties of
cerium oxide. For CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst, a peak of CO emission at
535 C together with two peaks of CO2 desorption at 150 and 450 C
were observed. One may conclude that basic sites on the surface of
CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are responsible for CO2 activation. ZrO2 possess not
only strong acid sites (Zr4+), but also strong Lewis basic sites (O2) and
Bronsted basic sites (terminal OH-groups) [56]. According to TPO-CO2
results, small peak of CO2 consumption is observed at 760 C, while CO
emission starts at 800 C.

weight loss in the low-temperature region (from RT to 150200 C) is
connected with desorption of the adsorbed water. The second step,
accompanied by exothermic effect and CO2 emission, was observed in
the
temperature
range
of
150300 C
for
CrOx/CeO2
and
200400 C for CrOx/γ-Al2O3, CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 and CrOx/ZrO2 cat-
alysts. This indicates the combustion of carbon deposits on the catalyst
surface. The difference in temperature maxima of the DSC-signal and
CO2 emission indicates differences in the nature of the carbon deposits
and/or in the ability of the catalyst surface toward carbon oxidation.
The supports with active surface oxygen (CeO2, CexZr(1-x)O2, ZrO2)
oxidize carbon deposits at lower temperatures.
In addition, an increase of the sample mass was observed in the
range of 350500 C for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 due to re-
oxidation of the catalysts by oxygen. At the same time, the mass loss at
the second step differs greatly for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and for CrOx/ZrO2,
CrOx/CeO2, CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts (7.46 and 0.36, 0.39, 0.8%,
respectively). Accumulation of large amounts of coke on the surface of
CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is connected with high rate of ethylene formation and
low reaction ability of surface oxygen of alumina. Strong acid sites are
known to facilitate coke formation on the alumina surface. The small
amount of carbon deposits on the surface of CrOx/ZrO2 (0.36% wt.)
may be associated with the removal of coke by gaseous CO2 during the
ODH process. It was shown [57] that the using of ZrO2 as a modifier for
Ni/Al2O3 catalyst significantly improved its coke resistance in dry re-
forming of methane. Carbon deposits may be oxidized by CO2 at the Ni/
ZrO2 interface. The CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts are
characterized by low amounts of coke. One of the possible reasons is a
low rate of ethylene formation. Another reason is connected with
carbon removal by CO2 during the ODH as in the case of ZrO2 support.
Moreover, DFT calculations show that CeO2 with high concentration of
oxygen vacancies on the surface may be re-oxidized during the CO2
dissociation [58]. So oxygen mobility in CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 network
may favor the removal of coke precursor on their surfaces.
4. Discussion
Our results show that the state of chromium depends on the nature
of support used. The reaction pathway and catalytic activity depend on
both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on acid-base
and red-ox properties. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is characterized by
formation of ethylene during the DDH accompanied by the RWGS. This
is a classical catalyst for the dehydrogenation processes. The CrOx/γ-
Al2O3 catalyst contains amorphous chromium oxide in both CrV/VI and
CrII/III states. Chromium red-ox cycle CrV/VI CrII/III on the catalyst
surface triggers DDH process by activation of C2H6 molecule. According
to our results, chromia on the surface of γ-Al2O3 is not re-oxidized by
gaseous CO2 as confirmed by the TPO-CO2 data (Fig. 10). This limits the
possibility of CO2 involvement in the reactions (ODH, non-selective
reactions). High surface acidity triggers an intensive coke deposition on
the surface and deactivation of the catalyst, while the absence of strong
CO2 adsorption leads to impossibility of carbon removal. According to
DSC-TG results, the amount of carbon after ODH-CO2 was 7.46% wt,
one order of magnitude higher than on the other, non-acidic support
catalysts. As a consequence, the rate of deactivation of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is
faster than for other catalysts (Figs. 3, 4).
Both selective ODH and DDH are the possible reaction pathways
over CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst. In this catalyst, chromium is stabilized mainly
as poly-, mononuclear Cr V/VI species that provides the increased ac-
tivity. The higher amount of CrVI in CrOx/ZrO2 sample (66% of total
Cr content) in comparison with the one in CrOx/γ-Al2O3 (35% of total
Cr content) may be caused by a better distribution of chromium on the
surface of ZrO2 due to stronger interaction with the support. The ability

of ZrO2 support to activate CO2 over basic sites improves the activity in
the ODH process. Besides, it is possible to conclude that side reactions
over CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst comprise non-selective oxidation and/or dry
reforming reactions, since the ratio between the CO and C2H4 formation
rates is 1.52. According to TG-DSC results, low amount of coke (0.36%
wt.) remains after the catalytic experiment, which indicates the possible
oxidation of deposited coke on the catalyst surface by CO2 (Boudouard
reaction).
The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with
the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small
amount of reducible Cr V/VI. The re-oxidation ability of CeO2 support is
observed by TPO-CO2. This, together with the high oxygen mobility in
the ceria nertwork, makes non-selective oxidation and/or dry reforming
reactions (ratio CO/C2H4 is up to 5) the side reactions characteristic for
this catalyst. The low amount of coke observed (0.39% wt.) is caused by
both

and
Boudouard reaction.
Unlike CrOx/CeO2 catalyst, the catalyst supported on CexZr(1-x)O2
contains chromium mainly in a high valence state (Cr V/VI) according to
TPR-H2 and Raman results, and no α-Cr2O3 phase is detected. And, in
parallel, the activity of CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst is higher than the one
of CrOx/CeO2 (Fig.3(c)). Ethylene formation takes place by selective
ODH-CO2. CexZr(1-x)O2 is more reducible than ZrO2. The side reactions
over CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst are the same as for CrOx/ZrO2 and
CrOx/CeO2, though the ratio between the CO and C2H4 formation rates
amounts to 3 and is lower than the one for CrOx/CeO2.
Thus, the increase of CrV/VI species concentration leads to increase
in catalyst activity in ethane dehydrogenation. The possibility of CO2
activation on the support leads to increased activity in ODH for CrOx/
ZrO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts. CeO2 support provides activity of
catalysts in non-selective oxidation. Thus, the control of red-ox prop-
erties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its
surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant.
5. Conclusion
Cr-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, CexZr(1-
x)O2 have been investigated in the ODH-CO2. The nature of the support
influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and
stability of the catalyst. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher
activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction
pathways are different on them. The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 cat-
alyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the
RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions. On CrOx/
ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the
side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reac-
tions. The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is
caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive
chromium species. CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable
catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH.
Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with
difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. Relatively high stability of
CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for
ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic
sites of the supports. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/
CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/
and dry-reforming reactions.
