[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The ability of ZrO2 support to activate CO2 over basic sites improves the activity in the ODH process."

[6] "The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small amount of reducible Cr V/VI."

[7] "Thus, the control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates. CrOx/CeO2 had relatively low activity due to formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 phase.

2. Selectivity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 favored direct dehydrogenation with RWGS, while CrOx/ZrO2 promoted selective oxidative dehydrogenation. CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 tended to catalyze non-selective oxidation reactions.

3. Stability: CrOx/CeO2 was most stable but least active. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 deactivated rapidly due to coking. CrOx/ZrO2 deactivated at high temperatures possibly due to sintering.

4. Mechanistic pathways: Determined by chromium oxidation state and support properties, especially acid-base and redox characteristics. Basic sites on ZrO2 activated CO2, promoting ODH. CeO2 provided oxygen mobility, favoring non-selective oxidation.

Key challenges include balancing activity and stability, minimizing coking and sintering, and optimizing CO2 activation. The main trade-off is between high activity (CrOx/γ-Al2O3, CrOx/ZrO2) and high stability (CrOx/CeO2).

Reaction conditions like high CO2/C2H6 ratio (>2) can improve ethylene yield by shifting equilibrium. Controlling support redox properties to stabilize CrV/VI species is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in CO2-ODH.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示出最高的乙烯生成速率。由于形成了不活性的α-Cr2O3相，CrOx/CeO2的活性相对较低。

2. 选择性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3倾向于直接脱氢和逆水气变换反应，而CrOx/ZrO2促进选择性氧化脱氢。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2倾向于催化非选择性氧化反应。

3. 稳定性：CrOx/CeO2最稳定但活性最低。CrOx/γ-Al2O3由于结焦而快速失活。CrOx/ZrO2在高温下失活，可能是由于烧结。

4. 机理途径：由铬的氧化态和载体性质决定，特别是酸碱性和氧化还原特性。ZrO2上的碱性位点活化CO2，促进ODH。CeO2提供氧移动性，有利于非选择性氧化。

主要挑战包括平衡活性和稳定性、最小化结焦和烧结，以及优化CO2活化。主要权衡在于高活性（CrOx/γ-Al2O3，CrOx/ZrO2）和高稳定性（CrOx/CeO2）之间。

反应条件如高CO2/C2H6比率（>2）可以通过移动平衡来提高乙烯产率。控制载体的氧化还原性质以稳定CrV/VI物种对优化CO2-ODH中的催化剂性能至关重要。

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show the highest ethylene formation rates, while CrOx/CeO2 exhibits the lowest rate. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 shows intermediate activity.

2. Selectivity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily follows a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) pathway with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. CrOx/ZrO2 favors selective oxidative dehydrogenation. CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 tend to promote non-selective oxidation and/or dry reforming reactions.

3. Stability: CrOx/CeO2 shows the highest stability due to the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 phase. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 experiences rapid deactivation due to coke formation. CrOx/ZrO2 deactivates at high temperatures due to sintering or formation of inactive chromium species.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The pathways depend on the oxidation state of chromium and the support's acid-base and redox properties. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a CrV/VI - CrII/III redox cycle. CrOx/ZrO2 stabilizes Cr as poly- and mononuclear CrV/VI species. CrOx/CeO2 forms α-Cr2O3 phase, while CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 maintains chromium in high valence states.

Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role. A high CO2/C2H6 ratio (≥2) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve ethylene yield.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
1. Balancing activity and stability (e.g., CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is highly active but unstable, while CrOx/CeO2 is stable but less active).
2. Optimizing selectivity while maintaining high activity.
3. Preventing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, sintering, or formation of inactive species.
4. Tailoring the support material to achieve the desired chromium oxidation states and catalyst properties.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions, especially CO2 partial pressure, to enhance ethylene yield without compromising selectivity or stability.
