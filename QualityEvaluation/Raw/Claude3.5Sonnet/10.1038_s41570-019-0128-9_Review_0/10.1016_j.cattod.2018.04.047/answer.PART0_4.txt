[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the lowest rate of C2H4 formation, and, hence, higher stability among all studied catalysts."

[6] "The rate of deactivation gradually increased with the temperature and depended on the ethylene formation rate. High activity of CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts toward ethylene production leads to their rapid deactivation."

[7] "Thus, the control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates, while CrOx/CeO2 exhibited the lowest.

2. Selectivity: Different supports led to different reaction pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 promoted direct dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift, while CrOx/ZrO2 favored selective oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Stability: CrOx/CeO2 showed higher stability due to its lower activity in ethylene formation. High-activity catalysts like CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 deactivated more rapidly.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, which in turn affects the reaction pathway. The acid-base and redox properties of the support play crucial roles.

Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, also impact performance. A higher CO2/C2H6 ratio (2 or above) is needed to shift the equilibrium and improve ethylene yield.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: Higher activity often leads to faster deactivation.
2. Controlling the oxidation state of chromium: The support's redox properties are crucial for stabilizing active CrV/VI species.
3. Managing side reactions: Different supports promote various side reactions, affecting selectivity.
4. Optimizing CO2 activation: The support's ability to activate CO2 influences the ODH process efficiency.

Overall, optimizing catalyst performance requires careful tuning of support properties and reaction conditions to balance activity, selectivity, and stability.

载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理路径：

1. 活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示出最高的乙烯生成速率，而CrOx/CeO2的活性最低。

2. 选择性：不同的载体导致不同的反应路径。CrOx/γ-Al2O3促进直接脱氢和逆水气变换反应，而CrOx/ZrO2倾向于选择性氧化脱氢。

3. 稳定性：由于CrOx/CeO2在乙烯生成方面活性较低，因此表现出更高的稳定性。高活性催化剂如CrOx/ZrO2和CrOx/Al2O3失活更快。

4. 机理路径：载体影响铬物种的氧化态，进而影响反应路径。载体的酸碱性和氧化还原性质起着关键作用。

反应条件，特别是CO2分压，也影响性能。需要更高的CO2/C2H6比率（2或以上）来移动平衡并提高乙烯产率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：较高的活性通常导致更快的失活。
2. 控制铬的氧化态：载体的氧化还原性质对于稳定活性CrV/VI物种至关重要。
3. 管理副反应：不同的载体促进各种副反应，影响选择性。
4. 优化CO2活化：载体活化CO2的能力影响ODH过程效率。

总的来说，优化催化剂性能需要仔细调整载体性质和反应条件，以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
