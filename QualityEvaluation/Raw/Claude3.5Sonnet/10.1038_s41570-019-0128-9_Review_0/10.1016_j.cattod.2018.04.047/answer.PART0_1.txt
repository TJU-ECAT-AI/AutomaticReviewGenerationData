[1] "The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[3] "CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts possess the lowest ethane conversion (210%) and selectivity towards ethylene at 550700 C. This selectivity noticeably decreases from 95 to 45% as the reaction temperature increases."

[4] "The highest selectivity was observed for CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, for which it slowly decreased to 90 and 80%, respectively, during the reaction time."

[5] "The increase of CrV/VI species concentration leads to increase in catalyst activity in ethane dehydrogenation. The possibility of CO2 activation on the support leads to increased activity in ODH for CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalysts."

[6] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

The support materials significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show the highest ethylene formation rates. CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 exhibit lower ethane conversion.

2. Selectivity: CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 demonstrate the highest selectivity towards ethylene (90% and 80% respectively). CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 show lower selectivity, decreasing from 95% to 45% as temperature increases.

3. Stability: CrOx/CeO2 is the most stable catalyst due to the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 phase. CrOx/ZrO2 deactivates rapidly at high temperatures.

4. Mechanistic pathways: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 promotes direct dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift reaction. CrOx/ZrO2 facilitates selective oxidative dehydrogenation. CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 favor non-selective oxidation and/or dry reforming reactions.

5. CO2 partial pressure: Higher CO2/C2H6 ratio (2 or above) improves ethylene yield by shifting the equilibrium.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: Highly active catalysts like CrOx/ZrO2 tend to deactivate faster.
2. Optimizing selectivity vs conversion: Higher conversion often leads to lower selectivity.
3. Managing coke formation: Acidic supports promote coke formation, while basic supports help remove carbon deposits.
4. Controlling oxidation state of chromium: Higher concentration of CrV/VI species increases activity but may compromise stability.
5. Tailoring support properties: Acid-base and redox properties of the support influence catalyst performance and reaction pathways.

支撑材料显著影响了二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的性能：

1. 活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示最高的乙烯生成速率。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2表现出较低的乙烷转化率。

2. 选择性：CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2对乙烯表现出最高的选择性（分别为90%和80%）。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2显示较低的选择性，随着温度升高从95%降至45%。

3. 稳定性：由于形成了不活泼的α-Cr2O3相，CrOx/CeO2是最稳定的催化剂。CrOx/ZrO2在高温下迅速失活。

4. 机理途径：CrOx/γ-Al2O3促进直接脱氢和逆水气变换反应。CrOx/ZrO2促进选择性氧化脱氢。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2倾向于非选择性氧化和/或干重整反应。

5. CO2分压：较高的CO2/C2H6比率（2或以上）通过移动平衡提高乙烯产率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：高活性催化剂如CrOx/ZrO2往往失活更快。
2. 优化选择性与转化率：较高的转化率常导致较低的选择性。
3. 管理积碳形成：酸性支撑促进积碳形成，而碱性支撑有助于去除碳沉积。
4. 控制铬的氧化态：更高浓度的CrV/VI物种增加活性但可能影响稳定性。
5. 调整支撑性质：支撑的酸碱性和氧化还原性质影响催化剂性能和反应途径。
