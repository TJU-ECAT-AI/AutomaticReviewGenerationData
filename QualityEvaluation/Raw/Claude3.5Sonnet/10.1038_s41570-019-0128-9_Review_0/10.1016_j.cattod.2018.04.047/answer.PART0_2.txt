[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the lowest rate of C2H4 formation, and, hence, higher stability among all studied catalysts."

[6] "The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst contains amorphous chromium oxide in both CrV/VI and CrII/III states. Chromium red-ox cycle CrV/VI CrII/III on the catalyst surface triggers DDH process by activation of C2H6 molecule."

[7] "Both selective ODH and DDH are the possible reaction pathways over CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst. In this catalyst, chromium is stabilized mainly as poly-, mononuclear Cr V/VI species that provides the increased activity."

[8] "The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small amount of reducible Cr V/VI."

[9] "Unlike CrOx/CeO2 catalyst, the catalyst supported on CexZr(1-x)O2 contains chromium mainly in a high valence state (Cr V/VI) according to TPR-H2 and Raman results, and no α-Cr2O3 phase is detected. And, in parallel, the activity of CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 catalyst is higher than the one of CrOx/CeO2"

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show the highest ethylene formation rates, while CrOx/CeO2 exhibits the lowest rate. CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 shows intermediate activity.

2. Selectivity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily follows a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) pathway with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. CrOx/ZrO2 favors selective oxidative dehydrogenation. CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 tend to promote non-selective oxidation and/or dry reforming reactions.

3. Stability: CrOx/CeO2 shows the highest stability due to the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 phase. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 experiences rapid deactivation due to coke formation. CrOx/ZrO2 deactivates at high temperatures due to sintering or formation of inactive chromium species.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The pathways depend on the oxidation state of chromium and the support's acid-base and redox properties. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a CrV/VI - CrII/III redox cycle. CrOx/ZrO2 stabilizes Cr as poly- and mononuclear CrV/VI species. CrOx/CeO2 forms α-Cr2O3 phase, while CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 maintains chromium in high valence states.

Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role. A high CO2/C2H6 ratio (≥2) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve ethylene yield.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
1. Balancing activity and stability (e.g., CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is highly active but unstable, while CrOx/CeO2 is stable but less active).
2. Optimizing selectivity while maintaining high activity.
3. Preventing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, sintering, or formation of inactive species.
4. Tailoring the support material to achieve the desired chromium oxidation states and catalyst properties.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions, especially CO2 partial pressure, to enhance ethylene yield without compromising selectivity or stability.

载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理途径：

1. 活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示出最高的乙烯生成速率，而CrOx/CeO2表现出最低的速率。CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2显示中等活性。

2. 选择性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要遵循直接脱氢（DDH）途径，伴随逆水气变换（RWGS）反应。CrOx/ZrO2倾向于选择性氧化脱氢。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2倾向于促进非选择性氧化和/或干重整反应。

3. 稳定性：CrOx/CeO2由于形成非活性α-Cr2O3相而显示出最高的稳定性。CrOx/γ-Al2O3由于焦炭形成而快速失活。CrOx/ZrO2在高温下由于烧结或形成非活性铬物种而失活。

4. 反应机理途径：途径取决于铬的氧化态和载体的酸碱性和氧化还原性质。CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过CrV/VI - CrII/III氧化还原循环运作。CrOx/ZrO2将Cr稳定为多核和单核CrV/VI物种。CrOx/CeO2形成α-Cr2O3相，而CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2将铬保持在高价态。

反应条件，特别是CO2分压，起着至关重要的作用。需要高CO2/C2H6比率（≥2）来移动平衡并提高乙烯产率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡活性和稳定性（例如，CrOx/γ-Al2O3活性高但不稳定，而CrOx/CeO2稳定但活性较低）。
2. 在保持高活性的同时优化选择性。
3. 防止由于焦炭形成、烧结或形成非活性物种而导致的催化剂失活。
4. 定制载体材料以实现所需的铬氧化态和催化剂性能。
5. 优化反应条件，特别是CO2分压，以提高乙烯产率，同时不影响选择性或稳定性。
