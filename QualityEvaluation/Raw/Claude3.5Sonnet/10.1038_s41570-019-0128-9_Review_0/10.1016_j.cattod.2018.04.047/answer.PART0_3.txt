[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "The CrOx/CeO2 catalyst exhibits the lowest rate of C2H4 formation, and, hence, higher stability among all studied catalysts."

[5] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Activity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 showed the highest ethylene formation rates, while CrOx/CeO2 exhibited the lowest.

Selectivity: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 favors direct dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift reaction, while CrOx/ZrO2 promotes selective oxidative dehydrogenation. 

Stability: CrOx/CeO2 demonstrated higher stability compared to other catalysts.

Mechanistic pathways: The reaction pathway depends on both the chromium state and support properties, particularly acid-base and redox properties. The support influences the oxidation state of chromium species.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: More active catalysts like CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 tend to be less stable.

2. Optimizing selectivity: Different supports lead to different reaction pathways, affecting product selectivity.

3. CO2 activation: Supports that can activate CO2 (e.g., ZrO2) improve ODH performance but may also promote side reactions.

4. Coke formation: Acidic supports like γ-Al2O3 promote coke formation, leading to faster deactivation.

5. Chromium state control: The oxidation state of chromium species affects catalyst performance and needs to be optimized.

Reaction conditions, such as CO2 partial pressure, also play a crucial role. Higher CO2/C2H6 ratios (2 or above) are required to shift the equilibrium and improve ethylene yield.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

活性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2显示出最高的乙烯生成速率，而CrOx/CeO2表现出最低的活性。

选择性：CrOx/γ-Al2O3倾向于直接脱氢伴随逆水气变换反应，而CrOx/ZrO2促进选择性氧化脱氢。

稳定性：与其他催化剂相比，CrOx/CeO2表现出更高的稳定性。

机理途径：反应途径取决于铬的状态和支持材料的性质，特别是酸碱性和氧化还原性质。支持材料影响铬物种的氧化态。

关键挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：像CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2这样更活跃的催化剂往往稳定性较差。

2. 优化选择性：不同的支持材料导致不同的反应途径，影响产物选择性。

3. CO2活化：能够活化CO2的支持材料（如ZrO2）改善ODH性能，但也可能促进副反应。

4. 焦炭形成：像γ-Al2O3这样的酸性支持材料促进焦炭形成，导致更快的失活。

5. 铬状态控制：铬物种的氧化态影响催化剂性能，需要进行优化。

反应条件，如CO2分压，也起着至关重要的作用。需要更高的CO2/C2H6比率（2或以上）来移动平衡并提高乙烯产率。
