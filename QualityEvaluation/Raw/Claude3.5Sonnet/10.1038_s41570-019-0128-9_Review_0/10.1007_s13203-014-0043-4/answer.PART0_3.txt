[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Different supports like ZSM-5, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 have been studied for this reaction.

Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher ethane conversion (42%) compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 (32%), but with lower ethylene selectivity (36% vs 46%). This difference in performance is attributed to the varying redox properties of the catalysts on different supports.

The oxidation state of chromium plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, with both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions acting as active sites. The support material influences the distribution and stability of these chromium species.

CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages, including improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime. It helps in controlling the exothermicity of the reaction and acts as a diluent to offer high equilibrium conversion.

Key challenges in optimizing catalyst performance include balancing activity and selectivity, as higher conversion often leads to lower ethylene selectivity. Trade-offs exist between different support materials, with some offering higher activity but lower selectivity and vice versa.

The partial pressure of CO2 likely influences the reaction, but specific details are not provided in the given literature. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of CO2 partial pressure on the reaction mechanism and catalyst performance.

支持材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性有显著影响。不同的支持材料如ZSM-5、Al2O3、SiO2、ZrO2和TiO2已被用于研究这种反应。

Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出更高的乙烷转化率（42%）相比于Cr2O3/Al2O3（32%），但乙烯选择性较低（36%对46%）。这种性能差异归因于不同支持材料上催化剂的氧化还原性质不同。

铬的氧化态在催化活性中起着关键作用，Cr2+和Cr3+离子都作为活性位点。支持材料影响这些铬物种的分布和稳定性。

CO2作为氧化剂提供了几个优势，包括提高乙烯选择性、减少积碳形成和延长催化剂寿命。它有助于控制反应的放热性，并作为稀释剂提供高平衡转化率。

优化催化剂性能的主要挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，因为更高的转化率通常导致较低的乙烯选择性。不同支持材料之间存在权衡，有些提供更高的活性但选择性较低，反之亦然。

CO2的分压可能会影响反应，但给定的文献中没有提供具体细节。需要进一步研究以充分理解CO2分压对反应机理和催化剂性能的影响。
