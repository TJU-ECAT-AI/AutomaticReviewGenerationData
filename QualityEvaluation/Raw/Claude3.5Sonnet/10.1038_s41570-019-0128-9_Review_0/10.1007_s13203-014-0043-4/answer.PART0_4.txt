[1] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %."

[2] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "Cr2O3/Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) shows 36 % ethane and 29 % CO2 conversions. These values are higher than for Cr2O3/Al2O3 but lower than for Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[4] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[5] "The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."

[6] "The conversion of ethane increases with increase in temperature irrespective of the oxidizing agent used in the reaction."

[7] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

The support materials significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among the studied supports, ZrO2 provides the highest activity but lower ethylene selectivity, while Al2O3 offers better selectivity at the cost of lower activity. The mixed oxide support Al2O3-ZrO2 (1:1) shows a balance between activity and selectivity, with higher performance than Al2O3 but lower than ZrO2.

The redox properties of the catalysts, influenced by the support, play a crucial role in determining their activity. Both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions act as active sites in the catalytic reaction. The basicity of the support also affects activity, with the higher basicity of Al2O3 contributing to decreased activity compared to ZrO2.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature and choice of oxidant, significantly impact catalyst performance. Higher temperatures generally increase ethane conversion regardless of the oxidant used. CO2 as an oxidant provides higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2, likely due to its milder oxidizing nature which reduces secondary oxidation of ethylene.

Key challenges in optimizing overall performance include balancing activity and selectivity, as higher activity often comes at the cost of lower selectivity. The trade-off between ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity is particularly evident when comparing different supports and oxidants. Another challenge is preventing secondary oxidation of ethylene, especially when using O2 as the oxidant.

While the document doesn't directly address the influence of CO2 partial pressure, it's likely that this parameter would affect both ethane conversion and CO2 activation, potentially impacting overall catalyst performance and reaction pathways.

To further optimize these catalysts, research could focus on developing supports or promoters that can maintain high activity while minimizing secondary oxidation of ethylene, especially when using O2 as an oxidant. Additionally, investigating the role of CO2 partial pressure and its impact on reaction mechanisms could provide insights for improving catalyst design and reaction conditions.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能。在研究的支持材料中，ZrO2提供了最高的活性但乙烯选择性较低，而Al2O3提供了更好的选择性但活性较低。混合氧化物支持Al2O3-ZrO2（1:1）在活性和选择性之间显示了平衡，其性能高于Al2O3但低于ZrO2。

催化剂的氧化还原性质，受支持材料影响，在决定其活性方面起着关键作用。Cr2+和Cr3+离子都作为催化反应的活性位点。支持材料的碱性也影响活性，Al2O3的较高碱性导致活性比ZrO2低。

反应条件，特别是温度和氧化剂的选择，显著影响催化剂性能。无论使用何种氧化剂，较高的温度通常会增加乙烷转化率。CO2作为氧化剂提供了较高的乙烯选择性，这可能是由于其较温和的氧化性质减少了乙烯的二次氧化。

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，因为较高的活性往往以较低的选择性为代价。乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间的权衡在比较不同支持材料和氧化剂时尤为明显。另一个挑战是防止乙烯的二次氧化，特别是在使用O2作为氧化剂时。

虽然文档没有直接讨论CO2分压的影响，但这个参数可能会影响乙烷转化和CO2活化，从而潜在地影响催化剂的整体性能和反应途径。

为进一步优化这些催化剂，研究可以集中在开发能够保持高活性同时最小化乙烯二次氧化的支持材料或促进剂上，特别是在使用O2作为氧化剂时。此外，研究CO2分压的作用及其对反应机理的影响可能为改进催化剂设计和反应条件提供见解。
