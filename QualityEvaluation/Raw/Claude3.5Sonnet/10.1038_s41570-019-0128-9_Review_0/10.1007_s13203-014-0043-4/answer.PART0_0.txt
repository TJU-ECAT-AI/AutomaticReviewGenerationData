[1] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

Various support materials influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Different supports like ZSM-5, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 have been studied for Cr2O3 catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 shows good selectivity but lower activity, while Cr2O3/ZrO2 exhibits higher activity but lower selectivity. 

3. The redox properties of the catalysts, influenced by the support, affect their activity. Both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions play important roles as active sites.

4. CO2 as an oxidant provides higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2, likely due to less secondary oxidation of the product.

Key challenges include optimizing the trade-off between activity and selectivity. The choice of support material significantly impacts catalyst performance by affecting the redox properties and oxidation states of chromium species. Further research is needed to design catalysts that can achieve both high activity and selectivity, possibly through the use of promoters or mixed oxide supports.

各种载体材料对CO2氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的性能有影响：

1. 已经研究了ZSM-5、Al2O3、SiO2、ZrO2和TiO2等不同载体用于Cr2O3催化剂在乙烷与CO2脱氢反应中的应用。

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3表现出良好的选择性但活性较低，而Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出较高的活性但选择性较低。

3. 催化剂的氧化还原性质受载体影响，进而影响其活性。Cr2+和Cr3+离子都作为活性位点发挥重要作用。

4. 与O2相比，CO2作为氧化剂提供了更高的乙烯选择性，这可能是由于产物的二次氧化较少。

主要挑战包括优化活性和选择性之间的权衡。载体材料的选择通过影响铬物种的氧化还原性质和氧化态，显著影响催化剂性能。需要进一步研究设计既能实现高活性又能实现高选择性的催化剂，可能通过使用助剂或混合氧化物载体来实现。
