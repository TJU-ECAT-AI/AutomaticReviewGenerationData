[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "Wang et al. [21] have also reported that as Cr2O3/ZrO2 has the strong ability to give oxygen species and hence offers the highest activity and lowest ethylene selectivity compared to the other two catalysts."

[5] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."

The literature discusses the influence of various support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Different supports like ZSM-5, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 have been studied. The support material significantly affects catalyst performance, with Cr2O3/ZrO2 showing higher activity but lower ethylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3.

The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by their redox properties and the oxidation states of chromium. Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions play important roles as active sites. Cr2O3/ZrO2 has a strong ability to provide oxygen species, leading to high activity but low ethylene selectivity.

Using CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages, including improved ethylene selectivity, reduced coke formation, and longer catalyst lifetime. It helps contain the reaction exothermicity and acts as a diluent to offer high equilibrium conversion.

Key challenges in optimizing catalyst performance include balancing activity and selectivity, as higher activity often comes at the cost of lower ethylene selectivity. The trade-off between ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity is evident in the comparison of Cr2O3/ZrO2 and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. 

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand these aspects and to develop catalysts that can overcome the activity-selectivity trade-off.

文献讨论了各种载体材料和反应条件对乙烷CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响。研究了不同的载体，如ZSM-5、Al2O3、SiO2、ZrO2和TiO2。载体材料显著影响催化剂性能，与Cr2O3/Al2O3相比，Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出更高的活性但乙烯选择性较低。

这些催化剂的活性和选择性受其氧化还原性质和铬的氧化态的影响。Cr2+和Cr3+离子作为活性位点发挥重要作用。Cr2O3/ZrO2具有提供氧物种的强大能力，导致高活性但低乙烯选择性。

使用CO2作为氧化剂具有多项优势，包括提高乙烯选择性、减少积碳形成和延长催化剂寿命。它有助于控制反应放热性，并作为稀释剂提供高平衡转化率。

优化催化剂性能的主要挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，因为较高的活性通常以较低的乙烯选择性为代价。在Cr2O3/ZrO2和Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的比较中，乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性之间的权衡很明显。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或详细反应机理途径的具体信息。需要进一步研究以全面了解这些方面，并开发能够克服活性-选择性权衡的催化剂。
