          [1] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

[5] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."

[6] "The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."

[7] "The conversion of ethane increases with increase in temperature irrespective of the oxidizing agent used in the reaction."

          Various support materials (such as ZSM-5, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2) significantly influence the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

1. Activity and Selectivity:
   - Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42% ethane conversion) but lower ethylene selectivity (36%).
   - Cr2O3/Al2O3 exhibits lower activity (32% ethane conversion) but higher ethylene selectivity (46%).
   - Mixed oxide supports like Al2O3-ZrO2 offer a balance between activity and selectivity.

2. Redox Properties:
   - The variation in catalytic activity is attributed to differences in redox properties of the catalysts.
   - Both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions play crucial roles as active sites in the catalytic reaction.

3. Support Basicity:
   - The higher basicity of Al2O3 compared to ZrO2 may contribute to decreased activity.

4. Reaction Conditions:
   - Temperature: Ethane conversion increases with temperature, regardless of the oxidizing agent.
   - CO2 as an oxidant:
     a) Offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2.
     b) Acts as a mild oxidant, containing reaction exothermicity.
     c) Serves as a diluent, offering high equilibrium conversion.
     d) Improves ethylene selectivity and reduces coke formation.
     e) Maintains longer catalyst lifetime.

Key challenges and trade-offs:
1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Higher activity often corresponds to lower ethylene selectivity.
2. Optimizing support material: Different supports offer varying combinations of activity and selectivity.
3. Controlling reaction conditions: Temperature and oxidant choice significantly impact performance.
4. Preventing secondary oxidation: Especially important when using O2 as an oxidant.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand these aspects and to develop catalysts that can overcome the activity-selectivity trade-off.

          各种支持材料（如ZSM-5、Al2O3、SiO2、ZrO2和TiO2）显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

1. 活性和选择性：
   - Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出更高的活性（42%乙烷转化率）但乙烯选择性较低（36%）。
   - Cr2O3/Al2O3表现出较低的活性（32%乙烷转化率）但乙烯选择性较高（46%）。
   - 混合氧化物支持材料如Al2O3-ZrO2在活性和选择性之间提供了平衡。

2. 氧化还原性质：
   - 催化活性的变化归因于催化剂氧化还原性质的差异。
   - Cr2+和Cr3+离子都在催化反应中作为活性位点发挥关键作用。

3. 支持材料碱性：
   - Al2O3相比ZrO2的较高碱性可能导致活性降低。

4. 反应条件：
   - 温度：无论使用何种氧化剂，乙烷转化率随温度升高而增加。
   - CO2作为氧化剂：
     a) 与O2相比提供更高的乙烯选择性。
     b) 作为温和的氧化剂，控制反应放热性。
     c) 作为稀释剂，提供高平衡转化率。
     d) 提高乙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。
     e) 维持更长的催化剂寿命。

主要挑战和权衡：
1. 平衡活性和选择性：较高的活性通常对应较低的乙烯选择性。
2. 优化支持材料：不同的支持材料提供不同的活性和选择性组合。
3. 控制反应条件：温度和氧化剂的选择显著影响性能。
4. 防止二次氧化：特别是在使用O2作为氧化剂时很重要。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或详细反应机理途径的具体信息。需要进一步研究以全面理解这些方面，并开发能够克服活性-选择性权衡的催化剂。
