[1] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %."

[3] "Cr2O3/Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) shows 36 % ethane and 29 % CO2 conversions. These values are higher than for Cr2O3/Al2O3 but lower than for Cr2O3/ZrO2."

[4] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[5] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

ZrO2 support provides higher activity but lower ethylene selectivity compared to Al2O3 support. The mixed oxide Al2O3-ZrO2 support offers a balance between activity and selectivity, with performance intermediate between pure Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports.

The redox properties of the catalysts, which vary depending on the support, play a crucial role in determining their activity. Both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions act as active sites in the catalytic reaction.

Using CO2 as an oxidant leads to higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. This is likely due to the milder oxidizing nature of CO2, which reduces secondary oxidation of the produced ethylene.

Key challenges include balancing activity and selectivity, as higher activity often corresponds to lower ethylene selectivity. Optimizing the oxidation state of chromium species on the catalyst surface is also crucial for performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or the performance of SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, and CeO2 supports. More research is needed to fully understand the impact of these factors and supports on catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

支撑材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性有显著影响。

ZrO2支撑提供更高的活性但乙烯选择性较低，而Al2O3支撑则相反。混合氧化物Al2O3-ZrO2支撑在活性和选择性之间提供了平衡，其性能介于纯Al2O3和ZrO2支撑之间。

催化剂的氧化还原性质（因支撑材料而异）在决定其活性方面起关键作用。Cr2+和Cr3+离子都作为催化反应中的活性位点。

使用CO2作为氧化剂比使用O2能获得更高的乙烯选择性。这可能是由于CO2的氧化性较温和，减少了产生的乙烯的二次氧化。

主要挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，因为较高的活性通常对应较低的乙烯选择性。优化催化剂表面铬物种的氧化态对性能也至关重要。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5和CeO2支撑性能的具体信息。需要进行更多研究以充分了解这些因素和支撑材料对CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的影响。
