[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Cr2O3-based catalysts generally show superior activity compared to Ga2O3-based catalysts for ODHE using CO2.

SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts demonstrate relatively high and stable performance, with ethane conversion around 50% and ethene selectivity >90%. This outperforms other supports like Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2.

The high activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 is attributed to its redox properties and acidity/basicity characteristics. 

Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters to Cr2O3/SiO2 has led to some improvements in catalytic activity.

Key challenges and trade-offs appear to be:
1. Balancing activity and stability, as some catalysts show high initial activity but decline over time.
2. Optimizing support acidity/basicity to enhance performance without promoting undesired side reactions.
3. Tuning redox properties for high activity while maintaining selectivity.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how reaction conditions like CO2 partial pressure affect performance or on mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

文献为我们提供了一些关于不同支撑材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

与Ga2O3基催化剂相比，Cr2O3基催化剂在使用CO2进行ODHE反应时通常表现出更优越的活性。

SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现出相对较高且稳定的性能，乙烷转化率约为50%，乙烯选择性>90%。这优于其他支撑材料如Al2O3、TiO2和ZrO2。

Cr2O3/SiO2的高活性归因于其氧化还原性质和酸碱特性。

向Cr2O3/SiO2中添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂已导致催化活性的一些改进。

主要挑战和权衡似乎是：
1. 平衡活性和稳定性，因为一些催化剂表现出较高的初始活性但随时间下降。
2. 优化支撑材料的酸碱度以提高性能，同时避免促进不期望的副反应。
3. 调节氧化还原性质以获得高活性，同时保持选择性。

文献没有提供关于反应条件（如CO2分压）如何影响性能或反应机理途径的详细信息。需要更多研究来全面解答这些问题。
