[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. SiO2 support: Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 showed superior performance compared to other supports, with relatively high and stable ethane conversion (around 50%) and ethene selectivity (>90%). The high activity was attributed to the redox properties and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 system.

2. Other supports (Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2): These supports were mentioned as being less effective than SiO2 for Cr2O3 catalysts in the ODHE reaction.

3. Mixed oxide supports: Addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters to Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts led to some improvement in activity.

The literature does not provide specific information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, or CeO2 supports for chromium oxide catalysts in this reaction. It also does not discuss the influence of CO2 partial pressure or other reaction conditions on the performance of these catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs mentioned include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: While Cr2O3-based catalysts showed higher activity than Ga2O3-based ones, the need to maintain high selectivity is also emphasized.

2. Stability: The gradual decrease in activity (primarily ethane conversion) over time for some catalysts (e.g., Ga2O3-based) highlights the importance of developing stable catalysts.

3. Support selection: The choice of support material significantly impacts catalyst performance, with SiO2 being identified as particularly effective for Cr2O3 catalysts.

To fully optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, further research would be needed to understand the impact of various supports, promoters, and reaction conditions on activity, selectivity, and stability.

该文献提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中性能的见解：

1. SiO2载体：与其他载体相比，负载在SiO2上的Cr2O3表现出优异的性能，乙烷转化率相对较高且稳定（约50%），乙烯选择性也较高（>90%）。这种高活性归因于Cr2O3/SiO2体系的氧化还原性质和酸碱性。

2. 其他载体（Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2）：文献提到这些载体对于Cr2O3催化剂在ODHE反应中的效果不如SiO2。

3. 混合氧化物载体：向Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中添加酸性和碱性氧化物助剂可以在一定程度上提高活性。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5或CeO2载体用于该反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的具体信息。它也没有讨论CO2分压或其他反应条件对这些催化剂性能的影响。

提到的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：虽然Cr2O3基催化剂显示出比Ga2O3基催化剂更高的活性，但保持高选择性的需求也被强调。

2. 稳定性：一些催化剂（如Ga2O3基）活性随时间逐渐下降（主要是乙烷转化率），突出了开发稳定催化剂的重要性。

3. 载体选择：载体材料的选择对催化剂性能有显著影响，SiO2被确定为特别适合Cr2O3催化剂的载体。

为了全面优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能，还需要进一步研究各种载体、助剂和反应条件对活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。
