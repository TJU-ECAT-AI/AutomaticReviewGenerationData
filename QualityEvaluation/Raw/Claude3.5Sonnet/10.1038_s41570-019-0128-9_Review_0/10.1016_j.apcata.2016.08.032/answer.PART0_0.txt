[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 shows superior performance compared to other supports like Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. It achieves relatively high and stable ethane conversion (around 50%) and ethene selectivity (>90%).

2. The high activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 is attributed to its redox properties and acidity/basicity characteristics.

3. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters to Cr2O3/SiO2 has led to some improvements in activity.

4. Ga2O3-based catalysts show lower initial ethane conversion (20-30%) and ethene selectivity (80-90%) compared to Cr2O3-based catalysts, and their performance gradually decreases over time.

The literature does not provide specific information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5 or CeO2 supports, or detailed insights into reaction conditions such as CO2 partial pressure. It also does not discuss mechanistic pathways or key challenges in optimizing overall performance. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

文献为我们提供了一些关于不同支撑材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

1. SiO2支撑的Cr2O3相比其他支撑材料（如Al2O3、TiO2和ZrO2）表现出更优异的性能。它能实现较高且稳定的乙烷转化率（约50%）和乙烯选择性（>90%）。

2. Cr2O3/SiO2的高活性归因于其氧化还原性质和酸碱特性。

3. 向Cr2O3/SiO2中添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂已导致活性的一些改善。

4. 与Cr2O3基催化剂相比，Ga2O3基催化剂显示出较低的初始乙烷转化率（20-30%）和乙烯选择性（80-90%），并且它们的性能随时间逐渐下降。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5或CeO2支撑材料的具体信息，也没有详细介绍反应条件（如CO2分压）的影响。它也没有讨论反应机理途径或优化整体性能的关键挑战。需要进行更全面的研究才能充分解答这些问题的方方面面。
