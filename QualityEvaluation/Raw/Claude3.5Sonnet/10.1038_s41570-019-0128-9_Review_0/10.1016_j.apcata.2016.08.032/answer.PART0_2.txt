[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "By tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, to some extent, the coke deposition has been minimized [15], however, the necessity of catalyst regeneration seemed to be inevitable."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]. The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2."

[4] "Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material impact: SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed superior performance compared to other supports like Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. It achieved higher and more stable ethane conversion (around 50%) and ethene selectivity (>90%).

2. Mechanism: The high activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 was attributed to its redox properties and acidity/basicity characteristics.

3. Promoters: Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters to Cr2O3/SiO2 further improved its catalytic activity.

4. Challenges: Coke deposition is a key challenge, requiring catalyst regeneration. Tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst helped minimize coke deposition to some extent, but did not completely eliminate the need for regeneration.

5. Comparison with other catalysts: Cr2O3-based catalysts showed superior activity compared to Ga2O3-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed comparisons with supports like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, or CeO2 for chromium oxide catalysts. More research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question, including the impact of various reaction conditions and mechanistic pathways.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

1. 载体材料的影响：与其他载体（如Al2O3、TiO2和ZrO2）相比，SiO2负载的Cr2O3表现出更优异的性能。它实现了更高且更稳定的乙烷转化率（约50%）和乙烯选择性（>90%）。

2. 机理：Cr2O3/SiO2的高活性归因于其氧化还原性质和酸碱性特征。

3. 助剂：向Cr2O3/SiO2中添加酸性和碱性氧化物助剂进一步提高了其催化活性。

4. 挑战：结焦是一个关键挑战，需要催化剂再生。调节催化剂的酸碱度在一定程度上有助于减少结焦，但并未完全消除再生的需求。

5. 与其他催化剂的比较：在二氧化碳辅助的乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）反应中，Cr2O3基催化剂比Ga2O3基催化剂表现出更优异的活性。

文献没有提供关于二氧化碳分压的影响或与MCM-41、H-ZSM-5或CeO2等载体对氧化铬催化剂的详细比较。需要进行更多研究以全面解答问题的所有方面，包括各种反应条件的影响和机理途径。
