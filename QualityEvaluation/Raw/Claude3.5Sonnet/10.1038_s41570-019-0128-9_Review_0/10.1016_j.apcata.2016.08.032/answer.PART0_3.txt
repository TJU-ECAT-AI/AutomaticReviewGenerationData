[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Cr2O3-based catalysts show superior activity compared to Ga2O3-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

2. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts demonstrate higher performance compared to other supports like Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. They achieve relatively high and stable ethane conversion (around 50%) and ethene selectivity (>90%).

3. The high activity of SiO2-supported Cr2O3 is attributed to its redox properties and acidity/basicity characteristics.

4. Adding acidic and basic oxide promoters to Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts has shown some improvement in activity.

5. In contrast, Ga2O3-based catalysts show lower initial ethane conversion (20-30%) and ethene selectivity (80-90%), which decrease over time.

The literature does not provide specific information on other supports like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, or CeO2, nor does it discuss the influence of CO2 partial pressure or other reaction conditions in detail. The key challenges appear to be maintaining high activity and selectivity while ensuring catalyst stability over time. The trade-off between these factors seems to depend significantly on the choice of support material and potential promoters.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 与Ga2O3基催化剂相比，Cr2O3基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）反应中表现出更优越的活性。

2. 与其他载体（如Al2O3、TiO2和ZrO2）相比，SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现出更高的性能。它们能够实现较高且稳定的乙烷转化率（约50%）和乙烯选择性（>90%）。

3. SiO2负载的Cr2O3的高活性归因于其氧化还原性质和酸碱特性。

4. 向Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中添加酸性和碱性氧化物促进剂已显示出一些活性改善。

5. 相比之下，Ga2O3基催化剂显示出较低的初始乙烷转化率（20-30%）和乙烯选择性（80-90%），并且这些性能会随时间下降。

该文献未提供关于其他载体（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5或CeO2）的具体信息，也未详细讨论二氧化碳分压或其他反应条件的影响。主要挑战似乎是在保持高活性和选择性的同时确保催化剂长期稳定性。这些因素之间的权衡似乎很大程度上取决于载体材料的选择和潜在的促进剂。
