[1] "Wang et al. studied Cr2O3 supported on various supports for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 and found the following order of activity (Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2)."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. studied the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/TiO2 catalysts. They concluded that the positive effect of CO2 on the rate of dehydrogenation is due to its ability to reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst and to assist in the rapid desorption of the product from the surface."

[3] "Ohishi et al. and Takehira et al. studied Cr-MCM-41 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propylene. They studied the Cr species on the MCM-41 mesoporous silica and concluded that a redox process involving carbon dioxide forming Cr6+ species is involved in the dehydrogenation."

[4] "In our previous work, we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."

[5] "The CO2 co-feed gas was more effective than argon for accelerating the dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity due to the activity of CO2 to suppress coke formation or remove coke from the catalyst."

The support material and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material effects:
- Activity order: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2
- High-silica H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 > 190) exhibits high performance
- MCM-41 mesoporous silica supports a redox process involving CO2 and Cr6+ species

2. CO2 effects:
- Reduces carbon deposition on the catalyst
- Assists in rapid product desorption
- Accelerates dehydrogenation and maintains catalytic activity
- More effective than inert gases (e.g., argon)
- Participates in a redox process, forming Cr6+ species

3. Key challenges and trade-offs:
- Balancing support acidity and Cr oxidation state
- Optimizing CO2 partial pressure to maximize its positive effects
- Maintaining catalyst stability while promoting the redox cycle
- Achieving high selectivity while increasing conversion

To optimize overall performance, researchers must consider the interplay between support material properties, Cr oxidation states, and CO2 partial pressure. The main challenge lies in finding the right balance between activity, selectivity, and stability by fine-tuning these parameters.
