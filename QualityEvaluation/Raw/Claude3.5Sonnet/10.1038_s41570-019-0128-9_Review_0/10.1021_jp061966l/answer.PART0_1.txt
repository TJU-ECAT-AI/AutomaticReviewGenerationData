[1] "Wang et al. studied Cr2O3 supported on various supports for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 and found the following order of activity (Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2)."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. studied the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/TiO2 catalysts. They concluded that the positive effect of CO2 on the rate of dehydrogenation is due to its ability to reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst and to assist in the rapid desorption of the product from the surface."

[3] "Ohishi et al. and Takehira et al. studied Cr-MCM-41 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propylene. They studied the Cr species on the MCM-41 mesoporous silica and concluded that a redox process involving carbon dioxide forming Cr6+ species is involved in the dehydrogenation."

[4] "In our previous work, we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."

[5] "The CO2 co-feed gas was more effective than argon for accelerating the dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity due to the activity of CO2 to suppress coke formation or remove coke from the catalyst."

The influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions varies significantly:

1. Support material impact:
- Activity order: SiO2 > ZrO2 > Al2O3 > TiO2 for Cr2O3-supported catalysts
- High-silica H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 > 190) showed high performance
- MCM-41 mesoporous silica supports facilitated a redox process involving CO2 and Cr6+ species

2. CO2 partial pressure effects:
- CO2 reduces carbon deposition on catalysts
- Assists in rapid product desorption from catalyst surface
- More effective than inert gases (e.g., argon) for accelerating dehydrogenation and maintaining activity

3. Mechanistic pathways:
- A redox cycle involving Cr6+ (or possibly Cr5+) and Cr3+ species occurs during dehydrogenation
- CO2 reoxidizes reduced Cr species, regenerating the active sites

Key challenges and trade-offs:
- Balancing catalyst activity with stability
- Optimizing support material properties to enhance Cr species dispersion and redox behavior
- Controlling carbon deposition while maintaining high conversion rates
- Fine-tuning CO2 partial pressure to maximize its beneficial effects without inhibiting the main reaction

To optimize overall performance, researchers must consider the interplay between support material properties, Cr species oxidation state, CO2 partial pressure, and reaction conditions to achieve the best balance of activity, selectivity, and stability.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的支撑材料和反应条件的影响差异显著：

1. 支撑材料的影响：
- 活性顺序：对于Cr2O3负载催化剂，SiO2 > ZrO2 > Al2O3 > TiO2
- 高硅H-ZSM-5（SiO2/Al2O3 > 190）表现出高性能
- MCM-41介孔二氧化硅支撑有利于涉及CO2和Cr6+物种的氧化还原过程

2. CO2分压效应：
- CO2减少催化剂上的碳沉积
- 助于产物从催化剂表面快速脱附
- 比惰性气体（如氩气）更有效地加速脱氢反应并维持活性

3. 机理途径：
- 脱氢过程中涉及Cr6+（或可能是Cr5+）和Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环
- CO2使还原的Cr物种重新氧化，再生活性位点

主要挑战和权衡：
- 平衡催化剂活性和稳定性
- 优化支撑材料性质以增强Cr物种分散和氧化还原行为
- 控制碳沉积的同时保持高转化率
- 精细调节CO2分压以最大化其有益效果，同时不抑制主要反应

为了优化整体性能，研究人员必须考虑支撑材料性质、Cr物种氧化态、CO2分压和反应条件之间的相互作用，以达到活性、选择性和稳定性的最佳平衡。
