[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction. Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[2] "5%Cr/TS-1 showed a consistent conversion of CO2. Interestingly, selectivity to CO significantly exceeded 100%. This could happen probably due to some deep oxidation of hydrocarbons (ethane, ethene) to CO resulting in an apparent selectivity to CO higher than 100%."

[3] "The role of CO2 is to generate oxygen species that take part in the formation of ethene as well as to suppress carbon deposition. The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

The literature provides some insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, but does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question.

Chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5, show the best performance among the catalysts studied. However, their reaction temperature is limited to about 650°C, as selectivity decreases significantly at higher temperatures.

The CO2 partial pressure plays a crucial role in the reaction. Increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5 improves selectivity to ethene from 78% to over 97%. Further increases in CO2 concentration do not significantly affect the reaction.

5%Cr/TS-1 showed consistent CO2 conversion, but with an unusually high selectivity to CO (exceeding 100%), possibly due to deep oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The main challenges appear to be balancing activity and selectivity, as well as managing the reaction temperature to prevent decreased selectivity at higher temperatures. The trade-off between high activity and maintaining selectivity is a key issue in optimizing overall performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of other support materials like MCM-41, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, nor does it discuss in detail the mechanistic pathways or stability of these catalysts. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

文献对支撑材料和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的表现提供了一些见解，但并未全面回答问题的所有方面。

在研究的催化剂中，铬基催化剂，特别是那些以TS-1或H-ZSM-5为载体的催化剂，表现最佳。然而，它们的反应温度被限制在约650°C，因为在更高温度下选择性会显著降低。

CO2分压在反应中起着至关重要的作用。将CO2/C2H6比率增加到1.5可以将乙烯的选择性从78%提高到97%以上。进一步增加CO2浓度对反应没有显著影响。

5%Cr/TS-1显示出稳定的CO2转化，但CO的选择性异常高（超过100%），可能是由于碳氢化合物的深度氧化造成的。

主要挑战似乎是平衡活性和选择性，以及管理反应温度以防止在高温下选择性降低。在优化整体性能时，高活性和保持选择性之间的权衡是一个关键问题。

文献没有提供关于其他载体材料如MCM-41、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2影响的具体信息，也没有详细讨论这些催化剂的机理途径或稳定性。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些问题的方面。
