[1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, though it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including SiO2, H-ZSM-5, TS-1, TiO2, and CeO2. Chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5, have shown the best performance among the studied catalysts.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5 led to improved selectivity to ethene, from 78% without CO2 to >97% with CO2. Further increases in CO2 concentration did not significantly affect the performance.

3. Temperature: Chromium-based catalysts supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5 show optimal performance at temperatures up to about 650°C. At higher temperatures, selectivity decreases significantly.

4. Activity and selectivity: Chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures compared to stronger oxidants, as it is less prone to supply oxygen species for undesired side reactions.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity, as higher temperatures increase activity but may decrease selectivity.
- Optimizing the CO2/C2H6 ratio to achieve high selectivity without unnecessarily diluting the reactants.
- Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity at higher temperatures to improve overall performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on stability or detailed mechanistic pathways for chromium oxide catalysts on different supports. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the overall performance of these catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

文献为我们提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件对二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷的铬氧化物催化剂的影响的见解，尽管它并未全面地涵盖问题的所有方面：

1. 支撑材料：研究了各种支撑材料，包括SiO2、H-ZSM-5、TS-1、TiO2和CeO2。在研究的催化剂中，铬基催化剂，特别是那些以TS-1或H-ZSM-5为载体的催化剂，表现最佳。

2. CO2分压：将CO2/C2H6比率提高到1.5会导致乙烯选择性提高，从没有CO2时的78%提高到有CO2时的>97%。进一步增加CO2浓度对性能没有显著影响。

3. 温度：以TS-1或H-ZSM-5为载体的铬基催化剂在650°C左右的温度下表现最佳。在更高的温度下，选择性显著降低。

4. 活性和选择性：铬基催化剂已被证明是这种反应中活性最高的。与强氧化剂相比，使用CO2作为氧化剂可以在较高温度下获得更高的选择性，因为它不太容易提供氧物种进行不期望的副反应。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性，因为更高的温度会增加活性但可能降低选择性。
- 优化CO2/C2H6比率，以实现高选择性，同时不会不必要地稀释反应物。
- 开发在更高温度下保持高选择性的催化剂，以提高整体性能。

文献没有提供关于不同载体上铬氧化物催化剂的稳定性或详细反应机理途径的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能充分解决这些方面的问题，并优化这些催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷反应中的整体性能。
