[1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The role of CO2 is to generate oxygen species that take part in the formation of ethene as well as to suppress carbon deposition. The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, though it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question:

1. Support materials: The text mentions several support materials used for chromium oxide catalysts, including SiO2, H-ZSM-5, and TS-1. Chromium-based catalysts are reported to be the most active for this reaction.

2. Activity and selectivity: Chromium catalysts supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5 show the best performance. However, their reaction temperature is limited to about 650°C, as selectivity decreases significantly at higher temperatures.

3. CO2 partial pressure: The ratio of CO2 to C2H6 influences both conversion and selectivity. Increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5 improved selectivity from 78% to >97%. Further increases in CO2 did not show significant effects.

4. Mechanistic pathways: CO2 generates oxygen species that participate in ethene formation and suppress carbon deposition. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction compared to stronger oxidants.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity, as higher temperatures increase conversion but may decrease selectivity.
- Optimizing the CO2/C2H6 ratio to maximize selectivity without unnecessarily diluting the reactants.
- Developing catalysts and supports that can maintain high selectivity at higher temperatures to improve overall yields.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of other mentioned supports (MCM-41, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) or on long-term stability of the catalysts.

该文献提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件对乙烷CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的见解，尽管它并未全面回答问题的所有方面：

1. 支撑材料：文中提到了几种用于铬氧化物催化剂的支撑材料，包括SiO2、H-ZSM-5和TS-1。据报道，铬基催化剂对这种反应最为活跃。

2. 活性和选择性：负载在TS-1或H-ZSM-5上的铬催化剂表现最佳。然而，它们的反应温度限制在约650°C，因为在更高温度下选择性显著降低。

3. CO2分压：CO2与C2H6的比例影响转化率和选择性。将CO2/C2H6比例增加到1.5可以将选择性从78%提高到>97%。进一步增加CO2并未显示显著效果。

4. 机理途径：CO2产生参与乙烯形成的氧物种，并抑制积碳。使用CO2作为氧化剂可以在较高温度下获得更高的选择性，因为与强氧化剂相比，它不太容易提供氧物种进行反应。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性，因为更高的温度会增加转化率但可能降低选择性。
- 优化CO2/C2H6比例，以最大化选择性而不会不必要地稀释反应物。
- 开发能在更高温度下保持高选择性的催化剂和支撑材料，以提高整体产率。

文献没有提供关于其他提到的支撑材料（MCM-41、Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2）的影响或催化剂长期稳定性的具体信息。
