          [1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

[5] "The role of CO2 is to generate oxygen species that take part in the formation of ethene as well as to suppress carbon deposition."

[6] "5%Cr/TS-1 showed a consistent conversion of CO2. Interestingly, selectivity to CO significantly exceeded 100%. This could happen probably due to some deep oxidation of hydrocarbons (ethane, ethene) to CO resulting in an apparent selectivity to CO higher than 100%."

          The literature provides insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including SiO2, H-ZSM-5, TS-1, TiO2, and CeO2. Chromium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5, have shown the best performance among the studied catalysts.

2. Activity and selectivity: Chromium-based catalysts are the most active for this reaction. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures compared to stronger oxidants, as it is less prone to supply oxygen species for undesired side reactions.

3. Temperature: Chromium-based catalysts supported on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5 show optimal performance at temperatures up to about 650°C. At higher temperatures, selectivity decreases significantly.

4. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5 led to improved selectivity to ethene, from 78% without CO2 to >97% with CO2. Further increases in CO2 concentration did not significantly affect the performance.

5. Mechanistic pathways: CO2 generates oxygen species that participate in ethene formation and suppress carbon deposition. For Cr-based catalysts, ethene formation occurs through the reduction of Cr(VI) species, while CO2 dissociates to re-oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity, as higher temperatures increase activity but may decrease selectivity.
- Optimizing the CO2/C2H6 ratio to achieve high selectivity without unnecessarily diluting the reactants.
- Managing deep oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO, which can affect the apparent selectivity.
- Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity at higher temperatures to improve overall performance.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on all the support materials mentioned in the question (e.g., MCM-41, Al2O3, ZrO2) or detailed analysis of catalyst stability. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the overall performance of these catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

          文献为我们提供了关于支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 支撑材料：研究了各种支撑材料，包括SiO2、H-ZSM-5、TS-1、TiO2和CeO2。在研究的催化剂中，铬基催化剂，特别是那些以TS-1或H-ZSM-5为载体的催化剂，表现最佳。

2. 活性和选择性：铬基催化剂是该反应中活性最高的。与强氧化剂相比，使用CO2作为氧化剂可以在较高温度下获得更高的选择性，因为它不太容易提供氧物种进行不期望的副反应。

3. 温度：以TS-1或H-ZSM-5为载体的铬基催化剂在650°C左右的温度下表现最佳。在更高的温度下，选择性显著降低。

4. CO2分压：将CO2/C2H6比率提高到1.5会导致乙烯选择性提高，从没有CO2时的78%提高到有CO2时的>97%。进一步增加CO2浓度对性能没有显著影响。

5. 机理途径：CO2产生参与乙烯形成并抑制碳沉积的氧物种。对于基于Cr的催化剂，乙烯的形成是通过Cr(VI)物种的还原实现的，而CO2解离以将Cr(III)重新氧化为Cr(VI)。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性，因为更高的温度会增加活性但可能降低选择性。
- 优化CO2/C2H6比率，以实现高选择性，同时不会不必要地稀释反应物。
- 管理碳氢化合物深度氧化生成CO的现象，这可能会影响表观选择性。
- 开发在更高温度下保持高选择性的催化剂，以提高整体性能。

文献没有提供问题中提到的所有支撑材料（如MCM-41、Al2O3、ZrO2）的综合信息，也没有详细分析催化剂的稳定性。需要进行更多研究才能充分解决这些方面的问题，并优化这些催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷反应中的整体性能。
