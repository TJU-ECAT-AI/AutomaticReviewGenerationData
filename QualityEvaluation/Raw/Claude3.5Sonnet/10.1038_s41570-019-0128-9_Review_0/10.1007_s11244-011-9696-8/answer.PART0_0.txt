[1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

The literature provides some insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including SiO2, H-ZSM-5, and TS-1. Chromium-based catalysts have shown the highest activity among those tested. Specifically, Cr/TS-1 and Cr/H-ZSM-5 demonstrated the best performance.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5 led to improved selectivity to ethene, from 78% without CO2 to >97% at the optimal ratio. Further increases in CO2 did not significantly affect performance.

3. Temperature: Chromium-based catalysts on TS-1 or H-ZSM-5 showed optimal performance at temperatures up to 650°C. Above this temperature, selectivity decreased significantly.

4. Activity and selectivity trade-off: CO2 as an oxidant can lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures compared to stronger oxidants, as it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: More active catalysts often show lower selectivity.

2. Temperature optimization: Higher temperatures increase conversion but may decrease selectivity.

3. CO2 partial pressure optimization: Finding the ideal CO2/C2H6 ratio to maximize selectivity without negatively impacting conversion.

4. Support material selection: Different supports affect catalyst performance, requiring careful optimization.

5. Stability: The literature does not provide specific information on catalyst stability, which is likely another important factor to consider in optimizing overall performance.

该文献提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 支撑材料：研究了各种支撑材料，包括SiO2、H-ZSM-5和TS-1。在测试的催化剂中，铬基催化剂表现出最高的活性。具体而言，Cr/TS-1和Cr/H-ZSM-5表现最佳。

2. CO2分压：将CO2/C2H6比率提高到1.5会导致乙烯选择性提高，从没有CO2时的78%提高到最佳比率时的>97%。进一步增加CO2并不会显著影响性能。

3. 温度：在TS-1或H-ZSM-5上的铬基催化剂在650°C以下温度表现最佳。超过这个温度，选择性会显著降低。

4. 活性和选择性的权衡：与强氧化剂相比，CO2作为氧化剂可以在高温下导致更高的选择性，因为它不太容易提供反应所需的氧物种。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：活性更高的催化剂通常表现出较低的选择性。

2. 温度优化：较高的温度会增加转化率，但可能会降低选择性。

3. CO2分压优化：找到理想的CO2/C2H6比率，以最大化选择性而不对转化率产生负面影响。

4. 支撑材料选择：不同的支撑材料会影响催化剂性能，需要仔细优化。

5. 稳定性：文献没有提供关于催化剂稳定性的具体信息，这可能是优化整体性能时需要考虑的另一个重要因素。
