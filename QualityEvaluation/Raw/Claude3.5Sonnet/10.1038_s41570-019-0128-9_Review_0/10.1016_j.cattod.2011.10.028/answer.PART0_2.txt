[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature provides insights into the influence of SiO2 and Al2O3 supports on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The support material significantly affects catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms:

1. Activity: Cr/SiO2 showed increased activity with higher CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 experienced reduced activity even with small amounts of CO2.

2. Mechanistic pathways: For both supports, a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays a crucial role. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) under reaction conditions.

3. Reaction types: Cr/SiO2 undergoes both simple dehydrogenation (Cr(III) species) and oxidative dehydrogenation (Cr(VI) species), while Cr/Al2O3 seems to mainly undergo simple dehydrogenation.

4. CO2 effects: CO2 adsorption on Al2O3 inhibits C3H8 adsorption, reducing catalyst activity. On SiO2, CO2 enhances activity by promoting oxidative dehydrogenation.

Key challenges and trade-offs include balancing the positive effects of CO2 (enhancing activity for SiO2-supported catalysts) with its potential negative impacts (reducing activity for Al2O3-supported catalysts). Optimizing overall performance requires careful consideration of support material choice and CO2 partial pressure.

The literature does not provide information on other support materials (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, CeO2) or discuss selectivity and stability explicitly. Further research would be needed to comprehensively compare the performance across a wider range of supports and reaction conditions.

该文献提供了SiO2和Al2O3载体对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢丙烷反应中的影响。载体材料显著影响催化剂性能和反应机理：

1. 活性：随着CO2分压增加，Cr/SiO2的活性提高，而Cr/Al2O3即使在少量CO2存在下活性也显著降低。

2. 机理途径：对于两种载体，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环起着关键作用。在反应条件下，CO2可以将Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)。

3. 反应类型：Cr/SiO2同时发生简单脱氢（Cr(III)物种）和氧化脱氢（Cr(VI)物种），而Cr/Al2O3似乎主要进行简单脱氢。

4. CO2效应：CO2在Al2O3上的吸附抑制了C3H8的吸附，降低了催化剂活性。在SiO2上，CO2通过促进氧化脱氢来提高活性。

主要挑战和权衡包括平衡CO2的正面效应（提高SiO2载体催化剂的活性）和潜在的负面影响（降低Al2O3载体催化剂的活性）。优化整体性能需要仔细考虑载体材料的选择和CO2分压。

该文献未提供其他载体材料（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2、CeO2）的信息，也未明确讨论选择性和稳定性。需要进一步研究以全面比较更广泛的载体和反应条件下的性能。
