[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature provides insights into the influence of support materials (SiO2 and Al2O3) and CO2 partial pressure on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material influence:
- Cr/SiO2 showed enhanced activity with increasing CO2 partial pressure.
- Cr/Al2O3 experienced reduced activity with the addition of CO2.

2. Reaction conditions (CO2 partial pressure):
- Increasing CO2 partial pressure enhanced the activity of Cr/SiO2.
- Even small amounts of CO2 significantly reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3.

3. Mechanistic pathways:
- For both supports, a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays an important role in the dehydrogenation process.
- CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions.
- In the case of Cr/SiO2, both simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species and oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species occur.

4. Key challenges and trade-offs:
- The choice of support material significantly impacts catalyst performance.
- CO2 adsorption on Al2O3 inhibits C3H8 adsorption, reducing catalyst activity.
- Balancing the oxidative and simple dehydrogenation pathways may be crucial for optimizing overall performance.

The literature does not provide information on other support materials (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, CeO2) or discuss selectivity and stability aspects in detail. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献提供了支撑材料（SiO2和Al2O3）和CO2分压对CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的见解：

1. 支撑材料的影响：
- Cr/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加而显示出活性增强。
- Cr/Al2O3在添加CO2后活性降低。

2. 反应条件（CO2分压）：
- 增加CO2分压提高了Cr/SiO2的活性。
- 即使少量的CO2也显著降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。

3. 机理途径：
- 对于两种支撑材料，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在脱氢过程中起着重要作用。
- 在反应条件下，CO2可以将Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
- 对于Cr/SiO2，Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢和Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢同时发生。

4. 主要挑战和权衡：
- 支撑材料的选择显著影响催化剂性能。
- CO2在Al2O3上的吸附抑制了C3H8的吸附，降低了催化剂活性。
- 平衡氧化脱氢和简单脱氢途径可能是优化整体性能的关键。

该文献没有提供有关其他支撑材料（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2、CeO2）的信息，也没有详细讨论选择性和稳定性方面。需要进一步研究以全面解决这些方面，并优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能。
