[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature provides information specifically on Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The support material significantly influences catalyst performance:

1. Activity: Cr/SiO2 activity increases with CO2 partial pressure, while Cr/Al2O3 activity decreases even with small CO2 additions.

2. Mechanistic pathways: Both catalysts involve a redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4. For Cr/SiO2, CO2 oxidizes Cr(III) to Cr(VI), enabling both simple dehydrogenation (Cr(III)) and oxidative dehydrogenation (Cr(VI)). For Cr/Al2O3, CO2 adsorption inhibits C3H8 adsorption, reducing activity.

3. Stability: Not directly addressed, but the redox cycle suggests potential for catalyst regeneration.

4. Selectivity: Not explicitly discussed in the given text.

Key challenges include optimizing CO2 partial pressure and understanding support-specific interactions. The trade-off between enhanced activity (SiO2) and reduced activity (Al2O3) with CO2 addition highlights the complexity of catalyst design.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2 supports, limiting a comprehensive comparison across all mentioned materials.

文献提供了关于Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于CO2氧化脱氢丙烷的信息。支撑材料显著影响催化剂性能：

1. 活性：Cr/SiO2的活性随CO2分压增加而增加，而Cr/Al2O3的活性即使在添加少量CO2时也会降低。

2. 机理途径：两种催化剂都涉及Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环。对于Cr/SiO2，CO2将Cr(III)氧化为Cr(VI)，实现简单脱氢（Cr(III)）和氧化脱氢（Cr(VI)）。对于Cr/Al2O3，CO2吸附抑制了C3H8的吸附，降低了活性。

3. 稳定性：未直接讨论，但氧化还原循环表明催化剂有再生的可能性。

4. 选择性：在给定文本中未明确讨论。

主要挑战包括优化CO2分压和理解特定支撑材料的相互作用。CO2添加导致活性增强（SiO2）和活性降低（Al2O3）之间的权衡突出了催化剂设计的复杂性。

文献未提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2支撑材料的信息，限制了对所有提及材料的全面比较。
