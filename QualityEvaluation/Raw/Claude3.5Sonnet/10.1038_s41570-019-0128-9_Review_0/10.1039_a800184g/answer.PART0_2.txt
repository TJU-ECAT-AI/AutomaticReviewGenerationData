[1] "Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported, but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."

[4] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3."

The literature provides limited information on the influence of various support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Cr2O3 is known to be an active catalyst for dehydrogenation of alkanes.

2. The presence of CO2 slightly improves the yield of ethene with Cr2O3 catalyst compared to using Ar as a carrier gas.

3. For Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 shows a promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation, but the increase in propene yield is modest (2.6% at 550°C).

4. Basic oxide supports like MgO or La2O3 strongly inhibit dehydrogenation reactions, at least for Ga2O3 catalysts. This suggests that acidic or neutral supports may be more suitable for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the influence of different support materials (such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) or reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) on chromium oxide catalysts. It also does not discuss stability, detailed mechanistic pathways, or key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献对各种载体材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的影响提供了有限的信息。然而，可以得出一些见解：

1. Cr2O3被认为是烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂。

2. 与使用Ar作为载气相比，CO2的存在略微提高了Cr2O3催化剂的乙烯产率。

3. 对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2对丙烷脱氢显示出促进作用，但丙烯产率的增加很小（在550°C时为2.6%）。

4. 碱性氧化物载体如MgO或La2O3会强烈抑制脱氢反应，至少对Ga2O3催化剂是如此。这表明酸性或中性载体可能更适合氧化脱氢反应。

文献没有提供关于不同载体材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）或反应条件（包括CO2分压）对铬氧化物催化剂影响的全面信息。它也没有讨论稳定性、详细的机理途径，或优化整体性能的关键挑战和权衡。需要进行更多研究以全面解决铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的这些方面。
