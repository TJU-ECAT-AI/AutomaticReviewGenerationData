[1] "Cr2O3 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

[4] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the influence of various support materials on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It only mentions that Cr2O3 exhibits high activity for dehydrogenation of alkanes. 

The presence of CO2 slightly increased the yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst compared to using Ar. However, the effect was much more pronounced for Ga2O3, where activity doubled in the presence of CO2.

The document does not discuss the impact of different support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on chromium oxide catalysts specifically. It does mention that impregnating Ga2O3 on basic oxides like MgO or La2O3 strongly inhibited dehydrogenation of ethane.

The literature does not provide information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure, selectivity, stability, mechanistic pathways, or key challenges in optimizing overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献没有提供关于各种支撑材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂影响的全面信息。它只提到Cr2O3对烷烃脱氢表现出高活性。

与使用Ar相比,CO2的存在略微增加了Cr2O3催化剂的乙烯产率。然而,这种效果在Ga2O3上更为显著,在CO2存在下活性翻倍。

该文档没有具体讨论不同支撑材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2对铬氧化物催化剂的影响。它确实提到将Ga2O3浸渍在MgO或La2O3等碱性氧化物上会强烈抑制乙烷的脱氢。

该文献没有提供关于CO2分压、选择性、稳定性、机理途径或优化铬氧化物催化剂整体性能的关键挑战等信息。需要更全面的研究才能充分解答这些问题。
