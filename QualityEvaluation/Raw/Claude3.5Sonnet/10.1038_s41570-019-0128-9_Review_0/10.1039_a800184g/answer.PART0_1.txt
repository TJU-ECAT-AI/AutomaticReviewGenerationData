[1] "Cr2O3 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported, but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."

The literature provides limited information specifically about chromium oxide catalysts on various supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Cr2O3 is known to be an active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The presence of CO2 slightly improves the ethene yield with Cr2O3 catalyst compared to using an inert gas (Ar).

3. For propane dehydrogenation, Cr2O3/SiO2 showed a small promoting effect with CO2, increasing propene yield by 2.6% at 550°C.

4. Support materials can significantly influence catalyst performance. Basic oxides like MgO or La2O3 strongly inhibited dehydrogenation when used as supports for Ga2O3, which may also apply to Cr2O3.

5. CO2 partial pressure likely plays a role in reaction performance, as evidenced by the promoting effect of CO2 on Ga2O3 catalysts.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the influence of different supports, reaction conditions, or mechanistic pathways for chromium oxide catalysts. Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance are not explicitly discussed for Cr2O3 catalysts in this context.

这篇文献对于各种载体上的氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的表现提供了有限的信息。但是可以得出一些见解：

1. Cr2O3被认为是烷烃脱氢反应的活性催化剂。

2. 与使用惰性气体(Ar)相比，CO2的存在略微提高了Cr2O3催化剂的乙烯产率。

3. 对于丙烷脱氢，Cr2O3/SiO2在CO2存在下显示出轻微的促进作用，在550°C时丙烯产率增加了2.6%。

4. 载体材料可以显著影响催化剂性能。当使用MgO或La2O3等碱性氧化物作为Ga2O3的载体时，会强烈抑制脱氢反应，这可能也适用于Cr2O3。

5. CO2分压可能在反应性能中起作用，这从CO2对Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用可以看出。

文献没有提供关于不同载体、反应条件或氧化铬催化剂机理途径影响的全面信息。在这种情况下，没有明确讨论优化Cr2O3催化剂整体性能的关键挑战和权衡。
