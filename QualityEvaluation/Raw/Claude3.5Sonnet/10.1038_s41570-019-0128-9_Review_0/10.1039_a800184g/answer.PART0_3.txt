[1] "Cr2O3 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "The activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported,5 but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."

The literature provides limited information specifically about chromium oxide catalysts on various supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that Cr2O3 exhibits high activity for dehydrogenation of alkanes. The presence of CO2 slightly increases the ethene yield with Cr2O3 catalyst compared to using Ar as a carrier gas. For Cr2O3/SiO2, CO2 shows a small promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation, increasing propene yield by 2.6% at 550°C.

The document does not provide detailed information on the influence of different supports, reaction conditions, or mechanistic pathways for chromium oxide catalysts. It also does not discuss challenges or trade-offs in optimizing their performance. To fully answer the question, more specific research on chromium oxide catalysts with various supports and under different reaction conditions would be needed.

这篇文献对于不同载体上的氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的表现提供了有限的信息。不过,它确实提到Cr2O3对烷烃脱氢表现出高活性。与使用Ar作为载气相比,CO2的存在略微提高了Cr2O3催化剂的乙烯产率。对于Cr2O3/SiO2,CO2对丙烷脱氢显示出小幅促进作用,在550°C时使丙烯产率增加2.6%。

文献并未提供关于不同载体、反应条件或氧化铬催化剂机理途径影响的详细信息。它也没有讨论优化其性能时的挑战或权衡。要全面回答这个问题,需要对不同载体和不同反应条件下的氧化铬催化剂进行更具体的研究。
