Graphical Abstract  
A series of mesoporous Cr(x)/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with 0, 2, 5, 8 and 11 wt.% content of 
chromium were synthesized by hydrothermal/impregnation method. The effect of chromium 
loading on the structure and catalytic performance of nanocatalysts in oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated. It was found that there is the optimum 
chromium content (8%) on the MCM-41 support for the best catalytic activity, attributable to 
higher dispersion of chromium species with monolayer coverage on MCM-41, homogeneous 
morphology with smallest particle size and better redox property due to higher oxidation state 
of chromium over the catalyst.

Abstract 
A series of mesoporous Cr(x)/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with 0, 2, 5, 8 and 11 wt.% content of 
chromium were synthesized by hydrothermal/impregnation method. The effect of chromium 
loading on the structure and catalytic performance of Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts in oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by 
XRD, FESEM, EDX, DRS, BET and FTIR analysis. Various chromium species including 
Cr6+, Cr3+ and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Cr(x)/MCM-41 samples. Particles 
of crystalline α-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Cr total content above 2 wt.%. The 
variation of Cr content indicates that the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of samples increased with the Cr 
loading up to 8 wt.%. However, a decreasing trend was observed with further increase of Cr 
content. This can be justified by Cr surface density. It was found that there is an optimum Cr 
content in Cr(8%)/MCM-41 for the best catalytic activity, attributable to higher active Cr6+ 
species, and more uniform dispersion of chromium species with monolayer coverage on 
MCM-41 and also, homogeneous surface morphology with smallest particle size. It was 
found that this catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 
at 700°C, giving 53% ethylene yield.

1 Introduction 
Currently, CO2 assisted oxydehydrogenation of light olefins has been attracted more 
attentions due to the environmental and technical benefits [1-3]. However, a number of 
challenges like low olefin yield compared to conventional processes, have prevented 
oxidative dehydrogenation from being widely implemented [4-6]. It could be solved by 
designing catalysts with efficient performance [7-9]. 
Among all the studied metal oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide nanocatalysts 
have been most promising candidate for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) due to their high 
catalytic activity [10-12]. The Cr content and the properties of the support strongly affect the 
redox property, oxidation state and dispersion of chromium species on the support [13-16]. 
There are Cr ions of various oxidation states (i.e. Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+) on the surface of 
chromium based nanocatalysts [17]. Highly dispersed Cr6+ ions that are known as most active 
species in ODH of alkanes, form below the monolayer coverage of support. When the Cr 
content exceeds the monolayer coverage, less active polymeric species are formed. Therefore 
the challenge is to achieve maximum dispersion of surface CrOx species [18-21]. For this 
reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials like MCM-41 
[22-24]  and SBA-15 [25-27] as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. MCM-41, a 
typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous 
channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 
m2/g) and thus, could be used as a promising support [28, 29]. There exist several studies on 
the synthesis and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 catalyst for photocatalytic reactions [30, 
31], oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [19] and butane [21], but oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) process over Cr/MCM-41 catalysts has not been in detail 
reported in literature. The main purpose of this study was to employ Cr supported MCM-41 
nanocatalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) in the presence of CO2. The 
5 
 
effect of chromium content on the structural properties and catalytic performance of 
nanocatalysts was taken in to account. In this regard, Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with various 
Cr contents were synthesized by hydrothermal/impregnation method. To the best of our 
knowledge, ODHE process over Cr/MCM-41 catalysts has not been reported in the literature, 
so there was an enthusiasm to investigate this nanostructured system for ethylene production 
and more clarify the influence of chromium content on the structural properties and catalytic 
performance. 
 
2 Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
In synthesis of MCM-41 support, cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (C19H42BrN, Merck, 
extra pure) and sodium metasilicate (Na2O3Si, Aldrich, 99.9%) were used as the sources of 
the template and silica, respectively. Chromium nitrate (Aldrich, 96%) was applied as the 
source of active phase. 
 
2.2 Nanocatalysts Preparation and Procedures 
2.2.1 Hydrothermal Synthesis of MCM-41 
MCM-41 mesoporous support was synthesized by hydrothermal method according to the 
reported method in the literature [21]. Figure 1 shows schematically the methodology of the 
preparation method of MCM-41 support. Appropriate amounts of cetyltrimethyl-ammonium 
bromide and sodium metasilicate were dissolved in water and stirred, then pH was adjusted to 
10.5 with sulfuric acid 4N (Merck, 85%). The resulting homogenous solution was transferred 
into an autoclave and heated in an oven at 140C for 12 h. The solid product was filtered, 
washed and dried at 110C for 6 h and then calcined at 550C for 6 h to remove the 
surfactant.

(Figure 1) 
 
2.2.2 Dispersion of Chromium over MCM-41 
The synthesized support was impregnated with chromium nitrate (Aldrich, 96%) aqueous 
solution. So that, appropriate amount of chromium nitrate and MCM-41 dissolved in water 
and stirred for 2 h. The resulting solution was dried at 110C for 6 h and then calcined at 
550C for 6 h to remove the surfactant. Obtained impregnated Cr-based nanocatalysts 
denoted as Cr(x)/MCM-41 where “x” represents the nominal weight percentage of Cr. 
Synthesis steps of Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalyst via impregnation method are shown in Figure 2. 
 
(Figure 2) 
 
2.3 Nanocatalysts Characterization 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer 
using Cu Kα radiation (0.154056 nm). The working voltage and current of the instrument 
were 30 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The morphology of samples was observed by 
HITACHI 4160-s field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). EDX and dot maps 
were conducted for elemental analysis (VEGA II, TESCAN). The FT-IR spectra were 
acquired by means of a Unicam 4000 FTIR spectrometer using KBr plate in the range of 400-
4000 cm-1. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements were investigated using 
nitrogen adsorption at 77 K and desorption at room temperature by a Quantachrome 
ChemBET 3000 analyzer. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were taken in the 
wavelength range 200–1000 nm with a spectrometer (Scinco S4100, Korea) equipped with a 
7 
 
PC for data acquisition and analysis. The chromium surface density (Cr surface density, Cr-
atom. nm−2) was calculated according to:

Cr/MCM-41 catalyst (m2/g). 
 
2.4 Nanocatalysts Performance Test 
 Figure 3 illustrates experimental setup for activity test of synthesized catalysts in oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide. The catalytic experiments were 
conducted in a U-shape quartz reactor (6 mm i.d.) with 500 mg catalyst loading under 
atmospheric pressure and in the range of 550-700°C. The reactant stream, consisting of 10% 
ethane, 50% carbon dioxide and 40% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a ﬂow rate 
of 75 ml/min. Blank tests were conducted under the same conditions, by replacing the 
catalyst with quartz sand particles of the same size. The products and remained reactants 
were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) equipped 
with a ﬂame ionization detector (FID) using a Carboxen™ 1000 column.

3 Results and Discussions 
3.1 Nanocatalysts Characterization 
3.1.3 XRD Analysis 
Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of synthesized MCM-41 (JCPDS 00-049-1712) 
support in the 2 range of 1-20. The characteristic peaks at 2.1, 3.7, 4.2 and 5.6 are indexed 
to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections of MCM-41. The high intensity of these 
diffraction lines confirms formation of hexagonal mesostructure of MCM-41 successfully. 
The X-ray diffraction patterns of synthesized Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts prepared with 
different Cr contents are shown in Figure 5 in the 2 range of 20-70. From reference 
patterns, peaks at 2θ= 24.5, 33.6, 36.2, 41.5, 50.2, 54.9, 63.3 and 65.1° are assigned to Cr2O3 
(JCPDS 00-006-0504) rhombohedra phase. A detailed examination of diffraction patterns 
reveals the formation of α-Cr2O3 structure with the Cr content higher than 5 wt.%. According 
to the patterns, the intensity of characteristic peaks of α-Cr2O3 is increased by enhancing 
chromium loading. The absence of the clear diffraction lines in the XRD pattern of sample 
containing 2 wt.% Cr may be explained by a low content of chromium. The structural 
properties of synthesized nanocatalysts are reported in Table 1. It can be demonstrated that 
crystallite size of α-Cr2O3 is in the range of 25-32 nm for all samples. 
 
(Figure 4) 
(Figure 5)

(Table 1) 
 
3.1.4 FESEM Analysis 
Figure 6 illustrates the FESEM images of the synthesized Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with 0, 
2, 5, 8 and 11 wt.% of Cr . The spherical morphology could be clearly observed for all the 
samples. Metal particle size is one of the principle properties of the catalyst which activity of 
the catalyst strongly depends on it. According to the images, with increasing chromium 
content up to 8 wt.%, particles size became more uniform and smaller, but with further 
increasing up to 11 wt.%, particles grew again. So, catalyst with 8 wt.% Cr had best structure 
with homogeneous morphology and tiny particle size less than 50 nm. From these results, It 
is expected that Cr(8%)/MCM-41 catalyst with best surface morphology among all samples 
exhibits better catalytic performance. 
 
 (Figure 6) 
 
3.1.5 EDX Analysis 
EDX dot mapping analysis and surface composition of synthesized Cr/MCM-41 
nanocatalysts with various loadings of chromium are shown in Figure 7 and Table 2, 
respectively. EDX spectrum and dot-mapping results demonstrate that chromium content in 
all samples is equal to calculated amount and is uniformly dispersed on the support. EDX 
pictures also confirm presence of chromium in Cr(2%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst, while XRD 
patterns do not conclusively show the chromium peaks of this sample. 
 
(Figure 7) 
(Table 2) 
10 
 
 
3.1.6 BET Analysis 
The BET analysis of the synthesized nanocatalysts is shown in Figure 8. According to the 
results, MCM-41 is a support with high surface area about 973 m2/g that provides very good 
surface for active phase dispersion and accessibility. For Cr/MCM-41 samples, specific 
surface area decreases gradually with an increase in the Cr loading. These decreases in 
specific surface area are caused mainly by active sites blockage due to the impregnation 
method. As can be seen, the surface decrease of Cr(8%)/MCM-41 by increasing Cr content 
from 5% to 8% is not considerable compared to that of Cr(11%)/MCM-41 by increasing from 
8% to 11%. This can be attributed to higher Cr dispersion and consequently, lower blockage 
of pores in Cr(8%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst. Increase of catalytic activity via enhancement of 
chromium content indicates that decrease of specific surface area does not have notable effect 
on the catalyst performance. 
 
(Figure 8) 
 
3.1.7 FTIR Analysis 
Figure 9 presents FTIR spectra of Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with 0, 2, 5, 8 and 11 wt.% of 
Cr in the 400-4000 cm-1 range. The adsorption bands observed at 480, 810 and 1075 cm-1 are 
related to symmetric stretching vibration of Si-O-Si bond that confirms the presence of 
MCM-41 support. The peaks demonstrated at 2360 cm-1 can be related to CO2 which is 
adsorbed from the atmosphere [32-34]. Peaks at wave number of about 1650 cm−1 can be 
attributed to physically adsorbed water [35-37] and peaks at 3450 cm-1 are related to 
chemically adsorbed water O-H bond [38-40]. The presence of OH groups owning to their 
ability in removing the formed coke is also very noticeable [4]. As FTIR analysis illustrates, 
11 
 
the intensity of the broadening peak in 3450 cm-1 in the catalyst containing 8 wt.% Cr is 
higher than the other ones. These features allow us to expect a better coking resistance and 
subsequently a meliorated performance from the Cr(8%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst as a result of 
the higher intensity of OH groups compared to other synthesized samples. 
 
(Figure 9) 
 
3.1.8 Chromium Surface Density 
The Cr surface density (defined as the number of Cr atoms per unit of BET surface area) 
results are summarized in table 1. This parameter quantitatively estimates the Cr dispersion of 
samples studied. It is generally accepted that on the surfaces of supported chromium oxides, 
there are three kinds of chromium species: i.e. isolated monochromate, polychromate and 
crystalline α-Cr2O3 [20]. The lower surface chromium density clearly indicates a better 
dispersion and an increase in population of the monomeric CrOX units as the most active 
species in the ODH of ethane. It is deduced that the value of 1 Cr-atom per nm2 is assumed to 
be a limiting value for the preferential formation of highly dispersed isolated monomeric 
units. In other words, one monolayer coverage of highly dispersed isolated monomeric CrOx 
units on MCM-41 occurs at Cr surface density = 1 Cr-atom/nm2 [18]. The formation of 
various oligomeric and polymeric species is expected after reaching this value that leads to 
the decrease of chromium dispersion. This value of the surface density reached for sample 
containing 8 wt.% of chromium for investigated catalysts (see Table 1). With further 
increasing Cr content up to 11 wt.%, the 3D bulk oxide species were formed with reaching 
the surface Cr density 1.58 Cr-atom/nm2. Based on the results, it is inferred that in the 
Cr(8%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst (1.054 Cr-atom/nm2), the coverage of CrOx domains on 
MCM-41 is around one monolayer and the dispersion of CrOx species is the highest at this 
12 
 
stage. These results correspond well with the information obtained from DR UV–Vis 
spectroscopy. 
 
3.1.9 UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectra Analysis 
Diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectroscopy provides information about the nature and oxida-
tion state of Chromium. It has been pointed out that the roles of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in the catalytic 
ODH of alkanes are different. Therefore, investigation of chromium oxidation states is im-
portant for the elucidation of active sites. The spectra of synthesized samples and the quanti-
tative data from integration of the area under the peaks are presented in Figure 10. As shown 
in the DRS study, there are Cr ions of various oxidation states in the Cr(x)/MCM-41 nanocat-
alysts. In the spectral region, all the samples exhibited adsorption bands centered at 307 (rela-
tively broad band), 370 and 443 nm. On the basis of literature data, the bands at 307 and 370 
nm are related to the charge transfer transitions O→Cr typical of Cr6+, whereas the band at 
443 is due to d–d transitions of Cr3+ species in octahedral symmetry (A2g → T1g and A2g → 
T2g, respectively). Considerable difference between intensity of Cr6+ and Cr3+ bands reveal 
that the surface Cr species are mainly Cr6+ with a minor amount of Cr3+ due to α-Cr2O3 for-
mation. The relative intensity of Cr6+ band in comparison with the Cr3+ band is different 
among the samples with different chromium content. From the results, intensity of Cr6+ band 
and the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio increased with rising chromium content up to 8 wt.%. Sample with 8 
wt.% of Chromium has the sharpest Cr6+ band with the highest Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio about 3.09 
among all samples. Further rising of Chromium content resulted reducing of Cr6+ intensity 
and Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio. The rapid decrease of Cr6+ concentration at loading of 11 wt.% Cr is due 
to the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase. The result is in concord with that of surface Chromium 
density calculations. From the spectra results, one can deduce that near monolayer coverage 
of chromium on the MCM-41 surface that is achieved at a chromium loading of 8 wt.% (cor-
13 
 
responding to a Cr surface density of 1.054 Cr-atom/nm2), Cr6+ as most active species in 
ODH of alkanes, are in the highest concentration of them. 
 
(Figure 10) 
 
3.2 Catalytic Performance of Cr/MCM-41 toward Ethane to Ethylene 
3.2.1 Effect of Chromium Loading on C2H6 Conversion 
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 at temperature range of 550-700°C is 
depicted in Figure 11 for synthesized Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts with different content of Cr. 
As seen, catalytic activity of all samples increased dramatically by temperature, due to the 
supply of activation energy of ethane and also because of endothermic nature of reaction in 
the presence of carbon dioxide. Conversion of ethane increases with an increase of the 
chromium loading and reaches its maximum for the catalyst containing 8 wt.% Cr. Further 
increase in the chromium loading results in a decrease of ethane conversion. So, comparing 
catalysts with different chromium content shows that the one containing 8wt.% chromium is 
the best in all temperatures and ethane can be converted 56% at 700°C. According to the 
characterization results, the tiny particles, homogeneous morphology, presence of the greater 
number of active Cr6+ species and monolayer coverage of CrOx with uniform dispersion on 
MCM-41 are responsible for the good performance of the Cr(8%)/MCM-41 catalyst and 
improve catalytic activity in ethane ODH. 
 
 (Figure 11) 
 
 
 
14 
 
3.2.2 Effect of Chromium Loading on C2H4 Yield 
Figure 12 illustrates the ethylene yield over synthesized nanocatalysts at temperature range of 
550-700°C. The selectivity of the ethylene nearly remained constant for various contents of 
chromium but decreased slightly with increasing the temperature. As a result, the yield chart 
had the same trend with ethane conversion and Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalyst with 8 wt.% 
chromium was the best overall studied temperatures in comparison with other samples. This 
catalyst having 53% yield of ethylene at 700°C exhibited an appreciable performance in this 
field. It is notable that the high selectivity of all samples which is about 93-95% can be due to 
the mild nature of CO2 oxidant and neutral nature of MCM-41 support. 
 
(Figure 12) 
 
3.2.3 Time on Stream Performance 
According to catalytic activity test, 700°C was selected to investigate the stability 
performance of Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalyst. The time on stream performance of the best 
catalyst (Cr(8%)/MCM-41) was investigate continuously for 10h and shown in Figure 13. As 
shown, the ethane conversion and ethylene yield decrease slowly with increasing the reaction 
time, suggesting small deactivation of the catalysts, while the selectivity remains stable about 
94-95% after 10h. Slight decrease of ethane conversion and catalyst deactivation can be due 
to the coke formation and the reduction of redox Cr species. Generally, it can be seen, 
catalytic activity of Cr(8%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst declined just about 20% after 600 min. 
Despite this, a high ethylene yield, more than 30%, could still be maintained after 10 h on 
stream operation. The high stability of this catalyst can be due to the high surface area, tiny 
particle size, well dispersion, a great number of active Cr6+ species and the intensity of OH 
groups observed in FTIR analysis.

(Figure 13) 
 
4 Conclusions 
In this research, a series of mesoporous Cr/MCM-41 nanocatalysts varying in Cr content 
were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal/impregnation method. The variation of 
chromium content indicates different physicochemical properties as well as catalytic 
performance. It was found that there is the optimum chromium content (8%) on the MCM-41 
support for the best catalytic activity, attributable to higher dispersion of chromium species 
with monolayer coverage on MCM-41, homogeneous morphology with smallest particle size, 
high surface area and better redox property due to higher oxidation state of chromium over 
the catalyst. Moreover, the characterization results evidence that the Cr6+ species were found 
to be crucial for high activity in the CO2 assisted dehydrogenation of ethane. Briefly, 
Cr(8%)/MCM-41 nanocatalyst with 56% ethane conversion and 94% ethylene selectivity at 
700°C exhibit excellent catalytic activity at the ODH of ethane with CO2.
