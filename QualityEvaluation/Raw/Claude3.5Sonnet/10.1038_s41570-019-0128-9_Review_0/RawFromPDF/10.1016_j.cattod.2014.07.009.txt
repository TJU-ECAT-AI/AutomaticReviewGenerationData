The  increasing
 availability
 of computational
 data  from  quantum-chemical
 calculations
 on  the  reactivity
and
 electronic
 structure
 of  catalytically
 active
 oxidic
 systems
 make
 a revisitation
 of
 the  classical
 questions
on chemical
 bonding
 aspects
 of  catalytically
 reactive
 systems
 useful.
This
 Perspective
 paper  starts  with  a
 short
 review
 of
 the  different
 available
 systems.
 The
 elementary
reactions
 that  are  part of
 the  selective
 oxidation
 catalysis,  such  as
 substrate
 bond
 activation
 or  oxygen
insertion,
 are  introduced.
This
 is  followed
 by  a discussion
 of basic
 electronic
 features
 of the  valence
 electron
 structure
 of  oxide
materials.
 We  will  initially  compare
 the  chemical
 bonding
 and reactivity
 of  compounds
 with  dominantly
ionic
 versus  covalent
 bonding.
 Surface
 reactivity
 descriptors
 for the  two  types
 of  chemical
 bonds
 are
indicated.
 It will
 appear  that,  except  for  longer
 range
 ionic
 interactions,
 binding
 to  the  metal
 cations
 is
dominated
 by  local  covalent
 interactions
 and  that  ligand  ﬁeld
 theory
 type  atomic
 orbital
 splitting
 as  well
as
 rehybridisation
 are  important.
 Trends
 in  bonding
 as a function  of
 position
 of  reducible  metal
 in
 the
periodic
 system
 are  emphasized
 throughout
 the
 paper.
At
 the surface,  in  addition
 to  the  changes
 in  electronic
 structure,
 atom  position  relaxation
 and
 surface
reconstruction
 effects  may
 also  have  a
 large  inﬂuence
 on  the  differences
 in  reactivity.
The
 reactivity
 of  the oxygen
 atoms
 varies.
 They  can  be  proton
 acceptors
 and  generate
 Brønsted
 acid-
ity,
 can assist  heterolytic
 or  radical  type  C  
H bond  activation
 or  when
 electrophilic
 will insert  into
hydrocarbon
 double
 bonds.
At
 the  end  of the  paper  trends  in  catalytic
 reactivity  are  analyzed.
 The  double  volcano
 type  curve
 found
for
 the  dependence
 of  catalytic
 reactivity
 on  the
 position
 of  cation  in  the  third  row
 of  the  periodic
 system
is  shown
 to  relate
 to the  distribution
 of electrons
 with
 high
 spin  over  the  ligand
 ﬁeld  split  atomic
 orbitals
of
 the
 respective
 cations.
 This  will  be  discussed
 in  the  context
 of  classical
 catalytic
 results
 that
 are
 based
on
 Balandin
 type  volcano
 plots
 of reactivity
 versus  the  catalyst

 Introduction
Energy
 production
 by
 combustion
 has
 been
 essential
 to
 the
 early
rise
 of
 human
 civilization.
 Currently
 the
 need
 to
 selectively
 produce
energy
 without
 detrimental
 NOx production
 has
 become
 impor-
tant.
 It
 is
 one
 of
 the
 driving
 forces
 to
 develop
 new
 catalytic
 systems
for
 total
 combustion
 [1].
 Because
 of
 the
 temperatures
 involved,
such
 catalysts
 will
 have
 to
 be
 heterogeneous.
 Catalytic
 partial
 oxi-
dation
 is
 an
 important
 route
 to
 convert
 natural
 gas
 into
 synthesis
gas,
 oleﬁns
 and
 hydrogen
 [2].
 Also,
 to
 produce
 chemicals,
 selec-
tive
 oxidation
 catalysis
 has
 become
 essential
 for
 the
 production

 Catalysis
 for
 renewable
 energy
 pro-
cesses
 as,
 for
 instance,
 the
 production
 of
 solar
 fuels
 is
 attracting
increased
 attention
 nowadays
 [7–9].
The
 class
 of
 materials
 on
 which
 such
 catalytic
 processes
 are
based
 are
 the
 reducible
 oxides.
 Their
 surface
 chemical
 reactiv-
ity
 and
 its
 relation
 to
 chemical
 bonding
 features
 will
 be
 the
subject
 of
 this
 paper.
 The
 purpose
 is
 to
 identify
 the
 relevant
 reac-
tivity
 parameters
 of
 a
 material
 that
 determine
 its
 activity
 and
selectivity.
As
 a
 start,
 this
 requires
 basic
 knowledge
 of
 the
 types
 of
 reac-
tions
 that
 occur
 between
 reagent
 and
 catalyst.
 We
 will
 initiate
 this
paper
 with
 a
 short
 introduction
 of
 the
 different
 bond
 activation
and
 oxygen
 insertion
 mechanistic
 steps
 that
 are
 currently
 known.
Whereas
 experimental
 information
 is
 essential,
 this
 is
 currently
rapidly
 complemented
 by
 detailed
 computational

 studies
[10–18].

It
 is
 speciﬁcally
 our
 goal
 here
 to
 review
 the
 new
 insights
obtained
 from
 such
 calculations
 to
 highlight
 the
 relation
 between
chemical
 reactivity
 and
 surface
 chemical
 bonding
 features.
We
 will
 emphasize
 chemical
 concepts
 and
 insights,
 mainly
based
 on
 results
 of
 recent
 quantum-chemical
 computational
 data
obtained
 from
 state
 of
 the
 art
 DFT
 calculations.
 We  will
 not
 review
details
 of
 such
 calculations
 here,
 but
 refer
 to
 the
 existing
 literature
[19–25].
 It
 is
 worthwhile
 to
 mention
 that
 electronic
 correlation
effects
 in
 reducible
 oxides
 are
 generally
 different
 from
 those
 in
metals
 and
 molecules.
 Computational
 quantum
 chemical
 methods
are
 available
 that
 account
 for
 this.
 They
 have
 been
 devised
 mainly
by
 empirically
 adapting
 one
 center
 repulsion
 energy
 integrals
 of
the
 localized
 d-electrons
 [26].
The
 chemical
 bond
 in
 a
 reducible
 oxide
 can
 be
 considered
 a
 bal-
ance
 of
 covalent
 and
 ionic
 bonding
 interactions.
 We  will
 introduce
the
 ionic
 bonding
 view
 from
 computed
 electronic
 and
 reactivity
properties
 of
 essentially
 ionic
 compounds.
 We  selected
 TiO2 and
CeO2 as
 prototypical
 reducible
 oxides
 dominated
 by
 ionic
 bonding.
Reducibility
 and
 water
 activation
 are
 reactivity
 aspects
 that
 we
 will
discuss
 for
 these
 systems.
This
 will
 be
 followed
 by
 a
 subsection
 on
 materials
 in
 which
covalent
 bonding
 dominates.
 We  will
 discuss
 in
 detail
 the
 chemical
bonding
 and
 reactivity
 of
 PdO,
 which
 is
 a
 prototype
 of
 a
 compound
with
 dominantly
 covalent
 bonding.
 We  will
 also
 discuss
 essential
differences
 in
 the
 bonding
 between
 oxygen
 adsorbed
 to
 a
 metal
 sur-
faces
 and
 that
 in
 the
 oxide.
 We  will
 see
 that
 the
 covalent
 bond
 in
 the
oxide
 has
 similarities
 with
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 type
 bonding
 as
 in
 coordina-
tion
 complexes.
 Catalytic
 reactivity
 aspects
 of
 methane
 activation
will
 be
 used
 to
 illustrate
 the
 reactivity
 of
 PdO.
A
 section
 follows
 that
 uses
 now
 known
 concepts
 to
 the
 reader
 to
analyze
 trends
 in
 chemical
 bonding
 and
 reactivity
 of
 the
 reducible
oxide
 surface
 as
 a
 function
 of
 reactive
 cation
 position
 in
 the
 periodic
system.
 We  will
 see
 that
 generally
 an
 increase
 in
 valence
 electron
count
 as
 well
 as
 of
 charge
 on
 the
 reactive
 cation
 will
 decrease
 the
strength
 of
 M
 O
 bonds.
The
 paper
 will
 conclude
 with
 a
 discussion
 of
 trends
 in
 catalytic
activity.
 The
 question
 is
 addressed
 of
 the
 observation
 of
 double
 vol-
cano
 plots
 in
 the
 catalytic
 [27]
 as
 well
 as
 electrocatalytic
 reactivity
of
 the
 ﬁrst
 row
 oxides
 [28]
 when
 this
 is
 plotted
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
position
 of
 the
 metal
 along
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system.
2.
 The
 different
 types
 of
 elementary
 activation
 reactions
 in
heterogeneous
 oxidation
 catalysis
In
 this
 section
 as
 an
 introduction
 to
 the
 later
 analysis
 of
 the
 reac-
tivity
 of
 oxide
 surfaces
 we
 will
 discuss
 some
 examples
 of
 catalytic
oxidation
 reactions.
 One
 can
 distinguish
 two
 different
 types
 of
 ele-
mentary
 reaction
 steps.
 In
 one
 type
 of
 reaction
 a
 C
 H
 or
 C
 C
 bond
is
 activated
 by
 a
 surface
 oxygen
 atom,
 but
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 is
 initially
maintained.
 In
 the
 other
 type
 of
 reaction
 an
 O
 atom
 is
 inserted
 into
a
 C
 C
 or
 C
 H
 bond,
 and
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 is
 fully
 broken.
 As
 will
 be
explained
 in
 detail
 in
 the
 following
 subsections,
 the
 ﬁrst
 elemen-
tary
 reaction,
 of
 substrate
 bond
 activation
 type,
 can
 occur
 with
 or
without
 a
 change
 of
 the
 valency
 of
 the
 metal
 atoms.
 In
 the
 sec-
ond
 case
 the
 oxygen
 anion
 that
 inserts
 into
 a
 reacting
 molecule
donates
 electrons
 to
 the
 surface
 cations
 and
 the
 formal
 valence
 of
the
 surface
 cation(s)
 that
 release
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 reduces
 with
 2
charge
 equivalents.
 The
 different
 activation
 modes
 are
 summarized
in
 Fig.
 1
 and
 will
 be
 discussed
 in
 the
 following
 subsections.
A
 generally
 important
 question
 with
 respect
 to
 oxidation
 catal-
ysis
 is
 whether
 reactions
 occur
 with
 a
 surface
 oxygen
 species
 of
 dis-
sociatively
 adsorbed
 gas
 phase
 O2,
 or
 whether
 reacting
 surface
 oxy-
gen
 atoms
 can
 be
 considered
 bulk
 oxygen
 atoms.
 In
 the
 latter
 case
the
 only
 function
 of
 O2 dissociation
 is
 to
 reoxidize
 the
 surface.
 There
is
 no
 need
 to
 be
 a
 correlation
 between
 the
 site
 where
 O2 dissociates
and
 the
 site
 where
 (selective)
 oxidation
 of
 the
 reagent
 occurs.
 This
combination
 of
 reaction
 events
 is
 called
 the
 Mars-van
 Krevelen
mechanism
 [29].
 Experimentally
 this
 can
 be
 investigated
 by
 using
isotope-labeled
 gas
 phase
 O2 molecules
 and
 to
 observe
 whether
gas
 phase
 oxygen
 or
 oxide
 oxygen
 appears
 ﬁrst
 in
 the
 product.
An
 important
 over
 all
 observation
 is
 that
 the
 products
 of
 the
oxidation
 reaction
 are
 generally
 coordinately
 saturated
 molecules
that
 have
 the
 singlet
 as
 spin
 state.
 However,
 the
 reacting
 oxygen
molecule
 has
 initially
 a
 triplet
 spin
 state.
 In
 such
 a
 case
 the
 cata-
lyst
 has
 also
 to
 take
 care
 of
 the
 required
 spin-ﬂip
 and
 to
 relax
 the
non-singlet
 spin
 state
 left
 on
 the
 catalyst
 after
 the
 reaction
 by
 fast
consecutive
 electron
 spin-ﬂip
 dissipation
 processes.
2.1.
 Substrate
 bond
 activation
As
 a
 reference
 to
 the
 later
 discussion
 on
 activation
 of
 the
 C
 H
bond
 by
 the
 metal
 oxide
 surface
 we  will
 discuss
 ﬁrst
 the
 activation
of
 a
 C
 H
 bond
 by
 a
 transition
 metal
 surface.
 This
 is
 the
 prototype
reaction
 of
 the
 activation
 of
 a
 -type
 bond.
 Bond
 dissociation
 on
 a
transition
 metal
 results
 in
 an
 adsorbed
 alkyl
 intermediate
 and
 an
H
 atom.
 This
 reaction
 can
 be
 considered
 as
 homolytic.
 The
 disso-
ciated
 fragments
 form
 qualitatively
 similar
 bonds
 with
 the
 surface
metal
 atoms.
 It
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 oxidative
 addition
 as
 deﬁned
 in
organometallic
 chemistry
 and
 the
 valence
 state
 of
 the
 metal
 atom
involved
 changes
 by
 2+.
 The
 corresponding
 transition
 state
 of
 C
 H
activation
 of
 methane
 on
 a
 transition
 metal
 surface
 is
 shown
 in
Fig.
 1a.
On
 an
 oxide
 surface,
 in
 addition
 to
 homolytic
 C
 H
 bond
 acti-
vation
 on
 a
 single
 cation,
 also
 heterolytic
 bond
 cleavage
 can
 occur.
This
 is
 illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 1b.
 In
 this
 case
 the
 H
 atom
 will
 attach
 to
the
 oxygen
 atom
 and
 the
 alkyl
 group
 to
 the
 cation.
 The
 H
 atom
and
 alkyl
 species
 now
 form
 chemically
 different
 bonds,
 one
 with
the
 oxygen
 atom,
 and
 the
 other
 one
 with
 the
 metal
 atom.
 There
is
 then
 no
 change
 in
 the
 formal
 valence
 of
 the
 cation.
 A
 compu-
tationally
 well
 studied
 example
 is
 the
 activation
 of
 a
 C
 H
 bond
by
 small
 GaxOy or
 ZnxOz clusters
 located
 within
 the
 micropores
 of
zeolites
 [30].
 In
 the
 left
 part
 of
 Fig.
 1b
 the
 transition
 state
 of
 the
C
 H
 bond
 cleavage
 in
 ethane
 is
 shown
 for
 heterolytic
 activation
on
 a
 Ga2O22+ cluster
 embedded
 in
 the
 zeolite
 micropore.
 Another
example
 of
 a
 heterolytic
 reaction
 is
 the
 dissociative
 H2O
 adsorption
to
 non-reducing
 oxide
 surfaces.
 In
 this
 case
 the
 OH
 group
 attaches
to
 the
 cation
 and
 the
 proton
 to
 a
 surface
 oxygen
 atom.
In
 summary,
 in
 a
 homolytic
 dissociation
 reaction
 two
 equiva-
lent
 bonds
 are
 formed
 between
 the
 adsorbate
 fragments
 and
 the
reactive
 surface
 cation,
 while
 in
 a
 heterolytic
 dissociation
 reaction
one
 of
 the
 fragments
 attaches
 to
 the
 cation,
 the
 other
 to
 the
 anion.
If
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 case
 the
 redox
 state
 of
 the
 cation
 will
 change,
 this
 does
not
 have
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 second
 case.
Although
 this
 does
 not
 concern
 an
 oxidation
 reaction,
 it
 is
 useful
to
 compare
 the
 heterolytic
 dissociation
 reaction
 with
 proton
 acti-
vation
 of
 a
 C
 H
 bond
 of
 methane,
 shown
 in
 the
 right
 part
 of
 Fig.
 1b.
This
 also
 leads
 to
 qualitatively
 different
 bonds
 of
 reaction
 fragments
with
 the
 metal-oxide
 surface.
 In
 this
 example
 the
 activation
 of
 the
organic
 molecule
 by
 the
 zeolite
 proton
 generates
 a
 H2 molecule
 and
a
 positively
 charged
 carbenium
 ion
 that
 will
 re-adsorb
 to
 the
 neg-
atively
 charged
 surface
 oxygen
 atom.
 The
 H
 atom
 that
 is
 generated
by
 C
 H
 bond
 cleavage
 forms
 a
 
 H
 H
 bond
 whereas
 the
 CH3 cation
reacts
 with
 the
 zeolite
 framework
 anion
 to
 give
 a
 methoxy
 species
[31–33].
 C
 H
 bond
 cleavage
 by
 solid
 acids
 also
 proceeds
 without
change
 of
 the
 redox
 state
 of
 the
 proton
 charge
 compensating
 cation
in
 the
 zeolite
 framework.
Case
 1c
 illustrates
 radical-type
 bond
 activation.
 The
 surface
 oxy-
gen
 atom
 reacts
 with
 the
 H
 atom
 of
 the
 C
 H
 bond
 and
 generates
a
 radical
 intermediate.
 This
 reaction
 of
 the
 O
 atom
 with
 the
 C
 H
bond
 can
 be
 considered
 electrophilic.
 This
 is
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 previ-
ous
 heterolytic
 elementary
 reactions
 when
 a
 nucleophilic

 anion

forms
 a
 chemical
 bond
 with
 a
 proton
 or
 carbenium
 cation.
 Both
fragments
 generated
 by
 bond
 dissociation
 will
 ultimately
 attach
 to
surface
 oxygen
 atoms
 unless
 the
 radical
 intermediate
 reacts
 further
in
 gas
 phase.
 In
 this
 reaction
 the
 surface
 cation
 charge
 decreases.
For
 a
 general
 review
 on
 the
 role
 of
 radicals
 in
 oxidation
 catalysis
we
 refer
 to
 [34].
In
 Fig.
 1c
 the
 transition
 state
 of
 C
 H
 bond
 cleavage
 on
 the
 surface
of
 vanadium
 oxide
 is
 shown.
 It
 results
 in
 one
 valency
 reduction
 of
the
 two
 vanadium
 cations
 attached
 to
 the
 two
 oxygen
 atoms
 that
are
 part
 of
 this
 transition
 state
 [14,35,36].
 Formally
 such
 a
 reac-
tion
 can
 also
 be
 considered
 homolytic,
 but
 differs
 from
 oxidation
addition
 because
 no
 direct
 contact
 with
 the
 metal
 atom
 is
 made.
 In
subsequent
 reaction
 steps
 the
 product
 desorbs
 as
 an
 oleﬁn.
The
 reactivity
 of
 this
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 correlates
 with
the
 reduction
 energy
 of
 the
 oxide
 to
 a
 lower
 stoichiometric
 oxide.
This
 is,
 for
 instance,
 the
 reason
 for
 the
 higher
 activity
 of
 alkane
activation
 by
 V2O5 compared
 to
 MoO3 [37].
The
 mixed
 oxides
 such
 as
 Bi2O3/MoO3 that
 convert
 propylene
to
 acrolein
 initiate
 the
 reaction
 by
 allyl
 formation
 through
 H
 atom
abstraction
 by
 a
 BiO
 group.
 The
 allyl
 reacts
 in
 a
 subsequent
 step
with
 the
 Mo  oxide
 through
 an
 oxo-metallo-cycle
 intermediate,
 in
which
 Mo  activates
 C
 H
 and
 O
 inserts
 [38].
 Such
 oxygen
 insertion
reactions
 are
 the
 topic
 of
 the
 next
 subsection.
Methane
 activation
 by
 Li-doped
 MgO
 is
 also
 an
 important
 exam-
ple
 of
 radical
 initiation
 by
 H
 abstraction
 [17,39].
 Gas
 phase
 radicals
can
 recombine
 to
 give
 ethane
 or
 ethylene
 by
 subsequent
 dehy-
drogenation.
 Ethylene
 selectivity
 can
 be
 substantial
 as
 long
 as
conversion
 is
 not
 too
 high.
2.2.
 Oxygen
 insertion
 reactions
There
 is
 an
 extensive
 literature
 on
 the
 state
 of
 reactive
 O
 on
reducible
 surfaces,
 see
 [40].
 When
 reaction
 occurs
 with
 a

 there
 are
 two
 essentially
 different
 reaction
 modes
 that
differentiate
 between
 reaction
 with
 electrophilic
 and
 nucleophilic
oxygen
 (see
 Figs.
 1d
 and
 1e),
 respectively.
Nucleophilic
 oxygen
 is
 the
 typical
 state
 of
 an
 O
 atom
 adsorbed
to
 an
 electron-rich
 metal
 surface,
 or
 an
 O
 atom
 that
 is
 part
 of
 a
reducible
 metal-oxide
 with
 M
 O
 bonds
 of
 low
 polarizability
 of
the
 oxygen
 electrons
 towards
 the
 cation.
 Such
 nucleophilic
 oxygen
atoms
 activate
 preferentially
 C
 H
 bonds
 and
 will
 react
 and
 will
add
 to
 the
 C
 atom
 that
 has
 become
 reactive
 by
 internal
 H
 transfer.
The
 intermediate
 state
 of
 such
 a
 reaction
 is
 a
 four
 atom
 oxo-
metallo-cycle
 (OMC).
 Decomposition
 of
 the
 OMC
 complex
 gives
 the
aldehyde
 or
 ketone.
 This
 type
 of
 oxygen
 atom
 reactivity
 is
 called
nucleophilic,
 since
 electron
 rich
 O
 reacts
 through
 initial
 contact
with
 the
 electron-poor
 H
 atom
 of
 the
 C
 H
 bond.
 Upon
 O
 insertion
the
 metal
 surface
 cation
 is
 reduced
 with
 two
 electron
 units.
Electrophilic
 oxygen
 atoms
 are
 coordinated
 to
 cations
 that
 are
strong
 electron
 acceptors.
 Upon
 contact
 with
 a
 substrate
 C
 C
 bond
the
 O
 atoms
 insert
 into
 the
 electron
 rich
 C
 C
 double
 bond
 without
activation
 of
 a
 C
 H
 bond.
 An
 example
 is
 the
 epoxidation
 reaction
 of
ethylene
 catalyzed
 by
 Ag
 [41].
 The
 corresponding
 transition
 state
is
 illustrated
 in
 the
 right
 part
 of
 Fig.
 1e.
 On
 the
 oxidized
 Ag
 surface
the
 oxygen
 atoms
 react
 electrophilic
 and
 insert
 directly
 into
 the
C
 C
 bond.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 as
 is
 illustrated
 by
 Fig.
 1d,
 when
 the
Ag
 surface
 is
 metallic
 (low
 oxygen
 coverage)
 an
 OMC
 intermediate
is
 formed.
 Now
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 reacts
 nucleophilic
 and
 acetalde-
hyde
 is
 formed
 upon
 desorption
 of
 the
 product
 [42,43].
 Another
example
 of
 an
 electrophilic
 reaction
 is
 the
 insertion
 reaction
 of
 an
oxygen
 atom
 attached
 to
 a
 Fe2+ cation
 located
 in
 the
 cavity
 of
 a
zeolite
 micropore.
 The
 corresponding
 transition
 state
 is
 shown
 in
the
 left
 part
 of
 Fig.
 1e
 [44].
 The
 electropositive
 oxygen
 atom
 inserts
into
 the
 electron-rich
 bond
 of
 benzene,
 because
 it
 can
 readily
 accept
an
 electron
 in
 an
 anti-bonding
 unoccupied
 Fe
 O
 molecular
 orbital
[45].
An
 oxygen
 atom
 can
 also
 be
 inserted
 from
 a

 that
 still
 contains
 an
 O

 bond.

 Elementary
 considerations
 of
 chemical
 bonding
 features
of
 reducible
 oxides
The
 M
 O
 bond
 is
 a
 polar
 bond,
 so
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 a
 covalent
interaction
 there
 is
 often
 a
 large
 ionic
 contribution
 to
 the
 interac-
tion
 energy.
One
 of
 the
 classical
 questions
 in
 oxide
 inorganic
 chemistry
 is
how
 the
 relative
 contributions
 of
 these
 two
 energetic
 components
vary
 for
 the
 different
 compounds
 and
 how
 this
 affects
 trends
 in
oxide
 chemical
 properties
 [54].
 Due
 to
 the
 present
 advances
 in
quantum-chemical
 computations,
 empirical
 analyses
 as
 those
 by
Sanderson
 [54]
 can
 now
 be
 complemented
 with
 a
 detailed
 analy-
sis
 of
 electronic
 structural
 features,
 and
 these
 on
 their
 turn
 can
 be
related
 to
 surface
 reactivity
 properties.
An
 interesting
 consequence
 of
 the
 large
 contribution
 of
 ionic
bonding
 to
 the
 chemical
 bond
 strength
 in
 the
 oxides
 is
 illustrated
by
 Fig.
 2,
 which
 compares
 for
 a
 set
 of
 oxides
 of
 similar
 structure
the
 relation
 between
 surface
 energies
 and
 oxide
 energies
 of
 for-
mation.
 It
 appears
 that
 surface
 energies
 and
 heats
 of
 formation
show
 an
 inverse
 relation.
 This
 is
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 metal
 surfaces
where
 this
 relation
 would
 be
 proportional.
 Then
 the
 surface
 energy
is
 proportional
 to
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 metal–metal
 bonds
 that
 are
broken.
For
 a
 predominantly
 ionic
 surface
 one
 ﬁnds
 also
 substantially
lower
 surface
 energies
 (this
 can
 be
 as
 much
 as
 a
 factor
 of
 10)
 com-
pared
 to
 those
 of
 the
 metal
 surfaces.
 It
 is
 because
 the
 surfaces
that
 are
 separated
 have
 to
 be
 electrostatically
 neutral
 at
 inﬁnite
distance.
Scheme

 Born–Haber
 cycle
 of
 compound
 formation
 for
 a
 mono-oxide
 compound
[56].
This
 has
 the
 important
 consequence
 that
 when
 particle
 size
decreases
 the
 relative
 stability
 of
 the
 ionic
 oxidic
 particle
 increases
with
 respect
 to
 that
 of
 the
 metal
 particle.
 It
 results
 in
 the
 increase
 in
temperature
 of
 reduction
 of
 the
 oxide
 particles
 when
 their
 particle
size
 decreases.
To
 understand
 the
 energetics
 of
 the
 oxides,
 with
 dominantly
ionic
 chemical
 bonds,
 it
 is
 useful
 to
 inspect
 the
 Born-Haber
 cycle
 of
ionic
 compound
 formation,
 illustrated
 in
 Scheme
 1.
The
 ﬁrst
 imaginary
 step
 in
 this
 process
 is
 the
 sublimation
 of
 the
metal
 (Hsubl)
 and
 the
 dissociation
 of
 the
 O2 molecule
 (Hdiss).
Then
 electron
 transfer
 is
 considered
 between
 the
 atoms
 at
 inﬁnite
distance,
 that
 is
 determined
 by
 the
 ionization
 energy
 (HI)
 and
 the
electron
 afﬁnity
 (HE).
 In
 a
 subsequent
 step,
 formation
 of
 the
 bulk
compound
 then
 adds
 the
 attractive
 ionic
 energy
 (HU).
 Within
 this
ionic
 compound
 formation
 mechanism,
 the
 attractive
 contribution
to
 the
 bulk
 formation
 energy
 is
 the
 ionic
 interaction
 energy
 HU
that
 is
 also
 called
 the
 Madelung
 energy.
 It
 is
 determined
 by
 the
 sum
of
 the
 electrostatic
 interactions.
In
 an
 early
 paper
 by
 Gelatt
 et
 al.
 [57]
 compound
 formation
 is
analyzed
 in
 an
 analogous
 way,
 based
 on
 DFT
 local

 cal-
culations.
 By
 removal
 of
 the
 anionic
 atoms
 an
 artiﬁcial
 lattice
 of
metal
 atoms
 is
 created,
 with
 an
 energy
 cost
 that
 relates
 to
 the
 sub-
limation
 energy
 of
 the
 corresponding
 metals,
 but
 slightly
 less
 since
some
 metal–metal
 atom
 interaction
 may
 still
 be
 maintained.
 Com-
pound
 formation
 is
 the
 result
 of
 the
 insertion
 of
 the
 oxygen
 atoms,
or
 as
 in
 their
 reported
 case
 ﬂuoride
 atoms.
 For
 the
 metal
 atoms
located
 in
 the
 left
 part
 of
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system
 differences
in
 the
 overall
 metal-oxide

 do
 relate
 to
 a
 com-
bination
 of
 the
 Madelung
 energy
 and
 the
 electron

 energy
from
 metal
 atom
 to
 oxygen
 atom.
We
 will
 now
 discuss
 in
 more
 detail
 properties
 that
 relate
 to
 the
Madelung
 potential.
 Differences
 in
 the
 Madelung
 energy
 relate
 to
variations
 of
 the
 Madelung
 constant
 of
 a
 material.
 The
 Madelung
constant
 M
 of
 a
 material
 is
 the
 proportionality
 constant
 of
 the
electrostatic
 energy
 of
 an
 ionic
 solid
 to
 the
 energy
 of

between

 neighbour
 cations
 and

well
 as
 Madelung
 energies
 are
 relatively
 small,
 which
 agrees
 with
the
 relatively
 low
 values
 of
 the
 surface
 energies
 of
 the
 ionic
 com-
pounds.
 This
 is
 illustrated
 in
 Table
 2.
This
 table
 compares
 Madelung
 energy
 changes
 for
 the
 anatase

 surface
 and
 for
 the
 rutile
 TiO2(1

 surface
 as
 a
 function
of
 position
 of
 the
 cations
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 surface
 layer
 [58].
The
 Ti4+ cations
 are
 octahedrally
 coordinated
 to
 six
 oxygen
anions.
 As
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3
 the
 difference
 in
 structure
 of
 anatase
and
 rutile
 is
 due
 to
 the
 different
 packing
 of
 the
 octahedral
 TiO6
units.
 In
 the
 anatase
 case
 the
 octahedra
 are
 surrounded
 tetrahe-
drally
 with
 other
 octahedra,
 in
 the
 rutile
 structure
 the
 octahedral
units
 are
 oriented
 parallel
 in
 rows.
 The
 differences
 in
 packing
 of
 the
octahedra
 result
 in
 small
 Madelung
 energy
 differences
 between
 the
two
 structures.
 Noteworthy
 are
 the
 small
 differences
 between
 the
bulk
 and
 surface
 values
 and
 the
 rapid
 convergence
 of
 the
 Madelung
potentials
 to
 bulk
 values
 with
 increasing
 distance
 to
 the
 surface
layer
 (see
 Table
 2).
Clearly
 a
 decrease
 in
 nearest
 neighbour
 coordination
 numbers
decreases
 the
 Madelung
 energy.
 When
 there
 is
 no
 change
 in
 local
coordination,
 changes
 are
 due
 to
 interactions
 with
 ions
 in
 the
higher
 cation
 or
 anion
 coordination
 shells.
The
 decrease
 in
 Madelung
 energy
 at
 the
 surface
 is
 a
 measure
 for
the
 electrostatic
 contribution
 to
 the
 surface
 energy
 and
 represents
the
 cost
 of
 surface
 energy
 formation.
 Surface
 energies
 for
 different
surfaces
 are
 summarized
 in
 Fig.
 3.
In
 ionic
 compounds
 of
 the
 same
 structure
 and
 the
 same
 cation
charges,
 the
 heat
 of
 formation
 changes
 mainly
 because
 of
 variations
in
 the
 metal
 atom
 sublimation
 and
 ionization
 energies.
In
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system
 both
 properties
 vary
 with
d-valence
 electron
 occupation.
 The
 ionization
 potential
 tends
 to
uniformly
 increase
 with
 d-valence
 electron
 number
 and
 only
decreases
 when
 the
 d-valence
 electron
 shell
 becomes
 completely
ﬁlled.
 Zeng
 et
 al.
 [59]
 showed,
 by
 a
 comparative
 study
 of
 the
 for-
mation
 energies
 of
 different
 mixed
 oxide
 perovskites,
 a
 uniform
increase
 of
 the
 heat
 of
 formation
 when
 the
 reducible
 cation
 varies
its
 position
 in
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system
 from
 right
 to
 left.
 This
 is
valid
 for
 a
 constant
 formal
 charge
 on
 the
 cation.
 However,
 when
 the
formal
 charge
 on
 the
 reducible
 metal
 cation
 increases
 by
 different
choice
 of
 the
 other
 non-reducible
 cation,
 the
 energy
 of
 formation
curve
 shifts
 to
 increasingly
 smaller
 values.
 These
 decreases
 are
due
 to
 the
 increasing
 cost
 of
 electron
 transfer
 from
 the
 reducible
metal
 atom
 to
 oxygen
 atom.
 As
 we
 will
 discuss
 in
 the
 next
 section
the
 weakening
 of
 the
 covalent
 contribution
 to
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 also
contributes
 to
 the
 decrease
 in
 heat
 of
 formation
 when
 position
 of
metal
 atom
 changes
 from
 left
 to
 right
 in
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 sys-
tem,
 because
 of
 increased
 population
 of
 anti-bonding
 M
 O
 orbitals
especially
 for
 the
 Group
 VIII
 metal
 containing
 oxides.
One
 observes
 in
 Fig.
 2
 the
 high
 heat
 of
 metal
 oxide
 formation
 for
the
 metal
 atoms
 with
 the
 lower
 ionization
 energies,
 but
 also
 that
the
 corresponding
 dominantly
 ionic
 compounds
 have
 a
 low
 surface
energy.
 The
 inverse
 relation
 between
 heat
 of
 formation
 and
 surface
energy
 is
 because
 the
 large
 contributions
 to
 the
 bulk
 heat
 of
 forma-
tion
 due
 to
 electron
 transfer
 do
 not
 contribute
 to
 the
 differences
in
 surface
 energy.
 For
 ionic
 compounds
 this
 low
 surface
 energy
is
 mainly
 determined
 by
 the
 Madelung
 energy
 reduction
 by
 sur-
face
 formation.
 Whereas
 there
 is
 generally
 a
 small
 reduction
 in
 ion
charges
 at
 the
 surface
 compared
 to
 the
 bulk
 (as
 we
 will
 explain
 later
this
 is
 reﬂected
 in
 the
 smaller
 energy
 band
 gap
 between
 valence
and
 conduction
 band
 energies),
 in
 partially
 covalent
 compounds
the
 surface
 energy
 formation
 cost
 is
 mainly
 due
 to
 the
 change
 in
electrostatic
 as
 well
 as
 covalent
 interaction
 energies.
 Nonetheless,
the
 electrostatic
 contribution
 decreases
 for
 metal
 atoms
 when
 their
ionization
 energy
 increases
 because
 of
 reduced
 charge
 transfer.
Therefore
 one
 concludes
 that
 the
 increase
 in
 surface
 energy
 in
 con-
trast
 to
 the
 decrease
 in
 bulk
 oxide
 formation
 energy
 reﬂects
 the
increasing
 relative
 contribution
 of
 the
 covalent
 interaction
 to
 the
oxide
 chemical
 bond.
In
 the
 next
 section
 we
 will
 discuss
 quantum-chemical
 aspects
 of
the
 metal
 oxide
 chemical
 bond
 and
 we  will
 relate
 this
 to
 differences
in
 the
 surface
 reactivity.

 Ionic

 electronic
 structure,
 reducibility
 and
 heterolytic
reactivity
We
 will
 consider
 as
 prototype
 compounds
 of
 ionic
 reducible
oxides
 TiO2 and
 CeO2.
 TiO2 is,
 amongst
 others,
 useful
 as
 a
 pho-
tocatalyst
 [7].
 Photoreduction
 in
 water
 can
 also
 activate
 O2,
 which
generates
 OH
 radicals
 useful
 for
 the
 oxidation
 of
 chlorinated
 hydro-
carbons
 [60–62].
 CeO2 is
 used
 as
 a
 promoting
 support
 in
 automotive
exhaust
 catalysis
 [63,64].
 Its
 ease
 of
 reduction
 assists
 low
 temper-
ature
 CO
 oxidation
 [65].
We
 will
 discuss
 the
 relation
 between
 electronic
 structure
 and
reactivity
 for
 dissociative
 water
 adsorption
 on
 TiO2 and
 the
 surface
reduction
 of
 CeO2,
 respectively.
In
 TiO2 and
 CeO2 the
 Ti
 and
 Ce
 cations
 have
 both
 formal
 valencies
+4.
 In
 Ti,
 originally
 2
 electrons
 are
 located
 in
 the
 valence
 3d
 atomic
orbitals
 and
 2
 electrons
 in
 the
 Ti4s atomic
 orbitals.
 For
 the
 Ce
 atom
the
 valence
 electron
 distributions
 is
 different,
 with
 2
 electrons
 in
the
 6s
 atomic
 orbitals
 and
 1
 electron
 in
 each
 of
 the
 4f
 and
 5d
 atomic
orbitals.
 The
 chemical
 bonding
 features
 of
 the
 respective
 oxides
near
 their
 respective
 Fermi
 levels
 are
 shown
 in
 Figs.

 and

 The
 structures,
 the
 common
 surface
 terminations,
 and
 the
 corresponding
 surface
 free
 energies
 computed
 by
 DFT
 for
 (a)
 TiO2 anatase,
 and
 (b)
 TiO2 rutile
 [53,54].
In
 Fig.
 4a
 we
 provide
 the
 Partial
 Density
 of
 States
 (PDOS)
 for
 TiO2.
The
 PDOS
 gives
 the
 probabilities
 to
 ﬁnd
 an
 electron
 of
 particular
energy
 in
 an
 atomic
 orbital
 of
 the
 oxide
 compound:
PDOSi =

n

ϕi| n

ı (E −
 En)
 n|ϕi

=

n

cn
i

2ı (E −
 En)
(2)
where
 ci is
 the
 coefﬁcient
 of
 atomic
 orbital
 ϕi in
 molecular
 orbital
 n,
 and
 En is
 the
 eigenvalue
 of
  n.
While
 the
 PDOS
 plots
 offer
 useful
 information
 on
 the
 electron
density
 distribution,
 it
 does
 not
 show
 whether
 the
 contribution
 to
the
 chemical
 bond
 will
 be
 bonding,
 non-bonding
 or
 anti-bonding.
Such
 information
 can
 be
 obtained
 from
 a
 calculation
 of
 the
 Crys-
tal
 Overlap
 Hamiltonian
 Population
 (COHP),
 which
 partitions
 the
electron
 density
 contributions
 into
 bonding,
 non-bonding,
 and
anti-bonding
 domains
 [67–69].
 The
 expression
 of
 COHP
 is
 given
by
 the
 following
 equations:
COHPij (E) =
 Hij

n

ϕi| n

ı (E  −
 En)
 n|ϕj

=
 Hij

n
cn
i cm
j ı (E  −
 En)
(3)
where
 Hij is
 a
 Hamiltonian
 matrix
 element
 between
 atomic
 orbitals
ϕi and
 ϕj.
Because
 the
 matrix
 element
 Hij relates
 to
 the
 overlap
 energy
 of
 a
bond,
 when
 attractive
 it
 will
 have
 a
 negative
 value.
 When
 analyzing
the
 chemical
 bonds
 in
 terms
 of
 bonding,
 non-bonding,
 anti-bonding
contribution
 we
 will
 plot–COHP.
As
 Fig.
 4a
 shows,
 we  can
 distinguish
 below
 the
 Fermi
 level
two
 PDOS
 domains:
 the
 PDOS
 domain
 dominated
 by
 occupied
 O2s
atomic
 orbitals
 (around
 −17
 eV)
 and
 the
 PDOS
 domain
 dominated
by
 occupied
 O2p atomic
 orbitals
 (between
 −6
 eV
 and
 the
 Fermi
level).
 We  also
 note
 that
 some
 PDOS
 density
 of
 the
 3d,  4s
 and
 4p
atomic
 orbitals
 of
 Ti
 is
 present
 in
 the
 occupied
 local
 density
 of
 states
regimes.
 These
 are
 the
 valence
 band
 of
 the
 oxide.
 Above
 the
 Fermi
level
 the
 conduction
 bands
 are
 located.
 Closest
 to
 the
 Fermi
 level
we
 observe
 the
 corresponding
 unoccupied
 DOS
 dominated
 mainly
by
 Ti3d atomic
 orbitals.
In
 Fig.
 4b
 we
 can
 explicitly
 distinguish
 between
 bonding
 and
anti-bonding
 interaction
 regimes.
 We  observe
 the
 bonding
 area
below
 the
 Fermi
 level
 dominated
 by
 the
 interaction
 between
 Ti3d
and
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 Above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 the
 associated
 anti-
bonding
 regime
 is
 observed.
 In
 Fig.
 4a
 and
 b
 we  observe
 above
+10
 eV
 a
 substantial
 PDOS
 due
 to
 the
 anti-bonding
 interaction
 of
 the
4s
 and
 4p
 Ti
 atomic
 orbitals.
 Therefore,
 the
 valence
 electron
 orbital
structure
 of
 TiO2 can
 be
 best
 described
 as
 a
 state
 with
 substantial
electron
 transfer
 from
 3d
 and
 4s
 atomic
 orbitals
 of
 Ti
 into
 the
 O2p
atomic
 orbitals.
 The
 Ti4p atomic
 orbital
 also
 has
 a
 weak
 interaction
with
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 Since
 there
 is
 also
 in
 the
 conduction
band
 a
 contribution
 of
 the
 O2p PDOS,
 electron
 transfer
 from
 Ti
 to
 O
is
 not
 complete
 and
 their
 effective
 charges
 are
 less
 that
 the
 formal
charges.
 The
 computed
 Bader
 charge
 for
 Ti
 is
 +2.12
 electrons.
As
 an
 additional
 remark,
 we  notice
 that
 the
 presence
 of
 the
anti-bonding
 states
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 implies
 that
 when
 the
electron
 count
 on
 the
 metal
 atom
 increases,
 the
 additional
 elec-
tron
 will
 push
 the
 Fermi
 level
 into
 the
 anti-bonding
 regime,
 with
negative
 consequences
 on
 the
 system
 stability.
In
 CeO2 (Fig.
 5a)
 we
 also
 note
 below
 the
 Fermi
 level
 the
completely
 occupied
 electron
 density
 of
 the
 O2s atomic
 orbitals,
and
 the
 nearly
 completely
 occupied
 electron
 density
 of
 the
 O2p
atomic
 orbitals.
 Near
 the
 Fermi
 level
 we  observe
 the
 bonding
and
 anti-bonding
 contributions
 of
 the
 Ce4f atomic
 orbitals.
 The
large
 anti-bonding
 peak
 of
 Ce4f atomic
 orbital
 and
 the
 low
 den-
sity
 of
 the
 O2p at
 the
 same
 position
 (+2.5
 eV)
 indicate
 depletion
of
 the
 electrons
 for
 the
 4f
 atomic
 orbital.
 Below
 the
 Fermi
 level
the
 main
 electron
 density
 resides
 on
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 There
is
 a
 small
 bonding
 interaction
 with
 the
 Ce4f as
 well
 as
 with
 Ce5d
atomic
 orbitals.
 Above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 we  ﬁnd
 a
 substantial
 unoc-
cupied
 electron
 density
 of
 the
 anti-bonding
 interaction
 of
 the
 Ce5d
orbitals
 (5–10
 eV)
 which
 indicates
 substantial
 electron
 transfer
 also
from
 the
 Ce5d into
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 These
 orbital
 interactions
lead
 to
 strong
 attractive
 interactions.
 At
 [−13,
 −19]
 eV
 below
 the
Fermi
 level
 we
 observe
 the
 electron
 density
 contribution
 of
 the
 O2s
atomic
 orbitals

 has
 a

 interaction
 with
 Ce5p atomic

 The

 [108–112].

 which
 are
 completely
 occupied
 in
 the
 free
 Ce
 atom.
 The
overall
 interaction
 of
 the
 Ce5p atomic
 orbitals
 with
 the
 O
 atoms
is
 repulsive,
 the
 respective
 bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
 molecular
orbital
 fragments
 being
 both
 occupied.
 The
 corresponding
 anti-
bonding
 orbital
 interactions
 are
 in
 the
 O2s electron
 regime
 (−13
 eV)
as
 well
 as
 in
 the
 O2p electron
 density
 regime
 below
 the
 Fermi
 level
(−4
 eV).
 In
 the
 lowest
 part
 of
 the
 valence
 band
 (−35
 eV)
 a
 bonding
contribution
 mainly
 coming
 from
 the
 Ce6s atomic
 orbitals
 can
 be
identiﬁed.
 The
 corresponding
 anti-bonding
 contribution
 is
 in
 the
energy
 regime
 [−5
 eV,
 −1
 eV].
 The
 small
 contribution
 of
 electron
density
 of
 the
 Ce6s atomic
 orbital
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 indicates
that
 the
 Ce6s atomic
 orbital
 donates
 also
 a
 fraction
 of
 its
 electrons
into
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 A
 positive
 charge
 on
 the
 Ce
 ion
 of
 +2.38
electrons
 is
 calculated
 according
 to
 Bader
 analysis.
 It
 is
 due
 to
 elec-
tron
 depopulation
 mainly
 from
 the
 Ce4f and
 Ce5d atomic
 orbitals.
As
 for
 Ti
 we
 observe
 substantial
 but
 not
 complete
 electron
 transfer,
so
 that
 formal
 charges
 are
 not
 reached.
From
 the
 separation
 of
 the
 respective
 orbital
 contributions
 in
occupied
 valence
 and
 unoccupied
 conduction
 bands
 respectively,
with
 very
 different
 contributions
 of
 metal
 versus
 oxygen
 atomic
orbitals,
 the
 TiO2 as
 well
 as
 CeO2 materials
 can
 be
 concluded
 to
 be
highly
 ionic.

 Due
 to
 the
 large
 height
 of
 the
 Ce6s peak
 (74),
and
 of
 the
 Ce5d peak
 (13),
 found
 in
 the
 energetic
 interval
 [−34
 eV,
 −33
 eV],
 these
peaks
 have
 not
 been
 displayed
 entirely.
 The
 zero
 of
 the
 energy
 corresponds
 to
 the
Fermi
 energy.
 From
 [66].
In
 these
 ionic
 materials,
 the
 difference
 in
 energies
 of
 conduction
and
 valence
 band
 electrons
 –
 the
 band
 gap
 energy
 –
 relates
 to
 the
energy
 cost
 to
 transfer
 an
 electron
 from
 an
 O2p atomic
 orbital
 to
 a
Ti3d or
 Ce4f atomic
 orbital.
 In
 an
 ionic
 material
 this
 is
 proportional
to
 the
 Madelung
 energy,
 which
 gives
 the
 difference
 in
 potential
 of
an
 electron
 on
 the
 cation
 (repulsive
 interaction)
 and
 anion
 (attrac-
tive
 interaction).
 The
 Madelung
 energy
 cost
 is
 a
 measure
 for
 the
reducibility
 of
 a
 surface.
 For
 an
 ionic
 material
 this
 relates
 to
 the
differences
 in
 band
 gap
 energies
 between
 valence
 and
 conduction
electrons
 at
 the
 respective
 surfaces.
 As
 we
 will
 see
 in
 the
 next
 sec-
tion
 this
 interpretation
 of
 the
 band
 gap
 energy
 is
 only
 valid
 as
 long
as
 covalent
 contributions
 to
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 are
 negligible.
When
 coordinative
 unsaturation
 of
 the
 surface
 atoms
 increases,
the
 surface
 Madelung
 constant
 decreases
 and
 hence
 also
 the
 band
gap
 energy
 difference
 of
 the
 valence
 and
 conduction
 bands.
We
 will
 now
 compare
 the
 reactivity
 of
 different
 ionic
 surfaces
for
 two
 cases.
 We  start
 with
 a
 discussion
 on
 the
 reducibility
 of
 CeO2
as
 a
 function
 of
 CeO2 surface
 termination.
 Following
 we
 will
 discuss
water
 dissociation
 by

 and

surface
 has
 6-coordinated
 Ce
 atoms
 and
 2-coordinated
 O
 atoms.
With
 the
 particular
 DFT
 method
 used,
 the
 calculated
 band
 gap
energy
 of
 the
 bulk
 CeO2 was
 found
 to
 be
 equal
 to
 2.35
 eV.
 For
 the
three
 surfaces
 this
 band
 gap
 decreases
 to
 2.02,
 1.67
 and
 1.69
 eV,
respectively
 [66]. This
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 decrease
 in
 Madelung
energy
 for
 the
 more
 open
 surfaces,
 which
 follows
 the
 trend
 of
increasing
 coordinative
 unsaturation
 of
 the
 surface
 atoms.
 The
 cal-
culated
 surface
 energies
 are
 0.68,
 1.01
 and
 1.41
 J/m2,
 respectively
[21].
 The
 ascending
 trend
 in
 surface
 energies
 is
 expected
 based
 on
the
 increasing
 coordinative
 unsaturation
 of
 the
 surface
 atoms.
Using
 the
 same
 DFT
 methodology
 the
 following
 vacancy
 for-
mation
 energies
 have
 been
 reported:
 2.60,
 1.99
 and
 2.27
 eV,
respectively
 [20,21].
 This
 order
 agrees
 very
 well
 with
 the
 differ-
ence
 in
 reducibility
 of
 these
 surfaces
 as
 experimentally
 observed
[65].
 Because
 of
 the
 increased
 degree
 of
 coordinative
 unsatura-
tion
 one
 would
 expect
 that
 the
 vacancy
 formation
 energy
 would
be
 least
 for
 the
 surface
 with
 the
 highest
 surface
 energy.
 How-
ever,
 an
 inversion
 of
 the
 order
 of
 energy
 of
 vacancy
 formation
compared
 to
 the
 trend
 in
 surface
 energies
 is
 found
 for
 the
 (1
 1
 0)
and
 (1
 0
 0)
 surfaces.
 This
 is
 due
 to
 the
 substantially
 large
 relax-
ation
 energy
 of
 the
 (100)
 surface
 [21]
 due
 to
 its
 relaxation
 from
bulk-extrapolated
 atom
 positions.
 This
 relation
 of
 surface
 atom
positions
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 unexpectedly
 small
 difference
 in
Madelung
 energies
 of
 the
 (1
 1
 0)
 and
 (1
 0
 0)
 surfaces.
 Thus,
 sur-
face
 atom
 position
 relaxation
 and
 rearrangement
 can
 give
 a
 very
important
 additional
 contribution
 to
 the
 surface
 reactivity
 of
 oxide
surfaces.
 Such
 effects
 sometimes
 dominate
 surface
 reactivity
 differ-
ences
 rather
 than
 electronic
 structure
 or
 coordinative
 unsaturation
differences
 [70].
Another
 example
 of
 the
 importance
 of
 surface
 reconstruction
 as
a
 response
 to
 a
 surface
 reaction
 is
 given
 by
 the
 dissociative
 water
adsorption
 to
 the
 TiO2 anatase
 (0
 0
 1)
 and
 (1
 0
 1)
 surfaces.
 Their
differences
 in
 surface
 reactivity,
 surface
 structures
 and
 valence
electron
 distributions,
 respectively,
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7.
Comparison
 of
 their
 respective
 PDOSs
 shows
 only
 minor
 differ-
ences,
 but
 their
 surface
 reactivity
 is
 very
 different.
 The
 difference
in
 surface
 energies
 of
 Ti(0
 0
 1)
 and
 Ti(1
 0
 1)
 predicts
 the
 Ti(0
 0
 1)
surface
 to
 be
 most
 reactive,
 because
 of
 its
 lower
 stability
 (see
 Fig.
 3).
DFT
 calculations
 on
 the
 (0
 0
 1)
 surface
 indicate
 that
 dissociative
adsorption
 of
 H2O
 has
 a
 low
 barrier
 and
 is
 highly
 exothermic.
 The
reactivity
 of
 the
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface
 is
 found
 to
 be
 very
 different.
 Disso-
ciative
 H2O
 adsorption
 is
 now
 only
 slightly
 exothermic.
 Whereas
coordinative
 unsaturation
 of
 the
 Ti
 and
 O
 atoms
 on
 the
 two
 sur-
faces
 is
 comparable,
 the
 surface
 structure
 topologies
 and
 stabilities
are
 very
 different.
 The
 latter
 determines
 the
 reactivity
 difference.
The
 alternating
 ﬁve
 and
 six
 coordination
 of
 Ti
 on
 the
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface
makes
 the
 surface
 more
 rigid
 compared
 to
 the

 surface,
 that
exposes
 only

 coordinated
 Ti
 atoms.

bridging
 O
 atom
 becomes
 protonated.
 In
 this
 case
 the
 bridging
 O
atom
 does
 not
 connect
 the
 Ti
 atom
 with
 the
 end-on
 OH
 attached,
as
 was
 initially
 the
 case
 for
 the
 Ti(0
 0
 1)
 surface.
 The
 vibrational
 fre-
quencies
 of
 the
 two
 OH
 groups
 formed
 on
 the
 Ti(1
 0
 1)
 surface
 are
different.
 The
 low
 frequency
 of
 the
 proton
 attached
 to
 the
 bridg-
ing
 oxygen
 atom
 indicates
 Brønsted
 acidity,
 whereas
 the
 higher
frequency
 of
 the
 end-on
 OH
 group
 is
 an
 indication
 of
 its
 Brønsted
basicity.
The
 PDOS
 plots
 from
 Fig.
 7
 show
 a
 new
 low
 energy
 peak
 due
 to
atomic
 hydrogen
 attachment.
 In
 Fig.
 7c
 the
 peak
 intensity
 appears
at
 lower
 energy
 for
 the
 hydrogen
 atom
 attached
 to
 the
 bridging
 O
than
 for
 the
 atop
 adsorbed
 OH
 intermediate,
 which
 in
 view
 of
 the
higher
 frequency
 of
 vibration
 of
 atop
 OH
 is
 unexpected.
 It
 can
 be
understood
 in
 the
 following
 way.
The
 covalent
 interaction
 between
 H
 atom
 and
 oxygen
 atom
leads
 to
 bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
 orbital
 densities
 (this
 we
 will
discuss
 more
 extensively
 in
 the
 next
 subsection).
 Because
 of
 the
average
 higher
 energy
 of
 the
 OH
 electron
 density
 that
 corresponds
to
 atop
 adsorbed
 OH,
 more
 of
 its
 anti-bonding
 density
 will
 be
shifted
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level,
 which
 will
 result
 in
 the
 stronger
bond
 as
 deduced
 from
 its
 vibrational
 frequency.
 The
 lower
 energy
of
 the
 H
 atomic
 orbital
 PDOS
 adsorbed
 to
 bridging
 O,
 relates
 to
the
 Ti
 O
 Ti
 angle.
 When
 this
 is
 180
 degrees,
 the
 OH
 interaction
is
 with
 an
 O2px or
 an
 O2py atomic
 orbital
 orthogonal
 to
 the
 O2pz
orbital
 directed
 along
 the
 corresponding
 O
 Ti
 O
 bonds.
 Because
the
 atomic
 orbitals
 perpendicular
 to
 the
 Ti
 O
 Ti
 direction
 are
localized
 it
 results
 in
 a
 strong
 bonding
 interaction
 of
 H
 and
 O,
 which
of
 course
 will
 decrease
 with
 decreasing
 bond
 angle.
 However,
 for
OH
 atop
 adsorbed
 to
 a
 Ti
 atom,
 the
 H
 atom
 interacts
 with
 an
 O2p
atomic
 orbital
 that
 is
 also
 strongly
 involved
 with
 the
 Ti-O
 bond.
Indeed
 the
 PDOS
 that
 corresponds
 to
 the
 Tid atomic
 orbitals
 shows
that
 this
 interaction
 is
 transmitted
 to
 Ti.
These
 effects
 indicate
 that
 also
 in
 compounds
 with
 a
 predom-
inantly
 ionic
 chemical
 bond
 the
 covalent
 interaction
 part
 with
interacting
 reaction
 intermediates
 can
 be
 essential
 to
 understand
their
 surface
 chemical
 reactivity.

The
 chemical
 bonds
 of
 the
 metal
 oxides
 of
 metals
 of
 high
ionization
 potential
 and
 sublimation
 energy
 will
 have
 a
 high
 cova-
lent
 contribution.
 Electron
 transfer
 between
 metal
 and
 O
 then
 is
reduced
 and
 atomic
 orbital
 energy
 overlap
 between
 valence
 metal
and
 oxygen
 atomic
 orbitals,
 respectively,
 is
 substantial.
 The
 cova-
lent
 bond
 contribution
 to
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 is
 a
 strong
function
 of
 electron
 occupation
 of
 the
 metal
 atom
 valence
 atomic
orbitals.
To
 clarify
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 covalent
 interaction
 we  will
 compare
the
 electronic
 structure
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 in
 a
 metal
 oxide
 with
that
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 of
 chemisorbed
 oxygen
 to
 a
 transition
 metal
surface.
As
 an
 example
 we
 will
 compare
 in
 detail
 chemical
 bonding
 fea-
ture
 of
 the
 O
 atom
 adsorbed
 to
 the
 Pd
 (1
 0
 0)
 surface
 and
 those
 of
the
 O
 atom
 that
 is
 part
 of
 bulk
 PdO
 and
 the
 PdO
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface.
The
 bulk
 PdO
 structure
 and
 that
 of
 the
 stoichiometric
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
surface
 are
 given
 in
 Fig.
 8
In
 bulk
 PdO,
 Pd
 has
 a
 planar
 coordination
 with
 four
 oxygen
atoms,
 which
 on
 their
 turn
 are
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 with
 Pd
ions.
 On
 the
 PdO
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface
 an
 equal
 number
 of
 Pd
 atoms
 are
four
 and
 threefold
 coordinated.
 This
 is
 also
 the
 case
 for
 the
 surface
O
 atoms.
The
 PDOS
 of
 Pd
 metal,
 PdO,
 the
 PdO
 (1

 surface
 and
 O
adsorbed
 to
 the
 Pd(1

 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.

 respectively.
As
 can
 be
 observed
 from
 the
 PDOS
 in
 Fig.
 9a1
 of
 the
 Pd
 metal
the
 valence
 electron
 bandwidth
 of
 d-valence

 band

approximately
 5
 eV,
 whereas
 one
 sees
 in
 the
 corresponding
 Fig.
 9(b)
in
 PdO
 that
 the
 d-band
 width
 reduces
 to
 3.7
 eV.
 This
 indicates
 for
the
 oxide
 increased
 localization
 of
 the
 d-valence
 electrons.
In
 the
 Pd
 metal
 each
 Pd
 atom
 is
 surrounded
 by
 12
 atoms.
 The
three
 dxy,
 dzx,
 and
 dyz atomic
 orbitals
 are
 oriented
 towards
 each
other
 and
 are
 part
 of
 the
 relatively
 broad
 t2g band
 split
 into
 three
peaks
 (shown
 in
 red).
 The
 dz2 and
 dx2−y2 components
 are
 directed
in
 between
 the
 neighboring
 atom
 and
 are
 part
 of
 the
 more
 narrow
eg electron
 density
 band
 (shown
 in
 green).
 A
 substantial
 contribu-
tion
 due
 to
 interaction
 with
 the
 Pd5s electrons
 is
 also
 observed.
The
 COHP’s
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 9a2
 show
 the
 changing
 nature
 of
 the
metal
 valence
 band
 from
 bonding
 to
 anti-bonding
 with
 increasing
electron
 energy.
The
 anti-bonding
 nature
 of
 the
 chemical
 bond
 near
 the
 Fermi
level
 indicates
 that
 the
 cohesive
 energy
 will
 increase
 when
 valence
electron
 occupation
 depletes.
 This
 is
 the
 case
 for
 the
 group
 VIII
metals
 located
 to
 the
 left
 of
 Pd
 in
 the
 same
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
system.
In

 for
 PdO
 the
 PDOS
 and
 COHP’s
 of
 the
 metal
 4d-valence
electron
 of
 the
 four-fold
 coordinated
 Pd
 ion
 and
 the
 2p
 and
 2s
atomic
 orbitals
 of
 the
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 O
 atom
 are
 ana-
lyzed.
 One
 observes
 the
 appearance
 of
 bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
M
 O
 fragment
 orbital
 densities
 below
 the
 Fermi
 level.
 In
 the
 energy
regime
 [−5,
 −10]
 eV
 there
 is
 a
 strong
 bonding
 interaction
 between
4d
 and
 5s
 atomic
 orbitals
 of
 Pd
 and
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 Around
−20
 eV
 we
 also
 see
 a
 strong
 interaction
 between
 the
 5s
 and
 4d
atomic
 orbitals
 of
 Pd
 and
 O2s atomic
 orbitals.
 As
 can
 be
 especially
observed
 from
 the
 COHP
 in
 Fig.
 9b3
 there
 is
 a
 substantial
 shift
 of
Pd5s atomic
 orbital
 PDOS
 downwards
 as
 well
 as
 upwards
 in
 energy
compared
 to
 its
 relative
 density
 position
 in
 the
 metal,
 due
 to
 the
substantial
 bonding
 as
 well
 as
 anti-bonding
 interaction
 with
 the
2s
 and
 2p
 atomic
 orbitals
 of
 O.
 In
 between
 the
 regime
 of
 −5
 eV
and
 +
 3
 eV
 the
 DOS
 is
 dominated
 by
 the
 interaction
 with
 Pd4d elec-
trons.
 Above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 the
 anti-bonding
 electron
 density
 also
contains
 signiﬁcant
 contributions
 of
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 We
will
 further
 analyze
 the
 details
 of
 the
 PDOS
 and
 COHP
 distribu-
tions
 in
 the
 regime
 [−10;
 +
 6
 eV]
 following
 the
 Hoffmann
 [71]
 ligand

 orbital
 scheme.
Within
 the
 Hoffmann
 model
 doubly
 occupied

 type

located
 on
 the

 with
 the

 In
 PdO
 the

 and
 5p
 Pd
 metal
 atomic
 orbitals
 are
 proposed
 to
 be
 involved
into
 bonding
 with
 the

 orbitals.
 The
 resulting
 local

 scheme
 is
 sketched
 in

 This

 the

anti-bonding
 orbitals
 combinations
 of
 Fig.

The
 ranking
 of
 the
 metal
 4d
 energy
 levels
 follows
 crystal
 ﬁeld
splitting.
 The
 “non-bonding”
 dz2 is
 the
 lower
 orbital
 because
 the
repulsive
 electrostatic
 interaction
 is
 minimum.
 This
 repulsive
 inter-
action
 increases
 for
 the
 non-bonding
 degenerate
 dxz and
 dyz orbitals
and
 is
 the
 largest
 for
 the
 non-bonding
 in-plane
 dx2−y2 orbital.
 The
unoccupied
 dxy orbital
 is
 shifted
 upwards
 because
 it
 is
 also
 part
 of
the
 anti-bonding
 interaction
 with
 O
 orbitals.
As
 can
 be
 observed
 from
 Fig.
 9b2
 of
 the
 valence
 electron
 struc-
ture
 of
 PdO,
 this
 scheme
 can
 indeed
 approximately
 be
 identiﬁed.
The
 dxy orbital
 mixes
 strongly
 with
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals,
 which
gives
 bonding
 M
 O
 electron
 density
 at
 −7
 eV
 and
 a
 correspond-
ing
 anti-bonding
 electron
 density
 2
 eV
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level.
 This
difference
 in
 energy
 of
 9
 eV
 is
 indicative
 of
 a
 strong
 covalent
 inter-
action.
 However,
 the
 other
 d
 atomic
 orbitals
 state
 densities
 do
 not
remain
 resolved,
 because
 of
 the
 interaction
 with
 oxygen
 atomic
orbitals
 is
 not
 only
 of
 -type
 but
 also
 of
 -type.
In
 agreement
 with
 the
 Hoffmann
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 splitting
 model
 the
COHP
 of
 Fig.
 9b3
 indicates
 two
 anti-bonding
 regimes
 involving
the
 metal
 d-valence
 electrons.
 The
 occupied
 anti-bonding
 d-levels
in
 the
 upper
 part
 of
 the
 occupied
 d-valence
 electron
 band
 and
 the
earlier
 mentioned
 unoccupied
 PddxyO2p density
 regime.
 The
 strong
mixing
 of
 O2p and
 Pddxy orbitals
 in
 the
 latter
 regime
 is
 indicative
also
 of
 a
 reduced
 charge
 on
 Pd
 compared
 to
 its
 expected
 formal
charge.
 In
 this
 direction,
 from
 the
 Bader
 charge
 analysis
 we  ﬁnd
 on
the
 Pd
 atom
 a
 charge
 of
 +0.82
 electrons.
The
 large
 negative
 contribution
 in
 the
 
COHP
 that
 corresponds
to
 the
 Pd4d and
 O2p atomic
 orbital
 interactions
 above
 the
 Fermi
level,
 indicates
 the
 anti-bonding
 nature
 of
 their
 interaction
 at
 these
electronic
 energies.
 It
 is
 strongly
 covalent
 since
 the
 ratio
 of
 the
 par-
tial
 densities
 of
 states
 of
 the
 Pdd atomic
 orbitals
 with
 O2p atomic
orbitals
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 is
 not
 more
 than
 a
 factor
 of
 four.
 This
is
 very
 different
 from
 the
 chemical
 bonding
 situation
 in
 an
 ionic
oxide.
 For
 instance,
 comparison
 with
 the
 PDOS
 and
 COHP
 plots
 of
Fig.
 4
 of
 TiO2 shows
 that
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 also
 the
 interaction
between
 occupied
 O2p atomic
 orbitals
 and
 unoccupied
 Ti3d-atomic
orbitals
 is
 anti-bonding,
 but
 that
 the
 relative
 density
 ratio
 between
Ti3d PDOS
 and
 O2p PDOS
 now
 is
 larger
 than
 ten.
 In
 CeO2 the
 compa-
rable
 ﬁgure
 for
 the
 unoccupied
 4f
 orbital
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 O2p PDOS
is
 more
 than
 ﬁfty.
 In
 the
 ionic
 bonding
 case
 the
 respective
 metal
 and
O
 atomic
 orbital
 contributions
 are
 quite
 separate
 in
 energy.
We
 will
 further
 compare
 chemical
 bonding
 of
 the
 oxygen
 atoms
on
 the
 stoichiometric
 PdO
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface
 (Fig.
 9d)
 with
 that
 of
 an
O
 atom
 adsorbed
 to
 the
 Pd(1
 0
 0)
 surface
 (Fig.
 9c).
 The
 surface
 unit
cell
 of
 Pd(1
 0
 1)
 consist
 in
 (Fig.
 8):
 4-
 and
 3-coordinated
 Pd
 atoms
(coplanar),
 and
 4-
 and
 3-coordinated
 O
 atoms
 (at
 different
 heights).
All
 these
 four
 types
 of
 ions
 (Pd4,
 Pd3,
 O4,
 O3)
 are
 found
 in
 the
 sur-
face
 layer
 in
 equal
 concentrations.
 The
 Pd
 ion
 coordinated
 to
 four
oxygen
 ions
 remains
 in
 planar
 geometry
 as
 in
 the
 bulk
 and
 also
the
 four
 coordinated
 O
 ion
 remains
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
 with
Pd
 ions
 as
 in
 the
 bulk.
 As
 we  will
 see
 both
 these
 ions
 only
 weakly
interact
 with
 adsorbing
 species.
 The
 electronic
 structures
 of
 the
four
 coordinated
 surface
 Pd
 and
 O
 ions
 are
 similar
 to
 those
 in
 the
bulk,
 therefore
 we  will
 not
 show
 them.
 The
 three-coordinated
 Pd
as
 well
 as
 O
 ions
 display
 the
 higher
 reactivity
 and
 occupy
 more
readily
 approachable
 surface
 positions.
 Their
 corresponding
 PDOS
and
 COHP

 on

 the

 becomes
located

The

 of
 the
 Pd-O
 bond
 now
 becomes
 more
close
 to
 that
 of
 O
 adsorbed
 to
 the
 Pd(100)
 surface
 (Fig.

 On
the
 metal
 surface
 we
 observe
 around
 −6
 eV
 the
 splitting
 of
 the
Pdd
O2p bonding
 interaction
 into
 one
 due
 to
 the
 O2pz (smaller
shift)
 interaction
 perpendicular
 to
 the
 surface
 and
 that
 with
 O2px
and
 O2py orbitals
 (the
 larger
 downwards
 shift).
 A
 similar
 split
 is
observed
 around
 −6
 eV
 in
 the
 surface
 Pd
 O
 bonding
 electron
 den-
sity
 of
 Fig.
 9c1,
 with
 appearance
 of
 a
 smaller
 downwards
 shift
 of
the
 lone
 pair
 oxygen
 electron
 density
 (−4
 eV).
 The
 corresponding
anti-bonding
 orbital
 combination
 of
 the
 latter
 is
 found
 near
 the
Fermi
 level
 at
 1
 eV.
 Noteworthy
 is
 that
 the
 upwards
 and
 down-
wards
 shifted
 electron
 densities
 of
 the
 bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
interactions
 of
 the
 Pd4d/O2p atomic
 orbitals
 near
 the
 Fermi
 level
are
 not
 split
 anymore
 from
 the
 electron
 occupied
 densities
 of
 the
4d
 valence
 electrons
 dominated
 regimes.
 As
 in
 PdO,
 we
 note
 the
strong
 upwards
 and
 downwards
 shifts
 of
 the
 Pd
 5s
 atomic
 orbital
densities
 in
 both
 cases.
 Whereas
 there
 are
 differences
 in
 the
 details
of
 partial
 density
 of
 states
 distributions
 at
 the
 surface
 and
 the
 bulk,
it
 is
 remarkable
 that
 they
 also
 show
 strong
 correspondences.
As
 noted
 earlier,
 the
 change
 in
 chemical
 bonding
 from
 bond-
ing
 to
 anti-bonding
 of
 the
 PdO
 valence
 band
 (see
 Fig.
 9b3)
 allows
for
 a
 prediction
 of
 a
 trend
 in
 the
 covalent
 interaction
 energy
 as
 a
function
 of
 d-valence
 electron
 occupancy.
 A
 reduction
 of
 electrons
in
 the
 valence
 band
 will
 increase
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 metal-oxide
bond,
 as
 long
 as
 the
 charge
 on
 the
 metal
 ion
 does
 not
 vary.
 Such
a
 dependence
 of
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 on
 electron
 count
is
 for
 instance
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 14
 to
 be
 discussed
 later.
 In
 Fig.
 12
 the
PDOSs
 of
 different
 metal-oxides
 are
 compared,
 and
 changes
 in
 elec-
tron
 distribution
 over
 the
 valence
 and
 conduction
 band
 are
 shown.
In
 Section
 5.1
 this
 will
 be
 discussed
 in
 more
 detail.

The
 PdO
 is
 the

 for

of

 in

 [1].
 It
 allows
 for

 at
 a

 low
 enough
 that

 does
 not

 occur.
Temperature
 of

 At
 the
 higher
temperature
 the
 PdO
 phase
 decomposes.
 The

The
 question
 how

 [72–75].

 This
 increases
 the

 for

 C

 bond
activation
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 methane
 activation
 by
 the
 metal,
notwithstanding
 a
 more
 favourable
 reaction

 [74].
Interestingly
 activation
 of
 methane
 by
 the
 PdO(1

 surface
shows
 unique
 behavior.
 It
 decreases
 the
 activation
 barrier
 for
methane
 activation
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 the
 corresponding
 metal
Pd(1
 0
 0)
 surface
 (Table
 3).
 [77,78]
As
 Fig.
 11
 shows,
 activation
 of
 methane
 on
 the
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
 sur-
face
 is
 a
 heterolytic
 reaction.
 Three-coordinated
 O
 accepts
 the
 H
atom
 and
 the
 CH3 fragment
 adsorbs
 to
 the
 three
 coordinated
 Pd
surface
 atom.
 One
 observes
 from
 Table
 3
 that
 methane
 decom-
position
 has
 become
 exothermic
 compared
 to
 the
 corresponding
thermodynamics
 of
 methane
 dissociation
 on
 the
 Pd(1
 0
 0)
 surface.
On
 the
 polar
 PdO(0
 0
 1)
 dissociative
 adsorption
 of
 methane
 is
even
 more
 exothermic.
 However,
 only
 on
 the
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
 surface
 a
lower
 activation
 energy
 for
 methane
 activation
 is
 found.
 Inspection
of
 the
 H
 C
 H
 angle
 of
 transition
 state
 of
 methane
 shows
 that
 the
lower
 barrier
 corresponds
 to
 a
 transition
 state
 of
 wider
 angle
 so
that
 interaction
 with
 C
 can
 become
 facilitated
 [78].
The
 activation
 energy
 of
 methane
 on
 the
 open
 Pd(2
 1
 1)
 surface
is
 similar
 to
 that
 on
 the
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
 surface.
 However,
 at
 reaction
conditions
 the
 reacting
 Pd(2
 1
 1)
 surface
 will
 be
 highly
 covered
 with
adsorbed
 O
 and
 hence
 have
 a
 low
 reactivity.
The
 main
 difference
 between
 heterolytic
 activation
 of
 methane
on
 the
 polar
 PdO(1
 0
 0)
 surface,
 that
 has
 the
 lower
 surface
 energy
(18
 meV/Å2),
 and
 the
 stoichiometric
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
 surface,
 that
 has
the
 higher
 surface
 energy
 (52
 meV/Å2)
 [79],
 is
 that
 the
 non-
stoichiometric
 PdO(1
 0
 0)
 surface
 contains
 excess
 O
 atoms
 ions
of
 increased
 reactivity.
 The
 exposed
 Pd
 ions
 however
 remain

coordinated,
 but
 have
 a
 low
 interaction
 energy
 with
 adsorbing
intermediates.

It
 is
 interesting
 to

 interaction
 energies
 with
 the
H
 Pd
 interaction
 energy
 on
 the
 free
 metal
 surfaces
 (H/Pd(111)

 One
 notes
 that
 the
 interaction
 energy
 for
 the

 atom
attached

 fold
 coordinated
 Pd
 surface
 ion
 is
 only
 slightly
reduced
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 the

 atom

surface.
 The
 low
 value
 of
 the
 H
 Pd
 ion
 interaction
 of
 the
 four-
fold
 coordinated
 Pd
 ion
 results
 from
 its
 coordinative
 saturation
and
 unavailability
 of
 an
 empty

lar

 of
 proper
 symmetry.
 The

 energies
 of

 surface
 O
 atom
 are
 O(3)-H
 =
 −72
 kJ/mol;
 and

 respectively.
 For
 the
 case
 of

 its

 is

 reduced

 of
 methane
 as
 well
 as
 longer
 hydrocarbons
when
 adsorbed
 to
 the
 PdO(1
 0
 1)
 surface.
Adsorption
 of
 methane
 and
 longer
 hydrocarbons
 to
 metal
surface
 is
 dominated
 by
 weak
 dispersion
 forces.
 A
 molecule
 as
methane
 will
 experience
 a
 large
 repulsive
 interaction
 due
 to
 Pauli
repulsion,
 between
 the
 doubly
 occupied
 molecular
 valence
 orbitals
and
 those
 of
 the
 metal.
 An
 important
 contribution
 to
 the
 Pauli
repulsion
 by
 the
 metal
 valence
 electrons
 is
 due
 to
 the
 spatially
extended
 s-p
 valence
 band
 electrons.
 The
 resulting
 large
 distance
between
 adsorbate
 and
 surface
 will
 give
 a
 small
 overlap
 of
 adsor-
bate
 and
 surface
 orbitals,
 so
 that
 there
 will
 be
 little
 chemical
 bond
activation.
 This
 is
 very
 different
 when
 methane
 adsorbs
 to
 a
 cation
as
 Pd2+.
 On
 the
 PdO
 surface
 the
 spatially
 extended
 5s
 atomic
 orbital
of
 Pd
 now
 are
 involved
 in
 strong
 bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
 interac-
tions
 with
 the
 PdO
 surface
 oxygen
 atoms.
 This
 reduces
 the
 electron
densities
 of
 the
 Pd
 5s
 valence
 electrons
 near
 the
 Fermi
 level.
 Hence
they
 will
 less
 contribute
 to
 Pauli
 repulsion
 and
 as
 a
 result
 the
molecular
 adsorption
 energy
 will
 increase.
 In
 contact
 with
 the
 Pd
ion
 the
 methane
 adsorption
 energy
 becomes
 more
 attractive
 com-
pared
 to
 its
 weak
 interaction
 with
 the
 metal
 surface
 and
 increases
to
 −25
 kJ/mol
 [82].
 A
 very
 similar
 effect
 is
 found
 for
 adsorption
 of
other
 molecules
 as
 H2.
 For
 H2 adsorption
 to
 the
 three
 coordinated
Pd
 ion
 a
 value
 of
 −56
 kJ/mol
 is
 found,
 which
 is
 even
 larger
 than
 that
found
 for
 methane
 [75,80].
Because
 of
 the
 reduced
 repulsive
 interaction
 the
 adsorbing
molecule
 can
 more
 closely
 approach
 the
 metal
 cation
 than
 the
neutral
 metal
 atom.
 This
 gives
 increased
 overlap
 of
 adsorbate
molecular
 orbitals
 with
 the
 metal
 cation
 4d-valence
 orbitals.
 The
molecular
 adsorbate
 bond
 weakens
 and
 stretches
 because
 of
 the
resulting
 enhanced
 back
 donation
 of
 electrons
 from
 the
 metal
cation
 into
 the
 adsorbed
 molecular
 precursor
 state.
 The
 activation
barrier
 for
 C
 H
 bond
 cleavage
 is
 lowered
 since
 less
 deformation
energy
 is
 needed
 to
 reach
 the
 transition
 state.
In
 an
 early
 computational
 paper
 a
 very
 similar
 increase
 of
 the
adsorption
 energy
 of
 H2 and
 activation
 of
 H2 has
 been
 found
 for
an
 Ir4 cluster
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 neighboring
 cation
 [81].
 Due
 to
polarization
 of
 the
 metal
 cluster
 electrons
 in
 the
 ﬁeld
 of
 the
 cation,
electron
 density
 gets
 removed
 from
 the
 metal
 atoms
 in
 contact
 with
the
 H2 molecule.
 The
 resulting
 reduction
 of
 the
 Pauli
 repulsion
 then
leads
 to
 substantial
 activation
 of
 H2 as
 is
 notated
 from
 the
 signif-
icantly
 stretched
 H
 H
 bond
 of
 the
 adsorbed
 H2 molecule.
 A
 very
similar
 reduction
 of
 Pauli
 repulsion
 as
 for
 the
 Pd2+ cation
 on
 the
 PdO
surface
 is
 also
 responsible
 for
 the
 favorable
 metal-cation
 molecule
interactions
 in
 organo-metal
 complexes,
 as
 has
 been
 noted
 by
 [83]
for
 adsorbed
 methane.
Reduction
 of
 Pauli
 repulsion
 is
 the
 other
 important
 chemical
bonding
 aspect
 next
 to
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 splitting
 that
 relates
 activation
by
 cations
 in
 oxides
 with
 single
 center
 coordination
 chemistry.
Clearly
 the
 increased
 interaction
 of
 the
 precursor
 state
 of
methane
 with
 the
 coordinatively
 unsaturated
 Pd2+ cation
 domi-
nates
 the
 more
 favourable
 dissociative
 adsorption
 of
 methane
 to
PdO
 (1
 0
 1)
 surface.
 H2 dissociation
 from
 its
 precursor
 state
 also
occurs
 with
 low
 barrier
 on
 this
 surface
 [66,80].
Interestingly,
 whereas
 molecular
 adsorption
 of
 O2 to
 the
 PdO
(1
 0
 1)
 surface
 has
 the
 relatively
 high
 value
 of
 −90
 kJ/mol,
 the
 disso-
ciation
 of
 the
 O2 molecule
 [75]
 is
 endothermic
 [79].
 This
 illustrates
the
 very
 different
 effects
 on
 the
 ad-molecule
 or
 ad-atom
 interac-
tions
 energies
 for
 a
 neutral
 metal
 atom
 compared
 with
 that
 of
 a
metal
 cation.
 The
 changes
 in
 the
 adatom
 interaction
 energies
 with
change
 in
 the
 cation
 charge
 will
 be
 discussed
 in
 more
 detail
 in
Section
 5.2.
On
 the
 oxidized
 Pt
 surface
 [31]
 and
 Pt
 oxides
 as
 -PtO2 [84]
methane
 can
 be
 activated,
 but
 only
 with
 activation
 energies
 higher
than
 on
 the
 free
 surface.
 In
 this
 case
 activation
 of
 methane
 occurs
in
 radical
 type
 fashion,
 through
 OHads and
 OCH3, ads intermedi-
ate
 formation.
 On
 the
 reactive,
 but
 unstable
 Pt3O4 surface
 methane
dissociation
 decomposes
 in
 a
 similar
 way,
 but
 now
 dissociative
adsorption
 has
 become
 more
 exothermic
 than
 on
 the
 metallic

surface
 [84].

 Trends
 in
 chemical
 bonding
 and
 reactivity
 of
 the
 oxides
5.1.
 Covalent
 versus
 ionic
 bonding
In
 this
 section
 we
 will
 summarize
 the
 discussion
 in
 the
 previous
sections
 on
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 metal
 oxide
 bond
 in
 the
 metal
 oxides.
As
 mentioned,
 when
 one
 studies
 the
 properties
 of
 the
 metal
 oxide
bond
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 metal
 atom
 position
 from
 left
 to
 right
in
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system,
 a
 gradual
 shift
 of
 the
 nature
 of
M
 O
 chemical
 bond
 from
 the
 ionic
 to
 the
 covalent
 occurs.
 Also,
the
 strength
 of
 the
 metal
 oxide
 chemical
 bond
 tends
 to
 decrease
with
 increasing
 electron
 count
 of
 the
 metal
 atom
 d-valence
 electron
occupation.
A
 measure
 for
 the
 degree
 of
 covalency
 is
 the
 ratio
 of
 PDOS
 inten-
sity
 on
 the
 metal
 atomic
 orbitals
 with
 that
 of
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 PDOS
intensity
 at
 the
 same
 electron
 energy.
 This
 is
 most
 useful
 when
oxides
 of
 the
 same
 structure
 and
 stoichiometry
 are
 compared.
 Such
a
 comparison
 is
 illustrated
 from
 the
 PDOS
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 12
 [55]
 for
different
 metal
 oxides
 that
 have
 the
 rutile
 structure.
From
 top
 to
 bottom
 the
 number
 of
 metal
 atom
 valence
 elec-
trons
 increases
 and
 the
 ionization
 potential
 of
 the
 metal
 atom
 tends
to

 occupied.
 Above
 the
 Fermi
level
 there
 is
 the
 PDOS
 density
 of
 the
 Ti3d atomic
 orbitals
 with
 little
mixing
 of
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals.
 This
 reﬂects
 the
 condition
 of
 ionic
bonding.
 The
 two
 conduction
 band
 peaks
 correspond
 to
 the
 ligand
splitting
 of
 the
 3d
 orbital
 density
 with
 octahedral
 coordination
 into
three
 non-bonding
 t2g atomic
 orbitals
 and
 two
 anti-bonding
 e1g
atomic
 orbitals
 as
 expected
 from
 the
 octahedral
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 split-
ting
 scheme
 (see
 Fig.
 13).
 In
 VO2 an
 electron
 is
 added
 to
 the
 d
 atomic
orbital
 PDOS
 of
 the
 vanadium
 ion.
 At
 the
 Fermi
 level
 the
 band-gap
energy
 now
 disappears,
 but
 within
 the
 valence
 band
 the
 split
 in
energy
 between
 occupied
 oxygen
 orbitals
 and
 now
 singly
 occu-
pied
 vanadium
 d
 atomic
 orbitals
 remains.
 This
 energy
 difference
is
 determined
 by
 the
 Madelung
 potential
 difference.
 In
 CrO2 two
electrons
 reside
 in
 its
 metal
 d
 atomic
 orbitals,
 but
 now
 the
 energy
gap
 between
 occupied
 O2p electrons
 and
 metal
 d-atomic
 orbitals
closes.
 The
 strength
 of
 the
 metal-oxide
 chemical
 bond
 now
 mainly
decreases
 because
 of
 the
 increased
 ionization
 potential
 of
 V
 and
 Cr
compared
 to
 that
 of
 Ti.
Covalency
 increases
 as
 can
 be
 observed
 from
 the
 increased
 over-
lap
 in
 metal
 atom
 d
 atomic
 orbital
 density
 with
 the
 O2p atomic
orbitals.
 However,
 the
 t2g orbitals
 that
 become
 occupied
 have
 dom-
inantly
 non-bonding
 character.
 The
 e1g orbitals
 that
 get
 occupied
next
 will
 have
 increasing
 covalent
 anti-bonding
 character.
 Also
 in
Mn  with
 3d
 electrons
 we
 see
 a
 strong
 mixing
 of
 O2p and
 metal
 d
atomic
 orbitals
 and
 mainly
 empty
 metal
 d
 atomic
 orbitals
 above
the
 Fermi
 level.
 Bonding
 now
 is
 highly
 covalent.
 Within
 the
 Hoff-
mann
 model
 six
 bonding
 orbitals
 with
 oxygen
 are
 formed,
 with
 two
electrons
 in
 the
 non-bonding
 d-orbitals
 as
 illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 13.
In
 ReO2,
 also
 with
 three
 d-atomic
 orbitals
 the
 Hoffmann
 model
now
 indicates
 half
 electron
 occupation
 of
 the
 non-bonding
 t2g
orbitals
 and
 a
 gap
 reappears.
 This
 energy
 gap
 indicates
 ionic-
ity,
 because
 also
 the
 higher
 unoccupied
 e1g orbitals
 have
 little
 O
character.
 From
 RuO2(4
 d-electrons)
 to
 IrO2 (5
 d-electrons)
 and
PtO2 (6
 d-electrons)
 we
 observe
 increasing
 covalency
 that
 is
 sim-
ilar
 to
 the
 signature
 of
 chemical
 bonding
 in
 PdO
 (Fig.
 9).
 The
 t2g
orbitals
 become
 increasingly
 occupied
 and
 admixture
 of
 O2p atomic
orbitals
 into
 the
 anti-bonding
 e1g orbitals
 increases.
 In
 PtO2 the
 gap
between
 bonding
 and
 non-bonding
 d-type
 orbitals
 disappears
 and
the
 chemical
 bond
 has
 essentially
 no
 ionic
 contribution.
When
 the
 d-electron
 count
 on
 the
 metal
 cation
 increases
 above
three,
 there
 are
 several
 choices
 to
 distribute
 the
 electrons.
 One

 to

 or

 In

 case
 a

 and

 Adsorption
 of
 oxygen
The
 adsorption
 energy
 of
 atomic
 oxygen
 to
 cations
 of
 reducible
oxides
 is
 a
 strong
 function
 of
 cation
 charge
 and
 d-valence
 electron
occupation.
 Calculations
 by
 Koper
 et
 al.
 [86]
 (DFT,
 Dacapo
 RPBE
xc-functional)
 are
 reproduced
 in
 Fig.
 14.
Adsorption
 to
 the
 dense
 surfaces
 of
 the
 metals
 is
 compared
 to
cubic
 mono-oxides
 and
 the
 mixed
 oxide
 perovskites,
 of
 which
 a
prototype
 structure
 is
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 15.
This
 structure
 allows
 for
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 compositions.
 The
 reac-
tive
 metal
 cation
 (Ti)
 is
 octahedrally
 coordinated
 with
 O,
 the
 other
cations
 (Ba)
 are
 large
 and
 occupy
 the
 centers
 of
 a
 cube
 and
 are
 coor-
dinated
 with
 12
 oxygen
 atoms,
 which
 have
 a
 cubic
 arrangement.
By
 variation
 of
 the
 charge
 on
 the
 large
 cation,
 the
 cation
 charge
 on
the
 transition
 metal
 has
 to
 adapt.
 The
 calculations
 of

sider
 the
 transition

 cation

 binds
 the
 adsorbing
 oxygen
atom
 to
 be
 part
 of
 a
 truncated
 octahedral
 site
 that
 misses
 one
 of
 the
corner
 atoms.
In
 Fig.
 14
 we
 observe
 for
 adsorption
 to
 the
 metals
 the
 high
adsorption
 energy
 to
 the
 low
 electron
 count
 metal,
 which
 decreases
with
 increasing
 electron
 count.
 The
 low
 electron
 count
 metal
 has
low
 ionization
 potential
 and,
 as
 we  have
 discussed,
 a
 highly
 ionic
bond
 between
 metal
 and
 oxygen
 atom
 will
 arise.
 With
 increas-
ing
 electron
 count
 the
 ionization
 potential
 decreases
 and
 bonding
becomes
 increasingly
 more
 covalent,
 with
 formation
 of
 bonding
and
 anti-bonding
 surface
 energy
 levels.
 With
 increasing
 d-electron
count
 the
 anti-bonding
 orbitals
 become
 occupied
 and
 the
 interac-
tion
 energy
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 decreases.
 The
 decrease
 in
 interaction
energy
 with
 electron
 count
 is
 seen
 to
 be
 steeper
 for
 low
 electron
occupation
 than
 at
 the
 upper
 electron
 occupation
 end.
The
 low
 spin
 calculations
 indicate
 that
 without
 exception
 bond-
ing
 to
 the
 surface
 cation
 that
 is
 part
 of
 an
 oxide
 decreases
 compared
to
 adsorption
 to
 the
 corresponding
 metal
 surface.
 As
 we
 will
 discuss
in
 the
 next
 section
 this
 has
 the
 important
 consequence
 to
 cataly-
sis
 that
 the
 oxygen
 reactivity
 will
 increase,
 but
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 has
to
 be
 strong
 enough
 so
 that
 it
 can
 be
 generated
 from
 O2 or
 H2O

decomposition.
 The
 decrease
 in
 M
 O
 bond
 strength
 is
 because
the
 increased
 charge
 on
 the
 cations
 reduces
 electron
 donation
 to
oxygen.
 Also,
 the
 close
 proximity
 of
 additional
 oxygen
 atoms
 will
reduce
 the
 M O
 interaction
 energy
 because
 of
 repulsive
 electro-
static
 interactions.
The
 increase
 in
 bond
 energy
 with
 decreasing
 d-electron
 count
relates
 to
 the
 two
 factors
 of
 decreasing
 population
 of
 anti-bonding
orbitals
 and
 decrease
 in
 metal
 atom
 ionization
 potential.
 The
chemical
 consequence
 of
 the
 decrease
 in
 interaction
 energy
 with
increasing
 cation
 charge
 is
 that
 the
 interaction
 energy
 of
 an
adsorbed
 O
 atom
 with
 a
 metal
 atom
 located
 at
 the
 right
 in
 its
 row
 of
the
 periodic
 system
 tends
 to
 become
 equal
 to
 that
 of
 a
 metal
 atom
that
 has
 the
 higher
 charge
 more
 to
 the
 left
 in
 the
 same
 row
 of
 the
periodic
 system.
 For
 instance
 the
 Co2+
O
 bond
 energy
 appears
 to
have
 the
 same
 strength
 as
 a
 Cr3+
O
 bond.
However,
 interestingly
 experimental
 data
 on
 perovskite
 LaXO3
compounds
 [87]
 on
 O2 adsorption
 reproduced
 in
 Fig.
 16
 do
 not
follow
 the
 prediction
 of
 Fig.
 14.
 In
 the
 different
 compounds
 studied
the
 same
 charge
 on
 cation
 is
 maintained,
 but
 by
 varying
 the
 metal
atom
 element
 its
 valence
 electron
 number
 is
 changed.
When
 studied
 as
 a
 function
 of
 metal
 cation
 position
 in
 a
 row
of
 the
 periodic
 system
 the
 amount
 of
 oxygen
 adsorbed
 at
 a
 partic-
ular
 temperature
 and
 pressure
 normalized
 to
 surface
 area
 shows
that
 a
 local
 minimum
 in
 interaction
 energy
 is
 found
 for
 a
 metal
cation
 with
 valence
 electron
 occupation
 of
 5
 d
 electrons
 and
 as
 a
consequence
 there
 appear
 two
 local
 maxima.
 As
 we
 will
 discuss
 in
the
 next
 section,
 such
 a
 minimum
 has
 also
 been
 observed
 in
 simi-
lar
 catalytic
 systems
 with
 ﬁrst
 row
 elements.
 As
 already
 suggested
by
 Dowden
 [27]
 the
 double
 maxima
 in
 functional
 dependence
 that
results
 relates
 to
 the
 crystal
 ﬁeld
 effects
 we
 discussed
 earlier
 with
speciﬁc
 consequences
 for
 ﬁrst
 row
 cations
 that
 prefer
 a
 high
 spin
state.
Upon
 adsorption,
 approximate
 octahedral
 symmetry
 around
 the
cation
 is
 restored.
 This
 results
 in
 the
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 splitting
 of
 the
atomic
 orbitals
 illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 13.
 This
 splitting
 results
 from
 cova-
lent
 as
 well
 as
 ionic
 contributions.
 In
 the
 ionic
 ﬁeld
 of
 the
 ligand
 the
dxy,
 dxz and
 dzx orbitals
 are
 less
 destabilized
 than
 the
 dz2 and
 dx2−y2
orbitals,
 because
 the
 ﬁrst
 are
 oriented
 in
 between
 the
 ligands
 and
the
 latter
 directed
 towards
 them.
 Based
 on
 the
 difference
 in
 orbital
angles
 an
 estimate
 can
 be
 made
 of
 the
 differences
 of
 their
 respective
energies
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 average
 crystal
 ﬁeld.
 This
 is
 indicated
in
 Fig.

As

 the

 of

 The
 structure
 of
 polar
 surfaces;
 reconstruction
We
 have
 seen
 at
 several
 occasions
 that
 surface
 reconstruction
may
 have
 a
 large
 effect
 on
 the
 reactivity
 of
 an
 oxide
 surface.
 Sur-
face
 reconstruction
 may
 be
 of
 particular
 importance
 when
 polar
surfaces
 are
 concerned,
 that
 sometimes
 have
 very
 low
 surface
 ener-
gies.
 Tasker
 [91]
 has
 provided
 a
 theory
 that
 provides
 insights
 in
 the
electrostatic
 driving
 forces
 for
 reconstruction.
 This
 is
 illustrated
 in
Fig.
 19:
The
 structure
 a
 from
 Fig.
 19A
 is
 electrostatically
 stable
 since
 the
sum
 of
 positive
 and
 negative
 charges
 is
 zero.
 When
 the
 surfaces
are
 at
 inﬁnite
 distance
 their
 electrostatic
 interaction
 vanishes.
 The
polar
 surface
 of
 the
 layered
 compounds
 b
 is
 also
 stable
 because

 of
 the
 two
 surfaces
 cancel.
 The
 surface
 of
 structure
c
 is
 unstable
 because
 it
 has
 a
 non
 vanishing
 dipole
 moment.
 As
 is
illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 19B
 a
 vanishing
 dipole
 moment
 is
 generated
 from
structure
 c
 of
 Fig.
 19A
 when
 half
 of
 the
 surface
 charge
 is
 transported
from
 the
 top
 surface
 to
 the
 bottom
 surface.
 Then
 the
 structure
 again
becomes
 stable.
For
 particular
 systems
 the
 stability
 of
 the
 polar
 surface
 has
 been
reviewed
 by
 Woodruff
 [92].
 We  will
 summarize
 his
 discussion
on
 the
 structure
 and
 composition
 of
 the

 of
-Al2O3,
 Cr2O3,

 These
 com-
pounds
 all
 have
 the
 corundum
 structure.
 In
 the
 bulk
 each
 cation
 is
octahedrally
 coordinated
 by
 oxygen.
 Interestingly,
 as
 we
 will
 see,
the
 Tasker
 type
 reconstructions
 are
 realized
 differently
 for
 the
 dif-
ferent
 systems.

 The
 reactions
 studied
 by
 Dowden
 concern
 the
activation
 of
 C
 H
 bond
 in
 an
 organic
 molecule
 or
 that
 of
 the
 H2
molecule.
When
 the
 activating
 surface
 oxygen
 is
 too
 strongly
 bound
 to
surface
 cations,
 it
 will
 weakly
 bind
 to
 hydrogen
 atoms
 so
 that
 bond
activation
 will
 have
 a
 high
 barrier.
 When
 O
 binds
 too
 weakly,
 bond
activation
 may
 have
 a
 low
 barrier,
 but
 product
 desorption
 may
 be
inhibited.
 It
 may
 explain
 the
 shift
 in
 reactivity
 to
 M
 O
 adsorption
energies
 that
 are
 not
 maximum.
 The
 reason
 for
 the
 two
 maxima
is
 that
 to
 the
 left
 of
 the
 5
 d-electrons
 minimum
 the
 absolute
 value
of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 energy
 will
 increase,
 to
 the
 right
 after
 an
 initial
increase
 it
 will
 again
 decrease.
Our
 interpretation
 of
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 stabilization
 effects
 agrees
with
 Goodenough’s
 analysis
 that,
 for
 optimum
 oxygen
 evolu-
tion
 activity
 one
 electron
 should
 occupy
 the
 upwards

d-atomic

 Again
 this
 will
 not
 give
 the
 maximum
M
 O
 bond
 energy
 but
 an
 optimum,
 as
 Nørskov
 also
 remarked
[99].
Since
 according
 to
 this
 analysis
 the
 double
 volcano-curve
 is
related
 to
 the
 high
 spin
 state
 of
 the
 electrons,
 one
 predicts
 that
similar

 for
 the
 third
 or
 fourth
 row

 metals
 should
not
 show

 type
 dependence.
The
 double
 peak
 in
 the
 reactivity
 trend
 plot
 will
 disappear
 when
the
 reactivity
 is
 not
 plotted
 as
 a
 function
 of
 position
 of
 cation
 in
 the
periodic
 system,
 but
 when
 the
 reactivity
 is
 plotted
 as
 a
 function
 of
 a
reactivity
 descriptor
 as
 for
 instance
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 M-O
 bond.
 In
a
 classical
 heterogeneous
 catalytic
 experiment
 [100],
 this
 has
 been
demonstrated
 by
 Sachtler
 and
 Fahrenfort
 for
 the
 decomposition
 of
formic
 acid
 (see
 Fig.
 25).
When
 the
 temperatures
 of
 a
 set
 conversion
 level
 of
 formic
 acid
are
 plotted
 as
 a
 function
 of
 heat
 of
 formation
 of
 the
 most
 stable
oxide
 a
 maximum
 activity
 for
 the
 oxide
 of
 Pt
 is
 found.
 This
 max-
imum
 in
 activity
 for
 optimum
 M
 O
 interaction
 energy
 is
 due
 to
the
 need
 to
 balance
 the
 necessity
 for
 a
 strong
 surface
 interaction
 to
activate
 chemical
 bonds
 of
 the
 substrate,
 but
 a
 weak
 one
 to

 In
 summary
The
 chemical
 bond
 in
 the
 reducible
 oxide
 can
 be
 described
 in
terms
 of
 covalent,
 ionic
 and
 ligand
 ﬁeld
 type
 interactions.
 The
 basic
orbital
 scheme
 of
 bonding,
 non-bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
 orbitals
applies.
When
 the
 energies
 of
 the
 metal
 d
 valence
 atomic
 orbitals
 are
overlap
 or
 are
 close
 to
 those
 of
 the
 2p
 atomic
 orbitals
 of
 the
 oxygen
atom,
 chemical
 bonding
 is
 mainly
 covalent.
 Then
 the
 electron
 den-
sity
 of
 state
 of
 the
 oxide
 in
 the
 valence
 electron
 regime
 contains
three
 components:
- bonding
 M
 O
 orbitals,
 due
 to
 strong
 mixing
 of
 O2p with
 metal
atom
 d,
 s
 and
 p
 atomic
 orbitals;
 these
 occupied
 orbitals
 have
 a
low
 electron
 energy
-
 non-bonding
 and
 anti-bonding
 metal
 d-atomic
 orbitals,
 weakly
mixed
 with
 O2p atomic
 orbitals,
 mainly
 localized
 on
 the
 metal
atoms.
 Ligand
 ﬁeld
 splitting
 and
 spin
 state
 are
 important.
 Their
energies
 are
 located
 near
 the
 Fermi
 level.
-
 anti-bonding
 M
 O
 orbitals,
 due
 to
 strong
 mixing
 of
 O2p,
 and
mainly
 metal
 d-atomic
 orbitals;
 they
 have
 high
 energy
 and
 are
pushed
 above
 the
 Fermi
 level
 and
 hence
 are
 non-occupied.
When
 covalent
 bonding
 applies,
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
directly
 relates
 to
 the
 electron
 count
 on
 the
 metal
 atom.
 Theoret-
ically,
 initially
 for
 metal
 atoms
 with
 a
 low
 valence
 electron
 count
the
 M
 O
 interaction
 energy
 will
 increase
 with
 increasing
 number
of
 valence
 electrons.
 Once
 the
 bonding
 oxide
 molecular
 orbitals
are
 ﬁlled
 the
 M
 O
 interaction
 energy
 reaches
 its
 maximum
 value.
It
 will
 decrease
 when
 electron
 number
 further
 increases
 since
 then
anti-bonding
 orbitals
 become
 occupied.
 The
 latter
 is
 the
 situation
typical
 for
 transition
 metal
 oxides
 of
 metals
 as
 Pt,
 Ir
 or
 Pd.
The
 M
 O
 bond
 for
 metal
 oxides
 with
 low
 electron
 count
 is
 dom-
inated
 by
 the
 ionic
 interaction.
 As
 will
 be
 mentioned
 in
 the
 next
paragraph
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 prediction
 based
 on
 the
 covalent
 bond
picture,
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 interaction
 then
 actually
 will
 also
 decrease
with
 increase
 of
 valence
 electron
 count.
In
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system
 when
 the
 position
 of
 a
 transition
metal
 atom
 changes
 from
 the
 left
 to
 the
 right,
 the
 ionization
 poten-
tial
 and
 valence
 electron
 count
 of
 a
 transition
 metal
 will
 increase,
There
 is
 also
 contraction
 of
 the
 d-valence
 atomic
 orbital
 extension
[71].
 These
 give
 rise
 to
 systematic
 trends
 in
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 energies
and
 the
 reactivity
 of
 the
 corresponding
 oxide
 surfaces
 as
 a
 function
of
 the
 valence
 electron
 count
 of
 the
 metal
 atoms.
 The
 strength
 of
the
 M
 O
 bond
 tends
 to
 decrease
 when
 metal
 atom
 position
 changes
from
 the
 left
 to
 the
 right
 in
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
 system.
 At
 the
 left,
the
 ionic
 contribution
 to
 the
 M
 O
 chemical
 bond
 will
 dominate.
This
 is
 taken
 over
 by
 dominance
 of
 the
 covalent
 contribution
 to
 the
M
 O
 chemical
 bond
 when
 metal
 atom
 positions
 change
 towards
that
 of
 the
 group
 VIII
 metals,
 at
 the
 right
 of
 the
 periodic
 system.
For
 transition
 metal
 atoms
 at
 the
 left
 of
 a
 row
 of
 the
 periodic
system
 the
 bonding
 M
 O
 orbitals
 become
 dominated
 by
 the
 fully
electron
 occupied
 O2p atomic
 orbitals
 and
 the
 anti-bonding
 orbitals
by
 the
 unoccupied
 metal
 d-
 or
 f-atomic
 orbitals.
 Then
 the
 energy
gap
 difference
 between
 the
 energies
 of
 occupied
 valence
 and
 unoc-
cupied
 conduction
 band
 orbitals
 at
 the
 surface
 as
 compared
 to
the
 bulk
 is
 mainly
 determined
 by
 the
 change
 of
 the
 electrostatic
Madelung
 energy.
 This
 is
 the
 situation
 typical
 for
 TiO2 or
 VO2.
The
 reactivity
 of
 reducible
 oxides
 relates
 strongly
 to
 the
 elec-
tron
 occupation
 of
 valence
 orbitals
 of
 the
 reactive
 metal
 cation
 and
the
 polarity
 of
 the
 surface
 oxygen
 bond.
 In
 addition
 surface
 topol-
ogy
 and
 surface
 reconstruction
 or
 surface
 atom
 relaxation
 effects
can
 contribute
 substantially
 to
 surface
 reactivity.
 This
 implies
 that
for
 such
 cases
 surface
 reactivity
 descriptors
 based
 on
 electronic
structure
 properties
 only
 will
 have
 little
 value.
 Surface
 reconstruc-
tion
 and
 relaxation
 will
 occur
 for
 a
 metal
 oxide
 surface
 when
coordinative
 unsaturation
 becomes
 too
 large.
 The
 surface
 of
 the
corundum
 structure
 oxides
 provides
 an
 example
 of
 this.
 Another
example
 of
 reconstructed
 surfaces
 are
 metal
 surfaces
 covered
 with
an
 adsorbate
 overlayer.
 This
 will
 sometimes
 lead
 to
 formation
 of
reaction
 centers
 of
 unique
 reactivity
 [105–107].
Differences
 in
 reduction
 energy
 of
 ionic
 surfaces
 relate
 to
 the
size
 of
 band
 gap
 energy
 between
 the
 occupied
 valence
 band,
 that
mainly
 is
 formed
 of
 molecular
 orbitals
 that
 are
 a
 linear
 combina-
tion
 of
 the
 O2p atomic
 orbitals,
 and
 the
 energy
 of
 the
 unoccupied
conduction
 band
 with
 its
 electron
 density
 mainly
 located
 on
 the
cations.
 Since
 in
 an
 ionic
 compound
 band-gap
 energy
 difference
is
 mainly
 determined
 by
 the
 electrostatic
 Madelung
 energy,
 this
determines
 the
 transfer
 energy
 of
 an
 electron
 from
 the
 oxy-
gen
 anion
 to
 the
 metal
 cation.
 The
 band-gap
 energy
 difference
decreases
 with
 decreasing
 coordinative
 unsaturation
 of
 the
 surface
atoms.
Whereas
 the
 surface
 energies
 of
 ionic
 solids
 anti-correlate
 with
trends
 in
 the
 energies
 of
 oxide
 formation,
 the
 reducibility
 of
 the
oxides
 tends
 to
 correlate
 with
 the
 oxide
 heat
 of
 formation.
 Due
to
 the
 low
 surface
 energy
 of
 the
 metal-oxides
 compared
 to
 the
higher
 surface
 energies
 of
 the
 corresponding
 transition
 metals,
 the
reducibility
 of
 metal-oxide
 particles
 will
 decrease
 when
 their
 size
decreases.
The
 strength
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond,
 its
 polarity
 and
 the
 redox
 ener-
gies
 of
 the
 reducible
 cations
 that
 compose
 the
 metal
 oxide
 are
 the
basic
 reactivity
 descriptors
 of
 the
 oxygen
 atoms.
 When
 the
 M
 O
bond
 is
 strong,
 the
 charge
 on
 reducible
 cation
 high
 and
 the
 redox
energy
 for
 cation
 reduction
 is
 relatively
 low,
 substrate
 activation
 by
O
 is
 of
 radical
 type.
 Reaction
 with
 a
 saturated
 organic
 molecule
 will
be
 initiated
 by
 OH
 formation
 and
 formation
 of
 a
 radical
 intermedi-
ate.
 In
 section
 2
 we
 discussed
 the
 reactivity
 of
 V2O5 as
 an
 example.
When
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 strength
 reduces
 and
 also
 the
 charge
 of
 the
reducible
 cation
 is
 less,
 but
 still
 reduction
 of
 the
 cation
 has
 a
 rela-
tively
 low
 energy
 cost,
 electrophilic
 oxygen
 atom
 insertion
 into
 the
C
 H
 or
 C
 C
 bond
 will
 compete
 with
 the
 radical
 type
 reaction.
In
 the
 cases
 so
 far
 mentioned
 the
 reacting
 molecule
 is
 only
 acti-
vated
 through
 direct
 contact
 only
 with
 the
 surface
 oxygen
 atom.
When
 activation
 of
 the
 reacting
 molecule
 occurs
 by
 a
 surface
 oxy-
gen
 atom
 assisted
 by
 activation
 of
 the
 organic
 molecule
 at
 the
 same
time
 by
 a
 metal
 cation,
 then
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 reacts
 nucleophilic.
For
 a
 non-reducible
 cation
 this
 activation
 mode
 is
 the
 only
 one
 pos-
sible
 and
 the
 surface
 reacts
 as
 a
 Lewis
 acid-base
 system.
 Then
 the
proton
 of
 a
 reacting
 C
 H
 bond
 will
 bind
 to
 the
 negatively
 charged
oxygen
 anion
 to
 form
 an
 adsorbed
 hydroxyl.
 The
 corresponding
negatively
 charged
 organic
 intermediate
 will
 bind
 to
 the
 surface
metal
 cation.
 Similarly
 in
 the
 heterolytic
 dissociation
 reaction
 of
H2O
 it
 will
 decompose
 into
 a
 proton
 that
 reacts
 with
 surface
 anion
and
 hydroxyl
 that
 binds
 to
 a
 surface
 cation.
 Two
 adsorbed
 hydroxyls
are
 generated.
When
 the
 metal
 cation
 is
 reducible,
 heterolytic
 bond
 activation
may compete
 with
 redox
 catalysis.
 This
 is
 a
 possibility
 when
 the
M
 O
 bond
 is
 less
 strong
 and
 less
 polar
 than
 in
 the
 previous
 case,
but
 the
 metal
 cation
 still
 has
 a
 relatively
 high
 reduction
 energy
 cost.
In
 this
 case
 an
 oxo-metallo-cycle
 intermediate
 will
 be
 formed
 with
a
 reacting
 oleﬁn.
 Insertion
 of
 the
 O
 atom
 into
 the
 C
 C
 bond
 of
 the
oleﬁn
 is
 accompanied
 by
 C
 H
 bond
 activation
 by
 the
 surface
 metal
cation,
 that
 interacts
 with
 one
 of
 the
 oleﬁn
 carbon
 atoms.
 It
 causes
an
 internal
 shift
 of
 the
 hydrogen
 atom
 within
 the
 reacting
 molecule.
Then
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 reacts
 as
 a
 nucleophile
 with
 the
 now
 posi-
tively
 charged
 adsorbed
 organic
 intermediate.
 The
 reaction
 product
of
 oleﬁn
 activation
 will
 be
 a
 ketone
 or
 aldehyde.
A
 reaction
 center
 with
 accessible
 reducible
 metal
 cation
 may,
for
 instance,
 be
 generated
 by
 partial
 reduction
 of
 the
 surface.
 For
a
 metal
 oxide
 with
 surface
 oxygen
 vacancies
 or
 an
 oxygen
 atom
adsorbed
 to
 the
 electron-rich
 metallic
 surface,
 atomic
 oxygen
 will
react
 nucleophilic,
 but
 for
 the
 fully
 oxidized
 surface

atomic
 O
 may
 change
 to
 electrophilic.
 An
 example
 is
 the
 oxidation
reaction
 of
 ethylene
 catalyzed
 by
 Ag.
 It
 gives
 selective
 epoxide
 for-
mation
 when
 ethylene
 reacts
 with
 the
 fully
 oxidized
 Ag2O
 surface,
but
 aldehyde
 when
 the
 oxide
 surface
 contains
 oxide
 atom
 vacancies
[41].
For
 third
 row
 reducible
 metal
 oxides
 a
 high
 electron
 spin
 state
modiﬁes
 trends
 in
 M-O
 bond
 strength
 as
 predicted
 from
 low
 spin
state
 calculations,
 that
 have
 been
 mainly
 considered
 so
 far.
 Instead
of
 the
 expected
 uniform
 decrease
 of
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 when
 valence
electron
 count
 increases
 for
 the
 third
 row
 metal
 oxides
 –
 due
 to
 its
high
 spin
 state
 –
 a
 local
 minimum
 in
 the
 M
 O
 bond
 energy
 is
 found.
For
 this
 reason
 oxides
 with
 metal
 cation
 electron
 count
 of
 four
 or
 six
have
 been
 found
 with
 optimum
 reactivity
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 C
 H
activation
 reaction.
 Such
 a
 double
 maximum
 volcano
 curve
 of
 reac-
tivity
 versus
 position
 of
 transition
 metal
 atom
 in
 the
 third
 row
 of
the
 periodic
 system
 appears
 to
 be
 general
 as
 indicated
 by
 the
 obser-
vation
 of
 a
 similar
 trend
 for
 electrochemical
 water
 decomposition.
If
 this
 view
 is
 correct,
 for
 fourth
 and
 ﬁfth
 row
 metal
 oxides
 that
 are
expected
 to
 be
 mainly
 low
 spin,
 such
 double
 peaked
 volcano
 type
behaviour
 will
 not
 be
 found.
