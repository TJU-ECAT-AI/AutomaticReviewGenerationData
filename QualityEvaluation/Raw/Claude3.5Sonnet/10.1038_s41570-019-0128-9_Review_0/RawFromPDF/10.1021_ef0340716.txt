The utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse
effect, has been a topic of global interest, from both fundamental and practical viewpoints. In
addition to be the sources of carbon, CO2 might also be utilized as an oxygen source or oxidant,
because it can be considered to be a nontraditional (mild) oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. In
this paper, CO2 as an oxidant for the selective oxidative conversions of alkanes to alkenes has
been reviewed, including methane coupling to ethylene, C2-C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their
corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene, and dehydroge-
nation of ethylbenzene to styrene. It has been shown that CO2 has the potential to offer a
promising alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation, whereas the catalyst development is the
key to the applications.
1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important
greenhouse gases. Mitigation of CO2 emission from
various sources has been a worldwide objective. It has
been recognized that enhanced capacities in the area
of chemical catalysis could have a significant role in
addressing the global atmospheric CO2 problem. Con-
version and utilization of CO2 (as well as methane, CH4)
are important subjects in the field of C1 chemistry.
Several technologies have been proposed for improving
the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization of
CO2. Generally, CO2 recovered from flue stacks or
atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas
and oil wells. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used
to produce chemicals, fuels, and other useful products.
There are several motivations for producing chemicals
from CO2 whenever possible:
(1) CO2 is an inexpensive, nontoxic feedstock that can
frequently replace toxic chemicals such as phosgene or
isocyanates.
(2) CO2 is a renewable feedstock compared to oil or
coal.
(3) The production of chemicals from CO2 can lead to
new materials such as polymers.
(4) New routes to existing chemical intermediates and
products could be more efficient and economical than
current methods.
(5) The production of chemicals from CO2 could have
a small but significant positive impact on the global
carbon balance.1
In the past decades, for catalytic chemistry, most
efforts have been concentrated on the utilization of CO2
as a source of carbon. Only recently it has been proposed
that CO2 might also be utilized as an oxygen source or
oxidant, because it can be considered to be a nontradi-
tional (mild) oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. The use
of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower
alkanes may become an important route for the utiliza-
tion of natural gas. It is known that the natural gas in
many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition
to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly
desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without
emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation
of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals
or fuels.
The wide availability and low price of light alkanes
make them among the least reactive and chemically
most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are
mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as
feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great
practical interest. A notable example of the utilization
of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocar-
bons, because the present-day chemical industry is
heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting
materials.
In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alterna-
tive to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogena-
tion processes and much effort has been exerted for
effective catalyst development and process control.
However, because of the exothermic characteristic of
these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and
avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to

give high selectivity toward olefins. Therefore, it is
expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing
oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxida-
tion. In this paper, we will review the progress of
the conversion of various alkanes to olefins in ODH in
the presence of CO2. These reactions include CH4
coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2-C4 alkanes dehydroge-
nation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromer-
ization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene. It is
shown that the use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides
an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective
oxidation.
2. Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) with
Carbon Dioxide to Ethane and Ethylene
Methane (CH4) is an important natural resource in
the world, with an abundance of C2-C4 hydrocarbons.
Basically, there are three routes for the chemical use
of CH4: (i) an indirect route, through conversion to
syngas; (ii) direct coupling in the presence of O2 or H2;
and (iii) direct conversion to oxygenates. In the past
two decades, a great number of papers have been
published on the direct conversion of CH4, particu-
larly on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)
to C2 hydrocarbons (ethane (C2H6) and ethylene
(C2H4)) by O2.2-5 The reactions involved are listed as
follows:
The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and
CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and
C2H6) (reactions 3-5), however, seems to be one of the
most serious problems, from a practical point of view.
CO2, as an oxidant, has several advantages over O2.
First, CO will be the only byproduct in this case (see
reactions 7 and 8 later in this work). Second, unlike O2,
CO2 will not induce gas-phase radical reactions. In other
words, the reactions of CH4 and CO2 to produce C2
hydrocarbons will mainly be controlled by heteroge-
neous catalysis. It is thus expected that the development
of active catalysts achieve high selectivity to C2 hydro-
carbons.
2.1. Thermodynamics. The overall reactions for CH4
coupling to C2H6 and C2H4 under CO2 can be expressed
as follows:
At the same time, the following side reactions that
produce CO are possible:
Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and
C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are
shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the tem-
perature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase. An enhance-
ment in the CO2:CH4 ratio increases the CH4 conver-
sions to C2H6 and C2H4 and their yields exceed 15% and
25%, respectively, at 800 °C for the reactant with a CO2:
CH4 ratio of 2. These values, if achieved, would meet
the target C2 yield (ca. 30%) estimated from economic
evaluations.6 The key point for the realization is to
develop an efficient catalyst that is capable not only of
activating both CH4 and CO2 but also of producing C2
hydrocarbons selectively. Some investigations have been
conducted in the past few years, and progress is being
achieved in catalyst development.
2.2. Catalyst System. Enhancement of C2 formation
by CO2 was first observed in the oxidative coupling of
CH4 over a PbO/MgO catalyst,7 but it could not be
sustained in the absence of O2.8 Asami et al. systemati-
cally investigated the catalytic activities of more than
30 metal oxides for the conversion of CH4 by CO2 in the
absence of O2 and found that lanthanide oxides gener-
ally showed higher activities (Figure 2). Among them,
praseodymium oxide or terbium oxide exhibited rela-
tively good catalytic performance; a C2 yield of 1.5% with

a selectivity of ca. 50% was obtained at 850 °C (Figure
3).9-11 Wang et al. further investigated the conversion
of CH4 to C2H6 over praseodymium oxide and reported
that praseodymium oxide could be effective in the
presence of CO2 at temperatures as low as ca. 500-650
°C to form C2 hydrocarbons.12
In addition to the monoxide, binary oxide catalysts
were also investigated by several research groups for
the oxidative coupling of methane by CO2. A binary
oxide (La2O3-ZnO) was observed to have high C2
selectivity and good stability, giving a C2 yield of 2.8%.13
Although this yield is better than that of any monoxide
system reported previously, it is still quite low. Wang
et al. investigated ceria that had been modified with
alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal oxides for the
reaction and reported that CaO-CeO2 systems are
effective and that the C2 yield could reach 6.1% at 900
°C.14,15 Characterization of the system indicated that the
redox of Ce4+/Ce3+ relates to the activation of CO2, i.e.,
the dissociation to CO and oxygen species, which ac-
counts for CH4 conversion, and the basic Ca2+ ion in
the catalyst greatly enhances the selectivity to C2
hydrocarbons.15 In the meantime, they also reported
that CaO-Cr2O3 catalysts are effective for this reac-
tion.16 A binary catalyst of CaO-ZnO was also tested
by the same group for the reaction. A C2 selectivity
approaching 80% with a C2 yield of 4.3% was achieved
over the catalyst with a Ca:Zn ratio of 0.5 at 875 °C.
The lattice oxygen of the CaO-ZnO could convert CH4
mainly to H2 and CO. The presence of CO2 formed a
new oxygen species, which was active and selective for
the conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons. The CaO
component in the catalyst enhanced the adsorption of
CO2 and thus suppressed the reaction involving the
lattice oxygen. The reduced Zn site was suggested to
activate CO2.17
Recently, Wang et al. further reported their investi-
gations of catalytic performance and kinetics over other
binary oxides, mainly CaO-MnO2, SrO-MnO2, and
BaO-MnO2, for the CO2 coupling of CH4 to C2H6 and
C2H4. At temperatures of g840 °C, the CaO-MnO2
catalyst exhibited performance similar to that of other
calcium-containing binary oxide catalysts (CaO-CeO2,
CaO-Cr2O3, and CaO-ZnO); C2 selectivity and yield
at 850 °C increased remarkably with increasing partial
pressure of CO2, and apparent activation energies
observed over these catalysts were approximately the
same (190-220 kJ/mol). When the temperature was
decreased from 840 °C to 825 °C, CH4 conversion and
C2 selectivity over the CaO-MnO2 catalyst abruptly

decreased and a discontinuous change was also observed
in the Arrhenius plots. On the other hand, the SrO-
MnO2 and BaO-MnO2 catalysts exhibited kinetic fea-
tures that were different from the CaO-MnO2 system;
C2 selectivity at 850 °C changed only slightly with the
partial pressure of CO2, and the activation energies
were constant over the entire temperature range ex-
amined and notably lower. Characterizations revealed
that a solid solution of Ca0.48Mn0.52O was the main
phase for the CaO-MnO2 catalyst after reaction at 850
°C, whereas, at 800 °C, some Ca2+ ions were separated
from the solid solution to form CaCO3, which covered
the catalyst surface. Such a difference accounted for the
discontinuous change in the catalytic behavior with
temperature. With the SrO-MnO2 and BaO-MnO2
catalysts, SrCO3 and BaCO3 were formed, along with
MnO2, after reaction, and the carbonates were suggested
to react with MnO2 to form SrMnO2.5 and BaMnO2.5 in
the conversion process of CH4 with CO2.18 Cai et al.
further investigated the system of Mn/SrCO3 for the
selective conversion of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons, using
CO2 as an oxidant and achieved C2 selectivities of 88%
and 79.1%, with a C2 yield of 4.3% and 4.5% over
catalysts with an Mn:Sr ratio of 0.1 and 0.2, respec-
tively.19
Zhou and his colleagues investigated a series of lead/
calcium catalysts, promoted with lithium, potassium,
and lanthanum, for OCM and found that CO2 added to
the feed resulted in a decreased CH4 conversion and an
increased C2 selectivity for the lithium/lead/calcium
catalyst.20 Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, which is a better catalyst
for the oxidative coupling of CH4 with O2, was further
investigated in the conversion of CH4 with CO2 to C2
hydrocarbons. A CH4 yield of ∼5% and a selectivity to
C2 of 95% were obtained at 820 °C. The reaction
temperature was observed to favor CH4 conversion but
not the selectivity to C2. This is due to surface lattice
oxygen, which is responsible for the selective oxidation
of CH4 to C2, whereas the bulk lattice oxygen is
responsible for deep oxidation.21
Table 1 presents a summary of the catalytic activity
of the various catalysts that have been investigated. The
MnO2- and ZnO-based catalysts are observed to exhibit
higher C2 yield. A strong basic oxide (e.g., BaO) will not
favor the activation of CH4. It is also observed that the
results reported previously still show a low C2 yield,
compared to the thermodynamic calculations. The high-
est CH4 conversion is 6%, at ∼850 °C, which suggests
that these catalyst systems are not effective in activat-
ing CH4. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new
catalyst systems or to find a new method for the
activation of CH4, thus improving CH4 conversion.
Zhang et al. recently reported using pulse corona plasma
as an activation method and applied it for the reaction
of CH4 and CO2 over some catalysts. The products were
C2 hydrocarbons and the byproducts were CO and
molecular hydrogen (H2). CH4 conversion and the yield
of C2 hydrocarbons were affected by the CO2 concentra-
tion in the feed. The conversion of CH4 increased as the
CO2 concentration in the feed increased, while the yield
of C2 hydrocarbons decreased. The synergism of La2O3/
γ-Al2O3 and plasma gave a CH4 conversion of 24.9% and
C2 hydrocarbons yield of 18.1% were obtained at a
plasma power input of 30 W. The distribution of C2
hydrocarbons was changed through the use of a Pd-
La2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, and the major C2 product was
C2H4.22
2.3. The Role of Carbon Dioxide and the Reac-
tion Mechanism. In the reaction of CH4 coupling, it is
generally believed that the activation of CH4 is the most
important step. The activation of CH4 involves cleavage
of the C-H bond; however, it is not clear whether that
cleavage is (i) heterolytic, resulting in the formation of
methyl ions (CH3+) or CH3•, or (ii) homolytic, leading
to the direct formation of a methyl radical released into
the gas phase.3 Currently, it is generally accepted that
the active sites for the activation of CH4 can be ascribed
to O-(s) or O2-(s) via the reactions
In the presence of O2, CH3- can convert to the CH3
radicals required for dimerization to C2H6 via reaction
with molecular oxygen (O2).

Catalytic Conversion of Alkanes to Olefins

The O2- superoxide species is known to be very
reactive and capable of promoting deep oxidation of the
hydrocarbons to COx. Therefore, it is necessary to
suppress the production of O2- in OCM. Several inves-
tigations have found that a co-feed of CO2 in OCM could
have several effects, including poisoning of the active
sites, stabilization of the active sites, an increase in the
activation energy for CH4 conversion, and enhancement
of the C2 yield or C2 selectivity, depending on the
catalyst systems and process conditions.23,24 Lunsford
and co-workers25 presented a plausible explanation of
the CO2 effect on CH4 conversion and C2 selectivity
during OCM on Li/MgO. The enhancement of C2 selec-
tivity was attributed to the poisoning effect that CO2
had on the secondary reactions between methyl radicals
and the surface modified by the presence of CO2.
For CO2 OCM, Asami et al. suggested two possible
reaction mechanisms, depending on the types of metal
oxides.10 One possible mechanism is that CO2 is first
adsorbed over the metal oxide and decomposed to form
an active oxygen species, and CO is released. The active
species oxidize CH4 to form C2H6 through the methyl
radical, and C2H4 would be formed through the pyrolysis
and ODH of C2H6.
The other mechanism would involve the reaction of
methane with lattice oxygen in metal oxides to form a
methyl radical, which, in turn, is converted to C2
hydrocarbons, and the partly reduced oxides are then
oxidized by CO2.
Liu et al. used O2-TPD and CO2 pulse reaction and
observed that the mechanism of CH4 with CO2 to form
C2 hydrocarbons was via the first reaction mechanism
over Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2,21 whereas for the La2O3/ZnO
system, the second mechanism was proposed for CO2
OCM.13
Wang et al. reported that the oxygen vacancies in
praseodymium oxide have key roles in the low-temper-
ature reaction of CH4 coupling with CO2. CO2 adsorbs
on the oxygen vacancy to form surface oxygen species,
which then activate CH4.12 In their work on binary oxide
catalysts based on CaO (CaO-ZnO, CaO-Cr2O3, CaO-
CeO2, CaO-MnO2), they found similar observations,
that the oxygen vacancies connected to oxides account
for CO2 activation in producing active oxygen species.
CH4 would be converted by the active oxygen to a CH3
radical that is an intermediate for C2 formation. The
lattice O atoms are responsible for the conversion of CH4
to CO.15-17 For strontium- and barium-based catalysts,
they found that the kinetic features for the Sr-Mn and
Ba-Mn catalysts are different from those of the Ca-
Mn catalyst.18 In the presence of CO2, these oxides may
be converted to the corresponding carbonates, which
may subsequently be transformed partly to SrMnO2.5
and BaMnO2.5. These oxides activate CH4 to form the
CH3 radicals and underwent coupling reactions to yield
C2H6. The mechanism is listed below. Cai et al. inves-
tigated the role of CO2 in the Mn-SrCO3 catalyst, and
their results indicate that the oxygen species responsible
for selective C2 formation does not originate from lattice
oxygen but is generated from CO2 during the reaction.19
Therefore, it is concluded that CO2 could have two
important roles in CH4 coupling to C2H6 and C2H4. One
role is to be activated by the oxide surface to form active
oxygen species, inducing CH4 cleavage and giving meth-
yl radicals, and the other role is to act as an oxidized
agent in the cycle of CH4 activation.
3. CO2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of C2-C4
Alkanes to Olefins
In the past two decades, there has been a strong
interest to study the ODH of light alkanes (ethane,
propane, and butane), rather than the direct dehydro-
genation of hydrocarbons, because of the potential
commercial interest to utilize alkanes effectively. In fact,
the dehydrogenation of paraffins (eq 24) to give the
corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic
process that must be performed at temperatures >600
°C. At the high reaction temperatures, other unwanted
reactions that lead to coke also occur, and the catalyst
requires frequent regeneration.
For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25),
the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat
of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at
a much lower reaction temperature. However, because
of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in
the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat
and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides,
to give high selectivity toward the olefins. Reaction 26
shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other
than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main
byproduct.

Wang and Zhu
In the past twenty years, many papers have been
published on the development of catalyst systems for
the ODH of alkanes using oxygen, and their results can
be found in several reviews.26-30 Here, we will review
the progress of CO2 ODH.
3.1. Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Eth-
ylene by CO2. 3.1.1. Catalyst System. The overall
reaction can be described as follows:
Other side reactions can also occur:
All these reactions are observed to be endothermic
reactions, although, in comparison with the side reac-
tions, CO2 ODH is more favorable, in regard to ther-
modynamics.
The promoting effect of CO2 in the ODH of C2H6 was
first reported by Wang and his colleagues.25 They found
that CO2, either formed or added to the system, in-
creased the selectivity for the desired hydrocarbon
products during the oxidative coupling of CH4 and the
ODH of C2H6 by oxygen over Li+/MgO catalysts. The
improved selectivities were attributed to the poisoning
effect that CO2 had on the secondary reactions of alkyl
radicals with the surface.
Krylov et al. conducted investigations on the catalytic
ODHs of C1-C7 alkanes by CO2 on several oxide
catalysts, Fe2O3, Cr2O3, MnO2, and on multicomponent
systems.31,32 For the ODH of C2H6 with CO2 at 800 °C,
MnO2-based catalysts exhibited high activities. Further
improvement could be achieved when the catalyst was
modified by promoters Cr and K.
Nakagawa et al.33 studied the dehydrogenation of
C2H6 by CO2 over several oxides and reported that
gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is an effective catalyst for this
reaction, giving a C2H4 yield of 18.6% with a selectivity
of 94.5% at 650 °C. They also tested various oxide-
supported Ga2O3 catalysts for this reaction and found
that Ga2O3/TiO2 is the most active. C2H4 yields reached
ca. 20%-25% and the selectivity was ca. 70%-90% at
650 °C in the 17% C2H6/83% CO2 feed.34 Using a pulsed
reaction technique, they found that the use of CO2 in
the dehydrogenation of C2H6 could reduce carbon depo-
sition over the catalyst and assist in the rapid desorp-
tion of C2H4 from the catalyst’s surface.35 They further
explored an oxidized-diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst
and found that the oxidized diamond had a significant
role in improving the catalyst performance of the Cr2O3
catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 by CO2,
giving a C2H4 yield of 22.5% with a C2H4 selectivity of
87.7% at 650 °C. The activity of the oxidized-diamond-
supported Cr2O3 catalyst increased as the CO2 partial
pressures increased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analyses of the fresh and reacted catalysts, in the
presence and absence of CO2, revealed that CO2 main-
tained the surface Cr2O3 at a higher oxidation state than
the reaction in the absence of CO2. On the other hand,
the bulk of the Cr2O3 was not reduced in either
atmosphere.36,37
Valenzuela et al.38,39 investigated the selective ODH
of C2H6 with CO2 over ceria (CeO2)-based catalysts. The
presence of Ca2+ ions in solid solution in the CeO2
crystalline network significantly increased the selectiv-
ity to C2H4 and the efficiency of CO2 as an oxidant in
the heterogeneous reaction. They believed that the
reaction was rather complicated, because of the coexist-
ence of homogeneous dehydrogenation in the gas phase
and heterogeneous catalysis on the catalyst surface.
CeO2 acted as a redox catalyst. The actual contribution
for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis is
75%-55% in the temperature range of 680-720 °C. The
reaction routes can be expressed in the following reac-
tions:
Wang et al. investigated the effect of support on the
catalytic ODH of C2H6 into C2H4 by CO2 over an
unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst and several supported
Cr2O3 catalysts on metal oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2,
TiO2, and ZrO2.40 The unsupported Cr2O3 showed
medium catalytic activity in this reaction; the support
would exert a very different effect on the catalytic
behavior. The catalytic activity varied with the nature
of supports. Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent
performance in this reaction. Cr2O3 loading also affected
the catalytic activity; 8 wt % Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could
produce a C2H4 yield of 55.5% at 61% C2H6 conversion
at 650 °C. Characterization indicated that the distribu-
tion of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium
species structure were influenced by the nature of
supports. The acidity/basicity and redox property of the
catalysts determined the catalytic activity in the dehy-
drogenation of C2H6 by CO2. On the basis of this

characterization, they proposed the following mecha-
nism:
They further investigated a series of Cr2O3/SiO2
catalysts that were modified by some acidic and basic
oxides and found that the sulfation of silica presented
a positive effect on C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield
while tungstation and addition of strong basic promoters
(alkali-metal oxides) suppressed the catalytic activity.
A CrK/SO4-SiO2 catalyst exhibited the best perfor-
mance, giving high activity and stability (Figure 4).41,42
Characterizations indicate that the addition of sulfate
changes the bulk and surface properties of Cr2O3/SiO2,
promoting the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ and favoring
the catalytic conversion. The ODH of C2H6 to C2H4 by
CO2 over a series of silica-supported chromium oxide
catalysts was also investigated by another research
group. The results showed that the catalysts were
effective for the reaction and CO2 in the feed promoted
the catalytic activity. The 5 wt % Cr/SiO2 catalyst
exhibited excellent performance, with 30.7% C2H6 con-
version and 96.5% C2H4 selectivity at 700 °C. Electron
spin resonance (ESR) and ultraviolet-diffuse reflec-
tance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) were used to probe the
active sites and the species with high-valency states
(Cr5+ and/or Cr6+) were determined to be important for
the reaction.43
A Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was also tested for the reac-
tion. It is reported that the maximum rate of formation
of C2H4 at 650 °C was 0.516 mmol gcat/min and the
selectivity was >90%. CO2 maintained the activity of
the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the
catalyst. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
spectrometry profiles of the Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts sug-
gested that high-oxidation-state chromium species such
as Cr6+ were present on the catalyst, which was consid-
ered the key to higher activity.44 Recently, Wang et al.
investigated the performance of a mesoporous molecular
sieve (Si-MCM41) supported chromium catalyst pre-
pared by different methods in selective dehydrogenation
of lower alkanes with CO2 and reported 99.7% selectiv-
ity to C2H4 at 11.5% C2H6 at 550 °C for C2H6 dehydro-
genation.45
Activated-carbon-supported oxide catalyst systems
were investigated by Yang et al.46 Cr2O3 was the best
catalyst among the activated-carbon-supported iron,
manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, and chromium
oxide catalysts. At 550-650 °C, an C2H4 selectivity of
69.6%-87.5% was achieved for a C2H6 conversion of
8.5%-29.2%. CO2 facilitates the dehydrogenation of
C2H6 and enhances C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield.
Moreover, coke deposition on the catalyst was signifi-
cantly retarded.46
A Cr/Si-2 catalyst was developed to possess good
reactivity for the formation of C2H4 by the ODH of C2H6
with CO2 by Xu et al.47 The addition of manganese and
lanthanum oxides could improve the reactivity of the
catalyst. They also found that increasing the CO2:C2H6
ratio of the feed gas could increase the C2H6 conversion
and C2H4 selectivity of the Cr/Si-2 catalyst. Moreover,
the addition of steam to the feed gas could diminish coke
formation during the reaction process. The main reac-
tions for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 with CO2 to C2H4
have been deduced to consist of the cracking of C2H6 to
C2H4 and CO2 hydrogenation to CO.47 The catalytic
performance of Fe/Si-2 and Fe-Mn/Si-2 catalysts for the
conversion of C2H6 with CO2 to C2H4 was further
examined in a continuous-flow and fixed-bed reactor.
The results showed that the Fe-Mn/Si-2 catalyst exhib-
its much better reaction activity and selectivity to C2H4
than those of the Fe/Si-2 catalyst, achieving a C2H4
selectivity of 93% and a C2H6 conversion of 66%. The
promotion of Mn to the Fe/Si-2 catalyst lies not only in
increasing C2H4 selectivity but also in improving the
catalytic stability greatly. The promotion of Mn to the
improvement of the catalytic stability of the Fe/sili-
calite-2 catalyst results from the great prohibition of
coke formation on the Fe-Mn/silicalite-2 catalyst sur-
faces. The coking-decoking behaviors of these catalysts
were studied through thermogravimetry (TG). The
catalytic performances of the catalysts after regenera-
tion for conversion of C2H6 or dilute C2H6 in fluidized

catalytic cracking (FCC) off-gas with CO2 to C2H4 were
also examined. The results showed that both the activity
and selectivity of the Fe-Mn/Si-2 catalyst after regen-
eration reached the same level as those of the fresh
catalyst, whereas it is difficult for the Fe/Si-2 catalyst
to refresh its reaction behavior after regeneration.48,49
Other non-oxide catalyst systems were also developed.
Solymosi and Nemeth50 prepared Mo2C on SiO2 and
found it to be an effective catalyst for the dehydroge-
nation of C2H6 to produce C2H4 in the presence of CO2.
The selectivity to C2H4 at 575-650 °C was 90%-95%
at a C2H6 conversion of 8%-30%.50
The performance of the Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst for
the ODH of C2H6, under oxygen and CO2, was investi-
gated and compared. C2H6 conversion and selectivity to
C2H4 values of >70% could be achieved at 700 °C, with
a space velocity of >30 000 h-1. The stability test of the
catalyst for the ODH of C2H6 showed that C2H6 conver-
sion and selectivity remained constant for 100 h. CO2
could be used as an oxidant instead of O2 for ODH of
C2H6. A C2H6 conversion of 53.3% and 97% selectivity
to C2H4 could be obtained at 800 °C. The selectivity
decreased when temperature was >800 °C. The surface
lattice oxygen was proposed to be responsible for selec-
tive ODH of C2H6, whereas the bulk lattice oxygen was
responsible for the deep oxidation of C2H6.51
Table 2 summarizes the catalytic activity of previ-
ously investigated catalyst systems. A comparison of the
relative C2H4 yields suggests that the catalyst systems
that contain radical promoting metals (chromium, man-
ganese, and iron) are the most effective. The type of
support also influences the catalyst activity. The best
C2H4 yields can be achieved on the catalysts that use
acidic supports such as SiO2, Si-2, and H-ZSM5.
3.1.2. Kinetics and Mechanism. CO2 ODH of C2H6 to
C2H4 is a new process. Most of the recent investigations
have focused on the catalyst development. Few papers
have been concerned with the kinetics. Krylov and his
colleagues31,32 proposed a kinetic equation for a Cr-Mn/
SiO2 catalyst. The rate of C2H6 dehydrogenation by CO2
is described by the equation
Valenzuela et al. investigated the kinetics of the CO2
dehydrogenation of C2H6 over CeO2 and CaO-CeO2
systems and found that the activation energies are 30-
40 kcal/mol and the reaction orders are 0.55-0.95, with
respect to C2H6.38,39 Xu et al. investigated the kinetics
of CO2 ODH of C2H6 over Cr/Si-2 catalysts and obtained
an activation energy of 55.5 kJ/mol.47
3.2. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane by
CO2. For the CO2 ODH of propane (C3H8), some typical
reactions, including dehydrogenation, ODH, and re-
forming reactions, might proceed on catalysts.
Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the
equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2
and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium
conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8
in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without

CO2. For example, at 600 °C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar
ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches
92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conver-
sion is achieved under the same conditions. In other
words, in the presence of CO2 and with a CO2:C3H8
molar ratio of 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation
can be ∼100 °C lower than that for simple dehydroge-
nation without dilution. As the CO2:C3H8 ratio increases,
the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 will also increase.
Zhaorigetu and his colleagues reported the promoting
effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 when they
investigated the ODH of C3H8 by O2.52 They found that
the addition of CO2 into the feed resulted in an
increased C3H6 selectivity, together with a decreased
CO formation through the total oxidation of the alkane
or the formed alkene on rare-earth vanadates as well
as the niobium-promoted catalysts.52 Takahara and co-
workers53,54 then investigated the CO2 dehydrogenation
of C3H8 over various supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Their
results showed that CO2 exerted a promoting effect only
on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. Zou et al.55 investi-
gated the effect of Cr2O3 loading in CrOx/SiO2 systems
on the C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction under a CO2
atmosphere. The order of C3H8 conversion and selectiv-
ity to propylene (C3H6) was observed to be as follows:
2.5 wt %CrOx/SiO2 > 5 wt %CrOx/SiO2 > 10 wt %CrOx/
SiO2. The results of ESR and UV-vis DRS (measured
during the reaction process) indicated that the active
centers of the CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction is the
Cr5+ species, which is probably generated from Cr3+
species that oxidizes during the calcination and chro-
mate reduction during the reaction. The role of CO2 is
to reoxidize the Cr3+ species to Cr5+ species in the
reaction. The differences in the catalytic behavior of
other various supported Cr2O3 catalysts in the reactions
were also investigated. It was reported that Cr2O3/SBA-
15 and Cr2O3/ZrO2/SBA-15 were more selective to C3H6
and more resistant to coking, in comparison to Cr2O3/
ZrO2 and Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3 for the non-oxidative dehydro-
genation of C3H8. In the ODH of C3H8 by O2 and CO2,
Cr2O3/SBA-15 also displayed better activity, selectivity,
and stability than the other two supported catalysts.

reached 24.2% and 20.3%, respectively.56 In addition,
Cr/MCM-41 catalysts were investigated and a C3H8
conversion of 17% and C3H6 selectivity of 93%-95%
were obtained.45
Several other types of catalysts (except chromium-
based systems) were also tested. Solymosi et al.57
investigated the ODH of C3H8 with CO2 over supported
Mo2C catalysts. The selectivity to C3H6 at 500-600 °C
is 85%-90%; the yield is ∼11% at 670 °C. The advan-
tages of CO2 use for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to
C3H6, on the basis of thermodynamic considerations,
were reported and several metal oxides (e.g., Ga2O3,
Cr2O3, and Fe2O3, unsupported and supported on γ-Al2O3
and SiO2) were tested by Michorczyk and Ogonowski.58
The Ga2O3 catalyst was determined to be an effective
agent for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6. The yield
of C3H6 at 600 °C was 30.1%.58 The effects of CO2 added
in the gas feed for the ODH of C3H8 to C3H6 are
investigated on NiMoO4 catalysts. Despite the low
reaction temperature range (400-480 °C), it turned out
that CO2 was not inert during the reaction. CO2 behaved
as a strong oxidant, with respect to the catalyst. CO2
helped to maintain the catalytic surface in a high
oxidation state under conditions for which NiMoO4
underwent reduction. CO2 clearly promoted the nonse-
lectivity of the catalyst and could inhibit deactivation.
Under particular conditions, it could improve C3H6
formation.59 Nakagawa et al.60 investigated several
oxides on oxidized diamond for the dehydrogenation of
C3H8 in the presence of CO2 and found that only
supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed effective
catalytic activity, whereas other metal oxides (e.g., ZrO2,
ZnO, Fe2O3, and Ga2O3) showed little effects. They also
found that the catalyst activity was dependent on the
type of support and that the support activity order was
as follows:
oxidized diamond > Al2O3 > activated
carbon > SiO2.
3.3. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Butane. N-
Butenes (C4H8) and isobutene (i-C4H8) productions are
also of considerable industrial importance. Much progress
has been made in the development of catalysts for ODH
of n-butane (C4H10) and isobutane (i-C4H10) to C4H8 and
i-C4H8 in the past several years. More-detailed informa-
tion on the ODH of C4H10 by oxygen can be found in a
recent review.61 However, little work has been done for
these reactions when CO2 is used as an oxidant.
Krylov et al.31,32 reported that a Cr-Mn-La-V/Al2O3
catalyst for CO2 dehydrogenation of C4H10 showed 81%-
84% C4H10 conversion and 76%-78% selectivity to C2-
C4 olefins at 630-650 °C. They also found that various
Cr-Mn/SiO2 and Cr-Mn-K/Al2O3 catalysts were effec-
tive for the CO2 dehydrogenation of i-C4H10. The most
effective catalyst, Cr-Mn/Al2O3, produced an i-C4H10
conversion of 61%-66% with 78-81% selectivity to
i-C4H8. The kinetic studies gave a form similar to that
of the Mars-van Krevelen equation:
Wang et al. reported, for i-C4H10 dehydrogenation
with Cr/MCM41 catalyst, a selectivity of 90.4% at an
i-C4H10 conversion of 18.3%.45 Shimada et al.62 found
that iron loaded on activated carbon produced an
i-C4H10 conversion of 48% with 80% i-C4H8 selectivity
at 600 °C in the ODH of i-C4H10 by CO2. The co-feeding
of CO2 promoted dehydrogenation, as compared to
feeding bulk i-C4H10 or an i-C4H10 and argon mixture.
A redox cycle of Fe3O4 and metallic iron was suggested
for the catalytic cycle in the CO2 ODH by analyzing XRD
and XPS results. Carbon deposition was reduced under
a CO2 stream, as compared with the reaction under an
argon atmosphere. Bi et al. investigated the influence
of the addition of CO2 in the ODH of i-C4H10 over La/
Ba/Sm oxide catalysts in the temperature range of 450-
600 °C.63 That study showed that La/Ba/Sm oxide was
an active and stable catalyst for the ODH of i-C4H8,
achieving 40% i-C4H8 conversion and 50% selectivity to
i-C4H8.63 The kinetic investigations indicated that the
activation energies for CO2 ODH are 12-16 kcal/mol,
which are lower than those of dehydrogenation (32-34
kcal/mol).
Nakagawa et al.60 recently extended their work on
the oxidized-diamond-supported catalysts for C2H6 de-
hydrogenation to C4H10 and i-C4H10 dehydrogenation in
the presence or absence of CO2. They found a very small
promoting effect of CO2 on the C4H10 and i-C4H10
conversion over a V2O5 catalyst. The weak promoting
effect of a CO2 atmosphere in the cases of C3 and C4
alkanes might be ascribed to the fact that lower reaction
temperatures were applied to obtain considerable con-
versions, because the bond dissociation energies of CH2
or CH groups in C2H6, C4H10, and i-C4H10 are lower than
that of CH3 in C2H6. In the dehydrogenation of a higher
alkane, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen,
which has a much lower bond dissociation energy than
that of starting alkanes. Thus, the abstraction of
hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more
rapidly to produce coke precursors. Deactivation of the
catalyst could not be avoided, consequently decreasing
the alkene yields.
4. Aromatization of Lower Hydrocarbons in the
Presence of CO2
BTX hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) are
important sources of petrochemicals for gasoline and
other feedstocks. Aromatization of lower alkanes is an
interest in industry, and many efforts have been made
in this area. The transformation of CH4 to aromatics is
thermodynamically more favorable than the transfor-
mation of CH4 to C2H6, and extensive efforts have also
been devoted to the direct conversion along this line in
heterogeneous catalysis. In 1993, Wang et al.64 reported

on the dehydroaromatization of CH4 under non-oxidiz-
ing conditions in a flow reactor mode on HZSM-5 zeolite
catalysts modified with transition-metal ions. Since
then, many researchers have paid more attention to this
process and made encouraging progress toward catalyst
development.65,66 Because of coking, this reaction suffers
severely from its rapid catalyst deactivation. Without
doubt, how to stabilize the catalyst activity would be a
primary problem to be solved in realizing its future
application. However, neither new active and selective
catalysts nor a thorough understanding of the mecha-
nism of the reaction has been achieved. To achieve the
high activity and stability in methane dehydroaroma-
tization, novel approaches to reduce carbon deposition
are being made. The co-feeding of some oxidants (NO,
O2, CO, and CO2) with CH4 has been proposed.67 Here,
we discuss some investigations using CO or CO2 as an
oxidant.
Ohnishi et al.68 reported their investigation on the
catalytic dehydroaromatization of CH4 via the addition
of CO and CO2 at 1 atm and 700 °C on Mo/HZSM-5 and
Fe/Co-modified Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. With pure CH4
as the feed gas, molybdenum-supported catalysts showed
rapid deactivation, because of significant coke forma-
tion. In contrast, the addition of a few percent of CO
and CO2 to the CH4 feed promoted benzene (C6H6)
production and significantly improved the stability of
the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at prolonged times-on-stream.
For iron- and cobalt-modified Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, the
CH4 reaction with CO yielded higher activities of C6H6
production with good catalytic stability for more than
100 h, because of minimization of the coke formation to
<20%. Adding a few percent of CO2 to the CH4 feed
resulted in the promotion of catalyst stability in forming
CO, although excessive addition of CO2 (>10%) to the
CH4 feed gas largely inhibited the formation of aromatic
products such as C6H6, in a manner similar to complete
poisoning by the addition of a few percent of O2 (Figure
6). For other catalysts (e.g., zeolite-supported rhenium
(Re) catalysts), stable catalytic activity could be obtained
only when CO2 or CO was added into the CH4 feed.69
Under pressurized conditions, the catalytic dehydroaro-
matization of CH4 by the addition of CO and CO2 was
also investigated by the same group. Under a CH4
pressure of >0.2 MPa and a suitable CO2 concentration
in the CH4 feed, the high activity and stability were
achieved at elevated reaction temperatures of >750 °C
and CH4 space velocities of >5400 mL g-1 h-1, because
of minimized coke formation on the Mo/HZSM-5 cata-
lyst. It was suggested that the added CO2 reacted with
coke before its transformation to inactive graphitic
carbon, blocking the microporous channels of the HZSM-5
zeolite, which is more detrimental to the CH4 dehydro-
condensation reaction.70
In addition to the CH4 dehydroaromization described
above, few investigations have been reported on dehy-
droaromization of C2H6 and C3H8 using CO2. Nakagawa
et al. reported the promoting effect of CO2 on the
aromatization of C2H6 and C2H4 over a Ga2O3/HZSM-5

catalyst at >650 °C.34 Aromatics yields were higher than
those without CO2.
HZSM-5 and metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cr3+, Fe3+ and
Ni2+, in HZSM-5 catalysts have been tested for the
aromatization of C3H8, and a 15% selectivity to aromat-
ics at 50% conversion has been achieved over HZSM-5.
The incorporation of metal ions enhanced the catalytic
activity for CO2 reduction. The addition of CO2 was
observed to suppress the coke deposition during the
aromatization of C3H8.71 The schematics of the reaction
routes are described as follows:
5. Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene
Styrene is one of the most important monomers in
the modern petrochemical industry. It is mainly used
for the production of many different polymeric materi-
als, such as polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile, and
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Another im-
portant application is in styrene-butadiene latex. The
most important commercial production routes for sty-
rene are the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
(EB) in the presence of a large quantity of steam at high
temperatures of 600-700 °C and the oxidation of EB
to ethylbenzenehydroperoxide, which is subsequently
reacted with propylene to give styrene and propylene
oxide.72
In commercial practice, steam is co-fed with the EB
and serves several purposes. First, it delivers the
required heat and acts as a diluent, resulting in a shift
to higher equilibrium conversions. Second, it limits the
buildup of carbonaceous deposits by gasification. Fi-
nally, as an oxidation agent, it renders the iron oxide
in an appropriate oxidation state. However, this process
suffers from energy loss and catalyst deactivation,
because of coking. The catalyst slowly deactivates and
typically needs to be replaced every 1-2 years. There-
fore, much effort has been exerted to improve the
practice.
CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of
the catalyst and increase energy savings. Matsui et al.73
first reported a beneficial effect of CO2, with respect to
catalyst deactivation, in 1991. The addition of small
amounts of CO2 (0.1-0.5 mol %) to the feed over a
commercial catalyst resulted in a suppression of the
catalyst activity decay, albeit at the cost of a slight
decrease in the rate of styrene formation. Recently,
much interest have been raised in the use of CO2 instead
of steam and, thus, several catalyst systems have been
developed.
Mimura and Saito proposed two possible reaction
pathways for the dehydrogenation in the presence of
CO2: a one-step pathway, shown in reaction 47, and a
two-step pathway, via reaction 48 followed by reaction
49. The equilibrium yields of styrene at different tem-
peratures for the two reaction pathways, and the simple
dehydrogenation, were calculated and are shown in
Figure 7a. The equilibrium yield of styrene in the
presence of CO2 either via the one-step pathway or the
two-step pathway is greater than that in the presence
of steam. Higher CO2 content in the co-feed favors the
yield of styrene. In the case of a CO2:ethylbenzene ratio
of >8 for a one-step pathway, or in the case of a CO2:
ethylbenzene ratio of >3 for a two-step pathway, the
equilibrium yield of styrene in dehydrogenation in the
presence of CO2 at 550°C is higher than that in the
presence of steam at 600 °C (see Figure 7b).
An early attempt to use CO2 as a diluent and oxidant
in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene was performed
over an activated-carbon-supported iron catalyst (17%
Fe) at 500-700 °C. An addition of 20-30 mol % of
lithium nitrate to iron resulted in a significant increase
in the catalytic activity. The highest yield of styrene

(40%-45%) with >90% selectivity was obtained at an
Li:Fe ratio of 0.1-0.2 (mol/mol). In addition to styrene,
CO and water (H2O) were formed as products. This
indicated that the reaction proceeded via an ODH
mechanism.74
Chang and co-workers75,76 investigated the dehydro-
genation of EB with CO2 over a ZSM-5-supported iron
oxide catalyst, a commercial catalyst (K-Fe2O3), and
unsupported iron oxide (Fe3O4), for comparison. They
found that EB was predominantly converted to styrene
via an oxidative manner. CO2 in this reaction played
the role of an oxidant to greatly improve catalytic
activity as well as coke resistance of the catalyst. On
the other hand, both the commercial catalyst and the
unsupported Fe3O4 exhibited a considerable decrease in
catalytic activity under the same conditions. They
suggested that an active phase for the dehydrogenation
with CO2 over ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst
would, instead, be a reduced and isolated magnetite
(Fe3O4)-like phase that has a oxygen deficiency in the
zeolite matrix.77,78
In the follow-up research, they investigated a series
of zirconia (ZrO2)-based catalysts for this reaction. ZrO2
itself was observed to be active for the dehydrogenation
of EB, especially in the presence of CO2. This positive
effect of CO2 was highly dependent on the crystalline
phases of ZrO2. The higher the tetragonal phase con-
tained in ZrO2, the higher the EB conversion and
styrene selectivity that were obtained. Highly tetragonal
ZrO2 was more active in ODH than monoclinic ZrO2.
The differences of catalytic activities could be ascribed
to the differences of the surface area and CO2 affinity,
relative to surface basicity.79 The addition of a CeO2
promoter to ZrO2 improved the catalytic activity sig-
nificantly, which was attributed to the increasing basic-
ity, as well as oxygen vancancies. The loading of iron
oxide onto only ZrO2 among ZrO2-related materials is
effective for improving the activity.80
Vislovskiy et al.81 reported high activity and selectiv-
ity over various vanadia-alumina (V2O5-Al2O3) cata-
lysts in dehydrogenation of EB to styrene with CO2.
Redox behavior of V2O5 played a key role in the
dehydrogenation. Among several additives, antimony
oxide has been observed to improve catalyst stability
as well as catalytic activity to produce styrene. Char-
acterization revealed that the addition of the antimony
oxide led to an easier redox cycle between fully oxidized
and reduced vanadium species.
Mimura et al. estimated the energy required for the
dehydrogenation of EB to produce styrene using CO2
and the commercial process using steam to be 6.3 × 108
cal/t-styrene and 1.5 × 109 cal/t-styrene, respectively
(Figure 8), which indicates that the new process using
CO2 should be an “energy-saving process”. They thus
developed an Fe/Ca/Al oxide catalyst, which exhibited
high performance in the dehydrogenation of EB with
CO2 and less deactivation.82 The dehydrogenation of EB
over the catalyst in the presence of CO2 was considered
to proceed via 45% of a one-step pathway and via 55%
of a two-step pathway.83 They also prepared some
calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds as catalysts for the
dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2. The
activity of the FeAl2Zn6 oxide catalyst was the highest
among the catalysts tested.84
Badstube et al. also investigated the catalytic behav-
ior of iron supported on activated carbon in the ODH of
EB with CO2 as an oxidant. High EB conversion (>70%)
and selectivity toward styrene (>90%) were observed
at 550 °C.85 They further studied the influence of the
type and concentration of transition-metal and alkali-
metal oxides, and the type of the catalyst support, as
well as the pretreatment method, on catalytic activity
and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of EB
with CO2. Activated-carbon-supported iron oxide pro-
moted by an alkali-metal oxide (Fe2O3-K2O/C) exhibited
the highest performance in the reaction.86 However, this
catalyst underwent deactivation, because of the forma-
tion of an inactive carbonaceous deposit. It was found
that the activity depended almost linearly on the
amount of (and decrease in) surface area. An excess of
CO in relation to styrene in the product distribution
suggested that the deposit was formed as a result of
styrene polymerization, and further dehydrogenation,
on the catalyst surface.87 Kustrowski et al. synthesized
some other catalysts that were based on hydrotalcite-
like precursors (Mg-Fe and Mg-Al-Fe) and applied them
in the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2. During the EB
dehydrogenation, the catalysts gradually lost their
activity, because of carbonaceous deposits that were
created on the surface. Nevertheless, the losses in

pletely restored by oxygen pulses.88
Activated-carbon-supported vanadium catalysts were
investigated by Sakurai and his colleagues for the
dehydrogenation of EB in an argon or CO2 atmo-
sphere.89 The catalyst, which can be described as 1.0
mmol of vanadium loaded onto 1 g of activated carbon,
afforded the highest EB conversion of 67.1%, a styrene
yield of 54.2%, and a styrene selectivity of 80.8% at 550
K with a W/F of 70 gcat h/mol of EB in CO2. EB
conversion and styrene yield in the presence of CO2 were
14.0% higher than those in argon. They also found that
MgO-supported vanadium gave a markedly high yield
and selectivity of styrene during the dehydrogenation
of EB to styrene under CO2. CO2 could oxidize the
reduced vanadium oxide species on MgO and keep the
vanadium species at a high oxidation state.90 At 600 °C,
the catalyst afforded the highest styrene yield, 73.8%
with a selectivity of 90.1%, in the presence of CO2.
Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation
reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or
Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO. The reduced species,
V4+ and V3+, were less reactive for the dehydrogena-
tion.91 In addition, the dehydrogenation of isopropyl-
benzene to alpha-methylstyrene was performed using
various supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence
of CO2. An activated-carbon-supported vanadium oxide
catalyst afforded a high activity in a CO2 atmosphere:
the alpha-methylstyrene yield in a CO2 atmosphere was
twice as great as that obtained in an argon atmosphere
at 450 °C.92
Recently, the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence
of CO2 over an Al2O3-supported iron oxide catalyst was
investigated at temperatures in the range of 525-600
°C under atmospheric pressure. The yield of styrene
increased as W/F increased and reached its highest
value (74%) at a W/F value of ∼40 gcat min/mmol EB,
where the selectivity to styrene was 96%. An increase
in reaction temperature, from 575 °C to 600 °C, im-
proved the yield of styrene but decreased the selectivity
to styrene slightly. The yield of styrene was the highest
at CO2:EB ratios of 5-10. The selectivity to styrene
increased slightly as the CO2:EB ratio increased from
15 to 30. However, an increase in either the reaction
temperature or the CO2:EB ratio could produce more
carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst during the dehy-
drogenation in the presence of CO2.93
6. Conclusions
Carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major greenhouse
gas, can be utilized as a mild oxidant for the selective
oxidation of hydrocarbons. Dehydrogenation of alkanes
by CO2 to olefins is a promising alternative to dehydro-
genation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by
oxygen, which suffer from either coking problems or
over-oxidation. CO2 has also been observed to be an
effective oxidant in the oxidative coupling of methane
(OCM) to ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4), the ODH
of C2-C4 alkanes to alkenes, the dehydroaromerization
of lower hydrocarbons (methane (CH4), C2H6, and pro-
pane (C3H8)) to benzene (C6H6), and the ODH of ethyl-
benzene (EB) to styrene. For all these reactions, several
efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their
redox property dominates the catalytic activity. In those
reactions, CO2 can have different roles, depending on
the catalyst systems and reactions: (i) CO2 can produce
active oxygen species; (ii) CO2 reoxidizes the reduced
oxides, forming the redox cycle; and (iii) CO2 oxidizes
the carbon species, reducing coking. However, few
investigations have been conducted in the past to
explore the reaction mechanism for those reactions, and
the active sites for hydrocarbon activation are still under
debate. Therefore, it is recommended that the future
research should be more focused on reaction mecha-
nisms and kinetics, to provide more information on the
catalyst design. For CH4 coupling with CO2, more-
efficient catalyst systems should be developed to meet
the theoretical prediction. In CO2 dehydrogenation and
dehydroaromerization of lower alkanes to alkenes,
deactivation of the catalyst is a problem for developing
new catalyst systems with long-term stable performance.
