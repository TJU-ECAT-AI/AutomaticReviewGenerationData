[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

The literature does not provide specific information about how various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some general challenges and performance issues with chromium oxide catalysts:

1. While chromium oxide on supports are considered the most effective catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, they have several drawbacks.

2. These catalysts tend to overconvert ethane to unwanted byproducts like methane and CO2, especially at high temperatures (>700°C) needed for high ethane conversion (>70%). This reduces selectivity for the desired ethylene product.

3. Chromium oxide catalysts show poor CO2 conversion (<20%).

4. They are unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime, deactivating after only a few hours.

5. The main challenge is to develop catalysts that can achieve high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and high ethylene selectivity (>80%) while being efficient, stable, and inexpensive.

The literature does not provide information on how CO2 partial pressure affects these catalysts or discuss specific mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address the question's aspects regarding support materials, reaction conditions, and mechanistic details for chromium oxide catalysts in this reaction.

该文献没有提供关于各种载体材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了铬氧化物催化剂的一些一般性挑战和性能问题：

1. 虽然载体上的铬氧化物被认为是在CO2存在下进行乙烷脱氢的最有效催化剂，但它们有几个缺点。

2. 这些催化剂倾向于将乙烷过度转化为不需要的副产品，如甲烷和CO2，尤其是在高温（>700°C）下需要高乙烷转化率（>70%）时。这降低了所需乙烯产物的选择性。

3. 铬氧化物催化剂显示出较低的CO2转化率（<20%）。

4. 它们不稳定、昂贵，且寿命短，只使用几小时后就会失活。

5. 主要挑战是开发能够实现高乙烷转化率（>70%）、高CO2转化率（>50%）和高乙烯选择性（>80%）的催化剂，同时还要高效、稳定和低成本。

文献没有提供CO2分压如何影响这些催化剂的信息，也没有讨论具体的机理途径。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答问题中涉及的支持材料、反应条件和铬氧化物催化剂在此反应中的机理细节等方面。
