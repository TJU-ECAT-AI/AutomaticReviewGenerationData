[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

The literature does not provide detailed information about various support materials or reaction conditions for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some general challenges and performance issues with chromium oxide-based catalysts:

1. While chromium oxide on supports are described as the most effective catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, they have several drawbacks.

2. At high temperatures (>700°C) needed for high ethane conversion (>70%), chromium-based catalysts tend to overconvert ethane to unwanted byproducts like methane and carbon dioxide, reducing ethylene selectivity.

3. CO2 conversion is low (<20%) with chromium oxide-based catalysts.

4. These catalysts are unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime, deactivating after only a few hours.

5. The main challenges in catalyst design for this reaction are achieving high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and high ethylene selectivity (>80%) simultaneously, while also maintaining stability, efficiency, and low cost.

The literature does not specifically address the influence of different support materials or CO2 partial pressure on catalyst performance. It also does not provide information on mechanistic pathways for chromium oxide catalysts in this reaction. To fully answer the question, more specific research on chromium oxide catalysts and their supports would be needed.

这篇文献没有提供关于各种支撑材料或铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的反应条件的详细信息。然而，它确实提到了铬氧化物基催化剂的一些一般性挑战和性能问题：

1. 虽然支撑的铬氧化物被描述为在CO2存在下进行乙烷脱氢的最有效催化剂，但它们有几个缺点。

2. 在需要高乙烷转化率（>70%）的高温（>700°C）下，铬基催化剂倾向于将乙烷过度转化为不需要的副产品，如甲烷和二氧化碳，从而降低了乙烯的选择性。

3. 使用铬氧化物基催化剂时，CO2的转化率很低（<20%）。

4. 这些催化剂不稳定、昂贵，寿命短，仅使用几小时后就会失活。

5. 这种反应的催化剂设计的主要挑战是同时实现高乙烷转化率（>70%）、高CO2转化率（>50%）和高乙烯选择性（>80%），同时保持稳定性、效率和低成本。

文献没有具体讨论不同支撑材料或CO2分压对催化剂性能的影响。它也没有提供这种反应中铬氧化物催化剂的机理途径信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对铬氧化物催化剂及其支撑材料进行更具体的研究。
