[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the influence of various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some general challenges and performance issues with chromium oxide-based catalysts:

1. Activity: Chromium oxide catalysts are described as the most effective for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, but they have low CO2 conversion rates (less than 20%).

2. Selectivity: At high temperatures (above 700°C) and high ethane conversions (above 70%), these catalysts tend to overconvert ethane to unwanted byproducts like methane and carbon dioxide, reducing ethylene selectivity.

3. Stability: Chromium oxide-based catalysts are reported to be unstable and have a short lifetime, deactivating after only a few hours of use.

4. Cost: These catalysts are described as expensive.

The key challenges in optimizing chromium oxide catalysts include:

1. Improving CO2 conversion rates while maintaining high ethane conversion.
2. Enhancing selectivity towards ethylene, especially at high temperatures and conversion rates.
3. Increasing catalyst stability and lifetime.
4. Reducing the cost of the catalysts.

The literature suggests that there is a need for more efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that can achieve high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and high ethylene selectivities (>80%). However, specific information about the influence of different support materials or CO2 partial pressure on the performance and mechanistic pathways is not provided in the given text.

该文献没有提供有关各种支撑材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）对CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的详细信息。但是，它提到了铬氧化物基催化剂的一些普遍挑战和性能问题：

1. 活性：铬氧化物催化剂被描述为在CO2存在下进行乙烷脱氢的最有效催化剂，但它们的CO2转化率较低（低于20%）。

2. 选择性：在高温（700°C以上）和高乙烷转化率（70%以上）下，这些催化剂倾向于将乙烷过度转化为不需要的副产品，如甲烷和二氧化碳，从而降低了乙烯的选择性。

3. 稳定性：据报道，铬氧化物基催化剂不稳定，寿命短，使用几小时后就会失活。

4. 成本：这些催化剂被描述为昂贵。

优化铬氧化物催化剂的主要挑战包括：

1. 在保持高乙烷转化率的同时提高CO2转化率。
2. 提高对乙烯的选择性，特别是在高温和高转化率下。
3. 提高催化剂的稳定性和使用寿命。
4. 降低催化剂的成本。

文献表明，需要开发更高效、更稳定和更便宜的催化剂，以实现高乙烷转化率（>70%）、高CO2转化率（>50%）和高乙烯选择性（>80%）。然而，给定的文本中没有提供不同支撑材料或CO2分压对性能和机理途径影响的具体信息。
