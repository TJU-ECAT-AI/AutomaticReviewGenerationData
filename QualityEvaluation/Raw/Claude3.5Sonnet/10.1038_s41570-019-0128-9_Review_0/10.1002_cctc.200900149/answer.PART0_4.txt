[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

The literature does not provide specific information about how various support materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some general challenges and performance issues with chromium oxide catalysts:

1. While chromium oxide on supports are considered the most effective catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, they have several drawbacks.

2. At high temperatures (>700°C) needed for high ethane conversion (>70%), chromium-based catalysts overconvert ethane to unwanted byproducts like methane and CO2, reducing ethylene selectivity.

3. CO2 conversion is low (<20%) with chromium oxide-based catalysts.

4. These catalysts are unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime, deactivating after only a few hours.

5. The main challenge is to develop efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that can achieve high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and high ethylene selectivity (>80%).

The literature does not provide information on how CO2 partial pressure affects the catalysts' performance or discuss specific mechanistic pathways. To fully answer the question, more research focusing on the effects of different support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于各种载体材料（SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）如何影响氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的具体信息。但是，它确实提到了氧化铬催化剂的一些一般性挑战和性能问题：

1. 虽然负载在载体上的氧化铬被认为是在CO2存在下进行乙烷脱氢的最有效催化剂，但它们存在几个缺点。

2. 在需要高乙烷转化率（>70%）的高温条件下（>700°C），基于铬的催化剂会过度转化乙烷为不需要的副产品，如甲烷和CO2，降低了乙烯的选择性。

3. 使用氧化铬基催化剂时，CO2的转化率很低（<20%）。

4. 这些催化剂不稳定、昂贵，且寿命短，仅使用几小时后就会失活。

5. 主要挑战是开发高效、稳定和廉价的催化剂，能够实现高乙烷转化率（>70%）、高CO2转化率（>50%）和高乙烯选择性（>80%）。

文献没有提供CO2分压如何影响催化剂性能的信息，也没有讨论具体的机理途径。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于不同载体材料和反应条件对氧化铬催化剂影响的研究。
