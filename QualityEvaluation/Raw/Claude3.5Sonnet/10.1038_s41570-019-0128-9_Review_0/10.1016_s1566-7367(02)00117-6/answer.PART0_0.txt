[1] "The list of various Cr (Cr2O3  5 wt%)/zeolite (or SiO2) and Ga or V (Ga2O3; V2O5  5 wt%)/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Table 1, and the activities of catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide oxidant are compiled in Fig. 1."

[2] "The most active catalyst tested was Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3  1900 (No. 1). The rate of formation of ethylene with this catalyst was 0:191 mmol g-catalyst1 min1."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Comparison of the dehydrogenation results for CO2 co-feed gas vs. Ar co-feed gas reveals two significant promoting effects of CO2. In the presence of CO2, the yield of ethylene was higher than that under Ar flow, and deactivation, which occurred with the Cr=SiO2 catalyst [1,2], was not observed."

[5] "We believe that CO2, a weak oxidant, removes the coke on the surface by the Boudart reaction: C  CO2  2CO."

[6] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

The literature provides insights into how various support materials and reaction conditions influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: The study compared various zeolite supports and SiO2. Among these, H-ZSM-5 with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (1900) showed the highest activity for ethane dehydrogenation. The activity decreased with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios in H-ZSM-5. Other zeolites like H-beta, USY, H-mordenite, and H-Y were less active than H-ZSM-5.

2. Reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 as a co-feed gas significantly improved catalyst performance compared to using Ar. CO2 increased ethylene yield and prevented catalyst deactivation.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The high activity of Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is attributed to the presence of high oxidation state Cr species, likely Cr(VI), as indicated by TPR profiles. CO2 plays a role in removing coke from the catalyst surface through the Boudart reaction.

4. Stability: CO2 co-feed improved catalyst stability by preventing deactivation, which was observed when using Ar as a co-feed gas.

5. Selectivity: The study mentions high selectivity to ethylene (over 90%) at the highest formation rate, but doesn't provide detailed comparisons across different supports.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Optimizing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in zeolite supports to balance activity and stability
- Maintaining high oxidation state Cr species on the catalyst surface
- Balancing CO2 partial pressure to promote dehydrogenation and prevent excessive oxidation

The study doesn't provide detailed information on other supports like MCM-41, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the specific effects of varying CO2 partial pressure, which remain areas for further investigation.

该文献提供了关于各种支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂性能的见解：

1. 支撑材料：研究比较了各种沸石支撑和SiO2。其中，具有高SiO2/Al2O3比（1900）的H-ZSM-5显示出最高的乙烷脱氢活性。H-ZSM-5中SiO2/Al2O3比较低时，活性降低。其他沸石如H-beta、USY、H-mordenite和H-Y的活性低于H-ZSM-5。

2. 反应条件：与使用Ar相比，使用CO2作为共进料气体显著改善了催化剂性能。CO2增加了乙烯产率并防止催化剂失活。

3. 机理途径：Cr/H-ZSM-5催化剂的高活性归因于高氧化态Cr物种的存在，可能是Cr(VI)，这从TPR谱图中得到了证实。CO2通过Boudart反应在去除催化剂表面积碳方面发挥作用。

4. 稳定性：CO2共进料通过防止失活改善了催化剂稳定性，而使用Ar作为共进料气体时观察到了失活现象。

5. 选择性：研究提到在最高生成速率下乙烯选择性很高（超过90%），但没有提供不同支撑材料之间的详细比较。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 优化沸石支撑中的SiO2/Al2O3比以平衡活性和稳定性
- 在催化剂表面维持高氧化态Cr物种
- 平衡CO2分压以促进脱氢并防止过度氧化

该研究没有提供关于其他支撑材料如MCM-41、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2的详细信息，或改变CO2分压的具体影响，这些仍然是需要进一步研究的领域。
