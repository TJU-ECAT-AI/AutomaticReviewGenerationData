[1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "Comparison of the dehydrogenation results for CO2 co-feed gas vs. Ar co-feed gas reveals two significant promoting effects of CO2. In the presence of CO2, the yield of ethylene was higher than that under Ar flow, and deactivation, which occurred with the Cr=SiO2 catalyst [1,2], was not observed."

[6] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

The support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: H-ZSM-5 supports, especially those with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, show the highest activity and selectivity. The Cr/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3=190) catalyst achieved a maximum ethylene formation rate of 0.516 mmol g-catalyst^-1 min^-1 with over 90% selectivity at 923 K.

2. Stability: CO2 as a co-feed gas enhances catalyst stability by removing coke from the catalyst surface, preventing deactivation observed with other co-feed gases like Ar.

3. Support structure effects: The crystal structure of zeolite supports greatly affects catalytic activity. Among supports with similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the activity order was Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta.

4. Mechanistic pathways: TPR profiles suggest that high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI), play a key role in the catalytic mechanism. These species are more prevalent in highly active catalysts like Cr/H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios.

5. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 partial pressure improves ethylene yield and prevents catalyst deactivation compared to inert gases like Ar.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing high activity with selectivity, as increasing Cr content increases conversion but decreases selectivity.
2. Optimizing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the support to maximize the formation of active Cr species.
3. Maintaining catalyst stability while achieving high conversion rates.
4. Understanding and controlling the formation of high oxidation state Cr species on different supports.

支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 活性和选择性：H-ZSM-5支持材料，尤其是具有高SiO2/Al2O3比的材料，表现出最高的活性和选择性。Cr/H-ZSM-5（SiO2/Al2O3=190）催化剂在923 K下实现了最大乙烯生成速率0.516 mmol g-催化剂^-1 min^-1，选择性超过90%。

2. 稳定性：CO2作为共进料气体通过去除催化剂表面的积碳来增强催化剂稳定性，防止了使用其他共进料气体（如Ar）时观察到的失活。

3. 支持结构效应：沸石支持的晶体结构极大地影响催化活性。在SiO2/Al2O3比相似的支持材料中，活性顺序为Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta。

4. 机理途径：TPR谱图表明，高氧化态Cr物种（如Cr(VI)）在催化机理中起关键作用。这些物种在高活性催化剂（如具有高SiO2/Al2O3比的Cr/H-ZSM-5）中更为普遍。

5. CO2分压：增加CO2分压与惰性气体（如Ar）相比可提高乙烯产率并防止催化剂失活。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡高活性和选择性，因为增加Cr含量会提高转化率但降低选择性。
2. 优化支持材料的SiO2/Al2O3比以最大化活性Cr物种的形成。
3. 在实现高转化率的同时保持催化剂稳定性。
4. 理解和控制不同支持材料上高氧化态Cr物种的形成。
