[1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "TPR profiles of the active (Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900)) and less active (Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8)) catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

[6] "CO2 co-feed gas accelerated dehydrogenation and maintained the catalytic activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the catalyst surface."

The support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (1900 and 190) showed the highest activity and selectivity. The order of activity for different zeolite structures was Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and catalyst activity.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Higher CO2 partial pressure improved catalyst performance by accelerating dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity through coke removal.

3. Temperature: The optimal reaction temperature was around 923 K, where the maximum ethylene formation rate and high selectivity were achieved.

4. Cr content: Increasing Cr content improved ethane conversion but decreased selectivity.

5. W/F ratio: Lower W/F ratios resulted in higher formation rates and selectivities but lower yields.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Higher Cr content increases conversion but decreases selectivity.

2. Optimizing support properties: Finding the ideal SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and zeolite structure to maximize performance.

3. Coke formation: Managing coke deposition to maintain long-term stability.

4. Understanding active species: Identifying and controlling the formation of high oxidation state Cr species, which appear to be crucial for high activity.

5. Reaction conditions: Optimizing temperature, CO2 partial pressure, and W/F ratio to achieve the best overall performance.

支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 支持材料：具有高SiO2/Al2O3比（1900和190）的H-ZSM-5显示出最高的活性和选择性。不同沸石结构的活性顺序为Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta。SiO2/Al2O3比影响Cr活性物种的性质和催化剂活性。

2. CO2分压：更高的CO2分压通过加速脱氢和通过去除积碳来维持催化活性，从而提高催化剂性能。

3. 温度：最佳反应温度约为923 K，在此温度下实现了最大的乙烯生成速率和高选择性。

4. Cr含量：增加Cr含量提高了乙烷转化率，但降低了选择性。

5. W/F比：较低的W/F比导致更高的生成速率和选择性，但产率较低。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：更高的Cr含量增加转化率但降低选择性。

2. 优化支持材料性质：找到理想的SiO2/Al2O3比和沸石结构以最大化性能。

3. 积碳形成：管理积碳沉积以维持长期稳定性。

4. 理解活性物种：识别和控制高氧化态Cr物种的形成，这些物种似乎对高活性至关重要。

5. 反应条件：优化温度、CO2分压和W/F比，以实现最佳整体性能。
