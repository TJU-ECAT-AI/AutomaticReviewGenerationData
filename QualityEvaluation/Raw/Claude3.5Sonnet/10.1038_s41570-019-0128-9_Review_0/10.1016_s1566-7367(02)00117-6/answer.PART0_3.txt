[1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

[6] "The H2 consumption peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to the higher dehydrogenation activity."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 

H-ZSM-5 supports with higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (1900 and 190) showed the highest activity and yield of ethylene. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and consequently the catalyst's activity.

Different zeolite structures also impact catalytic activity. Among supports with similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the order of activity was Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta.

The presence of high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI), appears to be key for higher dehydrogenation activity. This was evidenced by TPR profiles showing pronounced H2 consumption peaks for more active catalysts in the 623-823 K range.

CO2 plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst activity by removing coke from the catalyst surface. It also accelerates dehydrogenation, likely by quickly removing surface species formed during the reaction.

The main challenges in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to achieve optimal Cr species distribution and activity.
2. Selecting the most suitable zeolite structure to enhance catalytic performance.
3. Maintaining the high oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction.
4. Optimizing CO2 partial pressure to effectively remove coke and promote dehydrogenation without excessive oxidation.

Trade-offs exist between activity, selectivity, and stability. Higher Cr content increased ethane conversion but decreased selectivity. Optimizing reaction conditions, particularly the W/F ratio, can help balance yield, selectivity, and ethylene formation rate.

支持材料显著影响了二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

具有较高SiO2/Al2O3比率（1900和190）的H-ZSM-5支持材料表现出最高的活性和乙烯产率。SiO2/Al2O3比率影响了Cr活性物种的性质，从而影响催化剂的活性。

不同的沸石结构也影响催化活性。在SiO2/Al2O3比率相似的支持材料中，活性顺序为Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta。

高氧化态Cr物种（如Cr(VI)）的存在似乎是获得更高脱氢活性的关键。这一点从更活跃的催化剂在623-823 K范围内显示明显的H2消耗峰的TPR曲线中得到了证实。

CO2在维持催化剂活性方面起着关键作用，它可以从催化剂表面去除积碳。它还加速了脱氢反应，可能是通过快速去除反应过程中形成的表面物种。

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡SiO2/Al2O3比率，以实现最佳的Cr物种分布和活性。
2. 选择最合适的沸石结构以提高催化性能。
3. 在反应过程中维持Cr物种的高氧化态。
4. 优化CO2分压，以有效去除积碳并促进脱氢，同时避免过度氧化。

活性、选择性和稳定性之间存在权衡。较高的Cr含量增加了乙烷转化率，但降低了选择性。优化反应条件，特别是W/F比，可以帮助平衡产率、选择性和乙烯形成速率。
