          [1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

[6] "The H2 consumption peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to the higher dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "CO2 co-feed gas accelerated dehydrogenation and maintained the catalytic activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the catalyst surface."

          The support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (1900 and 190) showed the highest activity and selectivity. The order of activity for different zeolite structures was Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and catalyst activity.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Higher CO2 partial pressure improved catalyst performance by accelerating dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity through coke removal.

3. Temperature: The optimal reaction temperature was around 923 K, where the maximum ethylene formation rate and high selectivity were achieved.

4. Cr oxidation state: High oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI), appear to be key for higher dehydrogenation activity.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to achieve optimal Cr species distribution and activity.
2. Selecting the most suitable zeolite structure to enhance catalytic performance.
3. Maintaining the high oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction.
4. Optimizing CO2 partial pressure to effectively remove coke and promote dehydrogenation without excessive oxidation.
5. Balancing activity, selectivity, and stability through careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition.

          支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 支持材料：具有高SiO2/Al2O3比（1900和190）的H-ZSM-5显示出最高的活性和选择性。不同沸石结构的活性顺序为Cr/H-mordenite > Cr/H-ZSM-5 > Cr/H-beta。SiO2/Al2O3比影响Cr活性物种的性质和催化剂活性。

2. CO2分压：更高的CO2分压通过加速脱氢和去除积碳来维持催化活性，从而提高催化剂性能。

3. 温度：最佳反应温度约为923 K，在此温度下实现了最大的乙烯生成速率和高选择性。

4. Cr氧化态：高氧化态Cr物种，如Cr(VI)，似乎是获得更高脱氢活性的关键。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡SiO2/Al2O3比率，以实现最佳的Cr物种分布和活性。
2. 选择最合适的沸石结构以提高催化性能。
3. 在反应过程中维持Cr物种的高氧化态。
4. 优化CO2分压，以有效去除积碳并促进脱氢，同时避免过度氧化。
5. 通过仔细控制反应条件和催化剂组成，平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
