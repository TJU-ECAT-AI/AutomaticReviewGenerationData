[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "In order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]."

[3] "The addition of ZrO2 can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the catalysts [23]."

[4] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts show high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene, while Cr2O3/TiO2 catalysts demonstrate low activity but high ethylene selectivity. This indicates a trade-off between activity and selectivity depending on the support material.

Using TiO2-ZrO2 as a combined support can help improve both ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts display superior ODH activity compared to the individual component oxides, due to enhanced acid-base bifunctional behavior.

ZrO2 addition to TiO2 supports prevents phase transformations at high temperatures, promoting catalyst thermal stability.

The study used reaction conditions of 10% ethane, 50% CO2, and 40% N2 at temperatures of 550-700°C. However, the paper does not provide detailed information on how CO2 partial pressure impacts the reaction.

Key challenges appear to be balancing activity, selectivity and stability. The combined TiO2-ZrO2 support shows promise in optimizing overall performance by leveraging the benefits of both materials. However, more research would be needed to fully understand the mechanistic pathways and effects of reaction conditions like CO2 pressure across different support materials.

该文献对不同支撑材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的性能提供了一些见解：

Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂显示出高转化率但低乙烯选择性,而Cr2O3/TiO2催化剂表现出低活性但高乙烯选择性。这表明根据支撑材料的不同,活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

使用TiO2-ZrO2作为组合支撑可以帮助提高乙烯选择性和催化活性。混合氧化物纳米复合催化剂由于酸碱双功能行为的增强,显示出比单一组分氧化物更优越的ODH活性。

向TiO2支撑添加ZrO2可防止高温下的相变,提高催化剂的热稳定性。

该研究使用的反应条件为10%乙烷、50%CO2和40%N2,温度为550-700°C。然而,该论文没有提供CO2分压如何影响反应的详细信息。

主要挑战似乎是平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。TiO2-ZrO2组合支撑通过利用两种材料的优势,显示出优化整体性能的前景。然而,还需要更多研究才能充分理解不同支撑材料在各种反应条件(如CO2压力)下的机理途径和影响。
