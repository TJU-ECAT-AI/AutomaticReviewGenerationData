[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "In order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]."

[3] "The addition of ZrO2 can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the catalysts [23]."

[4] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity. This indicates a trade-off between conversion and selectivity depending on the support used.

To improve both ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, TiO2-ZrO2 combined supports were explored. These mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts displayed superior ODH activity compared to the individual component oxides, due to enhanced acid-base bifunctional behavior.

Adding ZrO2 to TiO2 prevented phase transformations at high temperatures, improving the thermal stability of the catalysts.

The study used 50 vol.% CO2 in the reactant stream and temperatures between 550-700°C, indicating these were favorable conditions for the reaction.

Key challenges appear to be balancing conversion and selectivity, as well as maintaining catalyst stability at high temperatures. The combined TiO2-ZrO2 support seems promising for optimizing overall performance by leveraging the benefits of both materials.

However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on other supports like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, or CeO2. More research would be needed to fully compare across this wider range of support materials and reaction conditions.

该文献提供了一些关于不同支撑材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解:

Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出高转化率但低乙烯选择性,而Cr2O3/TiO2表现出最低活性但最高乙烯选择性。这表明根据所使用的支撑材料,转化率和选择性之间存在权衡。

为了同时提高乙烯选择性和催化活性,研究了TiO2-ZrO2复合支撑材料。这些混合氧化物纳米复合催化剂由于酸碱双功能行为的增强,表现出比单一组分氧化物更优越的ODH活性。

向TiO2中添加ZrO2可以防止高温下的相变,从而提高催化剂的热稳定性。

研究使用了50体积%的CO2作为反应物流,温度在550-700°C之间,表明这些是有利于反应的条件。

主要挑战似乎是平衡转化率和选择性,以及在高温下保持催化剂的稳定性。TiO2-ZrO2复合支撑材料似乎很有前途,可以利用两种材料的优点来优化整体性能。

然而,该文献并未提供关于其他支撑材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3或CeO2的全面信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面比较这一更广泛的支撑材料范围和反应条件。
