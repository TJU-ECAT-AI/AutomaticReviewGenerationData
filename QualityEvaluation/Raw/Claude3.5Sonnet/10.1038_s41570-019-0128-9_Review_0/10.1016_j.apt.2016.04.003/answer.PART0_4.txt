[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time [16,17]."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, though it does not cover all the support materials mentioned in the question.

Different supports affect catalytic activity and selectivity. Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/TiO2 had low activity but high ethylene selectivity. This suggests a trade-off between activity and selectivity depending on the support used.

The study used 5 wt% Cr2O3 loading on the supports, which may influence catalyst performance. Reaction conditions included 50 vol% CO2 partial pressure and temperatures of 550-700°C. These conditions likely affect activity and selectivity, though specific effects are not detailed.

CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, helping to achieve high equilibrium conversion, enhance ethylene selectivity, and maintain longer catalyst lifetime. This indicates CO2 partial pressure is an important parameter affecting catalyst performance and stability.

Key challenges appear to be balancing activity and selectivity, as well as optimizing CO2 concentration to enhance performance while avoiding catalyst deactivation. The literature does not provide comprehensive information on mechanistic pathways or detailed comparisons across all mentioned support materials.

More research would be needed to fully optimize chromium oxide catalyst performance by tuning support composition and reaction conditions for this reaction.

该文献为二氧化碳氧化脱氢乙烷反应中铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料和反应条件的影响提供了一些见解,但并未涵盖问题中提到的所有载体材料。

不同的载体会影响催化活性和选择性。Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出高转化率但低乙烯选择性,而Cr2O3/TiO2活性低但乙烯选择性高。这表明根据所用载体的不同,活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

研究使用了5wt%的Cr2O3负载量,这可能会影响催化剂性能。反应条件包括50vol%的CO2分压和550-700°C的温度。这些条件可能会影响活性和选择性,但具体影响未详细说明。

CO2作为一种软氧化剂,有助于达到高平衡转化率,提高乙烯选择性,并维持更长的催化剂寿命。这表明CO2分压是影响催化剂性能和稳定性的重要参数。

主要挑战似乎是平衡活性和选择性,以及优化CO2浓度以提高性能同时避免催化剂失活。文献没有提供关于反应机理途径的全面信息,也没有对所有提到的载体材料进行详细比较。

需要进行更多研究,通过调整载体组成和反应条件来充分优化铬氧化物催化剂在该反应中的性能。
