[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "It has been indicated that CO2 increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)"

The literature provides some insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Different supports affect catalytic activity and selectivity. Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/TiO2 had low activity but high ethylene selectivity. This demonstrates a trade-off between activity and selectivity depending on the support material.

The study used 5 wt% Cr2O3 loading on the supports, which affects the dispersion and activity of the active phase. 

Reaction conditions included 50 vol% CO2 partial pressure and temperatures of 550-700°C. Higher CO2 partial pressure can enhance ethylene yield through redox cycling of the catalyst and coupling with reverse water-gas shift.

Key mechanistic pathways involve redox cycling where the catalyst is reduced by ethane and re-oxidized by CO2, as well as coupling between ethane dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift.

Major challenges appear to be balancing activity and selectivity, and optimizing CO2 partial pressure and temperature to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing side reactions. The ideal catalyst and conditions would provide high ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability simultaneously.

文献为二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料和反应条件如何影响其性能提供了一些见解:

不同的载体影响催化活性和选择性。Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出高转化率但低乙烯选择性,而Cr2O3/TiO2活性低但乙烯选择性高。这表明根据载体材料的不同,活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

研究使用了5 wt%的Cr2O3负载量,这影响活性相的分散和活性。

反应条件包括50 vol%的CO2分压和550-700°C的温度。更高的CO2分压可以通过催化剂的氧化还原循环和与逆水气变换反应的耦合来提高乙烯产率。

关键的机理途径包括催化剂被乙烷还原和被CO2再氧化的氧化还原循环,以及乙烷脱氢与逆水气变换反应的耦合。

主要挑战似乎是平衡活性和选择性,并优化CO2分压和温度以最大化乙烯产率同时最小化副反应。理想的催化剂和条件应同时提供高乙烷转化率、乙烯选择性和稳定性。
