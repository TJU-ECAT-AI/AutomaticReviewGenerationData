[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts due to the dominance of ZrO2 tetragonal phase will exhibit higher catalytic activity and stability in this process than that on monoclinic phase of zirconia."

The literature provides some insights into how support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, but it does not cover all the supports mentioned in the question. 

The study found that different supports significantly affect catalytic activity and selectivity. Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/TiO2 had the lowest activity but highest ethylene selectivity. This highlights a key trade-off between activity and selectivity depending on the support used.

The researchers used a combined TiO2-ZrO2 support to try to optimize both activity and selectivity. They found that Cr/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts with a tetragonal ZrO2 phase exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability compared to those with monoclinic ZrO2.

Regarding reaction conditions, the study used 50 vol% CO2 in the reactant stream at temperatures between 550-700°C. However, the paper does not extensively discuss how varying CO2 partial pressure affects the reaction.

The key challenges appear to be optimizing the support composition to balance activity and selectivity, and maintaining catalyst stability at high temperatures. The mechanistic pathways are not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts.

Overall, while this study provides some useful insights, it is limited in scope and does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding other support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, and CeO2.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解，但它并未涵盖问题中提到的所有支撑材料。

研究发现，不同的支撑材料显著影响催化活性和选择性。Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出高转化率但低乙烯选择性，而Cr2O3/TiO2活性最低但乙烯选择性最高。这突出了根据所使用的支撑材料在活性和选择性之间的关键权衡。

研究人员使用了TiO2-ZrO2复合支撑材料，试图同时优化活性和选择性。他们发现，具有四方相ZrO2的Cr/TiO2-ZrO2催化剂比具有单斜相ZrO2的催化剂表现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

关于反应条件，该研究在反应物流中使用了50体积%的CO2，温度在550-700°C之间。然而，该论文并未详细讨论改变CO2分压如何影响反应。

主要挑战似乎是优化支撑材料组成以平衡活性和选择性，并在高温下保持催化剂稳定性。给出的摘录中并未明确讨论机理途径。

总的来说，虽然这项研究提供了一些有用的见解，但其范围有限，并未全面解决问题的所有方面，特别是关于其他支撑材料如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3和CeO2的部分。
