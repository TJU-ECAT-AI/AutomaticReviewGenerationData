TiO2ZrO2 supports with different compositions ranging from 0 to 100 wt.% of ZrO2 were prepared by co-
precipitation method and impregnated with 5 wt.% of Cr2O3. The synthesized catalysts were character-
ized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and FTIR techniques. Characterization studies revealed that the
combination of different amounts of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the supports had obvious effect on the crystal struc-
ture, texture characteristic, and catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
by carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of crystalline TiO2 and/or
ZrO2 in the synthesized samples. The FESEM and EDX images represented the production of homoge-
neous spherical type agglomerates within the nanometer range and uniform dispersion over the surface
of all samples specially CrT75Z25 with an average particle size of about 38 nm. The BET results depicted
high surface area of Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts. The highest catalytic activity and yield (C2H4 yield of 46%
as well as 95% ethylene selectivity at 700 C) were acquired when 75 wt.% TiO2 and 25 wt.% ZrO2 were
used as the support. It could be attributed to the smaller particles, higher surface area, better dispersion
of active phase, and uniform morphology of CrT75Z25.

1. Introduction
The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane into ethy-
lene has attracted considerable attention, because ethylene is one
of the most important building blocks for many chemical and
petrochemical industries [1,2]. Ethylene is a raw material for the
production of low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density PE,
ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, linear LDPE, ethylbenzene,
and so on [35]. Thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is currently
the major source of ethylene [68]. Due to the rapidly growing
demand for ethylene and the shortage of petroleum resource in
the future, much effort has been devoted to new routes of ethylene
production from alternative resources, such as dehydrogenation of
ethane and natural gas-based processes [911].
The inherent obstacles of the ethane dehydrogenation process
are equilibrium limitations regarding ethane conversion, large
energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid cata-
lyst deactivation owing to coke formation [3,12]. Alternatively,
the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane by oxygen is free
from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower
temperatures with an exothermic reaction. However, this process
suffers from a significant loss of ethylene selectivity due to the
over-oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide in the reaction. Han-
dling the potentially explosive oxygen-containing mixture is also
difficult. Therefore, it is expected that these disadvantages will
be avoided to some extent via replacing oxygen by soft oxidants,
such as N2O and CO2 [1215].
CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation
of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium
conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining
longer catalyst life time [16,17]. It has been indicated that CO2
increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which
the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by
CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogena-
tion of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)

[18,19]. Also, CO2 removes hydrogen produced from ethane dehy-
drogenation, and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards
the ethylene formation. On the other hand, the use of CO2 in the
feed of this new process is ecological, because CO2 as one of the
major greenhouse gases is reduced to CO which is more valuable
in chemical industry [6,17,20]. However, due to using the CO2 as
an oxidant in the ODH reactions, more carbonaceous deposits are
formed and resulted in the fast deactivation of catalysts [21].
Therefore, there is a need to design better catalyst systems, which
can overcome the deactivation.
Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium
oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promis-
ing ones due to their high catalytic activity [3,6,16,17]. Also, the
acid-base and textural properties of the supports strongly affect
the catalytic performance. Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of
ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts
and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic
activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high con-
version but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demon-
strated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity. In
order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is
interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed
oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activ-
ity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement
in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]. The addition of ZrO2
can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at
high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the
catalysts [23]. TiO2ZrO2 mixed oxides are proved to be highly
active and selective catalysts for several reactions such as isomer-
ization of cyclohexane oxides, hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to
alcohols, dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether, oxidative and
non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and cyclohexane
[22,2426]. However, TiO2ZrO2 combined support was not been
investigated for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene by
CO2 as a soft oxidant. Therefore, a combined catalysts consisting
of 5 wt.% Cr2O3 and TiO2ZrO2 with various loadings of zirconia
were undertaken in the present investigation against the aforesaid
background.
Based on the above stated arguments, we have undertaken
TiO2ZrO2 supported Cr2O3 materials for the ODH of ethane by
CO2. The desired TiO2, ZrO2 and TiO2ZrO2 supports were synthe-
sized by precipitation and co-precipitation methods, respectively.
Cr2O3 was deposited over the supports by a wet impregnation
method. The structural evaluation of the catalysts was thoroughly
studied using various physiochemical techniques namely, XRD,
FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET, and FTIR. The catalytic performance was
evaluated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
under atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as a soft oxidant.

respectively. Also, ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, Mojal-
lali, Iran, 25%) was supplied as a precipitating agent. All of the

Fig. 1 illustrates schematically the methodology used for the
preparation of TiO2ZrO2 supports with various loadings of zirco-
nia via co-precipitation method. TiO2ZrO2 combined supports
were named as T(100  x)Zx, where x represents the nominal
weight percentage of ZrO2 (x: 0, 25, 50, 75,100 wt.%). In a typical
synthetic procedure, required amounts of zirconyl (IV) nitrate
hydrate and titanium (IV) chloride were dissolved separately in
deionized water and mixed together to ensure the formation of
homogeneous solution. To this mixture solution, dilute aqueous
ammonia was added drop wise under vigorous stirring until the
precipitation was completed. Then, the stirring was continued fur-
ther. The resultant precipitates were transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and aged hydrothermally before filtration.
The well-formed white precipitates were filtered and washed with
deionized water several times until the complete removal of chlo-
ride ions. The obtained cake was dried at 110 C for 12 h and finally
calcined at 600 C for 5 h under air flow. The pure ZrO2 and TiO2
supports were also synthesized in the same manner mentioned
above.
On the calcined supports, Cr2O3 was deposited by adopting a
standard wet impregnation method as indicated in Fig. 2. To
achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corre-
sponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in
deionized water and then the powdered supports were added
under continuous stirring at the same temperature. After the
impregnation, all these samples were dried and calcined as before.
2.2. Nanocatalysts characterization
XRD analysis was performed on Siemens diffractometer D5000
with a Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.54178 Ã) source operating at 40 kV
and 30 mA in a scanning range of 2h = 1090. The diffraction
peaks of the crystalline phase were compared with those of stan-
dard compounds reported in the Joint Committee of Powder
Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database files. The morphology and
surface particle size distribution of Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts
were studied by FESEM (HITACHI S-109 4160). EDX analysis was
carried out by VEGA n nTESCAN, BSE DETECTOR for elemental anal-
ysis. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined by
BET method on Quantachorom CHEMBET-3000 apparatus. FTIR of
the powders was recorded on UNICAM 4600 Fourier spectrometer
in a range of 4004000 cm1 by KBr pellet method in order to iden-
tify surface functional groups.
2.3. Nanocatalysts activity
Fig. 3 shows the experimental set up for the oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide. The catalytic
experiments were conducted in a quartz tube reactor (6 mm i.d.)
under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst loading for the reactor
was 500 mg. The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane,
50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced
into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction

temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C. Blank tests were
conducted under the same conditions, by replacing the catalyst
with quartz sand particles of the same size. The products and
remained reactants were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph
(GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) equipped with a flame ioniza-
tion detector (FID) using a CarboxenTM 1000 column. Gas stream
from the regulators passed through pipes and it was introduced
to the mass flow controllers (MFC). Argon was used as the carrier
gas for gas chromatography. The ethane conversion XC2H6, ethy-

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Nanocatalysts characterization
Fig. 4 depicts the XRD patterns and Table 1 reports the crys-
talline phases of synthesized TiO2ZrO2 support and Cr/TiO2
ZrO2 nanocatalysts with various loadings of ZrO2. According to
the JCPDS files, TiO2 (00-001-0562) and ZrO2 (01-080-0784) peaks
can be detected in the XRD patterns. As can be seen, CrT0Z100
shows both the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of ZrO2. The
addition of TiO2 to ZrO2 in order to producing TiO2ZrO2 combined
supports prevents the phase transformation from tetragonal to
monoclinic phase, so the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is detected very
weak for other patterns (T75Z25, CrT25Z75, CrT50Z50, CrT75Z25)
and the characteristic peaks of tetragonal zirconia are observed
as reported previously in other studies [3,27,28]. According to
other research [23], Cr/TiO2ZrO2 nanocatalysts due to the domi-
nance of ZrO2 tetragonal phase will exhibit higher catalytic activity
and stability in this process than that on monoclinic phase of zirco-
nia. As the percentage of ZrO2 content increases, most of the peaks
match with monoclinic and tetragonal structure of ZrO2 and as the
percentage of ZrO2 content decreases, most of the peaks match
with anatase phase of TiO2. By decreasing the ZrO2 content, the
intensity of TiO2 peaks increases indicating that the introduction
of titania into the zirconia lattice has been occurred which changes
the structure of zirconia. The rhombohedral crystalline phase of
Cr2O3 are seen just by the very weak diffraction peaks at
2h = 24.5, 33.6, 36.2 (00-006-0504) in all the synthesized
nanocatalysts, probably due to high dispersion or small crystallites
of chromia over the supports. This hypothesis is going to be sup-
ported by BET and EDX analysis. It is observed that some of the
TiO2, ZrO2 and Cr2O3 peaks have overlap. For example, the peak
of Cr2O3 at 2h = 24.5 is severely covered by the peaks of TiO2 at
2h = 25.3 and ZrO2 at 2h = 24.1.
