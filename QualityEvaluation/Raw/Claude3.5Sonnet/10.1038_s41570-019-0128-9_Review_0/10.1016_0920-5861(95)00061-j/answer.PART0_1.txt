[1] "The supported manganese oxide catalysts are the most active, selective and stable."

[2] "On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. C2H4 selectivity was 61.0% and C2H4 yield = 44.5%. A similar catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed a much lesser selectivity."

[3] "The most active and selective catalyst for C2H4 production was found to be 5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2. Further increase of selectivity was observed upon additional modification by alkali metal oxides. The 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst shows at 830C C2H6 conversion 82.6%, CO2 conversion 55.7% and C2H4 selectivity 76.8%."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights on manganese oxide catalysts supported on different materials:

1. SiO2 support: The 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst showed good performance for ethane conversion, with high activity and selectivity.

2. Al2O3 support: A similar manganese oxide catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed much lower selectivity compared to the SiO2-supported catalyst.

3. Mixed oxide catalysts: The most active and selective catalyst for ethylene production was found to be 5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2, which combines chromium and manganese oxides on a silica support.

4. Alkali metal modification: Further improvement in selectivity was observed by adding alkali metal oxides to the Cr-Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst.

The literature does not directly address the influence of CO2 partial pressure or other reaction conditions on these catalysts. Additionally, it does not discuss the performance of chromium oxide catalysts on other supports like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing catalyst performance are not explicitly discussed in the given text. However, it can be inferred that balancing activity, selectivity, and stability is crucial, as is the choice of support material and the addition of promoters like alkali metals.

To fully answer the question, more research would be needed on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts on various supports and under different reaction conditions.

文献没有全面比较各种载体材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的影响。但是，它确实提供了一些关于负载在不同材料上的氧化锰催化剂的见解：

1. SiO2载体：17%MnO/SiO2催化剂在乙烷转化方面表现出良好的性能，具有高活性和选择性。

2. Al2O3载体：与SiO2负载的催化剂相比，类似的负载在Al2O3上的氧化锰催化剂显示出较低的选择性。

3. 混合氧化物催化剂：发现最活跃和选择性最高的乙烯生产催化剂是5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2，它将铬和锰氧化物结合在二氧化硅载体上。

4. 碱金属改性：通过向Cr-Mn-O/SiO2催化剂添加碱金属氧化物，选择性得到进一步提高。

文献没有直接讨论CO2分压或其他反应条件对这些催化剂的影响。此外，它也没有讨论氧化铬催化剂在其他载体（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2）上的性能。

文中没有明确讨论优化催化剂性能的主要挑战和权衡。然而，可以推断平衡活性、选择性和稳定性是至关重要的，载体材料的选择和添加碱金属等助剂也很重要。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对各种载体上的氧化铬催化剂在不同反应条件下的性能进行更多研究。
