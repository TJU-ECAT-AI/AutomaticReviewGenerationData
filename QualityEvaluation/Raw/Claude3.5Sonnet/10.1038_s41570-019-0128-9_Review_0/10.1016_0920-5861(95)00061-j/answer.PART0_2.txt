[1] "The most active and stable catalysts for the reactions (8) and (9) were also manganese oxides based catalysts [7,10]. On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. C2H4 selectivity was 61.0% and C2H4 yield = 44.5%. A similar catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed a much lesser selectivity."

[2] "The 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst shows at 830C C2H6 conversion 82.6%, CO2 conversion 55.7% and C2H4 selectivity 76.8%."

[3] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide is described by the equation (10)
KiPc2h6KoPco2
rc2h4 = KoxPco2 + KreaPco"

[4] "Basic sites of moderate basicity are necessary for CO2 absorption and Cr3+ reoxidation."

The literature provides limited information specifically about chromium oxide catalysts on different supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. Support material influence: The text mentions that MnO supported on SiO2 showed good activity and selectivity for ethane dehydrogenation, while a similar catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed much lower selectivity. This suggests that the support material can significantly impact catalyst performance.

2. Influence of additives: Adding K and Cr to the Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst (1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2) improved its performance, increasing ethane conversion, CO2 conversion, and ethylene selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: The kinetic equation provided shows that the reaction rate depends on the partial pressures of ethane and CO2. This suggests that CO2 partial pressure is an important factor influencing catalyst activity and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The text indicates that moderate basicity of catalyst sites is necessary for CO2 absorption and Cr3+ reoxidation, which are key steps in the reaction mechanism.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity
- Preventing catalyst deactivation
- Optimizing CO2 activation while maintaining hydrocarbon activation
- Tuning catalyst basicity for optimal CO2 absorption without forming stable carbonates

However, the literature does not provide specific information about other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2, nor does it discuss in detail the challenges and trade-offs in optimizing chromium oxide catalysts for these reactions.

虽然文献对于不同载体上的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的表现提供的信息有限，但仍可以得出一些见解：

1. 载体材料的影响：文中提到，SiO2负载的MnO在乙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性，而类似的Al2O3负载催化剂的选择性则低得多。这表明载体材料可以显著影响催化剂的性能。

2. 添加剂的影响：向Mn-O/SiO2催化剂中添加K和Cr（1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2）改善了其性能，提高了乙烷转化率、CO2转化率和乙烯选择性。

3. 反应条件：提供的动力学方程表明，反应速率取决于乙烷和CO2的分压。这说明CO2分压是影响催化剂活性和选择性的重要因素。

4. 机理途径：文中指出，催化剂位点的中等碱性对于CO2吸收和Cr3+再氧化是必要的，这些是反应机理中的关键步骤。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡可能包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性
- 防止催化剂失活
- 在保持碳氢化合物活化的同时优化CO2活化
- 调节催化剂碱性以实现最佳CO2吸收，同时避免形成稳定的碳酸盐

然而，文献并未提供关于其他载体材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2）的具体信息，也没有详细讨论优化这些反应中铬氧化物催化剂的挑战和权衡。
