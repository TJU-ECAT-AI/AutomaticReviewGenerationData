[1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005)."

[4] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas"

[5] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[6] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how specific support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Support material affects the reaction mechanism. Redox oxide supports like Cr2O3 tend to follow a one-step mechanism, while non-redox oxide supports like Ga2O3 follow a two-step mechanism.

2. Acidic supports are undesirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxide supports are preferred due to the acidic nature of CO2.

3. Catalyst stability is a major challenge, with rapid deactivation due to coke formation being a common issue.

4. Reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, can influence undesired side reactions like dry reforming of propane.

5. The overall performance involves trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability. Optimizing these aspects simultaneously remains a key challenge.

6. Different active species (Cr, Ga, V, Fe) have been studied on various supports, suggesting that the choice of both active component and support material is crucial for catalyst performance.

The main challenges appear to be controlling coke formation, minimizing undesired side reactions, and maintaining catalyst stability while achieving high activity and selectivity. Tailoring the support material and optimizing reaction conditions are likely key strategies for addressing these challenges.

文献并未提供关于SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2等特定载体材料如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的详细信息。但是，可以得出一些一般性的见解：

1. 载体材料影响反应机理。像Cr2O3这样的氧化还原载体倾向于遵循单步机理，而像Ga2O3这样的非氧化还原载体则遵循两步机理。

2. 酸性载体是不受欢迎的，因为它们促进裂解和积碳。由于CO2的酸性特征，碱性氧化物载体更受青睐。

3. 催化剂稳定性是一个主要挑战，由于积碳导致的快速失活是一个常见问题。

4. 反应条件，包括CO2分压，可能会影响不良副反应，如丙烷的干重整。

5. 总体性能涉及活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。同时优化这些方面仍然是一个关键挑战。

6. 在各种载体上研究了不同的活性物种（Cr、Ga、V、Fe），这表明活性组分和载体材料的选择对催化剂性能至关重要。

主要挑战似乎是控制积碳、最小化不良副反应，以及在实现高活性和选择性的同时保持催化剂稳定性。调整载体材料和优化反应条件可能是解决这些挑战的关键策略。
