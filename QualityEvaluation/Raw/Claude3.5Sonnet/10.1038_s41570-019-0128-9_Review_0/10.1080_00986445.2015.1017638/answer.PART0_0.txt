[1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two-step pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how different support materials specifically influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Support materials can influence the mechanistic pathway. Redox oxides like Cr2O3 and Cr2O5 tend to follow a one-step mechanism, while non-redox oxides may follow a two-step pathway.

2. Acidic supports are generally undesirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxides are favored due to the acidic nature of CO2.

3. Stability is a key challenge. Chromium-based catalysts can deactivate due to coke formation and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

4. Activity and selectivity depend on the oxide and support combination. Various chromium, gallium, vanadium, and iron oxides have been studied, but their relative performance is not detailed.

5. CO2 partial pressure likely affects the reaction, as CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in the redox cycle for some oxides.

The main challenges appear to be catalyst stability and coke formation. Optimizing performance likely involves balancing the redox properties, acidity/basicity, and coke resistance of the catalyst system. However, the literature does not provide specific details on how to optimize these trade-offs for chromium oxide catalysts on different supports.

该文献并未提供关于不同载体材料如何特别影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的全面信息。但是，可以得出一些一般性见解：

1. 载体材料可以影响反应机理路径。像Cr2O3和Cr2O5这样的氧化还原氧化物倾向于遵循一步机理，而非氧化还原氧化物可能遵循两步路径。

2. 酸性载体通常不受欢迎，因为它们促进裂解和积碳。由于CO2的酸性特征，碱性氧化物更受青睐。

3. 稳定性是一个关键挑战。基于铬的催化剂可能因积碳和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)而失活。

4. 活性和选择性取决于氧化物和载体的组合。已经研究了各种铬、镓、钒和铁的氧化物，但未详细说明它们的相对性能。

5. CO2分压可能影响反应，因为CO2在某些氧化物的氧化还原循环中充当氧化剂。

主要挑战似乎是催化剂稳定性和积碳形成。优化性能可能涉及平衡催化剂系统的氧化还原性质、酸碱性和抗积碳性。然而，该文献并未提供关于如何为不同载体上的氧化铬催化剂优化这些权衡的具体细节。
