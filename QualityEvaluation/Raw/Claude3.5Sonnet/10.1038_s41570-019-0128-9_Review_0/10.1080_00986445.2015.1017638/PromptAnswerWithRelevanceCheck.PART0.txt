[1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two-step pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how different support materials specifically influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Support materials can influence the mechanistic pathway. Redox oxides like Cr2O3 and Cr2O5 tend to follow a one-step mechanism, while non-redox oxides may follow a two-step pathway.

2. Acidic supports are generally undesirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxides are favored due to the acidic nature of CO2.

3. Stability is a key challenge. Chromium-based catalysts can deactivate due to coke formation and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

4. Activity and selectivity depend on the oxide and support combination. Various chromium, gallium, vanadium, and iron oxides have been studied, but their relative performance is not detailed.

5. CO2 partial pressure likely affects the reaction, as CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in the redox cycle for some oxides.

The main challenges appear to be catalyst stability and coke formation. Optimizing performance likely involves balancing the redox properties, acidity/basicity, and coke resistance of the catalyst system. However, the literature does not provide specific details on how to optimize these trade-offs for chromium oxide catalysts on different supports.

该文献并未提供关于不同载体材料如何特别影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的全面信息。但是，可以得出一些一般性见解：

1. 载体材料可以影响反应机理路径。像Cr2O3和Cr2O5这样的氧化还原氧化物倾向于遵循一步机理，而非氧化还原氧化物可能遵循两步路径。

2. 酸性载体通常不受欢迎，因为它们促进裂解和积碳。由于CO2的酸性特征，碱性氧化物更受青睐。

3. 稳定性是一个关键挑战。基于铬的催化剂可能因积碳和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)而失活。

4. 活性和选择性取决于氧化物和载体的组合。已经研究了各种铬、镓、钒和铁的氧化物，但未详细说明它们的相对性能。

5. CO2分压可能影响反应，因为CO2在某些氧化物的氧化还原循环中充当氧化剂。

主要挑战似乎是催化剂稳定性和积碳形成。优化性能可能涉及平衡催化剂系统的氧化还原性质、酸碱性和抗积碳性。然而，该文献并未提供关于如何为不同载体上的氧化铬催化剂优化这些权衡的具体细节。

[1] "Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson, 1989). It provides a basis for experimental and computational studies, as well as, understanding the boundaries and constraints that thermodynamics imposes on process and catalyst development (Mawson et al., 1993)."

[2] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how different support materials specifically influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be inferred:

1. Support material selection is crucial for designing suitable catalysts for CO2-PDH reactions. The choice of support can affect activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways.

2. Chromium oxide is among the active species studied for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It likely follows a one-step mechanism as a redox oxide, where CO2 participates as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle.

3. Acidic supports are not desirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxides are favored due to CO2's acidic nature, but highly basic supports like alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient due to carbonate formation.

4. The ideal support for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-PDH would likely be a metal oxide with moderate basicity that can participate in the redox process with CO2 reduction.

5. Optimizing catalyst performance involves balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. Key challenges include preventing coke formation and controlling undesired side reactions like dry reforming.

6. CO2 partial pressure is an important reaction condition, but its specific effects on chromium oxide catalysts are not detailed in the given literature.

To fully optimize chromium oxide catalyst performance for CO2-PDH, further research is needed to understand the specific interactions between different support materials and chromium oxide, as well as the effects of various reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the specific support materials mentioned in the question (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. Activity and selectivity: Chromium-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

2. Reaction mechanism: Chromium oxide catalysts follow a one-step mechanism, where CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle. This is in contrast to non-redox oxides like Ga2O3, which follow a two-step pathway.

3. Stability: Chromium-based catalysts face deactivation challenges, primarily due to coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

4. Support material considerations: While specific supports are not discussed, the literature suggests that moderately basic metal oxide supports are preferred for CO2-PDH reactions. This is due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, highly basic supports like alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient as they form carbonates in the presence of CO2.

5. CO2 partial pressure: The literature does not directly address the influence of CO2 partial pressure on chromium oxide catalysts. However, it can be inferred that higher CO2 concentrations may promote the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and help in coke removal, but could also potentially lead to carbonate formation on certain supports.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: While chromium oxide catalysts are highly active, they face deactivation issues that need to be addressed.
2. Optimizing support acidity/basicity: Moderately basic supports are preferred, but finding the right balance to prevent carbonate formation and promote the redox process is crucial.
3. Controlling coke formation: Developing strategies to minimize coke formation or enhance coke removal without compromising selectivity is essential.
4. Maintaining the oxidation state of chromium: Preventing the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is important for maintaining catalyst activity.

Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of specific support materials and to optimize reaction conditions for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献中没有提供关于所提及的特定支撑材料（SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）用于二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的全面信息。然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些一般性见解：

1. 活性和选择性：铬基催化剂是丙烷二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂之一。

2. 反应机理：铬氧化物催化剂遵循一步机理，其中二氧化碳在氧化还原循环中充当氧化剂。这与非氧化还原氧化物（如Ga2O3）遵循的两步途径形成对比。

3. 稳定性：铬基催化剂面临失活挑战，主要是由于焦炭形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)。

4. 支撑材料考虑：虽然没有讨论具体的支撑材料，但文献表明，对于CO2-PDH反应，中等碱性的金属氧化物支撑材料是首选。这是由于CO2的酸性特征。然而，高碱性支撑材料如碱金属和碱土金属氧化物效率低下，因为它们在CO2存在下会形成碳酸盐。

5. CO2分压：文献没有直接讨论CO2分压对铬氧化物催化剂的影响。然而，可以推断更高的CO2浓度可能会促进氧化脱氢反应并帮助去除焦炭，但也可能导致某些支撑材料上形成碳酸盐。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然铬氧化物催化剂具有高活性，但它们面临需要解决的失活问题。
2. 优化支撑材料的酸碱性：首选中等碱性支撑材料，但找到正确的平衡以防止碳酸盐形成并促进氧化还原过程至关重要。
3. 控制焦炭形成：开发最小化焦炭形成或增强焦炭去除的策略，同时不影响选择性是至关重要的。
4. 维持铬的氧化态：防止Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)对于维持催化剂活性很重要。

需要进一步研究以充分了解特定支撑材料的影响，并优化铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的反应条件。
