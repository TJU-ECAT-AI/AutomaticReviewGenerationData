[1] "Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The onestep mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The twostep pathway has been proposed for nonredox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the twostep pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Support materials can influence the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts. The choice of support affects the redox properties and mechanistic pathways.

2. Redox oxides like Cr2O3 and Cr2O5 follow a one-step mechanism, where CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle.

3. Non-redox oxides tend to follow a two-step pathway, indicated by the production of H2.

4. Acidic supports are not desirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxides are preferred due to the acidic nature of CO2.

5. Catalyst deactivation is a key challenge, caused by coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

6. The CO2 partial pressure likely influences the reaction kinetics and catalyst stability, but specific details are not provided in the given literature.

7. Optimizing overall performance involves balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. The main trade-off appears to be between high activity and resistance to deactivation.

To fully optimize chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, further research is needed to understand the specific effects of different support materials and reaction conditions on catalyst performance and longevity.

文献中没有提供关于各种支撑材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的具体信息。但是，可以得出一些一般性的见解：

1. 支撑材料可以影响铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。支撑材料的选择会影响氧化还原特性和反应机理途径。

2. 像Cr2O3和Cr2O5这样的氧化还原氧化物遵循一步机制，其中CO2作为氧化剂参与氧化还原循环。

3. 非氧化还原氧化物倾向于遵循两步途径，这由H2的产生来表示。

4. 酸性支撑材料不受欢迎，因为它们促进裂解和焦炭形成。由于CO2的酸性性质，碱性氧化物更受青睐。

5. 催化剂失活是一个关键挑战，由焦炭形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)引起。

6. CO2分压可能影响反应动力学和催化剂稳定性，但给定的文献中没有提供具体细节。

7. 优化整体性能涉及平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。主要的权衡似乎是在高活性和抗失活能力之间。

为了充分优化CO2氧化脱氢的铬氧化物催化剂，需要进一步研究不同支撑材料和反应条件对催化剂性能和寿命的具体影响。
