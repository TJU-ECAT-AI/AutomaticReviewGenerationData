[1] "Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson, 1989). It provides a basis for experimental and computational studies, as well as, understanding the boundaries and constraints that thermodynamics imposes on process and catalyst development (Mawson et al., 1993)."

[2] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[4] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient because they form carbonate species in the presence of carbon dioxide (Rangel et al., 2012). Metal oxides of moderate basicity are required and must participate in the redox process with the reduction of carbon dioxide (Krylov et al., 1995)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how different support materials specifically influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be inferred:

1. Support material selection is crucial for designing suitable catalysts for CO2-PDH reactions. The choice of support can affect activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways.

2. Chromium oxide is among the active species studied for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It likely follows a one-step mechanism as a redox oxide, where CO2 participates as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle.

3. Acidic supports are not desirable as they promote cracking and coke formation. Basic oxides are favored due to CO2's acidic nature, but highly basic supports like alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient due to carbonate formation.

4. The ideal support for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-PDH would likely be a metal oxide with moderate basicity that can participate in the redox process with CO2 reduction.

5. Optimizing catalyst performance involves balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. Key challenges include preventing coke formation and controlling undesired side reactions like dry reforming.

6. CO2 partial pressure is an important reaction condition, but its specific effects on chromium oxide catalysts are not detailed in the given literature.

To fully optimize chromium oxide catalyst performance for CO2-PDH, further research is needed to understand the specific interactions between different support materials and chromium oxide, as well as the effects of various reaction conditions including CO2 partial pressure.

该文献并未提供有关不同载体材料如何特别影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的全面信息。但是，可以推断出一些一般性的见解：

1. 载体材料的选择对于设计适合CO2-PDH反应的催化剂至关重要。载体的选择可以影响活性、选择性、稳定性和反应机理途径。

2. 氧化铬是在二氧化碳存在下研究丙烷脱氢的活性物种之一。作为氧化还原氧化物，它可能遵循一步机制，其中CO2作为氧化剂参与氧化还原循环。

3. 酸性载体不受欢迎，因为它们会促进裂解和积碳。由于CO2的酸性，碱性氧化物受到青睐，但高度碱性的载体（如碱金属和碱土金属氧化物）由于形成碳酸盐而效率低下。

4. CO2-PDH中氧化铬催化剂的理想载体可能是具有中等碱性的金属氧化物，可以参与CO2还原的氧化还原过程。

5. 优化催化剂性能涉及平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。主要挑战包括防止积碳和控制不需要的副反应，如干重整。

6. CO2分压是一个重要的反应条件，但给定的文献中没有详细说明其对氧化铬催化剂的具体影响。

为了充分优化CO2-PDH的氧化铬催化剂性能，需要进一步研究以了解不同载体材料与氧化铬之间的具体相互作用，以及包括CO2分压在内的各种反应条件的影响。
