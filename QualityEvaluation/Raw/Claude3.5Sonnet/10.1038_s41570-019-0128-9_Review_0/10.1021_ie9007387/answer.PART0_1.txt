1. "Various promoters have been used to further improve catalytic performance. In our prior work, (14-16) it has been demonstrated that Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity."

2. "The catalysts, which were prepared by the coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation methods, have the same loadings of Fe and Cr (5 wt % of Fe and 10 wt % of Cr)."

3. "The ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (C) dramatically drops from 50% to 38% over the time on stream. However, the ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) varies little."

4. "The ethylene selectivity over FeCr/ZrO2 (C) is higher than that over FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) while its CO2 conversion is lower."

5. "Cr3+ ions are considered the active species for dehydrogenation, with the argument that only Cr3+ species has been detected by XPS on the used catalysts and there is no obvious deactivation of FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) catalysts in the stability test."

6. "Fe3O4 has an inverse spinal structure, which can readily undergo rapid electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The electron hopping between Fe3+ and Fe2+ can facilitate the proceeding of reaction 3."

The literature primarily focuses on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts rather than a comprehensive comparison of various support materials. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of ZrO2 as a support and the impact of preparation methods and reaction conditions:

1. Support material: ZrO2 is used as the support in this study. The Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts show high catalytic activity, indicating that ZrO2 is an effective support for this reaction.

2. Preparation methods: Two methods (coprecipitation and coprecipitation-impregnation) were compared. The coprecipitation-impregnation method resulted in better stability and higher CO2 conversion, while the coprecipitation method led to higher ethylene selectivity.

3. Active species: Cr3+ ions are identified as the active species for dehydrogenation. Fe3O4 formed during the reaction promotes the reverse water-gas shift reaction through electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+.

4. Stability: The coprecipitation-impregnation method produced more stable catalysts, with little variation in ethylene yield over time. In contrast, the coprecipitation method led to a significant drop in ethylene yield.

5. Selectivity vs. Conversion: There appears to be a trade-off between ethylene selectivity and CO2 conversion. The coprecipitation method resulted in higher ethylene selectivity but lower CO2 conversion, while the opposite was true for the coprecipitation-impregnation method.

6. Deactivation: Coke deposition was identified as the main cause of catalyst deactivation, particularly for the catalyst prepared by coprecipitation.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing ethylene selectivity with CO2 conversion
- Minimizing coke deposition to maintain catalyst stability
- Optimizing the preparation method to achieve the desired catalyst properties

The study does not directly address the influence of CO2 partial pressure or compare other support materials, so these aspects cannot be comprehensively answered based on the given information.

本文主要关注FeCr/ZrO2催化剂，而非对各种载体材料进行全面比较。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于ZrO2作为载体的影响以及制备方法和反应条件影响的见解：

1. 载体材料：本研究使用ZrO2作为载体。Fe促进的Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高催化活性，表明ZrO2是该反应的有效载体。

2. 制备方法：比较了两种方法（共沉淀法和共沉淀-浸渍法）。共沉淀-浸渍法得到的催化剂稳定性更好，CO2转化率更高，而共沉淀法得到的催化剂乙烯选择性更高。

3. 活性物种：Cr3+离子被确定为脱氢的活性物种。反应过程中形成的Fe3O4通过Fe3+和Fe2+之间的电子交换促进逆水气变换反应。

4. 稳定性：共沉淀-浸渍法制备的催化剂更稳定，乙烯产率随时间变化很小。相比之下，共沉淀法制备的催化剂乙烯产率显著下降。

5. 选择性vs转化率：乙烯选择性和CO2转化率之间似乎存在权衡关系。共沉淀法得到的催化剂乙烯选择性更高但CO2转化率较低，而共沉淀-浸渍法则相反。

6. 失活：焦炭沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于共沉淀法制备的催化剂。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡乙烯选择性和CO2转化率
- 最小化焦炭沉积以维持催化剂稳定性
- 优化制备方法以获得所需的催化剂性能

该研究并未直接涉及CO2分压的影响或比较其他载体材料，因此无法根据给定信息全面回答这些方面的问题。
