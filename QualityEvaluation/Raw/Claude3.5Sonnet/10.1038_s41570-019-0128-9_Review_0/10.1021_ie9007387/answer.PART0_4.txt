[1] "Carbon dioxide has recently been employed as a mild oxidant for ODE instead of oxygen."

[2] "A variety of catalysts have been examined in ODE with carbon dioxide as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have proven to be very effective catalysts for this reaction."

[3] "Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity."

[4] "The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g of the catalyst and 1 g of quartz sand at atmospheric pressure. The reactant stream consisting of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide, and 20% Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The reaction temperature was controlled at 650 °C."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into ZrO2 as a support and the influence of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study focuses on ZrO2-supported catalysts, specifically FeCr/ZrO2. These catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity, suggesting ZrO2 is an effective support for chromium oxide in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Reaction conditions: The study used a reactant stream of 20% ethane, 60% CO2, and 20% Ar at 650°C and atmospheric pressure. These conditions influenced the catalytic performance, but the paper does not explore variations in these parameters.

3. CO2 partial pressure: While not explicitly studied, the high CO2 concentration (60%) in the feed suggests that a relatively high CO2 partial pressure was used, which likely impacts the reaction kinetics and pathways.

4. Activity and selectivity: The FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts showed good activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity, but the exact values varied depending on the preparation method.

5. Stability: Catalyst stability was affected by coke deposition, which was identified as the main reason for deactivation.

6. Mechanistic pathways: The study proposes a reaction mechanism involving Cr3+ species for ethane dehydrogenation and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycling for CO2 activation.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability, as higher activity may lead to increased coke formation.
2. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to enhance performance and reduce deactivation.
3. Managing the trade-off between ethylene selectivity and CO2 conversion.

Further research is needed to comprehensively compare different support materials and explore a wider range of reaction conditions to fully optimize catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的不同载体材料进行全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于ZrO2作为载体的见解以及反应条件的影响：

1. 载体材料：该研究主要关注ZrO2负载的催化剂，特别是FeCr/ZrO2。这些催化剂表现出高催化活性，表明ZrO2是二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物的有效载体。

2. 反应条件：研究使用了20%乙烷、60%CO2和20%Ar的反应物流，在650°C和大气压下进行。这些条件影响了催化性能，但文章并未探讨这些参数的变化。

3. CO2分压：虽然没有明确研究，但进料中较高的CO2浓度（60%）表明使用了相对较高的CO2分压，这可能影响反应动力学和路径。

4. 活性和选择性：FeCr/ZrO2催化剂对乙烷转化和乙烯选择性表现出良好的活性，但确切数值因制备方法而异。

5. 稳定性：催化剂稳定性受积碳沉积影响，这被认为是失活的主要原因。

6. 机理路径：研究提出了一种反应机理，涉及Cr3+物种用于乙烷脱氢，以及Fe3+/Fe2+氧化还原循环用于CO2活化。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性，因为较高的活性可能导致积碳增加。
2. 优化催化剂制备方法以提高性能并减少失活。
3. 管理乙烯选择性和CO2转化之间的权衡。

需要进一步研究以全面比较不同的载体材料，并探索更广泛的反应条件，以充分优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中的催化剂性能。
