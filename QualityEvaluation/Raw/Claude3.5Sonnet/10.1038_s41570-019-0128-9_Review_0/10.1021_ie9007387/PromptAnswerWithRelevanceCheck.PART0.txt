The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing the effects of different support materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) or CO2 partial pressure on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study focuses primarily on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by two different methods (coprecipitation and coprecipitation-impregnation) for ethane dehydrogenation using CO2. Without relevant information on other supports or reaction conditions, it is not possible to comprehensively answer the question about their influence on activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways, or discuss key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance across different supports and conditions.

1. "Various promoters have been used to further improve catalytic performance. In our prior work, (14-16) it has been demonstrated that Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity."

2. "The catalysts, which were prepared by the coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation methods, have the same loadings of Fe and Cr (5 wt % of Fe and 10 wt % of Cr)."

3. "The ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (C) dramatically drops from 50% to 38% over the time on stream. However, the ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) varies little."

4. "The ethylene selectivity over FeCr/ZrO2 (C) is higher than that over FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) while its CO2 conversion is lower."

5. "Cr3+ ions are considered the active species for dehydrogenation, with the argument that only Cr3+ species has been detected by XPS on the used catalysts and there is no obvious deactivation of FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) catalysts in the stability test."

6. "Fe3O4 has an inverse spinal structure, which can readily undergo rapid electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The electron hopping between Fe3+ and Fe2+ can facilitate the proceeding of reaction 3."

The literature primarily focuses on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts rather than a comprehensive comparison of various support materials. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of ZrO2 as a support and the impact of preparation methods and reaction conditions:

1. Support material: ZrO2 is used as the support in this study. The Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts show high catalytic activity, indicating that ZrO2 is an effective support for this reaction.

2. Preparation methods: Two methods (coprecipitation and coprecipitation-impregnation) were compared. The coprecipitation-impregnation method resulted in better stability and higher CO2 conversion, while the coprecipitation method led to higher ethylene selectivity.

3. Active species: Cr3+ ions are identified as the active species for dehydrogenation. Fe3O4 formed during the reaction promotes the reverse water-gas shift reaction through electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+.

4. Stability: The coprecipitation-impregnation method produced more stable catalysts, with little variation in ethylene yield over time. In contrast, the coprecipitation method led to a significant drop in ethylene yield.

5. Selectivity vs. Conversion: There appears to be a trade-off between ethylene selectivity and CO2 conversion. The coprecipitation method resulted in higher ethylene selectivity but lower CO2 conversion, while the opposite was true for the coprecipitation-impregnation method.

6. Deactivation: Coke deposition was identified as the main cause of catalyst deactivation, particularly for the catalyst prepared by coprecipitation.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing ethylene selectivity with CO2 conversion
- Minimizing coke deposition to maintain catalyst stability
- Optimizing the preparation method to achieve the desired catalyst properties

The study does not directly address the influence of CO2 partial pressure or compare other support materials, so these aspects cannot be comprehensively answered based on the given information.

本文主要关注FeCr/ZrO2催化剂，而非对各种载体材料进行全面比较。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于ZrO2作为载体的影响以及制备方法和反应条件影响的见解：

1. 载体材料：本研究使用ZrO2作为载体。Fe促进的Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高催化活性，表明ZrO2是该反应的有效载体。

2. 制备方法：比较了两种方法（共沉淀法和共沉淀-浸渍法）。共沉淀-浸渍法得到的催化剂稳定性更好，CO2转化率更高，而共沉淀法得到的催化剂乙烯选择性更高。

3. 活性物种：Cr3+离子被确定为脱氢的活性物种。反应过程中形成的Fe3O4通过Fe3+和Fe2+之间的电子交换促进逆水气变换反应。

4. 稳定性：共沉淀-浸渍法制备的催化剂更稳定，乙烯产率随时间变化很小。相比之下，共沉淀法制备的催化剂乙烯产率显著下降。

5. 选择性vs转化率：乙烯选择性和CO2转化率之间似乎存在权衡关系。共沉淀法得到的催化剂乙烯选择性更高但CO2转化率较低，而共沉淀-浸渍法则相反。

6. 失活：焦炭沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于共沉淀法制备的催化剂。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡乙烯选择性和CO2转化率
- 最小化焦炭沉积以维持催化剂稳定性
- 优化制备方法以获得所需的催化剂性能

该研究并未直接涉及CO2分压的影响或比较其他载体材料，因此无法根据给定信息全面回答这些方面的问题。

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing how different support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The study focuses only on FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by two different methods. It does not compare different support materials or examine the effects of varying CO2 partial pressure.

The paper does provide some insights into ZrO2-supported catalysts, showing that the preparation method affects catalyst performance. The coprecipitation-impregnation method produced more stable catalysts with higher CO2 conversion but lower ethylene selectivity compared to the coprecipitation method. Key challenges identified include coke deposition leading to deactivation, especially for the coprecipitation catalyst.

However, without comparative data on other supports or reaction conditions, the document does not allow for a comprehensive analysis of the influence of various supports and CO2 partial pressures on activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways across different chromium oxide catalyst systems. More research comparing multiple support materials and reaction conditions would be needed to fully address the question posed.

给定的文献并未包含关于不同载体材料（如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的具体信息。该研究仅关注通过两种不同方法制备的FeCr/ZrO2催化剂。它没有比较不同的载体材料或研究改变CO2分压的影响。

该论文确实提供了一些关于ZrO2负载催化剂的见解，表明制备方法会影响催化剂性能。共沉淀-浸渍法制备的催化剂比共沉淀法制备的催化剂具有更高的稳定性和CO2转化率，但乙烯选择性较低。确定的主要挑战包括导致失活的积碳沉积，尤其是对于共沉淀催化剂。

然而，由于缺乏其他载体或反应条件的比较数据，该文档不允许对各种载体和CO2分压对不同氧化铬催化剂系统的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径的影响进行全面分析。需要更多研究来比较多种载体材料和反应条件，以全面回答所提出的问题。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different support materials for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into ZrO2 as a support and the influence of reaction conditions:

1. Support material: The study focuses on ZrO2-supported catalysts, specifically FeCr/ZrO2. These catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity, suggesting ZrO2 is an effective support for chromium oxide in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Reaction conditions: The study used a reactant stream of 20% ethane, 60% CO2, and 20% Ar at 650°C and atmospheric pressure. These conditions influenced the catalytic performance, but the paper does not explore variations in these parameters.

3. CO2 partial pressure: While not explicitly studied, the high CO2 concentration (60%) in the feed suggests that a relatively high CO2 partial pressure was used, which likely impacts the reaction kinetics and pathways.

4. Activity and selectivity: The FeCr/ZrO2 catalysts showed good activity for ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity, but the exact values varied depending on the preparation method.

5. Stability: Catalyst stability was affected by coke deposition, which was identified as the main reason for deactivation.

6. Mechanistic pathways: The study proposes a reaction mechanism involving Cr3+ species for ethane dehydrogenation and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycling for CO2 activation.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability, as higher activity may lead to increased coke formation.
2. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to enhance performance and reduce deactivation.
3. Managing the trade-off between ethylene selectivity and CO2 conversion.

Further research is needed to comprehensively compare different support materials and explore a wider range of reaction conditions to fully optimize catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. CO2分压：虽然没有明确研究，但进料中较高的CO2浓度（60%）表明使用了相对较高的CO2分压，这可能影响反应动力学和路径。

4. 活性和选择性：FeCr/ZrO2催化剂对乙烷转化和乙烯选择性表现出良好的活性，但确切数值因制备方法而异。

5. 稳定性：催化剂稳定性受积碳沉积影响，这被认为是失活的主要原因。

6. 机理路径：研究提出了一种反应机理，涉及Cr3+物种用于乙烷脱氢，以及Fe3+/Fe2+氧化还原循环用于CO2活化。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性，因为较高的活性可能导致积碳增加。
2. 优化催化剂制备方法以提高性能并减少失活。
3. 管理乙烯选择性和CO2转化之间的权衡。

需要进一步研究以全面比较不同的载体材料，并探索更广泛的反应条件，以充分优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中的催化剂性能。
