[1] "Ogonowski et al. [24] loaded vanadium oxides on active carbon (AC), SiO2, Al2O3, and ZnO, and found that the key factor influencing catalytic activity was the alkalinity/acidity of catalyst surface and oxidation-reduction potential of vanadium species."

[2] "Research of Ma et al. [25] on V2O5/Al2O3 and V2O5/SiO2 catalyst showed that vanadium species with higher dispersion had better catalytic activity."

[3] "MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, with 3D worm-like holes, which possess many advantages of pore structure and is in favor of the diffusion of molecular objects [26]."

[4] "The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream here could obviously enhance the stability of VOx/MSU-1, and the drop rate of isobutane conversion with CO2 was lower than that without CO2."

[5] "This was due to that CO2 in the reaction stream could suppress the formation of coke deposited over VOx/MSU-1 [17,37,38]."

While the given literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts, it provides insights on vanadium oxide catalysts that may be relevant:

1. The support material influences catalytic activity through surface alkalinity/acidity and the oxidation-reduction potential of the active metal species. Different supports like AC, SiO2, Al2O3, and ZnO affect these properties.

2. Higher dispersion of active metal species on the support leads to better catalytic activity, as seen with V2O5 on Al2O3 and SiO2.

3. Mesoporous materials with 3D pore structures, like MSU-x, can enhance molecular diffusion and potentially improve catalyst performance.

4. CO2 in the reaction stream enhances catalyst stability and reduces the rate of conversion decline over time.

5. CO2 suppresses coke formation on the catalyst surface, which is a key factor in maintaining catalyst activity and stability.

The main challenges in optimizing overall performance likely involve balancing metal dispersion, support properties, and reaction conditions to maximize activity and selectivity while minimizing deactivation. Trade-offs may exist between high initial activity and long-term stability.

虽然给定的文献并未直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂，但它提供了关于钒氧化物催化剂的见解，这可能具有相关性：

1. 载体材料通过表面碱性/酸性和活性金属物种的氧化还原电位影响催化活性。不同的载体如活性炭、SiO2、Al2O3和ZnO会影响这些性质。

2. 活性金属物种在载体上的高度分散会导致更好的催化活性，这在V2O5/Al2O3和V2O5/SiO2催化剂中得到了证实。

3. 具有三维孔结构的介孔材料，如MSU-x，可以增强分子扩散，潜在地提高催化剂性能。

4. 反应气流中的CO2增强了催化剂的稳定性，并降低了转化率随时间下降的速率。

5. CO2抑制了催化剂表面积炭的形成，这是维持催化剂活性和稳定性的关键因素。

优化整体性能的主要挑战可能涉及平衡金属分散度、载体性质和反应条件，以最大化活性和选择性，同时最小化失活。高初始活性和长期稳定性之间可能存在权衡。
