[1] "Several metal oxides have been used as catalysts [110,111], and the most effective catalysts with high ethane conversion (>60%) and ethylene selectivity (>90%) contained Cr or Ce elements."

[2] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant can overcome the high energy consumption for the endothermic pyrolysis and prevents deep oxidation, but unfortunately, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 remains an endothermic reaction and requires addition of heat for its activation [102,107]. However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the influence of different support materials or reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts specifically for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that chromium-containing catalysts are among the most effective for ethane conversion to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant, achieving high conversion (>60%) and selectivity (>90%).

The key challenges in optimizing performance appear to be:

1. Overcoming the endothermic nature of the reaction, which requires additional heat input.

2. Activating CO2, which has low chemical reactivity and typically requires higher reaction temperatures.

3. Balancing conversion and selectivity, as higher temperatures needed for CO2 activation may negatively impact selectivity.

4. Maintaining catalyst stability at the elevated temperatures required.

The literature does not provide specific information on mechanistic pathways or the influence of CO2 partial pressure. More research would be needed to fully address the question's details about support materials, reaction conditions, and optimization trade-offs for chromium oxide catalysts in this reaction.

文献中没有提供关于不同支撑材料或反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的影响的详细信息。但是，它确实提到含铬催化剂是使用CO2作为氧化剂将乙烷转化为乙烯的最有效催化剂之一，实现了高转化率(>60%)和选择性(>90%)。

优化性能的主要挑战似乎是：

1. 克服反应的吸热性质，这需要额外的热量输入。

2. 活化CO2，它具有低化学反应性，通常需要更高的反应温度。

3. 平衡转化率和选择性，因为CO2活化所需的更高温度可能会对选择性产生负面影响。

4. 在所需的高温下保持催化剂的稳定性。

文献没有提供关于反应机理途径或CO2分压影响的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答问题中关于支撑材料、反应条件以及铬氧化物催化剂在这种反应中的优化权衡的详细信息。
