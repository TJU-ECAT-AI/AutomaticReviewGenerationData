[1] "Several metal oxides have been used as catalysts [110,111], and the most effective catalysts with high ethane conversion (>60%) and ethylene selectivity (>90%) contained Cr or Ce elements."

[2] "However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures. This drawback makes the use of CO2 as a selective oxidant well suited for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts specifically for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that chromium-containing catalysts are among the most effective for ethane conversion to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant, achieving high conversion (>60%) and selectivity (>90%). 

The key challenge noted is the low reactivity of CO2, requiring high temperatures for activation. This aligns well with ethane activation, which also needs high temperatures. The trade-off appears to be between achieving sufficient reactivity at high temperatures while maintaining selectivity.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on chromium oxide catalysts supported on various materials (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and their performance under different CO2 partial pressures would be needed. Factors like support acidity/basicity, surface area, and chromium oxide dispersion likely play important roles but are not discussed in the given literature.

文献没有提供关于不同载体材料和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的详细信息。但是,它确实提到含铬的催化剂是使用CO2作为氧化剂将乙烷转化为乙烯的最有效催化剂之一,实现了高转化率(>60%)和选择性(>90%)。

所提到的主要挑战是CO2的反应活性低,需要高温才能活化。这与乙烷的活化需求很好地吻合,因为乙烷活化也需要高温。权衡似乎在于在高温下实现足够的反应活性,同时保持选择性。

要全面回答这个问题,需要对负载在各种材料(SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2)上的铬氧化物催化剂及其在不同CO2分压下的性能进行更具体的研究。载体的酸碱性、比表面积和铬氧化物的分散度等因素可能起着重要作用,但在给定的文献中没有讨论这些内容。
