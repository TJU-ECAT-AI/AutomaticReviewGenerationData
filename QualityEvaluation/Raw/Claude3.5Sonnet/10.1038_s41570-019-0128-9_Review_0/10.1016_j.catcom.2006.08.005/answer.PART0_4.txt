[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. Excellent results in dehydrogena-tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec-tivity, were obtained."

[2] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[3] "Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal-leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, are expected to be new promising catalyst support"

[4] "The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min. Catalyst loading was 0.2 g."

[5] "Conversion of propane increased as the reaction tempera-ture was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased."

[6] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[7] "Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher pro-pane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table. The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

The literature provides information on chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (MSU-x) for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not directly compare different support materials. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Support influence: Mesoporous silica (MSU-x) is highlighted as a promising support due to its high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, which likely contribute to the excellent performance observed.

2. Chromium loading effects: Lower Cr loading results in higher oxidation state Cr species, while higher loading leads to bulk Cr2O3 formation. Optimal loading is between 5-12 wt%, balancing propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature increases improve propane conversion but decrease propylene selectivity. CO2:C3H8 ratio of 3:1 was used.

4. Performance: Cr/MSU-x showed high activity (36.8% propane conversion, 89.1% propylene selectivity) compared to other catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing Cr loading to optimize both activity and selectivity
- Managing the inverse relationship between conversion and selectivity with temperature
- Maintaining catalyst stability over time (some deactivation was observed)

The study does not provide direct information on mechanistic pathways or the specific influence of CO2 partial pressure. More comparative studies with different supports and reaction conditions would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献提供了以介孔二氧化硅(MSU-x)为载体的氧化铬催化剂用于CO2氧化脱氢丙烷的信息，但没有直接比较不同载体材料。然而，可以得出一些见解：

1. 载体影响：介孔二氧化硅(MSU-x)因其高比表面积和均匀的纳米孔道结构而被强调为有前景的载体，这可能是导致观察到优异性能的原因。

2. 铬负载效应：较低的Cr负载导致形成较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高负载导致形成块状Cr2O3。最佳负载量在5-12 wt%之间，平衡了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 反应条件：温度升高提高丙烷转化率但降低丙烯选择性。使用了CO2:C3H8比例为3:1。

4. 性能：与其他催化剂相比，Cr/MSU-x表现出高活性(丙烷转化率36.8%，丙烯选择性89.1%)。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡Cr负载以优化活性和选择性
- 管理温度与转化率和选择性之间的反比关系
- 维持催化剂的长期稳定性(观察到一些失活现象)

该研究没有提供关于反应机理路径或CO2分压具体影响的直接信息。需要进行更多不同载体和反应条件的比较研究才能全面回答这个问题。
