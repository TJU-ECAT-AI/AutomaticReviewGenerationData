The literature provides some insights into how mesoporous silica supports like MSU-x influence chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Mesoporous silica materials like MSU-x offer high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, making them promising catalyst supports.

2. Cr/MSU-x catalysts showed good activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane with CO2, exhibiting higher propane conversion than many other catalysts.

3. Increasing reaction temperature improved propane conversion but decreased propylene selectivity.

4. Increasing chromium loading up to 5 wt% improved propane and CO2 conversion, though propylene selectivity decreased. Propylene yield still increased overall in this range.

The study does not directly compare different support materials or examine CO2 partial pressure effects. Key challenges appear to be balancing conversion and selectivity, as well as optimizing metal loading. More research comparing supports and reaction conditions would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于介孔二氧化硅载体(如MSU-x)如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解:

1. 像MSU-x这样的介孔二氧化硅材料具有高比表面积和均匀的纳米孔道,使其成为有前景的催化剂载体。

2. Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2存在下对乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢表现出良好的活性,其丙烷转化率高于许多其他催化剂。

3. 提高反应温度可以提高丙烷转化率,但会降低丙烯选择性。

4. 将铬负载量增加到5 wt%可以提高丙烷和CO2的转化率,但丙烯选择性会降低。在这个范围内,丙烯总产率仍然增加。

该研究没有直接比较不同的载体材料或研究CO2分压的影响。主要挑战似乎是在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡,以及优化金属负载量。需要进行更多比较载体和反应条件的研究才能全面回答问题的范围。
