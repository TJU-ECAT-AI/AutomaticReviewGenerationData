Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to be active catalysts for hydrogenation, isomerization of olefins, and dehydrogenation of alkanes"

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[3] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst. Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, whereas Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene."

[4] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "The acidbase property of supports plays an important role in Cr anchorage and dispersion on oxide supports"

[6] "It is believed that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: SiO2-supported Cr2O3 shows the highest ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. The overall activity order is Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. ZrO2 support leads to high conversion but low selectivity.

2. Stability: The stability of catalysts varies with different supports. Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits good stability.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The acidity/basicity of the support affects Cr anchorage and dispersion. Surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples are believed to be the active sites, with redox properties playing a key role in the reaction mechanism.

4. Influence of support properties: The acidic/basic nature of supports strongly affects catalyst performance. Silica's acidic properties favor high activity and selectivity, while more basic supports like alumina show lower performance.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: A major challenge is balancing high activity with high selectivity. ZrO2 supports provide high conversion but poor selectivity, while SiO2 offers a better balance. Optimizing Cr loading and dispersion on different supports to maximize active sites without forming bulk Cr2O3 is another key challenge.

The study does not specifically address the effects of CO2 partial pressure, which remains an area for further investigation in optimizing these catalysts' performance.

载体材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径有显著影响：

1. 活性和选择性：SiO2负载的Cr2O3表现出最高的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。整体活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。ZrO2载体导致高转化率但低选择性。

2. 稳定性：不同载体上催化剂的稳定性各不相同。Cr2O3/SiO2表现出良好的稳定性。

3. 机理途径：载体的酸碱性影响Cr的固定和分散。表面Cr3+物种和Cr6+/Cr3+耦合被认为是活性位点，氧化还原特性在反应机理中起关键作用。

4. 载体性质的影响：载体的酸碱性强烈影响催化剂性能。二氧化硅的酸性特征有利于高活性和选择性，而氧化铝等更碱性的载体表现出较低的性能。

5. 挑战和权衡：主要挑战是在高活性和高选择性之间取得平衡。ZrO2载体提供高转化率但选择性差，而SiO2提供更好的平衡。在不同载体上优化Cr负载量和分散度以最大化活性位点而不形成块状Cr2O3是另一个关键挑战。

该研究没有具体讨论CO2分压的影响，这仍然是优化这些催化剂性能的一个待研究领域。
