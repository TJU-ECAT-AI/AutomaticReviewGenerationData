[1] "The supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibit quite different activities for this reaction. Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst."

[2] "Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, whereas Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene. However, Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher methane selectivity, suggesting that it favors the cracking of ethane."

[3] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[5] "It has been also proposed that CO2 would exert a adverse effect on activity for those strong basic catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane"

[6] "8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 shows a higher deactivation rate. For both catalysts, as the ethane conversion decreases, ethylene selectivity increases."

[7] "We believe that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: The order of catalytic activity is Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. SiO2-supported catalysts show the highest ethane conversion, while TiO2-supported catalysts demonstrate the lowest activity.

2. Selectivity: Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene but higher methane selectivity due to favoring ethane cracking.

3. Stability: Higher Cr2O3 loading (e.g., 8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2) shows a higher deactivation rate compared to lower loading (5 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2).

4. Mechanistic pathways: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects the catalytic properties. CO2 may have an adverse effect on strongly basic catalysts. Surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples are believed to be the active sites, with catalytic activity dependent on the redox properties of the catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Higher activity catalysts may lead to lower selectivity (e.g., Cr2O3/ZrO2).
2. Optimizing Cr2O3 loading: Higher loading increases activity but may decrease stability.
3. Choosing appropriate support materials: The acidity/basicity of the support affects catalyst performance.
4. Managing the redox properties: The balance between Cr3+ and Cr6+ species influences catalytic behavior.

The influence of CO2 partial pressure is not directly addressed in the given literature.

支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 活性：催化活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。SiO2负载的催化剂显示最高的乙烷转化率，而TiO2负载的催化剂表现出最低的活性。

2. 选择性：Cr2O3/SiO2表现出最高的乙烯选择性，而Cr2O3/ZrO2给出最低的乙烯选择性，但由于有利于乙烷裂解而具有较高的甲烷选择性。

3. 稳定性：较高的Cr2O3负载量（例如8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2）相比较低负载量（5 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2）显示出更高的失活率。

4. 机理途径：氧化物支持材料的酸碱性强烈影响催化性能。CO2可能对强碱性催化剂产生不利影响。表面Cr3+物种和Cr6+/Cr3+偶合被认为是活性位点，催化活性取决于催化剂的氧化还原性质。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：较高活性的催化剂可能导致较低的选择性（例如Cr2O3/ZrO2）。
2. 优化Cr2O3负载量：较高的负载量增加活性但可能降低稳定性。
3. 选择适当的支持材料：支持材料的酸碱性影响催化剂性能。
4. 管理氧化还原性质：Cr3+和Cr6+物种之间的平衡影响催化行为。
