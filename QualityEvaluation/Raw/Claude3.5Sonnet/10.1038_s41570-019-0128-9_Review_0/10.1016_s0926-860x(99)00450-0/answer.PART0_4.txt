The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: The catalytic activity follows the order Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. SiO2-supported catalysts show the highest ethane conversion, while TiO2-supported catalysts demonstrate the lowest activity.

2. Selectivity: Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene but higher methane selectivity.

3. Stability: The stability of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts was investigated at 650°C, showing some deactivation over time due to carbon deposition.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The reaction involves both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. Surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples are believed to be the active sites, with the catalytic activity dependent on the redox properties of the catalysts.

The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: While Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows high activity, it has lower ethylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/SiO2.

2. Maintaining stability: Catalysts show deactivation over time due to carbon deposition, which needs to be addressed.

3. Optimizing support properties: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects catalytic properties, requiring careful selection and tuning of support materials.

4. Controlling Cr species distribution: The ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ and their redox properties influence catalytic performance, necessitating precise control of chromium species on the support surface.

5. Balancing dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways: The introduction of CO2 leads to parallel reaction paths, which need to be optimized for desired product distribution.

The study does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or other reaction conditions beyond temperature, nor does it discuss MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, or CeO2 supports.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径受到支撑材料的显著影响：

1. 活性：催化活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。SiO2负载的催化剂显示出最高的乙烷转化率，而TiO2负载的催化剂活性最低。

2. 选择性：Cr2O3/SiO2表现出最高的乙烯选择性，而Cr2O3/ZrO2给出最低的乙烯选择性，但甲烷选择性较高。

3. 稳定性：在650°C下研究了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的稳定性，显示随时间推移由于碳沉积而有一定程度的失活。

4. 机理途径：反应涉及脱氢和氧化脱氢两种途径。表面Cr3+物种和Cr6+/Cr3+偶被认为是活性位点，催化活性取决于催化剂的氧化还原性质。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：虽然Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出高活性，但与Cr2O3/SiO2相比，其乙烯选择性较低。

2. 保持稳定性：催化剂随时间推移由于碳沉积而失活，需要解决这一问题。

3. 优化支撑材料性质：氧化物支撑材料的酸碱性强烈影响催化性能，需要仔细选择和调节支撑材料。

4. 控制Cr物种分布：Cr6+/Cr3+的比例及其氧化还原性质影响催化性能，需要精确控制支撑表面的铬物种。

5. 平衡脱氢和氧化脱氢途径：CO2的引入导致平行反应路径，需要优化以获得所需的产物分布。

该研究没有提供关于CO2分压或除温度外其他反应条件影响的具体信息，也没有讨论MCM-41、H-ZSM-5或CeO2支撑材料。
