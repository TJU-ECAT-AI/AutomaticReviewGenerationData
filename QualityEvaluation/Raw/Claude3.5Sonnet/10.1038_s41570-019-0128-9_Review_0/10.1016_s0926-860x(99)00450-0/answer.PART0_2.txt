[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to be active catalysts for hydrogenation, isomerization of olefins, and dehydrogenation of alkanes"

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[3] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[4] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst. Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity"

[5] "The effect of Cr2O3 loading in Cr2O3/SiO2 system on catalytic activity was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 1. As seen, ethane conversion increases as Cr2O3 content increases and it reaches the maximum value at 8 wt.% Cr2O3."

[6] "We believe that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

[7] "The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation due to the introduction of CO2 and its decomposition to produce surface oxygen species will be the parallel reaction paths in the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide."

The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: The catalytic activity follows the order Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. SiO2-supported catalysts show the highest ethane conversion, while TiO2-supported catalysts demonstrate the lowest activity.

2. Selectivity: Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity among the tested catalysts.

3. Stability: The stability of the catalysts was not extensively discussed in the given literature.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The reaction involves both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. Surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation.

5. Influence of support: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects the catalytic properties. The support influences the distribution and structure of chromium oxide species on the surface.

6. Optimization: For Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, the optimal Cr2O3 loading was found to be 8 wt.%, which gave the maximum ethane conversion.

Key challenges and trade-offs:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: While Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows high activity, it has lower ethylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/SiO2.

2. Optimizing redox properties: The catalytic activity depends on the redox properties of the catalysts, which are influenced by the support material and chromium loading.

3. Managing the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio: This ratio affects the catalyst's performance and needs to be optimized for each support material.

4. Preventing catalyst deactivation: Although not extensively discussed, catalyst stability and preventing deactivation are likely challenges in optimizing overall performance.

5. CO2 activation: Effectively utilizing CO2 in the reaction while maintaining high ethylene selectivity is a key challenge.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the reaction, which represents a gap in the available data for fully optimizing these catalysts.

支持材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径有显著影响：

1. 活性：催化活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。SiO2负载的催化剂显示出最高的乙烷转化率，而TiO2负载的催化剂活性最低。

2. 选择性：在测试的催化剂中，Cr2O3/SiO2表现出最高的乙烯选择性。

3. 稳定性：文献中没有广泛讨论催化剂的稳定性。

4. 机理途径：反应涉及脱氢和氧化脱氢两种途径。表面Cr3+物种和Cr6+/Cr3+偶被认为是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

5. 载体的影响：氧化物载体的酸碱性强烈影响催化性能。载体影响表面铬氧化物种的分布和结构。

6. 优化：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，最佳Cr2O3负载量为8 wt.%，此时乙烷转化率最高。

主要挑战和权衡：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：虽然Cr2O3/ZrO2显示出高活性，但其乙烯选择性低于Cr2O3/SiO2。

2. 优化氧化还原性能：催化活性取决于催化剂的氧化还原性能，而这受载体材料和铬负载量的影响。

3. 管理Cr6+/Cr3+比例：这个比例影响催化剂的性能，需要针对每种载体材料进行优化。

4. 防止催化剂失活：虽然没有广泛讨论，但催化剂稳定性和防止失活可能是优化整体性能的挑战。

5. CO2活化：在保持高乙烯选择性的同时有效利用CO2参与反应是一个关键挑战。

文献没有提供CO2分压对反应影响的具体信息，这代表了全面优化这些催化剂时可用数据的空白。
