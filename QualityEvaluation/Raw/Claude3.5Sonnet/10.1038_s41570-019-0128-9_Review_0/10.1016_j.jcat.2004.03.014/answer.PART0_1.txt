[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of carbon monoxide formation increased together with that of propene, while the rate of hydrogen formation stayed at almost constant value, with increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6"

The literature provides insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material: MCM-41 showed the highest activity among tested supports for chromium oxide catalysts. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated superior performance compared to other supports like Cab-O-Sil (nonporous silica) and SiO2.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 partial pressure led to higher propene and CO formation rates, while H2 formation remained relatively constant. This suggests that CO2 plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism and product distribution.

3. Reaction mechanism: The active site appears to be Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination, which reduces to less active Cr(III) in octahedral coordination during the reaction. CO2 can regenerate the active Cr(VI)O4 species, though less efficiently than oxygen.

4. Activity and selectivity: Cr-MCM-41 achieved 30% propane conversion with over 90% propene selectivity under optimized conditions. In a specific gas mixture (N2:CO2:C3H8 = 10:34:6), it showed 17% propane conversion with 15.9% propene yield.

5. Stability and regeneration: The catalyst deactivates during the reaction but can be regenerated using both O2 and CO2. Oxygen treatment is more effective in restoring activity.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing high activity with catalyst stability, as the active Cr(VI) species tend to reduce during the reaction.
2. Optimizing CO2 partial pressure to enhance propene formation while minimizing coke deposition.
3. Developing support materials that promote the formation and stability of active Cr(VI) species.
4. Improving the efficiency of CO2 as a regenerating agent to maintain catalyst activity during extended operation.

Further research is needed to fully optimize these catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in terms of long-term stability and regeneration strategies.

文献为我们提供了不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 支撑材料：在测试的支撑材料中，MCM-41显示出最高的铬氧化物催化剂活性。与其他支撑材料如Cab-O-Sil（非多孔二氧化硅）和SiO2相比，Cr-MCM-41表现出更优越的性能。

2. CO2分压：随着CO2分压的增加，丙烯和CO的生成速率提高，而H2的生成速率保持相对恒定。这表明CO2在反应机理和产物分布中起着关键作用。

3. 反应机理：活性位点似乎是四面体配位的Cr(VI)，在反应过程中还原为活性较低的八面体配位的Cr(III)。CO2可以再生活性Cr(VI)O4物种，尽管效率低于氧气。

4. 活性和选择性：在优化条件下，Cr-MCM-41实现了30%的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性超过90%。在特定气体混合物（N2:CO2:C3H8 = 10:34:6）中，它显示出17%的丙烷转化率和15.9%的丙烯产率。

5. 稳定性和再生：催化剂在反应过程中会失活，但可以使用O2和CO2进行再生。氧气处理在恢复活性方面更有效。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡高活性和催化剂稳定性，因为活性Cr(VI)物种在反应过程中倾向于还原。
2. 优化CO2分压以增强丙烯形成，同时最小化积碳沉积。
3. 开发促进活性Cr(VI)物种形成和稳定性的支撑材料。
4. 提高CO2作为再生剂的效率，以在长期运行中维持催化剂活性。

需要进一步研究以全面优化这些催化剂用于工业应用，特别是在长期稳定性和再生策略方面。
