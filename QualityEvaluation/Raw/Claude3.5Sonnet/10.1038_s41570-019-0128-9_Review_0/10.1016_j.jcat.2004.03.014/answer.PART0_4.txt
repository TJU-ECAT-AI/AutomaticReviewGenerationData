[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of carbon monoxide formation increased together with that of propene, while the rate of hydrogen formation stayed at almost constant value, with increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6"

The support material and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material: MCM-41 showed the highest activity among tested supports for Cr catalysts, with 30% propane conversion and over 90% propene selectivity. 

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 partial pressure led to increased propene and CO formation rates, while H2 formation remained constant. This suggests CO2 plays a role in shifting the equilibrium and potentially in catalyst regeneration.

3. Mechanistic pathway: The reaction involves a redox cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra (active species) and Cr(III)O6 octahedra (less active species). CO2 can regenerate the active Cr(VI) species, though less efficiently than O2.

4. Stability: Catalyst deactivation occurs due to the reduction of active Cr(VI) to less active Cr(III) species. Regeneration with O2 or CO2 can restore activity by reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. Reaction conditions: A gas mixture of N2:CO2:C3H8 at 10:34:6 molar ratio resulted in 17% propane conversion and 15.9% propene yield for Cr-MCM-41-DHT.

Key challenges include maintaining the active Cr(VI) species during reaction, optimizing CO2 partial pressure for both equilibrium shift and catalyst regeneration, and balancing activity with stability. The trade-off between high activity and catalyst deactivation needs to be addressed for improved overall performance.

支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 支持材料：在测试的催化剂支持材料中，MCM-41显示出最高的活性，丙烷转化率达30%，丙烯选择性超过90%。

2. CO2分压：增加CO2分压导致丙烯和CO的生成速率增加，而H2的生成速率保持恒定。这表明CO2在平衡移动和潜在的催化剂再生中起作用。

3. 机理途径：反应涉及Cr(VI)O4四面体（活性物种）和Cr(III)O6八面体（活性较低的物种）之间的氧化还原循环。CO2可以再生活性Cr(VI)物种，尽管效率低于O2。

4. 稳定性：由于活性Cr(VI)还原为活性较低的Cr(III)物种，催化剂会失活。用O2或CO2再生可以通过将Cr(III)重新氧化为Cr(VI)来恢复活性。

5. 反应条件：对于Cr-MCM-41-DHT，N2:CO2:C3H8摩尔比为10:34:6的气体混合物导致17%的丙烷转化率和15.9%的丙烯产率。

主要挑战包括在反应过程中维持活性Cr(VI)物种、优化CO2分压以同时实现平衡移动和催化剂再生、以及平衡活性与稳定性。需要解决高活性与催化剂失活之间的权衡问题，以改善整体性能。
