[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of carbon monoxide formation increased together with that of propene, while the rate of hydrogen formation stayed at almost constant value, with increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT (Si/Cr = 50) showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6"

The literature provides insights into how different supports and reaction conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: MCM-41 was found to be a highly effective support for chromium oxide catalysts. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among various metal-containing MCM-41 catalysts tested, with 30% propane conversion and over 90% propene selectivity.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 partial pressure led to higher rates of propene and CO formation, while H2 formation remained relatively constant. This suggests that CO2 plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.

3. Reaction mechanism: The active species appears to be tetrahedral Cr(VI)O4, which is reduced to octahedral Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. CO2 can regenerate the active Cr(VI)O4 species, though less efficiently than oxygen.

4. Catalyst stability and regeneration: The catalyst deactivates over time but can be regenerated using both oxygen and CO2. Oxygen treatment is more effective for regeneration.

5. Optimizing performance: A key challenge is balancing the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. While Cr-MCM-41 shows high activity and selectivity, maintaining the active Cr(VI) species during prolonged reaction times remains a challenge.

The main trade-offs involve maximizing propene yield and selectivity while minimizing catalyst deactivation and coke formation. Optimizing CO2 partial pressure and developing more efficient regeneration methods could help address these challenges.

文献提供了关于不同载体和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能的见解：

1. 载体材料：MCM-41被发现是铬氧化物催化剂的高效载体。在测试的各种含金属MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，丙烷转化率达30%，丙烯选择性超过90%。

2. CO2分压：增加CO2分压导致丙烯和CO的生成速率提高，而H2的生成速率保持相对恒定。这表明CO2在反应机理中起着关键作用。

3. 反应机理：活性物种似乎是四面体Cr(VI)O4，在反应过程中被还原为八面体Cr(III)O6。CO2可以再生活性Cr(VI)O4物种，尽管效率低于氧气。

4. 催化剂稳定性和再生：催化剂随时间推移而失活，但可以使用氧气和CO2进行再生。氧气处理对再生更有效。

5. 优化性能：关键挑战是平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。虽然Cr-MCM-41显示出高活性和选择性，但在长时间反应中维持活性Cr(VI)物种仍然是一个挑战。

主要的权衡涉及最大化丙烯产率和选择性，同时最小化催化剂失活和积碳形成。优化CO2分压和开发更高效的再生方法可能有助于解决这些挑战。
