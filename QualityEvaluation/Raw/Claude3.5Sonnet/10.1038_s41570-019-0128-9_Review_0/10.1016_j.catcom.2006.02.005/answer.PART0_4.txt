[2] "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The catalytic activity, observed at temperatures as low as 450 C can be well explained on the basis of the existence of reducible chromium species."

[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction). Removal of deposited carbon through the Boudouard reaction was another plausible cause."

[5] "Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states [4,29,30]."

[6] "The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species [29]."

The literature provides some insights into how different supports and reaction conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Various support materials have been studied, including SiO2, TiO2, diamond, H-ZSM-5, and CeO2. Among these, Cr-based catalysts, especially Cr/SiO2, showed excellent performance.

2. The activity of these catalysts is closely related to the existence of reducible chromium species. The catalytic activity was observed at temperatures as low as 450°C.

3. CO2 plays multiple roles in the reaction:
   - It participates in the water-gas shift reaction, producing CO and H2O.
   - It may help remove deposited carbon through the Boudouard reaction.
   - It helps maintain chromium oxide in higher oxidation states, which is beneficial for the reaction.

4. The main challenge appears to be catalyst stability. The conversion of ethane gradually decreased over time, indicating catalyst deactivation. This was associated with the reduction of active chromium species.

5. The partial pressure of CO2 was not explicitly discussed in the given text, but it likely influences the reaction by affecting the equilibrium of the water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions.

The key trade-off seems to be between activity and stability. While higher oxidation states of chromium are more active, they also tend to be reduced over time, leading to deactivation. Optimizing the catalyst requires balancing these factors, possibly through careful selection of support materials and reaction conditions that can maintain the active chromium species.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些关于不同载体和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能的见解：

1. 研究了各种载体材料，包括SiO2、TiO2、金刚石、H-ZSM-5和CeO2。其中，基于铬的催化剂，尤其是Cr/SiO2，表现出优异的性能。

2. 这些催化剂的活性与可还原铬物种的存在密切相关。在低至450°C的温度下就观察到了催化活性。

3. CO2在反应中发挥多重作用：
   - 参与水气变换反应，产生CO和H2O。
   - 可能通过布达反应帮助去除沉积的碳。
   - 有助于维持铬氧化物处于较高的氧化态，这对反应有利。

4. 主要挑战似乎是催化剂的稳定性。乙烷的转化率随时间逐渐降低，表明催化剂失活。这与活性铬物种的还原有关。

5. 文中没有明确讨论CO2的分压，但它可能通过影响水气变换反应和布达反应的平衡来影响反应。

关键的权衡似乎在于活性和稳定性之间。虽然铬的高氧化态更活跃，但它们也容易随时间被还原，导致失活。优化催化剂需要平衡这些因素，可能通过仔细选择载体材料和反应条件来维持活性铬物种。
