[1] "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

[2] "In order to obtain better catalytic activities, some work had been carried out on the modification of Cr/SiO2 using alkali metal oxides and sulfate"

[3] "Weckhuysen et al. had ever investigated the Cr/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting that the addition of submonolayer quantities of surface titania species to silica (CabOSil) can enhance the concentration of surface polychromate species and result in comparable amounts of surface monochromate and polychromate species"

[4] "The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

[5] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane"

[6] "Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

[7] "The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

The literature provides some insights into how different supports and conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: The study focuses on TS-1 (titanium silicalite-1) supports with varying Si/Ti ratios. Cr/SiO2 catalysts are mentioned as showing excellent performance. Adding titania to silica supports can enhance surface polychromate species, which may improve catalytic activity.

2. Activity: Higher Si/Ti ratio supports (TS-1(150) and TS-1(60)) showed higher activity than lower ratio supports (TS-1(30) and TS-1(15)). This suggests that the support composition affects catalyst activity.

3. Selectivity: Lower Si/Ti ratio catalysts (Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30)) showed higher ethylene selectivity at higher temperatures compared to higher ratio catalysts.

4. Stability: The catalysts showed deactivation over time, associated with the reduction of active chromium species. This could be partially reversed by oxygen treatment.

5. Mechanistic insights: High oxidation state chromium species are key for higher catalytic activity. CO2 helps maintain chromium in higher oxidation states, promoting activity.

6. CO2 effects: The presence of CO2 slightly improved catalytic performance compared to reactions without CO2, likely due to shifting equilibrium and maintaining higher chromium oxidation states.

Key challenges include balancing activity and selectivity, as higher activity catalysts showed lower selectivity at high temperatures. Maintaining catalyst stability and preventing deactivation is another important issue to address.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于不同载体和条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 载体材料：研究主要集中在具有不同Si/Ti比的TS-1（钛硅分子筛-1）载体上。文中提到Cr/SiO2催化剂表现出优异的性能。向二氧化硅载体添加二氧化钛可以增强表面多铬酸盐物种，这可能会提高催化活性。

2. 活性：较高Si/Ti比的载体（TS-1(150)和TS-1(60)）比较低比例的载体（TS-1(30)和TS-1(15)）显示出更高的活性。这表明载体组成会影响催化剂活性。

3. 选择性：在较高温度下，较低Si/Ti比的催化剂（Cr/TS-1(15)和Cr/TS-1(30)）比较高比例的催化剂表现出更高的乙烯选择性。

4. 稳定性：催化剂随时间推移显示出失活，这与活性铬物种的还原有关。这种失活可以通过氧气处理部分逆转。

5. 机理见解：高氧化态铬物种是获得更高催化活性的关键。CO2有助于保持铬处于更高的氧化态，从而促进活性。

6. CO2效应：与无CO2反应相比，CO2的存在略微改善了催化性能，这可能是由于平衡移动和维持铬的较高氧化态。

主要挑战包括平衡活性和选择性，因为高活性催化剂在高温下表现出较低的选择性。保持催化剂稳定性和防止失活是另一个需要解决的重要问题。
