          "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"Cr/TS-1 catalyst could exhibit particular catalytic properties for the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide compared to Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

"Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction)."

"Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

"The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

          The literature provides insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including SiO2, TiO2, TS-1 (titanosilicate-1) with different Si/Ti ratios, diamond, H-ZSM-5, and CeO2. Cr/SiO2 and Cr/TS-1 catalysts showed excellent performance, with Cr/TS-1 exhibiting particular catalytic properties compared to Cr/SiO2.

2. Activity: The order of activities for Cr/TS-1 catalysts was Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15), indicating that higher Si/Ti ratios generally lead to higher activity. Chromium species in high oxidation states were key to higher catalytic activity.

3. CO2 effects: The presence of CO2 slightly improved catalytic performance compared to reactions without CO2. CO2 participates in the water-gas shift reaction, may help remove deposited carbon through the Boudouard reaction, and helps maintain chromium oxide in higher oxidation states.

4. Selectivity: Selectivity to ethylene decreased with increasing reaction temperature for all catalysts due to secondary reactions forming CH4. Chromium oxide in high oxidation states was considered responsible for the cracking of ethane to methane.

5. Stability: Catalysts showed deactivation over time, associated with the reduction of active chromium species. However, activity could be recovered through oxygen treatment.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity
- Temperature optimization
- Maintaining catalyst stability
- CO2 utilization
- Optimizing chromium oxidation states

The study does not provide comprehensive information on all support materials mentioned in the question, and the effects of CO2 partial pressure are not explicitly discussed. Further research is needed to address these challenges and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          该文献提供了关于不同载体材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 载体材料：研究了各种载体，包括SiO2、TiO2、具有不同Si/Ti比的TS-1（钛硅石-1）、金刚石、H-ZSM-5和CeO2。Cr/SiO2和Cr/TS-1催化剂表现出优异的性能，其中Cr/TS-1与Cr/SiO2相比展现出特殊的催化性能。

2. 活性：Cr/TS-1催化剂的活性顺序为Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)，表明较高的Si/Ti比通常会导致较高的活性。高氧化态的铬物种是获得较高催化活性的关键。

3. CO2影响：与无CO2的反应相比，CO2的存在略微提高了催化性能。CO2参与水煤气变换反应，可能通过布达反应帮助去除沉积的碳，并有助于保持铬氧化物处于较高的氧化态。

4. 选择性：对于所有催化剂，随着反应温度的升高，乙烯的选择性降低，这是由于形成CH4的二次反应。高氧化态的铬氧化物被认为是导致乙烷裂解为甲烷的主要因素。

5. 稳定性：催化剂随时间推移显示出失活，这与活性铬物种的还原有关。然而，通过氧气处理可以恢复活性。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性
- 温度优化
- 保持催化剂稳定性
- CO2利用
- 优化铬的氧化态

该研究并未提供问题中提到的所有载体材料的全面信息，也未明确讨论CO2分压的影响。需要进一步研究以解决这些挑战，并优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能。
