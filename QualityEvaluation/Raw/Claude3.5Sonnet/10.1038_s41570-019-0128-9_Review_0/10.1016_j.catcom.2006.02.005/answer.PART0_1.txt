[1] "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

[2] "Cr/TS-1 catalyst could exhibit particular catalytic properties for the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide compared to Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

[4] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane"

[5] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction)."

[6] "Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

[7] "The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

The literature provides some insights into how different supports and reaction conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: The study compares Cr/TS-1 catalysts with different Si/Ti ratios to Cr/SiO2. Cr/TS-1 catalysts showed particular catalytic properties compared to Cr/SiO2, with Cr/TS-1(150) and Cr/TS-1(60) exhibiting higher activities than Cr/TS-1(30) and Cr/TS-1(15).

2. Activity and selectivity: Higher Si/Ti ratios in TS-1 supports led to increased activity but decreased selectivity to ethylene at higher temperatures. This suggests a trade-off between activity and selectivity.

3. Stability: The catalysts showed deactivation over time, associated with the reduction of active chromium species. However, activity could be recovered through oxygen treatment.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The presence of CO2 promoted ethylene yields, possibly through the water-gas shift reaction and by maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states. Higher oxidation state chromium species were key to higher catalytic activity.

5. CO2 partial pressure: While not directly addressed, the study mentions that CO2 plays a role in maintaining chromium in higher oxidation states and promotes the water-gas shift reaction.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity
- Maintaining catalyst stability and preventing deactivation
- Optimizing support composition to enhance performance
- Understanding and controlling the complex role of CO2 in the reaction mechanism

The study does not provide information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, which limits a comprehensive comparison of different supports.

该文献提供了一些关于不同载体和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能的见解：

1. 载体材料：研究比较了具有不同Si/Ti比的Cr/TS-1催化剂与Cr/SiO2。Cr/TS-1催化剂与Cr/SiO2相比表现出特殊的催化性能，其中Cr/TS-1(150)和Cr/TS-1(60)的活性高于Cr/TS-1(30)和Cr/TS-1(15)。

2. 活性和选择性：TS-1载体中较高的Si/Ti比导致活性增加，但在较高温度下乙烯选择性降低。这表明活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

3. 稳定性：催化剂随时间推移出现失活，这与活性铬物种的还原有关。然而，通过氧气处理可以恢复活性。

4. 机理途径：CO2的存在促进了乙烯产率，可能是通过水气转化反应和维持铬氧化物处于较高氧化态。高氧化态的铬物种是获得较高催化活性的关键。

5. CO2分压：虽然没有直接讨论，但研究提到CO2在维持铬处于较高氧化态和促进水气转化反应中起作用。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性
- 维持催化剂稳定性并防止失活
- 优化载体组成以提高性能
- 理解和控制CO2在反应机理中的复杂作用

该研究未提供关于其他载体材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2的信息，这限制了对不同载体的全面比较。
