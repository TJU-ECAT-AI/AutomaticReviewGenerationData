[1] "Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

[2] "In order to obtain better catalytic activities, some work had been carried out on the modification of Cr/SiO2 using alkali metal oxides and sulfate"

[3] "Weckhuysen et al. had ever investigated the Cr/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting that the addition of submonolayer quantities of surface titania species to silica (CabOSil) can enhance the concentration of surface polychromate species and result in comparable amounts of surface monochromate and polychromate species"

[4] "The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

[5] "On the other hand, the catalytic performances of the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts in the presence of CO2 were slightly higher than that without CO2, indicating the promoting effects of CO2 on the ethylene yields."

[6] "Water gas shift reaction could shift the dehydrogenation of ethane to product side, thus leading to the higher C2H6 conversion over these catalysts. Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

[7] "The variation of the selectivity to ethylene with the reaction temperature can be observed in Fig. 5. It was seen that with increasing reaction temperature the selectivity to ethylene decreased for all the catalysts, clearly indicating that the higher the temperature the higher the rates of secondary reactions, in which the formation of CH4 took place."

[8] "Chromium oxide with high oxidation states was considered the main species resulting in the cracking process of ethane to methane"

[9] "The catalytic stability and regeneration performance of the Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst were shown in Fig. 6. It was seen that the conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

The literature provides insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: The study focuses on TS-1 (titanosilicate-1) supports with varying Si/Ti ratios. Cr/SiO2 catalysts are mentioned as showing excellent performance. The addition of titania to silica enhances the concentration of surface polychromate species, which affects catalyst activity.

2. Activity: The order of activities for Cr/TS-1 catalysts was Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15), indicating that higher Si/Ti ratios generally lead to higher activity.

3. CO2 partial pressure: The presence of CO2 slightly improved catalytic performance compared to reactions without CO2, suggesting a promoting effect on ethylene yields. CO2 helps maintain chromium oxide in higher oxidation states and shifts the dehydrogenation reaction towards products through the water-gas shift reaction.

4. Selectivity: Selectivity to ethylene decreased with increasing reaction temperature for all catalysts due to secondary reactions forming CH4. Chromium oxide in high oxidation states was considered responsible for the cracking of ethane to methane.

5. Stability: The Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst showed deactivation over time, associated with the reduction of active chromium species. However, the catalyst could be regenerated by oxygen treatment.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Higher Si/Ti ratios in supports led to higher activity but lower selectivity to ethylene at higher temperatures.

2. Temperature optimization: Higher temperatures increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to secondary reactions.

3. Maintaining catalyst stability: Preventing the reduction of active chromium species is crucial for long-term performance.

4. CO2 utilization: While CO2 promotes ethylene yields, it also participates in side reactions like the water-gas shift reaction.

5. Optimizing chromium oxidation states: Higher oxidation states are more active but also promote undesired cracking reactions.

Further research is needed to address these challenges and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献提供了关于不同支持材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 支持材料：研究主要集中在具有不同Si/Ti比的TS-1（钛硅石-1）支持材料上。Cr/SiO2催化剂被提及表现出优异的性能。向二氧化硅中添加二氧化钛可以增加表面多铬酸盐物种的浓度，这影响了催化剂的活性。

2. 活性：Cr/TS-1催化剂的活性顺序为Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)，表明较高的Si/Ti比通常会导致较高的活性。

3. CO2分压：与无CO2的反应相比，CO2的存在略微提高了催化性能，表明对乙烯产率有促进作用。CO2有助于保持铬氧化物处于较高的氧化态，并通过水煤气变换反应将脱氢反应向产物方向移动。

4. 选择性：对于所有催化剂，随着反应温度的升高，乙烯的选择性降低，这是由于形成CH4的二次反应。高氧化态的铬氧化物被认为是导致乙烷裂解为甲烷的主要物种。

5. 稳定性：Cr/TS-1(30)催化剂随时间推移显示出失活，这与活性铬物种的还原有关。然而，该催化剂可以通过氧气处理再生。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：支持材料中较高的Si/Ti比导致较高的活性，但在较高温度下对乙烯的选择性较低。

2. 温度优化：较高的温度增加转化率但降低选择性，这是由于二次反应的发生。

3. 保持催化剂稳定性：防止活性铬物种的还原对长期性能至关重要。

4. CO2利用：虽然CO2促进乙烯产率，但它也参与水煤气变换等副反应。

5. 优化铬的氧化态：较高的氧化态活性更高，但也促进不需要的裂解反应。

需要进一步研究以解决这些挑战，并优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能。
