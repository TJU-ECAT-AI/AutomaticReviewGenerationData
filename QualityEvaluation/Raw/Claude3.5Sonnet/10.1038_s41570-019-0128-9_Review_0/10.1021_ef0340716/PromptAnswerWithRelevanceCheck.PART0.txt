<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about chromium oxide catalysts, their support materials, or reaction conditions for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on other aspects of catalytic conversion of alkanes to olefins using CO2, particularly on methane coupling to ethylene. It does not discuss chromium oxide catalysts or the specific support materials and conditions mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
