Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about chromium oxide catalysts or CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on other types of catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, such as vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, and rare earth metal oxides. It does not discuss chromium oxide catalysts or the influence of different supports and reaction conditions on their performance. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

The given literature does not contain any information about chromium oxide catalysts or their performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document primarily discusses various catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using oxygen, including vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide, nickel oxide, rare earth oxides, and alkali metal compounds. It does not mention chromium oxide catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the specific question about chromium oxide catalysts and CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation based on this document.
