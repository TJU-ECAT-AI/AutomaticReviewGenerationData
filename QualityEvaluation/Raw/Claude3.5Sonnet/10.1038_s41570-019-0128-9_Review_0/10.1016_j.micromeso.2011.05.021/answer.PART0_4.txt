[4] "The activity of the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst is ca. 4 times that of Cr/ZSM-5-L. It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chromia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate [44,52]."

Different support materials significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Mesoporous silica materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, and MSU-x have gained attention due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore sizes, and relatively high thermal stability. ZSM-5, a MFI-type zeolite, is considered a good catalyst support because of its unique properties, including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities.

The crystallite size of the support material, such as ZSM-5, can have a profound effect on catalytic activity. For example, Cr/ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (Cr/ZSM-5-S) showed about 4 times higher activity compared to Cr/ZSM-5 with larger crystal size (Cr/ZSM-5-L).

Cr(VI) species are believed to be responsible for the high catalytic activities in light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant. Specifically, Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate. However, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction, along with coke formation, contributes to catalyst deactivation.

Key challenges in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing high surface area and thermal stability of the support material
2. Controlling the crystal size of the support to maximize catalytic activity
3. Maintaining a high concentration of Cr(VI) species during the reaction
4. Minimizing coke formation and Cr(VI) reduction to prevent catalyst deactivation

The study does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or other reaction conditions on the catalyst performance. Further research would be needed to fully understand these aspects and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

不同的载体材料显著影响了二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的性能。MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15和MSU-x等介孔二氧化硅材料因其高比表面积、均匀的介孔尺寸和相对较高的热稳定性而受到关注。ZSM-5作为MFI型分子筛，因其独特的性质，包括三维微孔结构、高比表面积、高热稳定性和水热稳定性、特殊的分子筛选和形状选择性能，被认为是一种良好的催化剂载体。

载体材料的晶体尺寸，如ZSM-5，可以对催化活性产生深远的影响。例如，小晶体尺寸的Cr/ZSM-5（Cr/ZSM-5-S）显示出比大晶体尺寸的Cr/ZSM-5（Cr/ZSM-5-L）高约4倍的活性。

Cr(VI)物种被认为是在以CO2为氧化剂的轻烷烃脱氢反应中具有高催化活性的原因。具体来说，Cr(VI)单铬酸盐比Cr(III)多铬酸盐更活跃。然而，反应过程中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)，以及积碳的形成，都会导致催化剂失活。

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡载体材料的高比表面积和热稳定性
2. 控制载体的晶体尺寸以最大化催化活性
3. 在反应过程中维持高浓度的Cr(VI)物种
4. 最小化积碳形成和Cr(VI)还原，以防止催化剂失活

该研究没有提供CO2分压或其他反应条件对催化剂性能影响的具体信息。需要进一步研究才能充分理解这些方面，并优化铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能。
