[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41 [20,23], SBA-1 [24], SBA-15 [25] and MSU-x [26] due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."

[3] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, is considered to be a good catalyst or catalyst support [2,6,27,2831] because of its unique properties, including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities."

[4] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

[5] "It is obvious that the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst possesses a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than Cr/ZSM-5-L."

[6] "Hence, the significantly higher propane conversion on the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L is a consequence of a much higher content of Cr(VI) species achieved on the former catalyst as suggested from the detailed characterization results presented above."

[7] "Besides the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [44,52]."

The literature provides insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSU-x) and zeolites (ZSM-5). These materials offer advantages such as high surface areas, uniform pore sizes, and thermal stability. ZSM-5, in particular, is highlighted for its unique properties including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, and high thermal and hydrothermal stability.

2. Influence on activity and selectivity: The crystallite size of the support material significantly affects catalytic activity. For instance, Cr/ZSM-5-S (smaller crystallite size) showed higher catalytic activity compared to Cr/ZSM-5-L (larger crystallite size) due to a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species.

3. Stability and deactivation: The main challenges in stability are coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction. Both factors contribute to catalyst deactivation over time.

4. Mechanistic pathways: The presence of Cr(VI) species is crucial for high catalytic activity. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction is part of the deactivation mechanism.

5. Key challenges and trade-offs: The main challenge is maintaining a high concentration of active Cr(VI) species while minimizing coke formation and Cr(VI) reduction. The trade-off lies in balancing the support properties (e.g., crystallite size, surface area) to maximize the dispersion and stability of Cr(VI) species without compromising other desirable catalyst characteristics.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or a comprehensive comparison of all mentioned support materials (SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2). Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献为我们提供了关于不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

1. 支撑材料：研究了各种支撑材料，包括介孔二氧化硅材料（MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15、MSU-x）和沸石（ZSM-5）。这些材料具有高比表面积、均匀孔径和热稳定性等优点。特别是ZSM-5，因其独特的性质而受到关注，包括三维微孔结构、高比表面积以及高热稳定性和水热稳定性。

2. 对活性和选择性的影响：支撑材料的晶粒大小显著影响催化活性。例如，Cr/ZSM-5-S（较小晶粒尺寸）由于表面Cr(VI)物种浓度较高，表现出比Cr/ZSM-5-L（较大晶粒尺寸）更高的催化活性。

3. 稳定性和失活：稳定性方面的主要挑战是反应过程中的积碳形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)。这两个因素都会导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

4. 机理途径：Cr(VI)物种的存在对高催化活性至关重要。反应过程中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)是失活机理的一部分。

5. 关键挑战和权衡：主要挑战在于保持高浓度的活性Cr(VI)物种，同时最大程度地减少积碳形成和Cr(VI)还原。权衡在于平衡支撑材料的性质（如晶粒大小、比表面积），以最大化Cr(VI)物种的分散性和稳定性，同时不影响其他理想的催化剂特性。

文献没有提供关于二氧化碳分压影响的具体信息，也没有对所有提到的支撑材料（SiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2）进行全面比较。需要进一步研究以全面解决这些方面的问题，并优化氧化铬催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的整体性能。
