[1] "Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest. It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a rather high selectivity"

[2] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[3] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41 [20,23], SBA-1 [24], SBA-15 [25] and MSU-x [26] due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."

[4] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, is considered to be a good catalyst or catalyst support [2,6,27,2831] because of its unique properties, including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities."

[5] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

[6] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chromia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate"

The literature provides insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including mesoporous silica materials (MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, MSU-x) and zeolites (ZSM-5). These materials offer high surface areas, thermal stability, and in the case of ZSM-5, additional benefits like shape selectivity and hydrothermal stability.

2. Influence on activity and selectivity: The support material significantly affects catalyst performance. ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts show high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on catalytic activity, with smaller crystallites generally performing better.

3. Active species: Cr(VI) species, particularly Cr(VI) monochromate, are responsible for high catalytic activities in light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2. The concentration of Cr(VI) species on the support surface is crucial for catalyst performance.

4. Stability and deactivation: Catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction. Regeneration by calcination in air can restore the original activity by removing coke and reoxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI).

5. CO2 as oxidant: Using CO2 as a mild oxidant allows for high propylene selectivity and helps overcome thermodynamic limitations of the dehydrogenation reaction.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing high activity (associated with high Cr(VI) content) with stability (as Cr(VI) tends to reduce during the reaction)
- Optimizing support properties (surface area, pore structure, crystal size) to maximize dispersion and stability of active chromium species
- Developing efficient regeneration strategies to maintain long-term catalyst performance
- Balancing CO2 partial pressure to promote dehydrogenation while minimizing side reactions

Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanistic pathways and optimize the overall performance of these catalysts for industrial applications.

文献为我们提供了关于不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能的见解：

1. 支撑材料：研究了各种支撑材料，包括介孔硅材料（MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15、MSU-x）和沸石（ZSM-5）。这些材料具有高比表面积、热稳定性，而ZSM-5还具有形状选择性和水热稳定性等额外优势。

2. 对活性和选择性的影响：支撑材料显著影响催化剂性能。ZSM-5负载的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯反应中表现出高活性和选择性。ZSM-5支撑材料的晶粒尺寸对催化活性有深远影响，较小的晶粒通常表现更佳。

3. 活性物种：Cr(VI)物种，特别是Cr(VI)单铬酸盐，是CO2辅助轻烷烃脱氢反应中高催化活性的原因。支撑表面上Cr(VI)物种的浓度对催化剂性能至关重要。

4. 稳定性和失活：催化剂失活是由于反应过程中的积碳形成和Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)。通过在空气中焙烧可以去除积碳并将Cr(III)重新氧化为Cr(VI)，从而恢复原有活性。

5. CO2作为氧化剂：使用CO2作为温和氧化剂可以获得高丙烯选择性，并有助于克服脱氢反应的热力学限制。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡高活性（与高Cr(VI)含量相关）和稳定性（因为Cr(VI)在反应中tends降还原）
- 优化支撑材料的性质（比表面积、孔结构、晶粒尺寸）以最大化活性铬物种的分散性和稳定性
- 开发高效的再生策略以维持催化剂的长期性能
- 平衡CO2分压，以促进脱氢反应同时最小化副反应

需要进一步研究以充分理解反应机理路径，并优化这些催化剂在工业应用中的整体性能。
