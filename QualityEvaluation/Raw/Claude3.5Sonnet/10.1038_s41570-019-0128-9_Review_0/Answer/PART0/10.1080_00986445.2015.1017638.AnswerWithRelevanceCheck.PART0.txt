          [1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two-step pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

[6] "Basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient because they form carbonate species in the presence of carbon dioxide (Rangel et al., 2012). Metal oxides of moderate basicity are required and must participate in the redox process with the reduction of carbon dioxide (Krylov et al., 1995)."

[7] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas"

[8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

          The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how the specific support materials mentioned (SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Activity and selectivity: Chromium-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

2. Reaction mechanism: Chromium oxide catalysts (Cr2O3, Cr2O5) follow a one-step mechanism, where CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle. This differs from non-redox oxides like Ga2O3, which follow a two-step pathway.

3. Support material considerations: 
   - Acidic supports are undesirable as they promote cracking and coke formation.
   - Basic oxides are favored due to the acidic nature of CO2.
   - However, highly basic supports (alkali and alkaline earth oxides) are inefficient due to carbonate formation.
   - Metal oxides with moderate basicity that can participate in the redox process are preferred.

4. Stability: Major challenges include:
   - Rapid deactivation due to coke formation.
   - Reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in chromium-based catalysts.

5. CO2 partial pressure: While not explicitly discussed, it likely influences:
   - The oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rate.
   - Coke removal efficiency.
   - Potential carbonate formation on certain supports.

6. Side reactions: Undesired reactions like dry reforming of propane can occur depending on system conditions.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing activity and stability.
2. Optimizing support basicity to prevent carbonate formation while promoting the redox process.
3. Minimizing coke formation and enhancing coke removal without compromising selectivity.
4. Maintaining the oxidation state of chromium.
5. Controlling undesired side reactions.

Further research is needed to understand the specific effects of different support materials and to optimize reaction conditions for chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          文献并未提供关于所提及的特定支撑材料（SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2）如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的全面信息。然而，可以得出一些一般性见解：

1. 活性和选择性：铬基催化剂是丙烷二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂之一。

2. 反应机理：铬氧化物催化剂（Cr2O3、Cr2O5）遵循一步机理，其中二氧化碳在氧化还原循环中充当氧化剂。这与非氧化还原氧化物（如Ga2O3）遵循的两步途径不同。

3. 支撑材料考虑：
   - 酸性支撑材料不受欢迎，因为它们促进裂解和积碳。
   - 由于CO2的酸性，碱性氧化物受到青睐。
   - 然而，高度碱性的支撑材料（碱金属和碱土金属氧化物）由于形成碳酸盐而效率低下。
   - 首选能够参与氧化还原过程的中等碱性金属氧化物。

4. 稳定性：主要挑战包括：
   - 由于积碳导致的快速失活。
   - 铬基催化剂中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)。

5. CO2分压：虽然没有明确讨论，但可能影响：
   - 氧化脱氢反应速率。
   - 积碳去除效率。
   - 在某些支撑材料上可能形成碳酸盐。

6. 副反应：根据系统条件，可能发生不希望的反应，如丙烷的干重整。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡活性和稳定性。
2. 优化支撑材料的碱度，以防止碳酸盐形成的同时促进氧化还原过程。
3. 最小化积碳形成并增强积碳去除，同时不影响选择性。
4. 维持铬的氧化态。
5. 控制不希望的副反应。

需要进一步研究以了解不同支撑材料的具体影响，并优化二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的反应条件。
