          "Several factors influence the concentration of these species on the surface of supports. They include the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and properties of the support (e.g. isoelectric point, specific surface area)."

"Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties."

"CO2 participates in the process as an oxidant and allows for regeneration of the reduced chromium sites generated during the dehydrogenation of propane"

"Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed."

"The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species."

"Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."

"Because of the fact that in reaction conditions CO2 is reduced to CO, together with hydrogen (synthesis gas) or separately, it has many applications in the chemical industry."

"In addition, it is known that the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS) can proceed over redox and nonredox Cr sites [18,23,39]. This reaction enhances the yield of propene by consumption of hydrogen which is produced in the nonoxidative pathway (in equilibrium propane dehydrogenation, Scheme 1)."

          The activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by various support materials and reaction conditions:

1. Support materials: High-surface-area mesoporous supports (e.g., SBA-1, MCM-41, SBA-15) provide more adsorption sites to stabilize redox Cr species, leading to better catalytic performance. These supports allow for higher Cr dispersion and delayed formation of less active Cr2O3 crystallites compared to traditional supports.

2. Preparation methods: One-pot and post-synthesis techniques affect the pore architecture and Cr distribution. Factors like Cr precursor type, calcination temperature, and Cr content influence the concentration and nature of active species on the support surface.

3. CO2 partial pressure: Higher CO2 concentration enhances propene yield and catalyst stability. CO2 acts as a weak oxidizing agent, helping to regenerate reduced chromium sites and shift the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation products.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Various redox cycles (Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+) have been proposed. High-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+) are crucial for CO2 activation in the oxidative pathway.

5. Activity and selectivity: The activity depends on the concentration of high-valent redox Cr species. Selectivity to propene is generally high (85-93%) for chromium catalysts on mesoporous supports.

6. Stability: CO2 improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation. However, higher CO2 concentrations can lead to faster catalyst darkening due to increased propene reactivity.

7. Side reactions: The reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) occurs over both redox and non-redox Cr sites, enhancing propene yield by consuming hydrogen produced in the non-oxidative pathway.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing Cr loading to maximize active species while avoiding formation of less active Cr2O3 crystallites.
2. Optimizing CO2 concentration to enhance propene yield and stability without accelerating catalyst deactivation.
3. Developing supports that provide high surface area and thermal stability while maintaining accessibility to active sites.
4. Understanding and controlling the complex redox mechanisms to improve catalyst design.
5. Minimizing irreversible deactivation caused by loss of redox Cr species or pore structure collapse during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.
6. Balancing activity/selectivity with long-term stability, as conditions promoting high conversion may also accelerate deactivation.

          在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，各种载体材料和反应条件影响铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 载体材料：高比表面积的介孔载体（如SBA-1、MCM-41、SBA-15）提供更多吸附位点来稳定氧化还原铬物种，从而带来更好的催化性能。与传统载体相比，这些载体允许更高的铬分散度，并延迟了活性较低的Cr2O3晶体的形成。

2. 制备方法：一锅法和后合成技术影响孔道结构和铬分布。铬前驱体类型、焙烧温度和铬含量等因素影响载体表面活性物种的浓度和性质。

3. CO2分压：较高的CO2浓度可提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。CO2作为弱氧化剂，有助于再生还原的铬位点，并将平衡向脱氢产物方向移动。

4. 反应机理：已提出多种氧化还原循环（Cr6+/Cr3+、Cr5+/Cr3+、Cr3+/Cr2+）。高价态氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+）对CO2在氧化途径中的活化至关重要。

5. 活性和选择性：活性取决于高价态氧化还原铬物种的浓度。对于介孔载体上的铬催化剂，丙烯的选择性通常很高（85-93%）。

6. 稳定性：CO2通过抑制积碳形成来提高催化剂稳定性。然而，较高的CO2浓度可能由于丙烯反应性增加而导致催化剂变黑速度加快。

7. 副反应：逆水气变换反应（RWGS）在氧化还原和非氧化还原铬位点上进行，通过消耗非氧化途径产生的氢气来增加丙烯产率。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡铬负载量，以最大化活性物种，同时避免形成活性较低的Cr2O3晶体。
2. 优化CO2浓度，以提高丙烯产率和稳定性，同时不加速催化剂失活。
3. 开发提供高比表面积和热稳定性的载体，同时保持活性位点的可接近性。
4. 理解和控制复杂的氧化还原机制，以改进催化剂设计。
5. 最小化在多次反应-再生循环过程中由于氧化还原铬物种损失或孔结构崩塌导致的不可逆失活。
6. 平衡活性/选择性和长期稳定性，因为促进高转化率的条件也可能加速失活。
