          [1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "It was shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

[4] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."

[5] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

          The literature primarily focuses on ZrO2 as a support material for Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, without providing comprehensive information on other support materials. Key findings include:

1. Support material: ZrO2 with specific properties (90 m2/g surface area) was used as a support for Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. Reaction conditions:
   - CO2 partial pressure: Increasing the partial pressure of reactants (including CO2) improved C3H6 selectivity while inhibiting C3H8 conversion.
   - C3H8 partial pressure: Higher C3H8 partial pressure enhanced C3H6 selectivity but reduced C3H8 conversion.
   - Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV): Increasing GHSV decreased C3H8 conversion but did not significantly improve C3H6 selectivity.

3. Mechanistic insights:
   - Competitive adsorption between C3H6 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface plays a role in inhibiting further cracking of C3H6.
   - CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium without significantly gasifying carbon deposits.

4. Challenges and trade-offs:
   - Balancing C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity is a key challenge.
   - Increasing reactant partial pressure improves selectivity but decreases conversion.
   - Increasing GHSV decreases conversion without significantly improving selectivity.

The study does not provide direct comparisons with other support materials or detailed mechanistic pathways for various supports. More research would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding the influence of different support materials on catalyst performance.

          该文献主要关注ZrO2作为CO2氧化脱氢反应中Cr2O3催化剂的载体材料，但没有提供其他载体材料的全面信息。主要发现包括：

1. 载体材料：使用了具有特定性质（90 m2/g比表面积）的ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的载体。

2. 反应条件：
   - CO2分压：增加反应物（包括CO2）的分压提高了C3H6的选择性，同时抑制了C3H8的转化率。
   - C3H8分压：更高的C3H8分压增强了C3H6的选择性，但降低了C3H8的转化率。
   - 气体空速（GHSV）：增加GHSV降低了C3H8的转化率，但并未显著提高C3H6的选择性。

3. 机理洞察：
   - C3H6和C3H8在催化剂表面的竞争性吸附在抑制C3H6进一步裂解中起作用。
   - CO2作为温和的氧化剂，在不显著气化碳沉积的情况下移动平衡。

4. 挑战和权衡：
   - 平衡C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性是一个关键挑战。
   - 增加反应物分压提高了选择性但降低了转化率。
   - 增加GHSV降低了转化率但并未显著提高选择性。

该研究没有提供与其他载体材料的直接比较或各种载体的详细机理途径。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答问题中涉及的不同载体材料对催化剂性能影响的范围。
