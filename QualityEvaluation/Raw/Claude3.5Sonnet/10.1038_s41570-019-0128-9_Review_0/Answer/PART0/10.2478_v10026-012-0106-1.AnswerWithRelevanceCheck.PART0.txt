          [1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[5] "The low ratio of CO/H2 suitable for a direct application of synthesis gas in chemical processes can be obtained over Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst using feed gas with low CO2 concentration."

          The support material significantly influences the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: Cr-O/SiO2 shows a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, while Cr-O/Al2O3 experiences a dramatic decrease in propene yield with even small amounts of CO2 in the feed. For both catalysts, propane conversion and propene yield increase with reaction temperature, but propene selectivity decreases.

2. Stability: The provided information does not directly address catalyst stability for different supports.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The nature of the support affects CO2 adsorption. On γ-Al2O3, CO2 adsorption reduces propane adsorption, leading to decreased conversion. SiO2 does not show this inhibitory effect.

4. Reaction conditions: Temperature affects conversion, yield, and selectivity. CO2 partial pressure impacts the CO/H2 ratio in the product. Lower CO2 concentrations in the feed gas produce a more favorable CO/H2 ratio for Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Balancing propene yield and selectivity with reaction temperature
- Optimizing CO2 concentration to promote propene yield without negatively impacting catalyst performance
- Selecting appropriate support materials that enhance rather than inhibit the desired reactions
- Achieving the right CO/H2 ratio for downstream applications while maintaining high propene production

The study suggests that Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts with low CO2 concentrations in the feed gas offer a promising direction for optimizing overall performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the information provided does not cover MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, indicating a need for further research on these materials.

          支持材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 活性和选择性：Cr-O/SiO2显示出CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用，而Cr-O/Al2O3即使在进料中添加少量CO2也会导致丙烯产率大幅下降。对于两种催化剂，丙烷转化率和丙烯产率随反应温度升高而增加，但丙烯选择性降低。

2. 稳定性：提供的信息没有直接涉及不同支持材料的催化剂稳定性。

3. 机理途径：支持材料的性质影响CO2的吸附。在γ-Al2O3上，CO2的吸附减少了丙烷的吸附，导致转化率降低。SiO2没有显示这种抑制效应。

4. 反应条件：温度影响转化率、产率和选择性。CO2分压影响产物中的CO/H2比率。进料气中较低的CO2浓度为Cr-O/SiO2催化剂产生更有利的CO/H2比率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡反应温度与丙烯产率和选择性
- 优化CO2浓度以促进丙烯产率，同时不对催化剂性能产生负面影响
- 选择适当的支持材料，增强而不是抑制所需反应
- 在保持高丙烯产量的同时，为下游应用获得适当的CO/H2比率

研究表明，在进料气中使用低CO2浓度的Cr-O/SiO2催化剂为优化CO2氧化脱氢反应的整体性能提供了一个有前景的方向。然而，提供的信息并未涵盖MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2支持材料，表明需要对这些材料进行进一步研究。
