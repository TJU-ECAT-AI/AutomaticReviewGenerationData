[1] "Several metal oxides have been used as catalysts [110,111], and the most effective catalysts with high ethane conversion (>60%) and ethylene selectivity (>90%) contained Cr or Ce elements."

          [2] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant can overcome the high energy consumption for the endothermic pyrolysis and prevents deep oxidation, but unfortunately, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 remains an endothermic reaction and requires addition of heat for its activation [102,107]. However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures."

          [3] "However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures. This drawback makes the use of CO2 as a selective oxidant well suited for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures."

[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[5] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[6] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[1] "Cr2O3 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

          [2] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

          [3] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported, but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."

          [4] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3."

[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

[1] "Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar [13]."

[2] "Ge et al. have investigated the influence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with oxygen over VMgO catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products."

[3] "The poor performance of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 could be due to the lack of reoxidation efficiency of the catalyst surface or strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface [14,15]."

[4] "The high activity of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acidbase bifunctionality and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]."

[5] "CeO2V2O5 combination catalyst also showed a remarkably high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 [29]."

[6] "The presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions namely, CO2 activation [27], low-temperature watergas shift reaction [28], and so on."

[7] "The unique oxygen storage/release capacity and redox properties of CeO2 are known to suppress the deactivation of the catalysts under rigorous reaction conditions."

[8] "The TPR analysis clearly exemplified that the reduction peaks of both vanadium oxide supported samples reduced at lower temperatures compared to the bulk vanadium oxide."

[9] "The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2."

[10] "The CZ support is a well-known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility [44]. The existence of Ce4+/Ce3+ was also confirmed by XPS."

"On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. C2H4 selectivity was 61.0% and C2H4 yield = 44.5%. A similar catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed a much lesser selectivity."

"The most active and selective catalyst for C2H4 production was found to be 5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2. Further increase of selectivity was observed upon additional modification by alkali metal oxides. The 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst shows at 830C C2H6 conversion 82.6%, CO2 conversion 55.7% and C2H4 selectivity 76.8%."

"The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide is described by the equation (10)
KiPc2h6KoPco2
rc2h4 = KoxPco2 + KreaPco"

"Basic sites of moderate basicity are necessary for CO2 absorption and Cr3+ reoxidation."

[1] "Carbon dioxide is considered as a mild or an unconventional oxidant. Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been investigated by several groups, and rather high selectivity to corresponding olefins was reported."

[2] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O"

[3] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the chemical industry. Because of the tri-dimensional micro-pore structure and large specific surface area, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support [8,9]."

[4] "Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."

[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalyst stability is also enhanced by the introduction of CO2."

[6] "The negative effect of CO2 displacement on the reaction is not evident at a low concentration of CO2, and the initial ethane conversion increases with increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio. When the CO2 concentration increases, this negative effect becomes dominant, and the ethane conversion begins to decrease."

[7] "Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface."

[8] "The stability was improved with further increasing in the CO2 partial pressure. The Boudouard reaction (i.e. C + CO2 ! 2CO), which removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves the stability of the catalyst, was observed over Ga2O3-loaded catalysts"

[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "It has been indicated that CO2 increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "In order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]."

[6] "The addition of ZrO2 can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the catalysts [23]."

[7] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time [16,17]."

[1] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

[5] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."

[6] "The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."

[7] "The conversion of ethane increases with increase in temperature irrespective of the oxidizing agent used in the reaction."

[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[5] "The low ratio of CO/H2 suitable for a direct application of synthesis gas in chemical processes can be obtained over Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst using feed gas with low CO2 concentration."

[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."

[2] "In order to obtain better catalytic activity, some efforts had been focused on the supports of chromium-based catalysts using TS-1 [11] and MSU-x [12]."

[3] "Compared to other Cr2O3-based nano-composite catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high catalytic activity with low selectivity to ethylene in our prior research [15]."

[4] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."

[5] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."

[6] "Among the prepared catalysts, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited not only high ethylene selectivity, but also relatively high ethane and CO2 conversions."

[7] "The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

[8] "Up to now, Fe-Mn/Si-2 [1], La2O3/-Al2O3 [2], Mo2C/SiO2 [4], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [5], K-Cr-Mn/SiO2 [6], Cr/SiO2 [7], Ga/TiO2 [8], CeO2-based [9] and metal oxides [10] catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant."

[9] "The reactant stream consisting of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide and 20% Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 650 C."

[10] "Catalytic conversion increased and ethylene selectivity decreased with elevation of reaction temperature."

[11] "The characterization indicated that weak acid sites are involved in ethane activation, and strong acidbase pairs promote the reforming and cracking reactions."

[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The ability of ZrO2 support to activate CO2 over basic sites improves the activity in the ODH process."

[6] "The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small amount of reducible Cr V/VI."

[7] "Thus, the control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."

          [2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

          [3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[5] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion"

[6] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[7] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

[1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "It was shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

[4] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."

[5] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."

[2] "The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support."

[3] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."

[4] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

[5] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."

[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

[1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

[5] "The role of CO2 is to generate oxygen species that take part in the formation of ethene as well as to suppress carbon deposition."

[6] "5%Cr/TS-1 showed a consistent conversion of CO2. Interestingly, selectivity to CO significantly exceeded 100%. This could happen probably due to some deep oxidation of hydrocarbons (ethane, ethene) to CO resulting in an apparent selectivity to CO higher than 100%."

[1] "Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparalleled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, are expected to be new promising catalyst support"

[2] "Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study"

[3] "The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

[4] "Conversion of propane increased as the reaction temperature was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased."

[5] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[6] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[7] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[8] "The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min."

[9] "Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table. The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41 [20,23], SBA-1 [24], SBA-15 [25] and MSU-x [26] due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."

[3] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, is considered to be a good catalyst or catalyst support [2,6,27,2831] because of its unique properties, including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities."

[4] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

[5] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane) and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [13,14,20,21] or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse watergas shift reaction [1719,22]."

[6] "Catalytic tests show that the chromia catalyst supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (ca. 400 nm) exhibits a good catalytic performance, which is much more active than that supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size (ca. 2 lm)."

[7] "A high number of Cr(VI) species in the calcined catalyst is crucial for its high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2."

[8] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chromia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate"

[9] "Besides the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [44,52]."

[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."

[2] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."

[3] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

[4] "Propane conversion over Ga2O3/TiO2 initially increased with the CO2/C3H8 ratio, reaching its peak when the CO2/C3H8 ratio equaled 2, then decreased with further increases in the CO2/C3H8 ratio."

[5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on many catalysts, including silica-supported Cr2O3"

[1] "Wang et al. studied Cr2O3 supported on various supports for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 and found the following order of activity (Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2)."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. studied the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/TiO2 catalysts. They concluded that the positive effect of CO2 on the rate of dehydrogenation is due to its ability to reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst and to assist in the rapid desorption of the product from the surface."

[3] "Ohishi et al. and Takehira et al. studied Cr-MCM-41 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propylene. They studied the Cr species on the MCM-41 mesoporous silica and concluded that a redox process involving carbon dioxide forming Cr6+ species is involved in the dehydrogenation."

[4] "In our previous work, we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."

[5] "The CO2 co-feed gas was more effective than argon for accelerating the dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity due to the activity of CO2 to suppress coke formation or remove coke from the catalyst."

[6] "An important role of CO2 is removing carbon by oxidation from the surface of the Cr/H-ZSM-5."

[1] "To date, in the field of PDH by CO2, Cr2O3-, V2O5- and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."

[2] "For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14]."

[3] "However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition."

[4] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."

[5] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."

[6] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."

[7] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

[8] "To circumvent this problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the most important green-house gases, has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes, including coupling of methane, dehydrogenation (DH) of ethylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene, propane, or iso-butane"

[9] "In the DH reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst"

          "Application of suitable catalyst can help to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of CO2 activation."
          "Exploitation of the soft oxidant property of CO2 with the help of suitable catalyst in commercial scale can give a boost to polymer and fuel economy."
          "Participation of catalyst in CO2 activation: favourable factors"

[1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

[6] "The H2 consumption peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to the higher dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "CO2 co-feed gas accelerated dehydrogenation and maintained the catalytic activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the catalyst surface."

"Several factors influence the concentration of these species on the surface of supports. They include the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and properties of the support (e.g. isoelectric point, specific surface area)."

"Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties."

"CO2 participates in the process as an oxidant and allows for regeneration of the reduced chromium sites generated during the dehydrogenation of propane"

"Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed."

"The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species."

"Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."

"Because of the fact that in reaction conditions CO2 is reduced to CO, together with hydrogen (synthesis gas) or separately, it has many applications in the chemical industry."

"In addition, it is known that the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS) can proceed over redox and nonredox Cr sites [18,23,39]. This reaction enhances the yield of propene by consumption of hydrogen which is produced in the nonoxidative pathway (in equilibrium propane dehydrogenation, Scheme 1)."

[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of carbon monoxide formation increased together with that of propene, while the rate of hydrogen formation stayed at almost constant value, with increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6"

[6] "Cr/Cab-O-Sil contains mainly polymeric chromates together with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 as a minor phase."

[7] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was recovered as seen by the fact that C3H8 conversion returned to the original value (Fig. 9, c), but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all (Fig. 9, c), after the treatment with O2."

[8] "Cr/SiO2 showed an insufficient but detectable recovery of the activity after the O2 treatment"

[1] "Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield."

[2] "The distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts, was influenced by the nature of supports."

[3] "It is well known that the dispersion, the oxidation state and the structural features of supported species may strongly depend on the support."

[4] "Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction. It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts."

[5] "The catalysts were prone to deactivate in the reaction but could be partially regenerated by oxygen."

[6] "It has been generally recognized that the surface chromium species strongly depends on the surface density of chromium oxide [27]."

[7] "When Cr loading was 8 wt%, the diffraction peaks of crystalline α-Cr2O3 appeared in the XRD patterns (Fig. 5B). The color of catalysts changes from yellow to green with the growing of Cr content is in accordance with above phenomenon, indicating the formation of Cr(III) at high loadings of Cr."

[8] "Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some degree."

[9] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst. Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

[10] "Two kinds of catalysts showed an insufficient but adequately detectable recovery of the activity after treated with air at 700 8C. It is noted that the activity of Cr-MSU-1 got more recovery from the air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1."

"Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"Cr/TS-1 catalyst could exhibit particular catalytic properties for the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide compared to Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

"Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction)."

"Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

"The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

1. "Various promoters have been used to further improve catalytic performance. In our prior work, (14-16) it has been demonstrated that Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity."

2. "The catalysts, which were prepared by the coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation methods, have the same loadings of Fe and Cr (5 wt % of Fe and 10 wt % of Cr)."

3. "The ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (C) dramatically drops from 50% to 38% over the time on stream. However, the ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) varies little."

4. "The ethylene selectivity over FeCr/ZrO2 (C) is higher than that over FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) while its CO2 conversion is lower."

5. "Cr3+ ions are considered the active species for dehydrogenation, with the argument that only Cr3+ species has been detected by XPS on the used catalysts and there is no obvious deactivation of FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) catalysts in the stability test."

6. "Fe3O4 has an inverse spinal structure, which can readily undergo rapid electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The electron hopping between Fe3+ and Fe2+ can facilitate the proceeding of reaction 3."

7. "Carbon dioxide has recently been employed as a mild oxidant for ODE instead of oxygen."

8. "A variety of catalysts have been examined in ODE with carbon dioxide as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have proven to be very effective catalysts for this reaction."

9. "The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g of the catalyst and 1 g of quartz sand at atmospheric pressure. The reactant stream consisting of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide, and 20% Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The reaction temperature was controlled at 650 °C."

10. "Coke deposition is the main reason of the deactivation of the catalysts."

[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[5] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[6] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

[7] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."

"Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

"Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

"The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

"The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

"Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

"Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

"The effect of the mole ratio of carbon dioxide to ethylbenzene over Li, Na and K showed a strong increase in the yield of styrene with an increase in the amount of CO2 in the reaction mixture until the CO2/ethyl benzene ratio was 10. A further increase in the ratio above this value decreased the yield."

[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to be active catalysts for hydrogenation, isomerization of olefins, and dehydrogenation of alkanes"

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[3] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst. Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, whereas Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene."

[4] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "The acidbase property of supports plays an important role in Cr anchorage and dispersion on oxide supports"

[6] "It is believed that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

[7] "The effect of Cr2O3 loading in Cr2O3/SiO2 system on catalytic activity was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 1. As seen, ethane conversion increases as Cr2O3 content increases and it reaches the maximum value at 8 wt.% Cr2O3."

[8] "The catalytic stability of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated at 650°C. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of 5 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 and 8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts as a function of time. It is seen that the two catalysts exhibit deactivation at different rates, which can be ascribed to the carbon deposition."

[9] "The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation due to the introduction of CO2 and its decomposition to produce surface oxygen species will be the parallel reaction paths in the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide."

[1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two-step pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

[6] "Basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient because they form carbonate species in the presence of carbon dioxide (Rangel et al., 2012). Metal oxides of moderate basicity are required and must participate in the redox process with the reduction of carbon dioxide (Krylov et al., 1995)."

[7] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas"

[8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[1] "Several metal oxides have been used as catalysts [110,111], and the most effective catalysts with high ethane conversion (>60%) and ethylene selectivity (>90%) contained Cr or Ce elements."

          [2] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant can overcome the high energy consumption for the endothermic pyrolysis and prevents deep oxidation, but unfortunately, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 remains an endothermic reaction and requires addition of heat for its activation [102,107]. However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures."

          [3] "However, the low chemical reactivity of CO2 leads to a difficult activation, which usually results in higher reaction temperatures. This drawback makes the use of CO2 as a selective oxidant well suited for the activation of ethane, which also requires high temperatures."

[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[5] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[6] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[1] "Cr2O3 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

          [2] "The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar."

          [3] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported, but the increase in the propene yield was only 2.6% at 550 C."

          [4] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic oxide such as MgO or La2O3."

[1] "Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11,12] and Ga2O3-based [1315] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity."

[2] "The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 2030% and 8090%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17,18]."

[3] "In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]."

[4] "The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19]."

[1] "Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar [13]."

[2] "Ge et al. have investigated the influence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with oxygen over VMgO catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products."

[3] "The poor performance of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 could be due to the lack of reoxidation efficiency of the catalyst surface or strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface [14,15]."

[4] "The high activity of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acidbase bifunctionality and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]."

[5] "CeO2V2O5 combination catalyst also showed a remarkably high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 [29]."

[6] "The presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions namely, CO2 activation [27], low-temperature watergas shift reaction [28], and so on."

[7] "The unique oxygen storage/release capacity and redox properties of CeO2 are known to suppress the deactivation of the catalysts under rigorous reaction conditions."

[8] "The TPR analysis clearly exemplified that the reduction peaks of both vanadium oxide supported samples reduced at lower temperatures compared to the bulk vanadium oxide."

[9] "The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2."

[10] "The CZ support is a well-known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility [44]. The existence of Ce4+/Ce3+ was also confirmed by XPS."

"On the 17%MnO/SiO2 catalyst C2H6 conversion of 73.1% and CO2 conversion of 49.0% were observed at 800C, V = 3600 hour-1 and CO:C2H6 = 1.5. C2H4 selectivity was 61.0% and C2H4 yield = 44.5%. A similar catalyst supported on Al2O3 displayed a much lesser selectivity."

"The most active and selective catalyst for C2H4 production was found to be 5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2. Further increase of selectivity was observed upon additional modification by alkali metal oxides. The 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst shows at 830C C2H6 conversion 82.6%, CO2 conversion 55.7% and C2H4 selectivity 76.8%."

"The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide is described by the equation (10)
KiPc2h6KoPco2
rc2h4 = KoxPco2 + KreaPco"

"Basic sites of moderate basicity are necessary for CO2 absorption and Cr3+ reoxidation."

[1] "Carbon dioxide is considered as a mild or an unconventional oxidant. Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been investigated by several groups, and rather high selectivity to corresponding olefins was reported."

[2] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O"

[3] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the chemical industry. Because of the tri-dimensional micro-pore structure and large specific surface area, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support [8,9]."

[4] "Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."

[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalyst stability is also enhanced by the introduction of CO2."

[6] "The negative effect of CO2 displacement on the reaction is not evident at a low concentration of CO2, and the initial ethane conversion increases with increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio. When the CO2 concentration increases, this negative effect becomes dominant, and the ethane conversion begins to decrease."

[7] "Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface."

[8] "The stability was improved with further increasing in the CO2 partial pressure. The Boudouard reaction (i.e. C + CO2 ! 2CO), which removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves the stability of the catalyst, was observed over Ga2O3-loaded catalysts"

[1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "It has been indicated that CO2 increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "In order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]."

[6] "The addition of ZrO2 can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the catalysts [23]."

[7] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time [16,17]."

[1] "Cr2O3/ZSM-5 [13], Cr2O3/Al2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2 [21], modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites [4], Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monoliths [17], CrO, CrVO oxide [7], Ga incorporated Cr2O3 supported on ZSM-5 and silicalite [18] catalysts have been tried for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is seen to exhibit its best catalytic activity with 32 % ethane and 21 % CO2 conversions and an ethylene selectivity of 46 %. Cr2O3/ZrO2 shows higher activity (42 % ethane conversion) but with a decreased ethylene selectivity (36 %)."

[3] "The variation in the ODE activity of the chromia-based catalysts is due to the difference in their redox property as revealed by Wang et al. [21]. It is also reported that both Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions have a strong role to play in the catalytic reaction as active sites [6, 21]."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant offers higher ethylene selectivity compared to O2. The reduction in ethylene selectivity during ODE with O2 could be due to secondary oxidation of ethylene."

[5] "CO2 is now considered as a mild oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its advantages in containing the exothermicity of the reaction, its role as a diluent in offering high equilibrium conversion, improving the selectivity to ethylene, reducing coke formation and maintaining longer catalyst life time [13, 23]."

[6] "The higher basicity of Al2O3 than that of ZrO2 may be the reason for decrease in the activity."

[7] "The conversion of ethane increases with increase in temperature irrespective of the oxidizing agent used in the reaction."

[1] "Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion and propene yield increase with the increase of reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases."

[2] "Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly."

[3] "It is clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in propane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2 in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene."

[4] "The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfavorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to reduced propane conversion."

[5] "The low ratio of CO/H2 suitable for a direct application of synthesis gas in chemical processes can be obtained over Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst using feed gas with low CO2 concentration."

[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."

[2] "In order to obtain better catalytic activity, some efforts had been focused on the supports of chromium-based catalysts using TS-1 [11] and MSU-x [12]."

[3] "Compared to other Cr2O3-based nano-composite catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high catalytic activity with low selectivity to ethylene in our prior research [15]."

[4] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."

[5] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."

[6] "Among the prepared catalysts, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited not only high ethylene selectivity, but also relatively high ethane and CO2 conversions."

[7] "The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

[8] "Up to now, Fe-Mn/Si-2 [1], La2O3/-Al2O3 [2], Mo2C/SiO2 [4], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [5], K-Cr-Mn/SiO2 [6], Cr/SiO2 [7], Ga/TiO2 [8], CeO2-based [9] and metal oxides [10] catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant."

[9] "The reactant stream consisting of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide and 20% Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 650 C."

[10] "Catalytic conversion increased and ethylene selectivity decreased with elevation of reaction temperature."

[11] "The characterization indicated that weak acid sites are involved in ethane activation, and strong acidbase pairs promote the reforming and cracking reactions."

[1] "The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability of CrOx-containing catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and CexZr(1-x)O2 has been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant (ODH-CO2)."

[2] "The catalysts CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rates, but the reaction followed different pathways on each: on CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst depend on both chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acid-base and red-ox properties."

[4] "High ratio of CO2/C2H6 (2 or above) is required to shift the equilibrium and improve the ethylene yield"

[5] "The ability of ZrO2 support to activate CO2 over basic sites improves the activity in the ODH process."

[6] "The relatively low activity of CrOx/CeO2 catalyst is connected with the formation of α-Cr2O3 phase (low activity in DDH) and a small amount of reducible Cr V/VI."

[7] "Thus, the control of red-ox properties of the support to provide stabilization of CrV/VI species on its surface is a key factor determining the activity of chromia catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant."

[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."

          [2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

          [3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[5] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion"

[6] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[7] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

[1] "To prepare the 5wt% of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst by precipitation method, ZrO2 (Alfa-Aesor, 90m2/g, 99%) was pre-heated at 600 for 6 hour before being grinded and sieved to 125μm in particle size."

[2] "The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "It was shown that the increase of C3H8 partial pressure is highly beneficial for the enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. Meanwhile, the C3H8 conversion was sacrificed due to the competitive adsorption between the produced C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules, which was the major reason for the inhibition of further cracking of C3H6."

[4] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."

[5] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV. However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."

[2] "The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support."

[3] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."

[4] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

[5] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."

[1] "Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction."

[2] "However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used."

[3] "When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours)."

[4] "Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%)."

[1] "Recently, attempts have been made to utilize less reactive carbon dioxide as an oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethene [14, 15]. The advantage of utilization of the green house gas CO2 as oxidant is that it might lead to higher selectivity at elevated temperatures because it is less prone to supply oxygen species for reaction."

[2] "Up to date, Mo2C/SiO2 [17], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [18, 19], Cr/TS-1[20], Cr/SiO2 [15], Ga/TiO2 [21], and CeO2-based oxides [22] have been used in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most active for this reaction."

[3] "Chromium based catalysts supported on TS-1 or Cr/H-ZSM-5 show best performance, but their reaction temperature is limited to about 650 C, since at higher temperatures selectivity decreases significantly [20]."

[4] "The dependence of ethane conversion and selectivity to ethene on the ratio CO2/C2H6 is shown in Fig. 5. It shows that in the absence of CO2 the selectivity was 78% and it increased to >97% with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio up to 1.5. Further increase in CO2 did not show significant effect."

[5] "The role of CO2 is to generate oxygen species that take part in the formation of ethene as well as to suppress carbon deposition."

[6] "5%Cr/TS-1 showed a consistent conversion of CO2. Interestingly, selectivity to CO significantly exceeded 100%. This could happen probably due to some deep oxidation of hydrocarbons (ethane, ethene) to CO resulting in an apparent selectivity to CO higher than 100%."

[1] "Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparalleled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, are expected to be new promising catalyst support"

[2] "Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study"

[3] "The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

[4] "Conversion of propane increased as the reaction temperature was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased."

[5] "The conversion of propane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propylene still acquire elevation."

[6] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%."

[7] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

[8] "The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min."

[9] "Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table. The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."

[2] "Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM-41 [20,23], SBA-1 [24], SBA-15 [25] and MSU-x [26] due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high thermal stability."

[3] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, is considered to be a good catalyst or catalyst support [2,6,27,2831] because of its unique properties, including tridimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities."

[4] "Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity."

[5] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane) and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [13,14,20,21] or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse watergas shift reaction [1719,22]."

[6] "Catalytic tests show that the chromia catalyst supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (ca. 400 nm) exhibits a good catalytic performance, which is much more active than that supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size (ca. 2 lm)."

[7] "A high number of Cr(VI) species in the calcined catalyst is crucial for its high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2."

[8] "It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chromia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate"

[9] "Besides the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [44,52]."

[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."

[2] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."

[3] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

[4] "Propane conversion over Ga2O3/TiO2 initially increased with the CO2/C3H8 ratio, reaching its peak when the CO2/C3H8 ratio equaled 2, then decreased with further increases in the CO2/C3H8 ratio."

[5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on many catalysts, including silica-supported Cr2O3"

[1] "Wang et al. studied Cr2O3 supported on various supports for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 and found the following order of activity (Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2)."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. studied the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/TiO2 catalysts. They concluded that the positive effect of CO2 on the rate of dehydrogenation is due to its ability to reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst and to assist in the rapid desorption of the product from the surface."

[3] "Ohishi et al. and Takehira et al. studied Cr-MCM-41 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propylene. They studied the Cr species on the MCM-41 mesoporous silica and concluded that a redox process involving carbon dioxide forming Cr6+ species is involved in the dehydrogenation."

[4] "In our previous work, we found that Cr catalysts supported on a high-silica H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 > 190 could be prepared easily by impregnation and exhibited high performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2."

[5] "The CO2 co-feed gas was more effective than argon for accelerating the dehydrogenation and maintaining catalytic activity due to the activity of CO2 to suppress coke formation or remove coke from the catalyst."

[6] "An important role of CO2 is removing carbon by oxidation from the surface of the Cr/H-ZSM-5."

[1] "To date, in the field of PDH by CO2, Cr2O3-, V2O5- and Ga2O3-based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems."

[2] "For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts, the proposed one-step pathway is followed, in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14]."

[3] "However, fast deactivation presents as a common problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems, ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition."

[4] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst [1]."

[5] "It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2]."

[6] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."

[7] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

[8] "To circumvent this problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the most important green-house gases, has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes, including coupling of methane, dehydrogenation (DH) of ethylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene, propane, or iso-butane"

[9] "In the DH reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst"

          "Surface acidity/basicity"
          "Application of suitable catalyst can help to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of CO2 activation."
          "Exploitation of the soft oxidant property of CO2 with the help of suitable catalyst in commercial scale can give a boost to polymer and fuel economy."
          "Participation of catalyst in CO2 activation: favourable factors"

[1] "Cr/H-ZSM-5 SiO2=Al2O3=190 catalyst effectively dehydrogenated ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 oxidant. The maximum rate of formation of ethylene at 923 K was 0:516 mmol g-catalyst1 min1 and selectivity was over 90%."

[2] "Carbon dioxide maintained the activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the surface of the catalyst."

[3] "The order of activity (conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene) of the H-ZSM-5 support was Cr=H-ZSM-51900 > Cr=H-ZSM-5190  Cr=H-ZSM-590 > Cr=H-ZSM-529. This order indicates that the SiO2=Al2O3 ratio affects the nature of the Cr active species and the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "Crystal structures of the zeolite supports also greatly affected the catalytic activity. Comparing among catalyst 4, 5 and 8, whose SiO2=Al2O3 ratio are almost the same, the order of activity is as follows: Cr=H-mordenite20 > Cr=H-ZSM-529 > Cr=H-beta25."

[5] "The TPR profiles of Cr/H-ZSM-5(1900) catalyst showed a pronounced H2 consumption peak in the temperature range 623823 K, whereas a very small peak was detected for the Cr/H-ZSM-5(29) and Cr/H-Y(4.8) catalysts in this temperature range."

[6] "The H2 consumption peak between 623 and 873 K can be assigned not to a Cr(III) species but to a high oxidation state Cr species, such as Cr(VI) [7], which may be the key to the higher dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "CO2 co-feed gas accelerated dehydrogenation and maintained the catalytic activity of the catalyst by removing coke from the catalyst surface."

"Several factors influence the concentration of these species on the surface of supports. They include the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and properties of the support (e.g. isoelectric point, specific surface area)."

"Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties."

"CO2 participates in the process as an oxidant and allows for regeneration of the reduced chromium sites generated during the dehydrogenation of propane"

"Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+ have been proposed."

"The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species."

"Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."

"Because of the fact that in reaction conditions CO2 is reduced to CO, together with hydrogen (synthesis gas) or separately, it has many applications in the chemical industry."

"In addition, it is known that the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS) can proceed over redox and nonredox Cr sites [18,23,39]. This reaction enhances the yield of propene by consumption of hydrogen which is produced in the nonoxidative pathway (in equilibrium propane dehydrogenation, Scheme 1)."

[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[2] "The rate of carbon monoxide formation increased together with that of propene, while the rate of hydrogen formation stayed at almost constant value, with increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide."

[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6"

[6] "Cr/Cab-O-Sil contains mainly polymeric chromates together with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 as a minor phase."

[7] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was recovered as seen by the fact that C3H8 conversion returned to the original value (Fig. 9, c), but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all (Fig. 9, c), after the treatment with O2."

[8] "Cr/SiO2 showed an insufficient but detectable recovery of the activity after the O2 treatment"

[1] "Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield."

[2] "The distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts, was influenced by the nature of supports."

[3] "It is well known that the dispersion, the oxidation state and the structural features of supported species may strongly depend on the support."

[4] "Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction. It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts."

[5] "The catalysts were prone to deactivate in the reaction but could be partially regenerated by oxygen."

[6] "It has been generally recognized that the surface chromium species strongly depends on the surface density of chromium oxide [27]."

[7] "When Cr loading was 8 wt%, the diffraction peaks of crystalline α-Cr2O3 appeared in the XRD patterns (Fig. 5B). The color of catalysts changes from yellow to green with the growing of Cr content is in accordance with above phenomenon, indicating the formation of Cr(III) at high loadings of Cr."

[8] "Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some degree."

[9] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst. Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

[10] "Two kinds of catalysts showed an insufficient but adequately detectable recovery of the activity after treated with air at 700 8C. It is noted that the activity of Cr-MSU-1 got more recovery from the air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1."

"Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction, especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"Cr/TS-1 catalyst could exhibit particular catalytic properties for the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide compared to Cr/SiO2 catalyst."

"The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS-1(150) ≈ Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30) ≈ Cr/TS-1(15)."

"Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane"

"The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction)."

"Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states"

"The conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species"

1. "Various promoters have been used to further improve catalytic performance. In our prior work, (14-16) it has been demonstrated that Fe-promoted Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity."

2. "The catalysts, which were prepared by the coprecipitation and coprecipitationimpregnation methods, have the same loadings of Fe and Cr (5 wt % of Fe and 10 wt % of Cr)."

3. "The ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (C) dramatically drops from 50% to 38% over the time on stream. However, the ethylene yield on FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) varies little."

4. "The ethylene selectivity over FeCr/ZrO2 (C) is higher than that over FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) while its CO2 conversion is lower."

5. "Cr3+ ions are considered the active species for dehydrogenation, with the argument that only Cr3+ species has been detected by XPS on the used catalysts and there is no obvious deactivation of FeCr/ZrO2 (CI) catalysts in the stability test."

6. "Fe3O4 has an inverse spinal structure, which can readily undergo rapid electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The electron hopping between Fe3+ and Fe2+ can facilitate the proceeding of reaction 3."

7. "Carbon dioxide has recently been employed as a mild oxidant for ODE instead of oxygen."

8. "A variety of catalysts have been examined in ODE with carbon dioxide as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have proven to be very effective catalysts for this reaction."

9. "The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g of the catalyst and 1 g of quartz sand at atmospheric pressure. The reactant stream consisting of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide, and 20% Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The reaction temperature was controlled at 650 °C."

10. "Coke deposition is the main reason of the deactivation of the catalysts."

[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[5] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[6] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

[7] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."

"Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

"Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

"The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

"The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

"Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

"Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

"The effect of the mole ratio of carbon dioxide to ethylbenzene over Li, Na and K showed a strong increase in the yield of styrene with an increase in the amount of CO2 in the reaction mixture until the CO2/ethyl benzene ratio was 10. A further increase in the ratio above this value decreased the yield."

[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to be active catalysts for hydrogenation, isomerization of olefins, and dehydrogenation of alkanes"

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[3] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst. Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, whereas Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene."

[4] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "The acidbase property of supports plays an important role in Cr anchorage and dispersion on oxide supports"

[6] "It is believed that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

[7] "The effect of Cr2O3 loading in Cr2O3/SiO2 system on catalytic activity was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 1. As seen, ethane conversion increases as Cr2O3 content increases and it reaches the maximum value at 8 wt.% Cr2O3."

[8] "The catalytic stability of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated at 650°C. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of 5 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 and 8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts as a function of time. It is seen that the two catalysts exhibit deactivation at different rates, which can be ascribed to the carbon deposition."

[9] "The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation due to the introduction of CO2 and its decomposition to produce surface oxygen species will be the parallel reaction paths in the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide."

[1] "Many bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The one-step mechanism has been proposed for redox oxides (Cr2O3, Cr2O5, ZnO and V2O5), where CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle"

[3] "The two-step pathway has been proposed for non-redox oxides such as Ga2O3 (Xu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2005). Production of H2 could be an indication of the two-step pathway."

[4] "Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[5] "As a consequence, acidic supports or oxides are not desirable as they favor cracking and coke formation (that is, acid coking (Richardson, 1989)). In fact, basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2."

[6] "Basic oxides have been favored for CO2-PDH reaction due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the alkali and alkaline earth oxides are inefficient because they form carbonate species in the presence of carbon dioxide (Rangel et al., 2012). Metal oxides of moderate basicity are required and must participate in the redox process with the reduction of carbon dioxide (Krylov et al., 1995)."

[7] "Unfortunately, depending on the system conditions, many undesired side reactions can occur including dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas"

[8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
