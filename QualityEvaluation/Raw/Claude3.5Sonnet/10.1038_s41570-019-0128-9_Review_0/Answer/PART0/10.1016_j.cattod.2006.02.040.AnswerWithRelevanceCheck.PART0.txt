          [1] "Wang et al. [9] investigated the effect of support such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 on the catalytic ODH of ethane to ethylene by CO2 over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts. 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts could produce a 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield."

[2] "The distribution of Cr2O3 on the supports and surface chromium species structure, which determined the activity of catalysts, was influenced by the nature of supports."

[3] "It is well known that the dispersion, the oxidation state and the structural features of supported species may strongly depend on the support."

[4] "Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction. It was proposed that these high-valent Cr species were responsible for the high activities of catalysts."

[5] "The catalysts were prone to deactivate in the reaction but could be partially regenerated by oxygen."

[6] "It has been generally recognized that the surface chromium species strongly depends on the surface density of chromium oxide [27]."

[7] "When Cr loading was 8 wt%, the diffraction peaks of crystalline α-Cr2O3 appeared in the XRD patterns (Fig. 5B). The color of catalysts changes from yellow to green with the growing of Cr content is in accordance with above phenomenon, indicating the formation of Cr(III) at high loadings of Cr."

[8] "Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 exhibited higher activities at the beginning of reaction. As the reactions proceeded, conversions of ethane and CO2 gave a visible drop, suggesting catalysts were deactivated to some degree."

[9] "Cr(VI) acted as active species in the catalysts for initial high activity and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during the reaction resulted in deactivation of catalyst. Both catalysts could be regenerated partially by treated with oxygen."

[10] "Two kinds of catalysts showed an insufficient but adequately detectable recovery of the activity after treated with air at 700 8C. It is noted that the activity of Cr-MSU-1 got more recovery from the air treatment compared to Cr/MSU-1."

          The influence of various support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions can be summarized as follows:

1. Support materials: Different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2) significantly affect the distribution, dispersion, oxidation state, and structural features of chromium species, which in turn influence catalyst activity and performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed good performance, with 8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 achieving 61% ethane conversion and 55.5% ethylene yield.

2. Chromium loading: The surface chromium species strongly depend on the surface density of chromium oxide. Higher Cr loading (8 wt%) led to the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3, indicating a change in the oxidation state from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) at higher loadings.

3. Oxidation state: High-valent Cr species (Cr6+ and Cr5+) are responsible for high catalytic activity. However, these species are reduced during the reaction, leading to catalyst deactivation.

4. Stability and deactivation: Catalysts tend to deactivate during the reaction due to the reduction of high-valent Cr species. Both Cr-MSU-1 and Cr/MSU-1 catalysts showed higher initial activities but experienced deactivation over time.

5. Regeneration: Partial regeneration of the catalysts is possible through oxygen or air treatment, suggesting that maintaining the Cr(VI) oxidation state is crucial for catalyst performance. The extent of recovery depends on the support material, with Cr-MSU-1 showing better recovery compared to Cr/MSU-1.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing Cr loading to maximize active sites while preventing the formation of less active crystalline Cr2O3.
2. Maintaining the Cr(VI) oxidation state during the reaction to prevent deactivation.
3. Developing effective regeneration strategies to restore catalyst activity.
4. Optimizing support materials to enhance Cr2O3 distribution, stability, and regeneration efficiency.
5. Balancing high initial activity with long-term stability, as the highly active Cr6+ species are prone to reduction and deactivation.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effects of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways for different supports. Further research in these areas could provide valuable insights for catalyst optimization and understanding the complex interplay between support materials, Cr oxidation states, and reaction conditions to maximize both activity and selectivity.

          各种支撑材料和反应条件对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的影响可总结如下：

1. 支撑材料：不同的支撑材料（Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2、ZrO2）显著影响铬物种的分布、分散度、氧化态和结构特征，进而影响催化剂活性和性能。SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现良好，8 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2实现了61%的乙烷转化率和55.5%的乙烯收率。

2. 铬负载量：表面铬物种强烈依赖于氧化铬的表面密度。较高的Cr负载量（8 wt%）导致结晶α-Cr2O3的形成，表明在较高负载量下氧化态从Cr(VI)变为Cr(III)。

3. 氧化态：高价铬物种（Cr6+和Cr5+）负责高催化活性。然而，这些物种在反应过程中被还原，导致催化剂失活。

4. 稳定性和失活：由于高价铬物种的还原，催化剂在反应过程中容易失活。Cr-MSU-1和Cr/MSU-1催化剂都显示出较高的初始活性，但随时间推移而失活。

5. 再生：通过氧气或空气处理可以部分再生催化剂，表明维持Cr(VI)氧化态对催化剂性能至关重要。恢复程度取决于支撑材料，Cr-MSU-1相比Cr/MSU-1表现出更好的恢复能力。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡Cr负载量，以最大化活性位点，同时防止形成活性较低的结晶Cr2O3。
2. 在反应过程中维持Cr(VI)氧化态，防止失活。
3. 开发有效的再生策略以恢复催化剂活性。
4. 优化支撑材料以增强Cr2O3分布、稳定性和再生效率。
5. 平衡高初始活性和长期稳定性，因为高活性的Cr6+物种容易被还原和失活。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或不同支撑材料详细反应机理途径的具体信息。在这些领域进行进一步研究可能为催化剂优化提供宝贵见解，并有助于理解支撑材料、铬氧化态和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用，以最大化活性和选择性。
