[1] "The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."

[2] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."

[3] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."

[4] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

[5] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The literature provides insights into the influence of support materials (specifically SiO2 and Al2O3) and CO2 partial pressure on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material influence:
- Cr/SiO2 showed enhanced activity with increasing CO2 partial pressure.
- Cr/Al2O3 exhibited reduced activity with the addition of even small amounts of CO2.

2. Reaction conditions (CO2 partial pressure):
- Increasing CO2 partial pressure enhanced the activity of Cr/SiO2.
- Even small amounts of CO2 remarkably reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3.

3. Mechanistic pathways:
- For both supports, the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6.
- CO2 could oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions.
- In the case of Cr/SiO2, both simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species and oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species occurred.

4. Key challenges and trade-offs:
- CO2 adsorption on Al2O3 inhibited C3H8 adsorption, reducing catalyst activity.
- The choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's response to CO2, with SiO2 showing benefits and Al2O3 showing drawbacks.
- Balancing the oxidative and simple dehydrogenation pathways may be crucial for optimizing overall performance.

The study does not provide information on other support materials mentioned in the question (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2), nor does it discuss selectivity or stability explicitly. Further research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question and optimize the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献提供了关于支撑材料（特别是SiO2和Al2O3）和CO2分压对CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的见解：

1. 支撑材料的影响：
- Cr/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加表现出活性增强。
- Cr/Al2O3在添加少量CO2时就表现出活性降低。

2. 反应条件（CO2分压）：
- 增加CO2分压可以提高Cr/SiO2的活性。
- 即使是少量的CO2也会显著降低Cr/Al2O3的活性。

3. 机理途径：
- 对于两种支撑材料，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6的脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
- 在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
- 对于Cr/SiO2，Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢和Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢同时发生。

4. 主要挑战和权衡：
- CO2在Al2O3上的吸附抑制了C3H8的吸附，降低了催化剂活性。
- 支撑材料的选择显著影响催化剂对CO2的响应，SiO2显示出优势，而Al2O3显示出劣势。
- 平衡氧化脱氢和简单脱氢途径可能是优化整体性能的关键。

该研究没有提供问题中提到的其他支撑材料（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2）的信息，也没有明确讨论选择性或稳定性。需要进行进一步研究才能全面解答所有问题，并优化CO2氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能。
