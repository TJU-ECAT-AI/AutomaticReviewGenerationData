          [1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[5] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[6] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

          The literature primarily focuses on CrOx/silica catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing insights into their performance and challenges:

1. Activity: CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity in ODHP reactions.

2. Stability: These catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the active Cr3+ state to the inactive Cr2+ state.

3. Influence of CO2: The presence of CO2 helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state compared to its absence. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability for reoxidizing reduced CrOx due to its thermodynamic stability.

4. Effect of O2 addition: Adding small amounts of O2 as a co-feed with CO2 improves the oxidizing power and decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene (C3H6).

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing activity and stability
2. Improving the oxidizing ability of CO2
3. Maintaining higher Cr oxidation states
4. Enhancing stability without compromising selectivity when adding other oxidants

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on other support materials (MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) or detailed effects of CO2 partial pressure. Further research is needed to fully address these aspects and understand the trade-offs in optimizing catalyst performance across different support materials and reaction conditions.

          该文献主要关注CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的应用，提供了关于其性能和挑战的见解：

1. 活性：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性。

2. 稳定性：这些催化剂由于积碳沉积和CrOx还原而快速失活，将活性Cr3+状态转变为无活性Cr2+状态。

3. CO2的影响：CO2的存在有助于保持Cr处于较高的氧化态，相比于无CO2的情况。然而，由于CO2的热力学稳定性，其对还原态CrOx的再氧化能力有限。

4. 添加O2的影响：添加少量O2作为CO2的共进料可以提高氧化能力并降低CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活速率。然而，这显著降低了对丙烯(C3H6)的选择性。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡活性和稳定性
2. 提高CO2的氧化能力
3. 维持较高的Cr氧化态
4. 在添加其他氧化剂时提高稳定性而不影响选择性

文献未提供关于其他载体材料（MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2）的全面信息或CO2分压影响的详细效果。需要进一步的研究来全面解决这些方面，并了解在不同载体材料和反应条件下优化催化剂性能的权衡。
