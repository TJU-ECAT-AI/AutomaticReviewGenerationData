          [1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to be active catalysts for hydrogenation, isomerization of olefins, and dehydrogenation of alkanes"

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."

[3] "Cr2O3/SiO2 shows the highest ethane conversion, while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrates the lowest activity, even lower than that of the unsupported Cr2O3 catalyst. Cr2O3/SiO2 also exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, whereas Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene."

[4] "Based on the ethane conversion and ethylene yield, the catalytic activity of Cr2O3 and the supported catalysts follows the order of Cr2O3/SiO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/ZrO2 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > 5 wt.% Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "The acidbase property of supports plays an important role in Cr anchorage and dispersion on oxide supports"

[6] "It is believed that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples will be the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane, based on XPS and TPR measurements. The catalytic activity is dependent on the redox property of catalysts."

[7] "The effect of Cr2O3 loading in Cr2O3/SiO2 system on catalytic activity was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 1. As seen, ethane conversion increases as Cr2O3 content increases and it reaches the maximum value at 8 wt.% Cr2O3."

[8] "The catalytic stability of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated at 650°C. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of 5 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 and 8 wt.% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts as a function of time. It is seen that the two catalysts exhibit deactivation at different rates, which can be ascribed to the carbon deposition."

[9] "The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation due to the introduction of CO2 and its decomposition to produce surface oxygen species will be the parallel reaction paths in the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide."

          The support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity: The catalytic activity follows the order Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. SiO2-supported catalysts show the highest ethane conversion, while TiO2-supported catalysts demonstrate the lowest activity.

2. Selectivity: Cr2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity, while Cr2O3/ZrO2 gives the lowest selectivity to ethylene.

3. Stability: Catalysts show deactivation over time due to carbon deposition, with different deactivation rates observed for different Cr2O3 loadings.

4. Cr2O3 loading: For SiO2-supported catalysts, ethane conversion increases with Cr2O3 content, reaching a maximum at 8 wt.% Cr2O3.

5. Support properties: The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects the catalytic properties, playing an important role in Cr anchorage and dispersion.

6. Active sites and mechanism: Surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+ couples are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation. The catalytic activity depends on the redox properties of the catalysts.

7. Reaction pathways: The reaction involves both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways due to the introduction of CO2.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:
- Balancing activity and selectivity, as exemplified by Cr2O3/ZrO2 showing high activity but low selectivity.
- Optimizing Cr2O3 loading to maximize conversion while maintaining stability.
- Mitigating catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition.
- Tailoring the redox properties and acidity/basicity of the catalysts to enhance performance.
- Managing the parallel reaction pathways (dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation) for desired product distribution.

The influence of CO2 partial pressure is not directly addressed in the given literature, which represents a gap in the available data for fully optimizing these catalysts.

          支撑材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 活性：催化活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 ≈ Cr2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。SiO2负载的催化剂显示出最高的乙烷转化率，而TiO2负载的催化剂活性最低。

2. 选择性：Cr2O3/SiO2表现出最高的乙烯选择性，而Cr2O3/ZrO2给出最低的乙烯选择性。

3. 稳定性：催化剂随时间推移会因碳沉积而失活，不同Cr2O3负载量的催化剂表现出不同的失活速率。

4. Cr2O3负载量：对于SiO2负载的催化剂，乙烷转化率随Cr2O3含量增加而增加，在8 wt.% Cr2O3时达到最大值。

5. 支撑材料性质：氧化物支撑材料的酸碱性强烈影响催化性能，在Cr的固定和分散中起重要作用。

6. 活性位点和机理：表面Cr3+物种和Cr6+/Cr3+偶被认为是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。催化活性取决于催化剂的氧化还原性质。

7. 反应途径：由于CO2的引入，反应涉及脱氢和氧化脱氢两种途径。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 平衡活性和选择性，例如Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出高活性但低选择性。
- 优化Cr2O3负载量以最大化转化率同时保持稳定性。
- 缓解由于碳沉积导致的催化剂失活。
- 调整催化剂的氧化还原性质和酸碱性以提高性能。
- 管理平行反应途径（脱氢和氧化脱氢）以获得所需的产物分布。

给定的文献中没有直接讨论CO2分压的影响，这代表了全面优化这些催化剂时可用数据的空白。
