          [1] "Wang et al. [10] studied the ODH of ethane to ethylene by carbon dioxide over Cr2O3-based catalysts and investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic activity. As a result, they found that Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low selectivity to ethylene while Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated the lowest activity but the highest ethylene selectivity."

[2] "To achieve this, the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate corresponding to 5 wt.% Cr2O3 in the final product was dissolved in deionized water and then the powdered supports were added under continuous stirring at the same temperature."

[3] "The reactant stream, consisting of 10 vol.% ethane, 50 vol.% carbon dioxide and 40 vol.% nitrogen, was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 75 ml/min. The reaction temperature ranged between 550 and 700 C."

[4] "It has been indicated that CO2 increases the yield of ethylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation (by CO2) cycles or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "In order to improve ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity, it is interesting to use TiO2ZrO2 as a combined support. The mixed oxide nanocomposite catalysts also displayed superior ODH activity than their individual component oxides owing to enhancement in the acid-base bifunctional behavior [22]."

[6] "The addition of ZrO2 can prevent TiO2 phase transformations from anatase to rutile at high temperature, thereby promoting the thermal stability of the catalysts [23]."

[7] "CO2 is now considered as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethane due to its role as a diluent in achieving high equilibrium conversion, enhancing the selectivity to ethylene, and maintaining longer catalyst life time [16,17]."

          The literature provides insights into how various support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials:
- Different supports significantly affect catalytic activity and selectivity.
- Cr2O3/ZrO2 showed high conversion but low ethylene selectivity.
- Cr2O3/TiO2 demonstrated low activity but high ethylene selectivity.
- TiO2-ZrO2 combined support improved both ethylene selectivity and catalytic activity due to enhanced acid-base bifunctional behavior.
- ZrO2 addition to TiO2 prevents phase transformations at high temperatures, promoting catalyst thermal stability.

2. Reaction conditions:
- The study used 5 wt% Cr2O3 loading on supports.
- Reaction conditions included 50 vol% CO2 partial pressure and temperatures of 550-700°C.
- CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, helping to achieve high equilibrium conversion, enhance ethylene selectivity, and maintain longer catalyst lifetime.

3. Mechanistic pathways:
- CO2 increases ethylene yield via a redox mechanism where the catalyst undergoes reduction by ethane and re-oxidation by CO2.
- Reaction coupling occurs between simple dehydrogenation of ethane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).

4. Challenges and trade-offs:
- Balancing activity and selectivity is a key challenge, as demonstrated by the different performances of Cr2O3/ZrO2 and Cr2O3/TiO2.
- Optimizing CO2 partial pressure and temperature to maximize ethylene yield while minimizing side reactions.
- Maintaining catalyst stability at high temperatures.

5. Optimization strategies:
- Using combined supports like TiO2-ZrO2 to leverage benefits of individual materials.
- Tuning CO2 concentration to enhance performance while avoiding catalyst deactivation.

However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on other supports like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, or CeO2. More research would be needed to fully compare across a wider range of support materials and reaction conditions to optimize overall performance.

          文献为二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的各种载体材料和反应条件如何影响其性能提供了一些见解：

1. 载体材料：
- 不同的载体显著影响催化活性和选择性。
- Cr2O3/ZrO2表现出高转化率但低乙烯选择性。
- Cr2O3/TiO2表现出低活性但高乙烯选择性。
- TiO2-ZrO2复合载体由于酸碱双功能行为的增强，改善了乙烯选择性和催化活性。
- 向TiO2添加ZrO2可防止高温下的相变，提高催化剂的热稳定性。

2. 反应条件：
- 研究使用了5 wt%的Cr2O3负载量。
- 反应条件包括50 vol%的CO2分压和550-700°C的温度。
- CO2作为软氧化剂，有助于达到高平衡转化率，提高乙烯选择性，并延长催化剂寿命。

3. 机理途径：
- CO2通过氧化还原机制增加乙烯产率，催化剂经历被乙烷还原和被CO2再氧化的循环。
- 乙烷简单脱氢与逆水气变换反应（RWGS）之间发生反应耦合。

4. 挑战和权衡：
- 平衡活性和选择性是一个关键挑战，这从Cr2O3/ZrO2和Cr2O3/TiO2的不同性能中可以看出。
- 优化CO2分压和温度以最大化乙烯产率同时最小化副反应。
- 在高温下维持催化剂稳定性。

5. 优化策略：
- 使用TiO2-ZrO2等复合载体，利用个别材料的优势。
- 调整CO2浓度以提高性能同时避免催化剂失活。

然而，文献并未提供关于SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3或CeO2等其他载体的全面信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面比较更广泛的载体材料和反应条件范围，以优化整体性能。
