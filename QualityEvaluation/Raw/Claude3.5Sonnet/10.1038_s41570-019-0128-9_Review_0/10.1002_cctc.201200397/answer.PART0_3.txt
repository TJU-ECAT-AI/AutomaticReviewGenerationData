[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[5] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

The literature primarily discusses CrOx catalysts supported on silica for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It does not provide comprehensive information on other support materials mentioned in the question.

For silica-supported CrOx catalysts:

1. Activity: They show high activity in ODHP reactions.

2. Selectivity: The addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2 significantly decreases selectivity for propylene (C3H6).

3. Stability: CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation. CO2 helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state, but has limited oxidizing ability for reoxidizing reduced CrOx. Adding small amounts of O2 decreases the deactivation rate.

4. Mechanistic pathways: CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, helping to maintain Cr in higher oxidation states. However, its oxidizing ability is limited due to its thermodynamic stability.

Key challenges and trade-offs:

1. Balancing activity and stability: While CrOx/silica catalysts are highly active, they suffer from rapid deactivation.
2. Improving oxidizing ability: CO2 alone has limited oxidizing ability. Adding O2 improves this but decreases selectivity for the desired product.
3. Maintaining higher Cr oxidation states: This is crucial for catalyst activity and stability, but challenging with CO2 alone.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these aspects across different support materials or to discuss the influence of CO2 partial pressure in detail.

该文献主要讨论了以二氧化硅为载体的CrOx催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的应用。它没有提供问题中提到的其他载体材料的全面信息。

对于以二氧化硅为载体的CrOx催化剂：

1. 活性：在ODHP反应中表现出高活性。

2. 选择性：添加O2作为CO2的共进料会显著降低对丙烯(C3H6)的选择性。

3. 稳定性：CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂会快速失活。CO2有助于保持Cr处于较高的氧化态，但对于重新氧化还原态CrOx的氧化能力有限。添加少量O2可降低失活速率。

4. 机理途径：CO2作为软氧化剂，有助于保持Cr处于较高的氧化态。然而，由于其热力学稳定性，其氧化能力有限。

主要挑战和权衡：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂具有高活性，但会快速失活。
2. 提高氧化能力：单独使用CO2的氧化能力有限。添加O2可以改善这一点，但会降低目标产物的选择性。
3. 维持较高的Cr氧化态：这对催化剂的活性和稳定性至关重要，但仅使用CO2很难实现。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较不同载体材料之间的这些方面，也没有详细讨论CO2分压的影响。
