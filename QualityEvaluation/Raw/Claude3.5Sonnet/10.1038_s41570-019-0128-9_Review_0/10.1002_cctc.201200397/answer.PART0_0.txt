[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how various support materials influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts and the role of CO2:

1. Silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts (CrOx/silica) show high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

2. These catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ sites to inactive Cr2+ states.

3. The presence of CO2 helps maintain chromium in a higher oxidation state compared to its absence, which is beneficial for the reaction.

4. However, CO2's oxidizing ability is limited due to its thermodynamic stability, presenting a challenge in reoxidizing reduced CrOx species.

The literature doesn't directly address the influence of other support materials or provide detailed information on how reaction conditions affect the catalysts' performance. It also doesn't comprehensively discuss the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance. To fully answer the question, more research focusing on different support materials and reaction conditions would be needed.

这篇文献并未提供关于各种载体材料如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的全面信息。然而，它确实对二氧化硅负载的氧化铬催化剂和二氧化碳的作用提供了一些见解：

1. 二氧化硅负载的氧化铬催化剂（CrOx/silica）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出高活性。

2. 这些催化剂面临快速失活的挑战，原因是焦炭沉积和活性Cr3+位点还原为非活性Cr2+状态。

3. 二氧化碳的存在有助于保持铬处于较高的氧化态，相比于无二氧化碳的情况，这对反应有利。

4. 然而，由于二氧化碳的热力学稳定性，其氧化能力有限，这在重新氧化还原态CrOx物种方面构成了挑战。

这篇文献没有直接讨论其他载体材料的影响，也没有提供关于反应条件如何影响催化剂性能的详细信息。它也没有全面讨论优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关注不同载体材料和反应条件的研究。
