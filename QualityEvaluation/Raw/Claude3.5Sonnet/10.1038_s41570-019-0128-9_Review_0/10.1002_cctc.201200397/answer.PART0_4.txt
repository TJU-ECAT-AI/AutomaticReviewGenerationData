[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[5] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, though it does not comprehensively address all the support materials mentioned in the question.

CrOx/silica catalysts are highlighted as promising due to their high activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. However, these catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the active Cr3+ state to the inactive Cr2+ state.

The presence of CO2 helps maintain chromium in a higher oxidation state compared to its absence, which is beneficial for the reaction. However, CO2 alone has limited oxidizing ability to reoxidize reduced CrOx due to its thermodynamic stability.

To improve the oxidizing power and decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts, adding a small amount of O2 as a co-feed with CO2 has been shown to be effective. This suggests that reaction conditions, particularly the gas composition, play a crucial role in optimizing catalyst performance.

The key challenges in optimizing overall performance appear to be:
1. Maintaining the active Cr3+ state and preventing reduction to Cr2+
2. Minimizing coke deposition
3. Enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2
4. Balancing the addition of other oxidants (like O2) to improve stability without compromising selectivity

The literature does not provide specific information on how different support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the catalytic performance, nor does it discuss the effects of CO2 partial pressure. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and understand the trade-offs in optimizing catalyst performance across different support materials and reaction conditions.

该文献提供了一些关于支撑材料和反应条件对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的影响的见解,但并未全面涉及问题中提到的所有支撑材料。

CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂因其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的高活性而被认为是有前途的。然而,这些催化剂面临着由焦炭沉积和CrOx还原引起的快速失活的挑战,这将活性Cr3+状态转化为非活性Cr2+状态。

CO2的存在有助于保持铬处于较高的氧化态,这对反应有利。然而,由于热力学稳定性,CO2单独的氧化能力有限,无法重新氧化还原后的CrOx。

为了提高氧化能力并降低CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活速率,添加少量O2作为CO2的共进料已被证明是有效的。这表明反应条件,特别是气体组成,在优化催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

优化整体性能的主要挑战似乎是:
1. 保持活性Cr3+状态并防止还原为Cr2+
2. 最小化焦炭沉积
3. 增强CO2的氧化能力
4. 平衡添加其他氧化剂(如O2)以提高稳定性,同时不影响选择性

文献没有提供关于不同支撑材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2如何影响催化性能的具体信息,也没有讨论CO2分压的影响。需要进一步的研究才能全面解决这些方面,并了解在不同支撑材料和反应条件下优化催化剂性能的权衡。
