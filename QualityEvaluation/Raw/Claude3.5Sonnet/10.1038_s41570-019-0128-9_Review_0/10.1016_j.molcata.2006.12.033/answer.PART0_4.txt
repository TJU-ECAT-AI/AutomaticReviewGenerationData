[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."

[2] "Compared to other Cr2O3-based nano-composite catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high catalytic activity with low selectivity to ethylene in our prior research [15]."

[3] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."

[4] "The Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited not only high ethylene selectivity, but also relatively high ethane and CO2 conversions. At 650 C, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst demonstrated 93.17% ethylene selectivity and 53.72% ethane conversion."

[5] "This investigation clearly shows that modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts exhibited varying activities in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The modifiers of Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased the ethylene selectivity of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions."

The literature provides some insights on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation, but does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question. Based on the information given:

1. Chromium-based catalysts are reported to be the most effective for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts show high activity but low ethylene selectivity.

3. Modifying Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts with Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides can improve performance. 

4. Fe, Co, and Mn oxide modifiers increased ethylene selectivity, while Ni favored side reactions.

5. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr catalyst showed the best balance of high selectivity and conversion.

6. Catalyst performance is influenced by the nature of the modifier, which affects textural and structural properties, chromium and oxygen species distribution, and acid/base properties.

The study focuses on ZrO2 as a support and does not provide comparative data on other supports like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, or CeO2. It also does not discuss the effects of CO2 partial pressure or address long-term stability. The main challenge appears to be balancing high activity with high selectivity, as exemplified by the trade-offs observed with different modifiers.

根据提供的文献，对于铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的一些见解如下，但并未全面涵盖问题的所有方面：

1. 据报道，铬基催化剂是乙烷与CO2脱氢反应中最有效的催化剂。

2. Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂表现出高活性但低乙烯选择性。

3. 用Fe、Ni、Mn和Co氧化物修饰Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂可以改善其性能。

4. Fe、Co和Mn氧化物改性剂提高了乙烯选择性，而Ni则倾向于促进副反应。

5. Fe5-Cr10/Zr催化剂在高选择性和高转化率之间表现出最佳平衡。

6. 催化剂性能受改性剂性质的影响，这影响了催化剂的织构和结构特性、铬和氧物种分布以及酸碱性质。

该研究主要关注ZrO2作为载体，没有提供其他载体如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3或CeO2的比较数据。它也没有讨论CO2分压的影响或长期稳定性问题。主要挑战似乎是在高活性和高选择性之间取得平衡，这从不同改性剂观察到的权衡中可以看出。
