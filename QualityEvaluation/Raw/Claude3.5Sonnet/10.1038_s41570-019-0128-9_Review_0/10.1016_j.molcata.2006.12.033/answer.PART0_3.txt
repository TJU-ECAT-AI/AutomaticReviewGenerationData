[1] "Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts modified with Ni, Fe, Co, Mn oxides respectively were synthesized by coupling co-precipitation with azeotropic distillation method. The effect of modifiers on the catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated."

[2] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]. In order to obtain better catalytic activity, some efforts had been focused on the supports of chromium-based catalysts using TS-1 [11] and MSU-x [12]."

[3] "The modifiers exhibited different effects on catalytic behavior. Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased ethylene selectivity, but the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactionsthe reforming and cracking reactions."

[4] "The Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited an excellent performance in this reaction, producing 50.05% ethylene yield at 53.72% ethane conversion at 650 C."

[5] "The characterization indicated that weak acid sites are involved in ethane activation, and strong acidbase pairs promote the reforming and cracking reactions. The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

The literature provides insights into how different support materials and modifiers influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: The study focuses on ZrO2 as the support material for Cr2O3 catalysts. Other supports mentioned include SiO2, TS-1, and MSU-x, which have been explored in previous research to improve catalytic activity. However, the specific effects of these supports are not detailed in the given text.

2. Modifiers: The addition of Fe, Co, and Mn oxides to Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts significantly increased ethylene selectivity. In contrast, Ni modification favored side reactions such as reforming and cracking.

3. Performance: The Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst showed the best performance, achieving 50.05% ethylene yield at 53.72% ethane conversion at 650°C.

4. Mechanistic pathways: Weak acid sites are involved in ethane activation, while strong acid-base pairs promote reforming and cracking reactions. The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species, and acid-base properties on the catalyst surface collectively determine the catalytic activity.

5. Challenges and trade-offs: The main challenge appears to be balancing ethylene selectivity with overall conversion. Modifiers that increase selectivity (Fe, Co, Mn) tend to decrease conversion, while those that increase conversion (Ni) favor unwanted side reactions.

The study does not provide information on the effects of CO2 partial pressure or long-term catalyst stability. Key challenges include optimizing the balance between selectivity and conversion, as well as minimizing side reactions while maintaining high activity.

这篇文献提供了关于不同支撑材料和改性剂如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能的见解：

1. 支撑材料：该研究主要关注ZrO2作为Cr2O3催化剂的支撑材料。文中还提到了其他支撑材料，如SiO2、TS-1和MSU-x，这些材料在之前的研究中被探索用于改善催化活性。然而，文中并未详细说明这些支撑材料的具体影响。

2. 改性剂：向Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂中添加Fe、Co和Mn氧化物显著提高了乙烯选择性。相比之下，Ni改性则倾向于促进副反应，如重整和裂解反应。

3. 性能：Fe5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂表现最佳，在650°C时实现了50.05%的乙烯产率和53.72%的乙烷转化率。

4. 机理途径：弱酸性位点参与乙烷的活化，而强酸碱对促进重整和裂解反应。催化剂表面上铬物种、氧物种的分布以及酸碱性质共同决定了催化活性。

5. 挑战和权衡：主要挑战似乎是平衡乙烯选择性和总体转化率。增加选择性的改性剂（Fe、Co、Mn）往往会降低转化率，而增加转化率的改性剂（Ni）则倾向于促进不需要的副反应。

该研究没有提供关于CO2分压效应或催化剂长期稳定性的信息。关键挑战包括优化选择性和转化率之间的平衡，以及在保持高活性的同时最小化副反应。
