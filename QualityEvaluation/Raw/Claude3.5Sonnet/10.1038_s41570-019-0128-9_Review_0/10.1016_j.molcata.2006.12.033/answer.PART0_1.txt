The literature provides some insights into how different supports and conditions affect chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Chromium-based catalysts are reported to be the most effective for this reaction. Different supports like TS-1 and MSU-x have been explored to improve catalytic activity. Specifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high activity but low ethylene selectivity.

The study aimed to improve ethylene selectivity by adding Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst. This suggests that modifying the support material can influence catalyst performance.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, affected activity and selectivity. Higher temperatures increased conversion but decreased ethylene selectivity. Side reactions like reforming and hydrocracking of ethane also occurred.

Key challenges appear to be:
1. Balancing activity and selectivity 
2. Minimizing side reactions
3. Optimizing catalyst composition and support material

The study does not directly address CO2 partial pressure effects or provide comprehensive comparisons across all listed support materials. More research would be needed to fully answer all aspects of the question.

文献为二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中不同载体和条件如何影响铬氧化物催化剂提供了一些见解：

报道称铬基催化剂是该反应最有效的催化剂。已经探索了TS-1和MSU-x等不同载体来提高催化活性。具体而言，Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂表现出高活性但乙烯选择性低。

该研究旨在通过向Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂中添加Fe、Ni、Mn和Co氧化物来提高乙烯选择性。这表明改变载体材料可以影响催化剂性能。

反应条件，特别是温度，影响了活性和选择性。温度升高会增加转化率但降低乙烯选择性。还发生了乙烷重整和加氢裂解等副反应。

主要挑战似乎是：
1. 平衡活性和选择性
2. 最小化副反应
3. 优化催化剂组成和载体材料

该研究没有直接讨论CO2分压效应，也没有提供所有列出的载体材料的全面比较。需要更多研究才能全面回答问题的所有方面。
