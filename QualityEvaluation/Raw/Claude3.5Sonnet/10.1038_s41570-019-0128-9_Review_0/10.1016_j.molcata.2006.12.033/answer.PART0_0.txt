[1] "Among these catalysts, chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction [57]."

[2] "In order to obtain better catalytic activity, some efforts had been focused on the supports of chromium-based catalysts using TS-1 [11] and MSU-x [12]."

[3] "Compared to other Cr2O3-based nano-composite catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high catalytic activity with low selectivity to ethylene in our prior research [15]."

[4] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."

[5] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."

[6] "Among the prepared catalysts, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited not only high ethylene selectivity, but also relatively high ethane and CO2 conversions."

[7] "The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity in dehydrogenations of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and modifications influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chromium-based catalysts are generally considered the most effective for this reaction.

2. Different supports have been explored to improve catalytic activity, including TS-1 and MSU-x.

3. Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts showed high catalytic activity but low ethylene selectivity.

4. Adding Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides to Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts was attempted to improve ethylene selectivity.

5. Fe, Mn, and Co modifications markedly increased ethylene selectivity compared to unmodified Cr2O3/ZrO2, but decreased ethane and CO2 conversions.

6. The Fe-modified catalyst (Fe5-Cr10/Zr) showed the best balance of high ethylene selectivity and relatively high conversions.

7. Catalyst performance is determined by the distribution of chromium species, oxygen species, and acid-base properties on the catalyst surface.

The key challenges and trade-offs appear to be balancing high activity (conversion) with high selectivity to ethylene. Modifying the catalysts can improve selectivity but may decrease overall conversion. Optimizing the catalyst composition and surface properties is crucial for achieving the best overall performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effects of reaction conditions like CO2 partial pressure or compare performance across all the support materials mentioned in the question. More research would be needed to fully address those aspects.

该文献提供了一些关于不同支撑材料和改性如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中性能的见解：

1. 铬基催化剂通常被认为是这种反应最有效的催化剂。

2. 已经探索了不同的支撑材料以提高催化活性，包括TS-1和MSU-x。

3. Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂表现出高催化活性但乙烯选择性低。

4. 尝试向Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂中添加Fe、Ni、Mn和Co氧化物以提高乙烯选择性。

5. Fe、Mn和Co改性显著提高了乙烯选择性，相比未改性的Cr2O3/ZrO2，但降低了乙烷和CO2转化率。

6. Fe改性催化剂（Fe5-Cr10/Zr）表现出最佳的高乙烯选择性和相对较高转化率的平衡。

7. 催化剂性能由催化剂表面的铬物种分布、氧物种分布和酸碱性质共同决定。

主要挑战和权衡似乎是平衡高活性（转化率）和高乙烯选择性。改性催化剂可以提高选择性，但可能降低整体转化率。优化催化剂组成和表面性质对于实现最佳整体性能至关重要。

该文献没有提供关于CO2分压等反应条件影响的具体信息，也没有比较问题中提到的所有支撑材料的性能。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些方面的问题。
