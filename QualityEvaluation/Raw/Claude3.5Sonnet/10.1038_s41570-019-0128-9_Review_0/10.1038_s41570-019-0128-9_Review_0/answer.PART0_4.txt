[1] "Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking"

[2] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[3] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[4] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[5] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[6] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion"

[7] "Further increasing the Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species"

[8] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

[9] "The low conversion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH catalysis can be improved by doping in Ni, an element that has strong chemisorption of CO2"

The influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions varies significantly:

1. Support materials: SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content provide the highest activity and selectivity for Cr oxide catalysts. Different supports lead to different mechanistic pathways and deactivation modes. For example, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a two-step mechanism (DDE and RWGS) and is prone to coking, while CrOx/ZrO2 performs single-step CO2-ODH but competes with dry reforming and deactivates through sintering.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 partial pressure improves activity and selectivity for CrOx/SiO2, but decreases activity for CrOx/γ-Al2O3. This difference is attributed to stronger CO2 adsorption on γ-Al2O3 and its effect on the catalyst's acid-base properties.

3. Cr content: Optimal performance is achieved at around 8 wt% Cr, which provides the highest CrVI:CrIII ratio and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing Cr content leads to agglomeration and formation of inactive species.

4. Doping: Adding Fe, Co, or Mn improves C2H4 selectivity by increasing weakly acidic sites and decreasing strong acid sites. Ni doping enhances CO2 chemisorption and improves conversion for CrOx/SiO2.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing performance include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: High initial activity often comes at the cost of rapid deactivation due to coking or sintering.
2. Selectivity vs. conversion: Achieving high selectivity for desired products while maintaining high conversion rates is challenging.
3. Controlling Cr oxidation state: Maintaining the optimal CrVI:CrIII ratio is crucial for performance but difficult to sustain over time.
4. Mitigating deactivation: Different supports and reaction conditions lead to various deactivation mechanisms, requiring tailored strategies for each catalyst system.
5. Toxicity concerns: Despite performance improvements, the high toxicity of CrIII remains a significant drawback for widespread implementation.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能受支撑材料和反应条件的影响显著：

1. 支撑材料：高SiO2含量的SiO2、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5为铬氧化物催化剂提供最高的活性和选择性。不同的支撑材料导致不同的机理路径和失活模式。例如，CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步机制（DDE和RWGS）运作，容易结焦；而CrOx/ZrO2进行单步CO2-ODH，但与干重整竞争，并通过烧结失活。

2. CO2分压：增加CO2分压可提高CrOx/SiO2的活性和选择性，但会降低CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性。这种差异归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上的强吸附以及对催化剂酸碱性的影响。

3. Cr含量：在约8 wt% Cr时达到最佳性能，提供最高的CrVI:CrIII比率和增加的烷烃转化率。但进一步增加Cr含量会导致聚集和形成无活性物种。

4. 掺杂：添加Fe、Co或Mn可通过增加弱酸性位点和减少强酸性位点来提高C2H4选择性。Ni掺杂可增强CO2化学吸附，提高CrOx/SiO2的转化率。

优化性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：高初始活性通常以快速失活为代价，因结焦或烧结而导致。
2. 选择性与转化率：在保持高转化率的同时实现目标产物的高选择性具有挑战性。
3. 控制Cr氧化态：维持最佳CrVI:CrIII比率对性能至关重要，但难以长期维持。
4. 减轻失活：不同的支撑材料和反应条件导致各种失活机制，需要针对每个催化剂系统制定专门策略。
5. 毒性问题：尽管性能有所改善，CrIII的高毒性仍然是广泛应用的重大缺点。
