[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[5] "The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3."

[6] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion"

[7] "Further increasing the Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species"

[8] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[9] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

[10] "The low conversion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH catalysis can be improved by doping in Ni, an element that has strong chemisorption of CO2"

The influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions varies significantly:

1. Activity and selectivity: SiO2-based supports (including MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5) generally provide the highest activity and selectivity. Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports also show high activity but through different mechanistic pathways.

2. Mechanistic pathways: CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a two-step mechanism (direct dehydrogenation followed by reverse water-gas shift), while CrOx/ZrO2 performs single-step CO2-ODH.

3. Stability: CeO2 support offers improved stability due to its ability to consume coke deposits through the reverse Boudouard reaction.

4. CO2 partial pressure effects: Increasing CO2 partial pressure improves activity and selectivity for CrOx/SiO2, but decreases activity for CrOx/γ-Al2O3.

5. Chromium content: Optimal performance is achieved at around 8 wt% Cr, which maximizes the CrVI:CrIII ratio. Higher Cr content leads to agglomeration and formation of inactive species.

6. Doping effects: Doping with Fe, Co, or Mn improves C2H4 selectivity by increasing weakly acidic sites and decreasing strong acid sites. Ni doping enhances CO2 chemisorption and improves conversion for CrOx/SiO2.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability, as highly active catalysts often suffer from rapid deactivation.
2. Optimizing Cr content to maximize active species while avoiding agglomeration.
3. Tailoring support acidity to promote desired reactions while minimizing side reactions.
4. Managing the competition between CO2-ODH and dry reforming pathways.
5. Addressing the toxicity and environmental concerns associated with Cr-based catalysts.

铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的支撑材料和反应条件的影响因素差异显著：

1. 活性和选择性：基于SiO2的支撑材料（包括MCM-41和H-ZSM-5）通常提供最高的活性和选择性。Al2O3和ZrO2支撑也显示高活性，但通过不同的机理途径。

2. 机理途径：CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步机制运作（直接脱氢后接逆水煤气反应），而CrOx/ZrO2执行单步CO2-ODH。

3. 稳定性：CeO2支撑提供了更好的稳定性，因为它能够通过逆布道反应消耗积碳。

4. CO2分压效应：增加CO2分压可以提高CrOx/SiO2的活性和选择性，但会降低CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性。

5. 铬含量：在约8 wt%的Cr含量时达到最佳性能，这可以最大化CrVI:CrIII比率。更高的Cr含量会导致聚集和形成无活性物种。

6. 掺杂效应：用Fe、Co或Mn掺杂可以通过增加弱酸性位点和减少强酸性位点来提高C2H4选择性。Ni掺杂可增强CO2化学吸附，提高CrOx/SiO2的转化率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性，因为高活性催化剂往往会快速失活。
2. 优化Cr含量以最大化活性物种，同时避免聚集。
3. 调整支撑材料的酸度以促进所需反应，同时最小化副反应。
4. 管理CO2-ODH和干重整途径之间的竞争。
5. 解决与Cr基催化剂相关的毒性和环境问题。
