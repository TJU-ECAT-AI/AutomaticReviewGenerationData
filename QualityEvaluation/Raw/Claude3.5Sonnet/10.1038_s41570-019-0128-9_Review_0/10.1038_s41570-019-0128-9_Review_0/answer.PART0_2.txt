[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits."

[5] "CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[6] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[7] "CrOx/MCM-41 nanocatalysts for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 at 823K show high initial selectivity for C2H4 (90%) but low maximum conversion of C2H6 (<8%). After 12h on stream, the catalyst was deactivated and only maintained 30% selectivity towards the alkene."

[8] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

[9] "The low conversion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH catalysis can be improved by doping in Ni, an element that has strong chemisorption of CO2"

The support materials and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity and selectivity: SiO2-based supports (including MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5) generally provide the highest activity and selectivity. Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports also show high activity but through different mechanistic pathways.

2. Stability: CeO2 support provides better stability due to its ability to consume coke deposits, although it shows lower activity.

3. Mechanistic pathways: The support material affects the oxidation state of Cr and the reaction mechanism. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates through a two-step mechanism (DDE and RWGS), while CrOx/ZrO2 performs single-step CO2-ODH.

4. CO2 partial pressure effects: Increasing CO2 partial pressure improves activity and selectivity for CrOx/SiO2, but decreases activity for CrOx/γ-Al2O3.

5. Deactivation mechanisms: Different supports lead to different deactivation modes. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 deactivates due to coking, while CrOx/ZrO2 deactivates through sintering or conversion to inactive Cr species.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and stability: High-activity catalysts (e.g., CrOx/SiO2) often suffer from rapid deactivation, while more stable catalysts (e.g., CrOx/CeO2) show lower activity.

2. Optimizing Cr oxidation state: CrVI species are more active for alkane dehydrogenation but are reduced to less active CrIII species during the reaction.

3. Controlling acid site distribution: Weak acid sites facilitate alkane activation, while strong acid sites promote undesired side reactions.

4. Improving catalyst longevity: Most Cr oxide catalysts suffer from short life cycles due to coking or conversion to inactive species.

5. Enhancing CO2 activation: The rate of CrIII reoxidation by CO2 is slower than the rate of alkane dehydrogenation, leading to catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these challenges, strategies such as doping with other metals (Fe, Co, Mn, or Ni) have been explored to improve selectivity, stability, and CO2 activation. However, the overall performance optimization of Cr oxide catalysts remains a complex task due to the interplay of various factors affecting activity, selectivity, and stability.

支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 活性和选择性：基于SiO2的支持材料（包括MCM-41和H-ZSM-5）通常提供最高的活性和选择性。Al2O3和ZrO2支持材料也显示出高活性，但通过不同的机理途径。

2. 稳定性：CeO2支持材料由于能够消耗积碳沉积物，提供了更好的稳定性，尽管它显示出较低的活性。

3. 机理途径：支持材料影响Cr的氧化态和反应机理。CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步机制（DDE和RWGS）运作，而CrOx/ZrO2执行单步CO2-ODH。

4. CO2分压效应：增加CO2分压可以提高CrOx/SiO2的活性和选择性，但会降低CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性。

5. 失活机制：不同的支持材料导致不同的失活模式。CrOx/γ-Al2O3由于积碳而失活，而CrOx/ZrO2通过烧结或转化为无活性Cr物种而失活。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：高活性催化剂（如CrOx/SiO2）通常会快速失活，而更稳定的催化剂（如CrOx/CeO2）显示出较低的活性。

2. 优化Cr氧化态：CrVI物种对烷烃脱氢更活跃，但在反应过程中被还原为活性较低的CrIII物种。

3. 控制酸性位分布：弱酸性位有利于烷烃活化，而强酸性位促进不需要的副反应。

4. 改善催化剂寿命：大多数Cr氧化物催化剂由于积碳或转化为无活性物种而寿命短。

5. 增强CO2活化：CO2对CrIII的再氧化速率慢于烷烃脱氢速率，导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

为解决这些挑战，已经探索了诸如掺杂其他金属（Fe、Co、Mn或Ni）等策略，以提高选择性、稳定性和CO2活化。然而，由于影响活性、选择性和稳定性的各种因素之间的相互作用，Cr氧化物催化剂的整体性能优化仍然是一项复杂的任务。
