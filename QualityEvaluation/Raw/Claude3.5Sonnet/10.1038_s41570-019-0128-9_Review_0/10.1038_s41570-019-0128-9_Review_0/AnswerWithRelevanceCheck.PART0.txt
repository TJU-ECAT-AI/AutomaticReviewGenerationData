[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[5] "Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion"

[6] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[7] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

The influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is significant:

1. Support materials:
- SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content provide the highest activity and selectivity.
- Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports affect the oxidation state of Cr, leading to different reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms.
- CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a two-step mechanism (DDE and RWGS) and is prone to coking.
- CrOx/ZrO2 performs single-step CO2-ODH but competes with dry reforming and deactivates through sintering or conversion to inactive Cr species.

2. CO2 partial pressure:
- Increasing CO2 partial pressure improves activity and C3H6 selectivity for CrOx/SiO2.
- For CrOx/γ-Al2O3, even slight increases in CO2 partial pressure decrease activity.

3. Cr content:
- Optimal performance is achieved at 8 wt% Cr, maximizing the CrVI:CrIII ratio and alkane conversion.

4. Reaction kinetics:
- CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes faster than CrIII species are reoxidized by CO2, leading to eventual deactivation.

5. Doping:
- Adding Fe, Co, or Mn improves C2H4 selectivity by increasing weakly acidic sites and decreasing strong acid sites.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing Cr content for optimal activity without causing agglomeration and inactive species formation.
2. Managing the faster dehydrogenation rate compared to the slower reoxidation rate to prevent deactivation.
3. Selecting appropriate supports to achieve desired reaction pathways and minimize deactivation mechanisms.
4. Optimizing CO2 partial pressure based on the specific support material used.
5. Incorporating dopants to enhance selectivity while maintaining overall catalyst stability and activity.
6. Addressing the toxicity concerns associated with Cr-based catalysts.

铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的性能受支撑材料和反应条件的显著影响：

1. 支撑材料：
- 高二氧化硅含量的SiO2、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5提供最高的活性和选择性。
- Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2支撑材料影响铬的氧化态，导致不同的反应途径和失活机制。
- CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步机制（DDE和RWGS）运作，容易结焦。
- CrOx/ZrO2进行单步CO2-ODH，但与干重整竞争，并通过烧结或转化为无活性铬物种而失活。

2. CO2分压：
- 增加CO2分压可提高CrOx/SiO2的活性和C3H6选择性。
- 对于CrOx/γ-Al2O3，即使CO2分压略微增加也会降低活性。

3. 铬含量：
- 8 wt%的铬含量可获得最佳性能，最大化CrVI:CrIII比例和烷烃转化率。

4. 反应动力学：
- CrVI=O物种脱氢烷烃的速度快于CrIII物种被CO2再氧化的速度，导致最终失活。

5. 掺杂：
- 添加Fe、Co或Mn可通过增加弱酸性位点和减少强酸性位点来提高C2H4选择性。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡铬含量以获得最佳活性，同时避免聚集和无活性物种的形成。
2. 管理较快的脱氢速率与较慢的再氧化速率之间的关系，以防止失活。
3. 选择适当的支撑材料以实现所需的反应途径并最小化失活机制。
4. 根据所使用的特定支撑材料优化CO2分压。
5. 引入掺杂剂以提高选择性，同时保持整体催化剂稳定性和活性。
6. 解决与铬基催化剂相关的毒性问题。
