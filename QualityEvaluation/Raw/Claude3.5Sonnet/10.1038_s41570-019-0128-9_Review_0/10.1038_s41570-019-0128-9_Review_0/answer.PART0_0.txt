[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content"

[2] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2"

[3] "CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."

[4] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure"

[5] "CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2"

[6] "Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking"

The influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions varies significantly:

1. Support materials:
- SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content provide the highest activity and selectivity for Cr oxide catalysts.
- Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports affect the oxidation state of Cr, leading to different mechanistic pathways and deactivation modes.
- CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via a two-step mechanism (DDE and RWGS) and is prone to coke formation.
- CrOx/ZrO2 performs single-step CO2-ODH but competes with dry reforming and deactivates through sintering or inactive Cr species formation.

2. Reaction conditions:
- CO2 partial pressure impacts activity and selectivity differently based on the support:
  - CrOx/SiO2 shows increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with higher CO2 partial pressure.
  - CrOx/γ-Al2O3 experiences decreased activity with even slight increases in CO2 partial pressure.

3. Key challenges and trade-offs:
- Balancing the rate of alkane dehydrogenation by CrVI=O species with the slower reoxidation of CrIII by CO2.
- Optimizing Cr loading to maximize active CrVI centers while avoiding agglomeration and formation of inactive species.
- Managing catalyst deactivation through coking, sintering, or conversion to inactive Cr species.
- Addressing the toxicity concerns associated with CrIII.

4. Optimization strategies:
- Doping with Fe, Co, or Mn to improve selectivity by increasing weakly acidic sites and decreasing strong acid sites.
- Careful selection of support materials to balance activity, selectivity, and stability.
- Tailoring reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, based on the chosen support material.

The overall performance optimization of chromium oxide catalysts requires a delicate balance between these factors, considering the specific requirements of the desired reaction and the inherent limitations of Cr-based systems.

各种支撑材料和反应条件对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的影响显著不同：

1. 支撑材料：
- 高SiO2含量的SiO2、MCM-41和H-ZSM-5为铬氧化物催化剂提供最高的活性和选择性。
- Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2支撑体影响Cr的氧化态，导致不同的机理途径和失活模式。
- CrOx/γ-Al2O3通过两步机制（DDE和RWGS）运作，容易形成积碳。
- CrOx/ZrO2进行单步CO2-ODH，但与干重整竞争，并通过烧结或形成无活性Cr物种而失活。

2. 反应条件：
- CO2分压根据支撑体的不同对活性和选择性产生不同影响：
  - CrOx/SiO2在较高CO2分压下表现出增加的活性和C3H6选择性。
  - CrOx/γ-Al2O3即使CO2分压略微增加也会导致活性下降。

3. 主要挑战和权衡：
- 平衡CrVI=O物种的烷烃脱氢速率与CO2对CrIII较慢的再氧化速率。
- 优化Cr负载量以最大化活性CrVI中心，同时避免团聚和形成无活性物种。
- 管理由于积碳、烧结或转化为无活性Cr物种导致的催化剂失活。
- 解决与CrIII相关的毒性问题。

4. 优化策略：
- 掺杂Fe、Co或Mn以提高选择性，增加弱酸性位点并减少强酸性位点。
- 谨慎选择支撑材料以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
- 根据所选支撑材料调整反应条件，特别是CO2分压。

铬氧化物催化剂的整体性能优化需要在这些因素之间取得微妙的平衡，考虑所需反应的具体要求和基于Cr系统的固有限制。
