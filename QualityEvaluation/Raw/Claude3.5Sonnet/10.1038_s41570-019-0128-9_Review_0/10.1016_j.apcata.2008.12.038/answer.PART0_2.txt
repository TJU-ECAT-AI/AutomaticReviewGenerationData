[1] "Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."

[2] "The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst exhibits both high activity and stability for dehydrogenation of ethane, with an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 h."

[3] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O"

[4] "Since CO2 is much more acidic than ethane, the adsorption of CO2 on the basic sites would certainly reduce the possibility of the adsorption of ethane on gallium oxide, leading to a reduction in ethane conversion."

[5] "The stability was improved with further increasing in the CO2 partial pressure. The Boudouard reaction (i.e. C + CO2 ! 2CO), which removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves the stability of the catalyst, was observed over Ga2O3-loaded catalysts"

This study focuses on gallium oxide catalysts rather than chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the results:

Support materials significantly influence catalyst performance. HZSM-5 supports with higher Si/Al ratios improved stability compared to b-Ga2O3. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst showed the best combination of activity and stability.

CO2 partial pressure plays a complex role:

1. It promotes the reaction through the reverse water gas shift reaction, removing H2 and driving the dehydrogenation forward.

2. At higher concentrations, CO2 can displace ethane on catalyst active sites, reducing conversion.

3. CO2 improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation through the Boudouard reaction and promoting product desorption.

Key challenges include balancing acidity for activity while avoiding side reactions, and optimizing CO2 concentration to promote stability without sacrificing conversion. The trade-off between activity and stability is a central issue in catalyst design.

While this study used gallium oxide catalysts, similar principles may apply to chromium oxide catalysts. However, direct comparisons would require additional research specific to chromium-based systems.

这项研究主要关注的是氧化镓催化剂，而不是氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，从研究结果中可以得出一些见解：

载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。高Si/Al比的HZSM-5载体比b-Ga2O3具有更好的稳定性。Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)催化剂表现出最佳的活性和稳定性组合。

CO2分压起着复杂的作用：

1. 通过逆水气变换反应促进反应，去除H2并推动脱氢反应向前进行。

2. 在高浓度时，CO2可能会取代催化剂活性位点上的乙烷，从而降低转化率。

3. CO2通过布达反应抑制积碳形成，并促进产物脱附，从而提高催化剂稳定性。

主要挑战包括平衡酸度以保持活性同时避免副反应，以及优化CO2浓度以提高稳定性而不牺牲转化率。活性和稳定性之间的权衡是催化剂设计中的核心问题。

虽然这项研究使用的是氧化镓催化剂，但类似的原理可能适用于氧化铬催化剂。然而，进行直接比较需要针对铬基系统进行额外的研究。
