[1] "Carbon dioxide is considered as a mild or an unconventional oxidant. Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been investigated by several groups, and rather high selectivity to corresponding olefins was reported."

[2] "Nakagawa et al. [2] found that gallium oxide was an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O"

[4] "Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation."

[5] "The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst exhibits both high activity and stability for dehydrogenation of ethane, with an ethane conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 h."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts, but discusses gallium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Based on this related system, we can infer some insights:

Support materials significantly impact catalyst performance. HZSM-5 supports, especially those with higher Si/Al ratios, improved stability compared to unsupported Ga2O3. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst showed excellent activity and stability.

CO2 partial pressure influences reaction pathways and performance. Increasing CO2 improves initial activity up to a point, then decreases it. CO2 promotes the reverse water-gas shift reaction, removing H2 and driving dehydrogenation. However, excessive CO2 can displace adsorbed ethane, reducing conversion.

Key challenges include balancing acidity for high activity while avoiding side reactions and coking. Optimizing CO2 levels is crucial - enough to promote dehydrogenation and suppress coking, but not so much as to inhibit ethane adsorption.

The main trade-off appears to be between high initial activity (favored by higher acidity) and long-term stability (favored by lower acidity). Finding the right balance of acid sites and CO2 partial pressure is key to optimizing overall catalyst performance.

虽然文献没有直接讨论氧化铬催化剂，但它讨论了用于乙烷CO2氧化脱氢的氧化镓催化剂。基于这个相关系统，我们可以推断一些见解：

载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。HZSM-5载体，特别是那些具有较高Si/Al比的载体，与未负载的Ga2O3相比，提高了稳定性。Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)催化剂表现出优异的活性和稳定性。

CO2分压影响反应途径和性能。增加CO2可以提高初始活性，直到达到某个点，然后活性开始下降。CO2促进逆水气变换反应，去除H2并推动脱氢反应。然而，过量的CO2可能会置换吸附的乙烷，降低转化率。

主要挑战包括平衡酸度以获得高活性，同时避免副反应和结焦。优化CO2水平至关重要 - 足够促进脱氢和抑制结焦，但不能过多以至于抑制乙烷吸附。

主要的权衡似乎是在高初始活性（由较高酸度favored）和长期稳定性（由较低酸度favored）之间。找到合适的酸性位点平衡和CO2分压是优化整体催化剂性能的关键。
