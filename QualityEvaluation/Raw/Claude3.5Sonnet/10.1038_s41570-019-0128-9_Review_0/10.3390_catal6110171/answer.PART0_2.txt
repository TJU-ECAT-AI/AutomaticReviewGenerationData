[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."

[2] "The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support."

[3] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."

[4] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts or most of the support materials mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some insights on how support materials can influence catalyst performance in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material choice affects catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. The study compares SBA-15 and MCM-41 as supports for vanadia catalysts.

2. SBA-15 support led to higher catalytic activity compared to MCM-41 due to enhanced reducibility and better dispersion of vanadium species.

3. SBA-15 support also resulted in higher isobutene selectivity compared to MCM-41 due to fewer acid sites.

4. The amount of dispersed active species (vanadium in this case) on the support correlates with catalytic activity.

5. Support properties like surface area, pore structure, and acidity influence catalyst performance.

The study does not discuss CO2 partial pressure effects or provide information on mechanistic pathways. The key challenges appear to be optimizing active species dispersion, reducibility, and controlling support acidity to balance activity and selectivity. The main trade-off seems to be between having enough active sites for high activity while maintaining good selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions on acidic sites.

文献没有直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂或问题中提到的大多数载体材料。但是，它确实提供了一些关于载体材料如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解：

1. 载体材料的选择影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该研究比较了SBA-15和MCM-41作为钒氧化物催化剂的载体。

2. 与MCM-41相比，SBA-15载体由于增强了可还原性和钒物种的更好分散，导致了更高的催化活性。

3. 由于酸性位点较少，SBA-15载体还导致了较高的异丁烯选择性。

4. 分散在载体上的活性物种（在本例中为钒）的数量与催化活性相关。

5. 载体的性质，如比表面积、孔结构和酸度，影响催化剂的性能。

该研究没有讨论CO2分压效应或提供有关反应机理途径的信息。主要挑战似乎是优化活性物种的分散、可还原性，以及控制载体酸度以平衡活性和选择性。主要的权衡似乎是在保持足够的活性位点以获得高活性的同时，通过限制酸性位点上的不需要的副反应来维持良好的选择性。
