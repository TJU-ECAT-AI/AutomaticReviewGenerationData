[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."

[2] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity. An isobutane conversion of 40.8% with an isobutene selectivity of 84.8% was achieved using this catalyst at 570 C and after reaction for 10 min."

[3] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."

[4] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts or the specific supports and reaction conditions mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some insights on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCM-41 for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane:

1. Support material influences activity and selectivity. SBA-15 support led to higher activity and selectivity compared to MCM-41 for vanadia catalysts.

2. Catalyst reducibility affects activity. The enhanced reducibility of V/SBA compared to V/MCM contributed to its higher catalytic activity.

3. Dispersion of active species impacts performance. More dispersed vanadium species on SBA-15 resulted in higher activity.

4. Acidity influences selectivity. Lower acidity of V/SBA compared to V/MCM led to higher isobutene selectivity.

5. Optimal loading was identified. 7% V loading on SBA-15 showed the highest activity.

The key challenges appear to be optimizing metal loading, improving metal dispersion, tuning support acidity, and enhancing reducibility to achieve high activity and selectivity. Trade-offs may exist between acidity for activity versus selectivity. While this study focused on vanadium catalysts, similar principles may apply for optimizing chromium oxide catalysts on various supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接涉及铬氧化物催化剂或问题中提到的特定载体和反应条件。然而，它确实提供了一些关于SBA-15和MCM-41负载的钒氧化物催化剂用于CO2氧化脱氢异丁烷的见解：

1. 载体材料影响活性和选择性。对于钒氧化物催化剂，SBA-15载体比MCM-41具有更高的活性和选择性。

2. 催化剂的可还原性影响活性。V/SBA比V/MCM具有更强的可还原性，这导致了更高的催化活性。

3. 活性物种的分散度影响性能。SBA-15上更分散的钒物种导致了更高的活性。

4. 酸度影响选择性。与V/MCM相比，V/SBA较低的酸度导致了更高的异丁烯选择性。

5. 确定了最佳负载量。7%的钒负载在SBA-15上显示出最高的活性。

主要挑战似乎是优化金属负载量、改善金属分散度、调节载体酸度和提高可还原性，以实现高活性和选择性。酸度对活性和选择性的影响可能存在权衡。虽然这项研究集中在钒催化剂上，但类似的原理可能适用于优化各种载体上的铬氧化物催化剂，用于CO2氧化脱氢反应。
