[1] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (V/SBA) were prepared by the wet impregnation method."

[2] "The V/SBA catalysts exhibit high activity for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with CO2, and the catalytic activity is correlated with the amount of dispersed vanadium species on the SBA-15 support."

[3] "The higher catalytic activity observed for 7% V/SBA than for that of 7% V/MCM can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility and more dispersed vanadium species on the former catalyst."

[4] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than for that on 7% V/MCM is due to the lower amount of acid sites on the former catalyst."

The literature does not provide information about chromium oxide catalysts or the specific supports and reaction conditions mentioned in the question. However, it does discuss vanadia catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCM-41 for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2.

The support material influences the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. SBA-15 as a support leads to higher activity and selectivity compared to MCM-41 for vanadia catalysts. This is due to enhanced reducibility, more dispersed vanadium species, and fewer acid sites on the SBA-15 support.

The amount of dispersed vanadium species on the support correlates with catalytic activity. The optimal loading was found to be 7% for V/SBA catalysts.

While the literature does not directly address the challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance, it suggests that balancing metal loading, dispersion, reducibility, and acidity of the catalyst is important for achieving high activity and selectivity.

The study does not provide information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or discuss mechanistic pathways in detail.

该文献没有提供关于铬氧化物催化剂或问题中提到的特定载体和反应条件的信息。但是，它确实讨论了以SBA-15和MCM-41为载体的钒催化剂用于异丁烷与CO2的脱氢反应。

载体材料影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。与MCM-41相比，SBA-15作为载体可以使钒催化剂具有更高的活性和选择性。这是由于SBA-15载体上的钒物种具有更强的可还原性、更高的分散度以及较少的酸性位点。

载体上分散的钒物种数量与催化活性相关。对于V/SBA催化剂，最佳负载量为7%。

虽然文献没有直接讨论优化整体性能的挑战和权衡，但它表明平衡金属负载量、分散度、可还原性和催化剂酸度对于获得高活性和选择性很重要。

该研究没有提供CO2分压影响的信息，也没有详细讨论反应机理途径。
