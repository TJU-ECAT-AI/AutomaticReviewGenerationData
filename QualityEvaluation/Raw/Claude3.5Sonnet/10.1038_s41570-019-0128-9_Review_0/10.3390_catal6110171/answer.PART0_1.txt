[1] "The catalysts reported for this reaction mainly consist of iron oxide [16], vanadium-magnesium oxide [17], V2O5 [18], LaBaSm oxide [19], and NiO [15]."

[2] "The SBA-15-supported vanadia exhibits higher isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity than the MCM-41-supported one."

[3] "The 7% V/SBA catalyst shows the highest activity, which gives 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity."

[4] "The higher catalytic activity of 7% V/SBA than 7% V/MCM is due to the fact that the former catalyst exhibits enhanced reducibility, as evidenced by the lower reduction temperature of peak I. Another reason is that the amount of dispersed vanadium species is greater for 7% V/SBA than 7% V/MCM."

[5] "The higher isobutene selectivity achieved on 7% V/SBA than 7% V/MCM can be attributed to less acid sites present on the former catalyst, as indicated by the NH3-TPD results."

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it provides insights on vanadium-based catalysts supported on different materials for isobutane dehydrogenation with CO2:

1. Support materials influence catalyst performance significantly. SBA-15 supported vanadia catalysts show higher isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity compared to MCM-41 supported catalysts.

2. The 7% V/SBA catalyst exhibited the best performance, with 40.8% isobutane conversion and 84.8% isobutene selectivity.

3. Key factors affecting catalyst performance include:
   - Reducibility of the catalyst
   - Dispersion of active species (vanadium in this case)
   - Acidity of the catalyst surface

4. SBA-15 supported catalysts showed enhanced reducibility and better dispersion of vanadium species compared to MCM-41 supported catalysts, leading to higher activity.

5. Lower acidity of SBA-15 supported catalysts contributed to higher isobutene selectivity compared to MCM-41 supported catalysts.

The study does not directly address the effects of CO2 partial pressure or discuss mechanistic pathways. The main challenges appear to be optimizing the balance between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability through careful selection of support materials and controlling the dispersion and reducibility of active species.

这篇文献并未直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于不同材料负载的钒基催化剂在CO2存在下进行异丁烷脱氢的见解：

1. 载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。SBA-15负载的钒氧化物催化剂相比MCM-41负载的催化剂表现出更高的异丁烷转化率和异丁烯选择性。

2. 7% V/SBA催化剂表现最佳，异丁烷转化率为40.8%，异丁烯选择性为84.8%。

3. 影响催化剂性能的关键因素包括：
   - 催化剂的可还原性
   - 活性物种（在本例中为钒）的分散度
   - 催化剂表面的酸性

4. SBA-15负载的催化剂相比MCM-41负载的催化剂表现出更强的可还原性和更好的钒物种分散度，从而导致更高的活性。

5. SBA-15负载催化剂较低的酸性有助于获得更高的异丁烯选择性，相比MCM-41负载催化剂而言。

这项研究并未直接讨论CO2分压的影响或机理途径。主要挑战似乎在于通过仔细选择载体材料并控制活性物种的分散度和可还原性，来优化催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。
