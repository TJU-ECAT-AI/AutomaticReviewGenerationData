[1] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

[2] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

[3] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

[4] "The temperature program reduction profiles clearly indicated a weak/insignificant peak of Cr2O3 supported on titania. This suggests that the partial reduction of chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction (eqn (9)), which is not achieved when titania is used as a support."

[5] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

Support materials significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. SiO2 provides the best support, yielding the highest ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability. The activity order is Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2.

2. The support affects chromium oxide dispersion, with fine dispersion observed across different supports.

3. Partial reduction of chromium is crucial for the reaction. TiO2 support hinders this reduction, explaining its poor performance.

4. Supported catalysts show better performance than pure chromia due to lower reoxidation rates, attributed to lower surface concentration of Cr3+ centers for CO2 adsorption.

5. The support influences the Cr-O bond strength and oxygen transfer ease, affecting catalytic performance.

Key challenges include optimizing chromium oxide dispersion, managing the redox properties, and balancing CO2 activation with catalyst stability. The trade-off between high activity (requiring partial reduction) and stability (avoiding over-reduction) is a critical consideration in catalyst design.

While specific effects of CO2 partial pressure are not directly addressed, it likely influences the oxidation state of chromium and the formation of active species on the catalyst surface.

Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between support materials, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways to optimize overall catalyst performance.

支持材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的性能有显著影响：

1. SiO2提供最佳支持，产生最高的乙烷转化率、乙烯选择性和稳定性。活性顺序为Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。

2. 支持材料影响铬氧化物的分散性，在不同支持材料上观察到细微分散。

3. 铬的部分还原对反应至关重要。TiO2支持阻碍这种还原，解释了其性能较差的原因。

4. 支持的催化剂比纯铬氧化物表现更好，这是由于较低的再氧化率，归因于用于CO2吸附的Cr3+中心的表面浓度较低。

5. 支持材料影响Cr-O键强度和氧转移的易度，从而影响催化性能。

主要挑战包括优化铬氧化物分散、管理氧化还原性能以及平衡CO2活化与催化剂稳定性。在催化剂设计中，高活性（需要部分还原）和稳定性（避免过度还原）之间的权衡是一个关键考虑因素。

虽然没有直接讨论CO2分压的具体影响，但它可能会影响铬的氧化态和催化剂表面活性物种的形成。

需要进一步研究以充分理解支持材料、反应条件和机理途径之间的复杂相互作用，以优化催化剂的整体性能。
