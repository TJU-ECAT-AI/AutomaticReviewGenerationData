[1] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

[2] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

[3] "The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

[4] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

[6] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

Different support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among the studied supports, SiO2 showed the best performance, followed by ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2. The high performance of supported catalysts is attributed to:

1. Fine dispersion of Cr2O3 on the support surface
2. Presence of both Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states 
3. Lower reoxidation rate compared to unsupported chromia
4. Stronger Cr6+–O–M bonds with the support

Key challenges in optimizing performance include:

1. Maintaining high dispersion of active chromium species
2. Balancing Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio for optimal activity and selectivity
3. Minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
4. Improving CO2 activation and conversion

The mechanistic pathways involve CO2 adsorption on Cr3+ centers, followed by oxygen transfer to form active oxygen species. The support influences the strength of Cr-O bonds and electron transfer, affecting the redox properties and catalytic cycle.

To further optimize performance, future research should focus on:

1. Developing novel support materials with tailored properties
2. Understanding the role of support-chromium interactions at the molecular level
3. Investigating the effect of promoters and modifiers
4. Optimizing reaction conditions, including CO2 partial pressure, to enhance activity and stability

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中,不同的载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。在研究的载体中,SiO2表现最佳,其次是ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2。负载型催化剂的高性能归因于:

1. Cr2O3在载体表面的精细分散
2. 同时存在Cr3+和Cr6+氧化态
3. 与未负载的氧化铬相比,再氧化速率较低
4. 与载体形成更强的Cr6+–O–M键

优化性能的主要挑战包括:

1. 保持活性铬物种的高度分散
2. 平衡Cr3+/Cr6+比例以获得最佳活性和选择性
3. 最小化积碳形成和催化剂失活
4. 提高CO2的活化和转化

机理途径涉及CO2在Cr3+中心的吸附,随后进行氧转移形成活性氧物种。载体影响Cr-O键的强度和电子转移,从而影响氧化还原性质和催化循环。

为进一步优化性能,未来研究应关注:

1. 开发具有定制性能的新型载体材料
2. 在分子水平上理解载体-铬相互作用的作用
3. 研究助剂和改性剂的影响
4. 优化反应条件,包括CO2分压,以提高活性和稳定性
