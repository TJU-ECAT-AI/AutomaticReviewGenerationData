          "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

"Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

"The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

"The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

"Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

"Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

"The effect of the mole ratio of carbon dioxide to ethylbenzene over Li, Na and K showed a strong increase in the yield of styrene with an increase in the amount of CO2 in the reaction mixture until the CO2/ethyl benzene ratio was 10. A further increase in the ratio above this value decreased the yield."

          Support materials significantly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity order: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2
2. SiO2 support provides the highest ethane conversion, best ethylene selectivity, and best stability.
3. Fine dispersion of Cr2O3 on supports, with Cr existing in both Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states.
4. Supported catalysts perform better than unsupported Cr2O3 due to:
   - Lower reoxidation rates
   - Lower surface concentration of Cr3+ sites for CO2 adsorption
   - Stronger Cr6+-O-M bonds compared to Cr6+-O-Cr6+ in pure Cr2O3

Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role:
- Increasing CO2 concentration improves yields up to an optimal ratio (CO2/reactant = 10)
- Further increase in CO2 ratio decreases yield

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing performance include:
1. Balancing Cr dispersion and Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio on different supports
2. Optimizing reducibility of Cr species for redox cycles while maintaining stability
3. Tuning support properties to influence CO2 activation and product selectivity
4. Managing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
5. Balancing CO2 activation with preventing excessive surface adsorption at higher pressures

The mechanistic pathways are influenced by the nature of the support, affecting the oxidation state, dispersion, and reducibility of chromium species. This impacts CO2 activation, oxygen mobility, and the redox cycle crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

          载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径：

1. 活性顺序：Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2
2. SiO2载体提供了最高的乙烷转化率、最佳的乙烯选择性和最佳的稳定性。
3. Cr2O3在载体上呈现精细分散，铬以Cr3+和Cr6+两种氧化态存在。
4. 负载型催化剂比未负载的Cr2O3表现更好，原因如下：
   - 再氧化速率较低
   - Cr3+位点的表面浓度较低，有利于CO2吸附
   - Cr6+-O-M键比纯Cr2O3中的Cr6+-O-Cr6+键更强

反应条件，尤其是CO2分压，起着关键作用：
- 增加CO2浓度可提高产率，直到达到最佳比例（CO2/反应物 = 10）
- CO2比例进一步增加会降低产率

优化性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：
1. 平衡不同载体上Cr的分散度和Cr6+/Cr3+比例
2. 优化Cr物种的可还原性以进行氧化还原循环，同时保持稳定性
3. 调节载体性质以影响CO2活化和产物选择性
4. 管理积碳形成和催化剂失活
5. 在高压下平衡CO2活化与防止过度表面吸附

机理途径受载体性质的影响，影响铬物种的氧化态、分散度和可还原性。这进而影响CO2活化、氧移动性和对脱氢过程至关重要的氧化还原循环。
