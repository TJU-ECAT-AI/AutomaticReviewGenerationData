[1] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

[2] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

[3] "The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

[4] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

[5] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

[6] "Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus, maintaining a better catalytic performance."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 was found to be the best support, followed by ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2. The superior performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts is attributed to:

1. Fine dispersion of Cr2O3 on the support surface
2. Presence of both Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states
3. Lower reoxidation rate compared to unsupported Cr2O3
4. Isolation of CrOx units on the support, limiting oxygen transfer

The key challenges in optimizing performance include:

1. Balancing the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio for optimal activity and selectivity
2. Maintaining high dispersion of Cr2O3 on the support
3. Controlling the surface concentration of Cr3+ centers for CO2 adsorption
4. Optimizing the isolation of CrOx units to prevent rapid reoxidation

While the literature does not explicitly discuss the influence of CO2 partial pressure, it likely plays a role in the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, affecting the overall reaction mechanism and performance.

The main trade-off appears to be between catalyst activity and stability, as higher activity may lead to faster deactivation due to coking or sintering. Optimizing the support material and Cr2O3 loading is crucial for balancing these factors and achieving the best overall performance.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中,载体材料显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。研究发现SiO2是最佳载体,其次是ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2。负载型Cr2O3催化剂性能优越的原因包括:

1. Cr2O3在载体表面的高度分散
2. 同时存在Cr3+和Cr6+氧化态
3. 与未负载Cr2O3相比,再氧化速率较低
4. CrOx单元在载体上的隔离,限制了氧转移

优化性能的主要挑战包括:

1. 平衡Cr6+/Cr3+比例以获得最佳活性和选择性
2. 保持Cr2O3在载体上的高度分散
3. 控制表面Cr3+中心的浓度以利于CO2吸附
4. 优化CrOx单元的隔离程度以防止快速再氧化

虽然文献没有明确讨论CO2分压的影响,但它可能在催化剂表面的CO2吸附和活化中起重要作用,从而影响整体反应机理和性能。

主要的权衡似乎在于催化剂活性和稳定性之间,因为更高的活性可能导致由于结焦或烧结而更快失活。优化载体材料和Cr2O3负载量对平衡这些因素和实现最佳整体性能至关重要。
