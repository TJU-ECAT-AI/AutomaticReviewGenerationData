[1] "Wang et al. investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

[2] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."

[3] "The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."

[4] "The temperature program reduction profiles clearly indicated a weak/insignificant peak of Cr2O3 supported on titania. This suggests that the partial reduction of chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction (eqn (9)), which is not achieved when titania is used as a support."

[5] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

[6] "Sloczynski et al. suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

[7] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

The support material has a significant influence on the activity, selectivity, stability and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Activity order: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2

2. SiO2 support provided the highest ethane conversion, best ethylene selectivity and stability.

3. TiO2 support showed poor performance due to inability to facilitate partial reduction of chromium, which is crucial for the redox mechanism.

4. Supported catalysts generally performed better than unsupported Cr2O3 due to:
   - Lower surface concentration of Cr3+ sites for CO2 adsorption
   - Stronger Cr6+-O-M bonds compared to Cr6+-O-Cr6+ in pure Cr2O3

5. Fine dispersion of Cr2O3 on supports was observed, with Cr existing in both Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states.

The key challenges and trade-offs include:
- Optimizing Cr dispersion and Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio on different supports
- Balancing reducibility of Cr species for redox cycles while maintaining stability
- Tuning support acidity/basicity to influence CO2 activation and product selectivity
- Managing coke formation and catalyst deactivation at high temperatures
- Increasing CO2 conversion while maintaining high olefin selectivity

Further research is needed to fully understand structure-property relationships and develop improved catalysts with optimal performance across all metrics.

载体材料对CO2氧化脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径有显著影响：

1. 活性顺序：Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2

2. SiO2载体提供了最高的乙烷转化率、最佳的乙烯选择性和稳定性。

3. TiO2载体表现不佳，因为无法促进铬的部分还原，这对于氧化还原机理至关重要。

4. 负载型催化剂通常比未负载的Cr2O3表现更好，原因如下：
   - Cr3+位点的表面浓度较低，有利于CO2吸附
   - Cr6+-O-M键比纯Cr2O3中的Cr6+-O-Cr6+键更强

5. 观察到Cr2O3在载体上呈现精细分散，铬以Cr3+和Cr6+两种氧化态存在。

主要挑战和权衡包括：
- 优化不同载体上Cr的分散度和Cr6+/Cr3+比例
- 平衡Cr物种的可还原性以进行氧化还原循环，同时保持稳定性
- 调节载体的酸碱性以影响CO2活化和产物选择性
- 在高温下管理积碳形成和催化剂失活
- 在保持高烯烃选择性的同时增加CO2转化率

需要进一步研究以充分理解结构-性能关系，并开发在所有指标上都具有最佳性能的改进型催化剂。
