[1] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."

[2] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."

[3] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."

[4] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+OCr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."

[5] "The effect of the mole ratio of carbon dioxide to ethylbenzene over Li, Na and K showed a strong increase in the yield of styrene with an increase in the amount of CO2 in the reaction mixture until the CO2/ethyl benzene ratio was 10. A further increase in the ratio above this value decreased the yield."

Support materials significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 support provides the highest activity, selectivity, and stability, followed by ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2. The superior performance of supported catalysts is attributed to lower reoxidation rates and stronger metal-oxygen bonds.

Reaction conditions, particularly CO2 partial pressure, play a crucial role. Increasing CO2 concentration improves yields up to an optimal ratio, beyond which performance declines. This suggests a trade-off between CO2 activation and potential site blocking or carbonate formation at higher pressures.

Key challenges in optimizing overall performance include:
1. Balancing CO2 activation with preventing excessive surface adsorption
2. Maintaining catalyst stability while maximizing activity
3. Optimizing metal-support interactions for ideal bond strengths and surface species
4. Tailoring pore structures and surface areas for efficient mass transfer
5. Mitigating coke formation and catalyst deactivation

The mechanistic pathways are influenced by the nature of the support, with different supports affecting the oxidation state, dispersion, and reducibility of chromium species. This impacts CO2 activation, oxygen mobility, and the redox cycle crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

支持材料对二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的性能有显著影响。SiO2支持提供最高的活性、选择性和稳定性，其次是ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2。负载催化剂性能优越归因于较低的再氧化速率和较强的金属-氧键。

反应条件，特别是CO2分压，起着至关重要的作用。增加CO2浓度可以提高产率，直到达到最佳比例，超过这个比例性能就会下降。这表明在CO2活化和可能的位点阻塞或高压下碳酸盐形成之间存在权衡。

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括：
1. 平衡CO2活化与防止过度表面吸附
2. 在最大化活性的同时保持催化剂稳定性
3. 优化金属-支持物相互作用，以获得理想的键强度和表面物种
4. 定制孔结构和表面积以实现高效的质量传递
5. 减轻积碳形成和催化剂失活

机理途径受支持物性质的影响，不同的支持物影响铬物种的氧化态、分散度和可还原性。这影响了CO2活化、氧移动性和对脱氢过程至关重要的氧化还原循环。
