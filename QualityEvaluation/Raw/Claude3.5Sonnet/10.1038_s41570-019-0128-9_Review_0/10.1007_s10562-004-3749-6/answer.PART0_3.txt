[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2-supported catalysts show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3-supported catalysts exhibit decreased yield and selectivity. This difference is attributed to the acidity/basicity of the support materials.

The reaction conditions, particularly the presence of CO2, affect the catalysts differently based on the support. For CrOx/SiO2, increasing CO2 content improves performance, while for CrOx/Al2O3, it has a poisonous effect. The chromium loading level also impacts the CO2 effect, with higher loadings increasing the promoting effect on SiO2 supports and decreasing the poisoning effect on Al2O3 supports.

A key challenge in optimizing overall performance is balancing the acidity/basicity of the catalyst surface. CO2 and steam produced during the reaction can modify these properties, particularly for Al2O3-supported catalysts. This suggests that careful control of reaction conditions and support material selection is crucial for achieving desired activity and selectivity.

The study does not provide information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or on specific mechanistic pathways. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the catalysts' performance across a broader range of supports and conditions.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料对铬氧化物催化剂的性能有显著影响。SiO2负载的催化剂在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而Al2O3负载的催化剂则表现出产率和选择性的降低。这种差异归因于载体材料的酸碱性。

反应条件，特别是CO2的存在，根据载体的不同对催化剂有不同的影响。对于CrOx/SiO2，增加CO2含量可以提高性能，而对于CrOx/Al2O3，它具有毒害效应。铬的负载量也会影响CO2的效果，在SiO2载体上，更高的负载量会增加促进效果，而在Al2O3载体上，则会降低毒害效果。

优化整体性能的一个关键挑战是平衡催化剂表面的酸碱性。反应过程中产生的CO2和水蒸气可以改变这些性质，特别是对于Al2O3负载的催化剂。这表明，仔细控制反应条件和选择合适的载体材料对于实现理想的活性和选择性至关重要。

该研究没有提供关于其他载体材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2）或具体反应机理途径的信息。需要进一步的研究来全面解决这些方面的问题，并在更广泛的载体和条件范围内优化催化剂的性能。
