[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "Over the whole temperature range the yield of propene was higher in the presence of CO2 then its absence. On the other hand, over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the yield and selectivity of propene"

[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst. CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

[4] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[5] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3 supports decrease both yield and selectivity. This difference is attributed to the acidity/basicity of the support materials.

For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, CO2 promotes propene yield across all tested temperatures. In contrast, CO2 has an adverse effect on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, decreasing both yield and selectivity. The poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is proposed to be due to the basicity of Al2O3.

Chromium loading levels also affect catalyst performance differently depending on the support. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium content leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, higher chromium loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

The key challenge appears to be balancing the acidity/basicity of the catalyst system to optimize CO2 promotion while maintaining high activity and selectivity. Trade-offs exist between support material choice, chromium loading, and reaction conditions to achieve optimal overall performance.

The study does not provide information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2, nor does it discuss mechanistic pathways in detail. Further research would be needed to comprehensively compare performance across a wider range of supports and elucidate precise mechanisms.

支撑材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。SiO2支撑体在CO2存在下可提高丙烯产率，而Al2O3支撑体则降低产率和选择性。这种差异归因于支撑材料的酸碱性。

对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，CO2在所有测试温度下都能促进丙烯产率。相反，CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂有不利影响，降低了产率和选择性。CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的毒性作用被认为是由于Al2O3的碱性造成的。

铬含量水平也会根据支撑体的不同而对催化剂性能产生不同影响。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬含量会导致CO2的促进作用更强。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，较高的铬含量会减少CO2的毒性作用。

主要挑战似乎是平衡催化剂系统的酸碱性，以优化CO2的促进作用，同时保持高活性和选择性。在支撑材料选择、铬含量和反应条件之间存在权衡，以实现最佳的整体性能。

该研究没有提供关于其他支撑材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2的信息，也没有详细讨论反应机理。需要进一步研究以全面比较更广泛的支撑材料的性能并阐明确切的机理。
