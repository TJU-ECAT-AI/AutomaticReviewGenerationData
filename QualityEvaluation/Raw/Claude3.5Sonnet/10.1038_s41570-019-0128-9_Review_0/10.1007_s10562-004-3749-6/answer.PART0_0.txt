[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst. CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[4] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports show a promoting effect of CO2, enhancing propene yield. In contrast, Al2O3 supports exhibit a poisonous effect of CO2, decreasing both yield and selectivity of propene.

The acidity/basicity of the oxide support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic properties. The basicity of Al2O3 is proposed to be responsible for the poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

Chromium loading levels also affect catalyst performance. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium loading increases the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, increasing loading decreases the poisoning effect of CO2.

Key challenges include optimizing support material selection and chromium loading to balance activity, selectivity, and stability. The trade-off between promoting effects on silica-based supports and poisonous effects on alumina-based supports must be carefully considered.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, or on the specific effects of CO2 partial pressure. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of these factors on catalyst performance and mechanistic pathways.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料显著影响铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。SiO2载体显示出CO2的促进作用，提高了丙烯产率。相比之下，Al2O3载体表现出CO2的毒化作用，降低了丙烯的产率和选择性。

氧化物载体的酸碱性在决定催化性能中起着关键作用。Al2O3的碱性被认为是导致CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂产生毒化作用的原因。

铬负载水平也影响催化剂性能。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬负载会增加He中产率与CO2中产率的比值。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，增加负载会减少CO2的毒化作用。

主要挑战包括优化载体材料选择和铬负载水平，以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。必须仔细考虑硅基载体上的促进作用与氧化铝基载体上的毒化作用之间的权衡。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2载体的信息，也没有提供CO2分压的具体影响。需要进一步研究以充分了解这些因素对催化剂性能和机理途径的影响。
