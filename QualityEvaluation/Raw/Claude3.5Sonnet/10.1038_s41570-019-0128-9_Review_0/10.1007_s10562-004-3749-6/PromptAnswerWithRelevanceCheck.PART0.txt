[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst. CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[4] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports show a promoting effect of CO2, enhancing propene yield. In contrast, Al2O3 supports exhibit a poisonous effect of CO2, decreasing both yield and selectivity of propene.

The acidity/basicity of the oxide support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic properties. The basicity of Al2O3 is proposed to be responsible for the poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

Chromium loading levels also affect catalyst performance. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium loading increases the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, increasing loading decreases the poisoning effect of CO2.

Key challenges include optimizing support material selection and chromium loading to balance activity, selectivity, and stability. The trade-off between promoting effects on silica-based supports and poisonous effects on alumina-based supports must be carefully considered.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2 supports, or on the specific effects of CO2 partial pressure. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of these factors on catalyst performance and mechanistic pathways.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料显著影响铬氧化物催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。SiO2载体显示出CO2的促进作用，提高了丙烯产率。相比之下，Al2O3载体表现出CO2的毒化作用，降低了丙烯的产率和选择性。

氧化物载体的酸碱性在决定催化性能中起着关键作用。Al2O3的碱性被认为是导致CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂产生毒化作用的原因。

铬负载水平也影响催化剂性能。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬负载会增加He中产率与CO2中产率的比值。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，增加负载会减少CO2的毒化作用。

主要挑战包括优化载体材料选择和铬负载水平，以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。必须仔细考虑硅基载体上的促进作用与氧化铝基载体上的毒化作用之间的权衡。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2载体的信息，也没有提供CO2分压的具体影响。需要进一步研究以充分了解这些因素对催化剂性能和机理途径的影响。

Chromium loading levels also impact catalyst performance. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium content leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2. Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, higher chromium loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

The key challenges in optimizing overall performance include balancing the acidity/basicity of the support material, managing the effects of CO2 and steam on the catalyst surface, and determining the optimal chromium loading for each support type. Trade-offs exist between promoting dehydrogenation activity and minimizing unwanted side reactions or catalyst deactivation.

The literature does not provide specific information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effects of CO2 partial pressure on the reaction. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and their impact on mechanistic pathways.

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括平衡载体材料的酸碱性、管理CO2和水蒸气对催化剂表面的影响，以及确定每种载体类型的最佳铬负载量。在促进脱氢活性和最小化不需要的副反应或催化剂失活之间存在权衡。

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3 supports decrease both yield and selectivity. This difference is attributed to the acidity/basicity of the support materials.

For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, CO2 promotes propene yield across all tested temperatures. In contrast, CO2 has an adverse effect on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, decreasing both yield and selectivity. The poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is proposed to be due to the basicity of Al2O3.

Chromium loading levels also affect catalyst performance differently depending on the support. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium content leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, higher chromium loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

The key challenge appears to be balancing the acidity/basicity of the catalyst system to optimize CO2 promotion while maintaining high activity and selectivity. Trade-offs exist between support material choice, chromium loading, and reaction conditions to achieve optimal overall performance.

The study does not provide information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2, nor does it discuss mechanistic pathways in detail. Further research would be needed to comprehensively compare performance across a wider range of supports and elucidate precise mechanisms.

支撑材料对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。SiO2支撑体在CO2存在下可提高丙烯产率，而Al2O3支撑体则降低产率和选择性。这种差异归因于支撑材料的酸碱性。

对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，CO2在所有测试温度下都能促进丙烯产率。相反，CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂有不利影响，降低了产率和选择性。CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的毒性作用被认为是由于Al2O3的碱性造成的。

铬含量水平也会根据支撑体的不同而对催化剂性能产生不同影响。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬含量会导致CO2的促进作用更强。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，较高的铬含量会减少CO2的毒性作用。

主要挑战似乎是平衡催化剂系统的酸碱性，以优化CO2的促进作用，同时保持高活性和选择性。在支撑材料选择、铬含量和反应条件之间存在权衡，以实现最佳的整体性能。

该研究没有提供关于其他支撑材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2的信息，也没有详细讨论反应机理。需要进一步研究以全面比较更广泛的支撑材料的性能并阐明确切的机理。

The support material has a significant influence on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2-supported catalysts show enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3-supported catalysts exhibit decreased yield and selectivity. This difference is attributed to the acidity/basicity of the support materials.

The reaction conditions, particularly the presence of CO2, affect the catalysts differently based on the support. For CrOx/SiO2, increasing CO2 content improves performance, while for CrOx/Al2O3, it has a poisonous effect. The chromium loading level also impacts the CO2 effect, with higher loadings increasing the promoting effect on SiO2 supports and decreasing the poisoning effect on Al2O3 supports.

A key challenge in optimizing overall performance is balancing the acidity/basicity of the catalyst surface. CO2 and steam produced during the reaction can modify these properties, particularly for Al2O3-supported catalysts. This suggests that careful control of reaction conditions and support material selection is crucial for achieving desired activity and selectivity.

The study does not provide information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or on specific mechanistic pathways. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize the catalysts' performance across a broader range of supports and conditions.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料对铬氧化物催化剂的性能有显著影响。SiO2负载的催化剂在CO2存在下显示出增强的丙烯产率，而Al2O3负载的催化剂则表现出产率和选择性的降低。这种差异归因于载体材料的酸碱性。

反应条件，特别是CO2的存在，根据载体的不同对催化剂有不同的影响。对于CrOx/SiO2，增加CO2含量可以提高性能，而对于CrOx/Al2O3，它具有毒害效应。铬的负载量也会影响CO2的效果，在SiO2载体上，更高的负载量会增加促进效果，而在Al2O3载体上，则会降低毒害效果。

优化整体性能的一个关键挑战是平衡催化剂表面的酸碱性。反应过程中产生的CO2和水蒸气可以改变这些性质，特别是对于Al2O3负载的催化剂。这表明，仔细控制反应条件和选择合适的载体材料对于实现理想的活性和选择性至关重要。

该研究没有提供关于其他载体材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2）或具体反应机理途径的信息。需要进一步的研究来全面解决这些方面的问题，并在更广泛的载体和条件范围内优化催化剂的性能。

The literature provides insights into how different support materials, particularly SiO2 and Al2O3, influence the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material has a strong effect on catalytic performance. CrOx/SiO2 catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit decreased yield and selectivity.

2. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects catalytic properties. The basicity of Al2O3 is proposed to cause the poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

3. Chromium loading levels impact the CO2 effect differently based on the support. For CrOx/SiO2, increasing Cr loading increases the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3, increasing Cr loading decreases the poisoning effect of CO2.

4. A key challenge is balancing the positive effects of CO2 on yield with potential negative impacts on selectivity, which varies depending on the support material.

5. The study does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2 supports, nor does it extensively explore the impact of CO2 partial pressure.

The main trade-off appears to be between enhanced yield and maintaining high selectivity, with the choice of support material playing a crucial role in determining overall catalyst performance.
