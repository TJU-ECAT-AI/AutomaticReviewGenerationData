[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst. CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3"

[4] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The literature provides insights into how different support materials, particularly SiO2 and Al2O3, influence the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material has a strong effect on catalytic performance. CrOx/SiO2 catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, while CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit decreased yield and selectivity.

2. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support strongly affects catalytic properties. The basicity of Al2O3 is proposed to cause the poisonous effect of CO2 on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

3. Chromium loading levels impact the CO2 effect differently based on the support. For CrOx/SiO2, increasing Cr loading increases the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2. For CrOx/Al2O3, increasing Cr loading decreases the poisoning effect of CO2.

4. A key challenge is balancing the positive effects of CO2 on yield with potential negative impacts on selectivity, which varies depending on the support material.

5. The study does not provide information on MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, or CeO2 supports, nor does it extensively explore the impact of CO2 partial pressure.

The main trade-off appears to be between enhanced yield and maintaining high selectivity, with the choice of support material playing a crucial role in determining overall catalyst performance.

该文献提供了关于不同支撑材料，特别是SiO2和Al2O3，如何影响氧化铬催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性和选择性的见解：

1. 支撑材料对催化性能有强烈影响。CrOx/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下显示出丙烯产率的提高，而CrOx/Al2O3催化剂则表现出产率和选择性的降低。

2. 氧化物支撑的酸碱性强烈影响催化特性。Al2O3的碱性被认为是导致CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂产生毒性效应的原因。

3. 铬负载水平对CO2效应的影响因支撑材料而异。对于CrOx/SiO2，增加Cr负载会增加He中产率与CO2中产率的比值。对于CrOx/Al2O3，增加Cr负载会减少CO2的毒性效应。

4. 一个关键挑战是平衡CO2对产率的积极影响与对选择性的潜在负面影响，这因支撑材料而异。

5. 该研究没有提供关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2或CeO2支撑的信息，也没有广泛探讨CO2分压的影响。

主要的权衡似乎是在提高产率和保持高选择性之间，而支撑材料的选择在决定催化剂整体性能方面起着关键作用。
