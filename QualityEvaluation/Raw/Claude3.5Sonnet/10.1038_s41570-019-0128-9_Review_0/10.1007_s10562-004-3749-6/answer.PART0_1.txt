[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."

[2] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support. It is proposed that poisonous effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is due to the basicity of Al2O3."

[3] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The support material significantly influences the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. SiO2 supports enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3 supports decrease both yield and selectivity. This difference is attributed to the acidity/basicity of the support materials.

The basicity of Al2O3 is proposed to cause the poisonous effect of CO2 on dehydrogenation activity. Additionally, CO2 and/or steam formed during the reaction may alter the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst surface, further affecting its performance.

Chromium loading levels also impact catalyst performance. For CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, increasing chromium content leads to a greater promoting effect of CO2. Conversely, for CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, higher chromium loading reduces the poisoning effect of CO2.

The key challenges in optimizing overall performance include balancing the acidity/basicity of the support material, managing the effects of CO2 and steam on the catalyst surface, and determining the optimal chromium loading for each support type. Trade-offs exist between promoting dehydrogenation activity and minimizing unwanted side reactions or catalyst deactivation.

The literature does not provide specific information on other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effects of CO2 partial pressure on the reaction. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and their impact on mechanistic pathways.

在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，载体材料对氧化铬催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性有显著影响。SiO2载体在CO2存在下能提高丙烯产率，而Al2O3载体则降低产率和选择性。这种差异归因于载体材料的酸碱性。

Al2O3的碱性被认为是导致CO2对脱氢活性产生毒害作用的原因。此外，反应过程中产生的CO2和/或水蒸气可能会改变CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表面的酸碱性，进一步影响其性能。

铬的负载量也影响催化剂性能。对于CrOx/SiO2催化剂，增加铬含量会导致CO2的促进作用更强。相反，对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，较高的铬负载量会减少CO2的毒害作用。

优化整体性能的主要挑战包括平衡载体材料的酸碱性、管理CO2和水蒸气对催化剂表面的影响，以及确定每种载体类型的最佳铬负载量。在促进脱氢活性和最小化不需要的副反应或催化剂失活之间存在权衡。

文献没有提供关于其他载体材料（如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2）或CO2分压对反应影响的具体信息。需要进一步研究才能充分解决这些方面及其对反应机理途径的影响。
