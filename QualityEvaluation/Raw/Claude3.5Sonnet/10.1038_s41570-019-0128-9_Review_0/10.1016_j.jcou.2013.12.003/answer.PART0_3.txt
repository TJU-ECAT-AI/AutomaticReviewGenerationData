[1] "Ceria-based mixed oxides are also receiving much attention as catalysts, supports, and promoters due to their high oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) and facile oxidation/reduction of the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple."

[2] "The presence of CeO2 promotes various catalytic reactions namely, CO2 activation [27], low-temperature watergas shift reaction [28], and so on."

[3] "Ge et al. have investigated the influence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with oxygen over VMgO catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products."

[4] "The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2."

[5] "The CZ support is a well-known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility [44]. The existence of Ce4+/Ce3+ was also confirmed by XPS."

The literature does not directly compare the performance of chromium oxide catalysts on various supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some insights on how support materials and reaction conditions can influence catalyst performance in related reactions:

1. Support materials: The study focuses on ceria-based mixed oxides as supports, highlighting their high oxygen storage capacity and facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry. These properties contribute to improved catalytic activity and stability.

2. CO2 partial pressure: An increase in CO2 partial pressure was found to improve selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products in a related study using VMgO catalysts.

3. Redox properties: The redox properties of the catalyst significantly influence catalytic activity in n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. Supports like ceria-zirconia mixed oxides that facilitate redox cycles can enhance catalyst performance.

4. Stability: The oxygen mobility in ceria-based supports helps prevent coke formation, which is a major deactivation pathway for these catalysts.

5. Mechanistic pathways: The study suggests that the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen (redox) type mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the dehydrogenation process and CO2 reoxidizes the reduced metal oxide.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely include balancing activity and selectivity, maintaining long-term stability, and mitigating coking. However, the document does not provide specific information on these aspects for chromium oxide catalysts on various supports.

虽然文献没有直接比较不同载体上铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能,但它确实提供了一些关于载体材料和反应条件如何影响相关反应中催化剂性能的见解:

1. 载体材料:研究主要关注基于氧化铈的混合氧化物作为载体,强调了它们的高氧储存能力和易于进行的Ce4+/Ce3+氧化还原化学。这些特性有助于提高催化活性和稳定性。

2. CO2分压:在一项相关的使用VMgO催化剂的研究中发现,增加CO2分压可以提高C4脱氢产物的选择性和产率。

3. 氧化还原性质:催化剂的氧化还原性质显著影响了CO2存在下正丁烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。像氧化铈-氧化锆混合氧化物这样能促进氧化还原循环的载体可以增强催化剂的性能。

4. 稳定性:基于氧化铈的载体中的氧移动性有助于防止焦炭形成,这是这类催化剂的主要失活途径。

5. 机理途径:研究表明,ODH反应通过Mars-van Krevelen(氧化还原)型机理进行,其中晶格氧参与脱氢过程,CO2再氧化还原后的金属氧化物。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡可能包括平衡活性和选择性、维持长期稳定性以及减少结焦。然而,该文献并未提供关于不同载体上的铬氧化物催化剂这些方面的具体信息。
