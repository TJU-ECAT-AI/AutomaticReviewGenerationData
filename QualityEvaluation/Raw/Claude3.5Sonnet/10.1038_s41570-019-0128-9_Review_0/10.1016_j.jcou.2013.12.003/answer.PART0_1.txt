[1] "Ge et al. have investigated the influence of CO2 in the ODH of nB with oxygen over VMgO catalyst [14]. It was found that an increase in CO2 partial pressure improves the selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products."

[2] "The poor performance of the catalysts in the presence of CO2 could be due to the lack of reoxidation efficiency of the catalyst surface or strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface [14,15]."

[3] "Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar [13]."

[4] "The high activity of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acidbase bifunctionality and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]."

[5] "CeO2V2O5 combination catalyst also showed a remarkably high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 [29]."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence the performance of catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, although it does not specifically focus on chromium oxide catalysts. Key points include:

1. CO2 partial pressure can impact selectivity and yield. Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to improve selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products in some cases.

2. The interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface is crucial. Poor catalyst performance can result from inefficient reoxidation of the catalyst surface or strong CO2 adsorption.

3. Mixed oxide supports can enhance catalyst performance. Mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts showed high activity due to superior acid-base bifunctionality and reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide.

4. Certain combinations of support and active components can be particularly effective. For example, CeO2-V2O5 catalysts demonstrated high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2.

5. The choice of support material can significantly influence catalyst behavior. Different supports like oxidized diamond showed promoting effects on conversion compared to simple dehydrogenation.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely involve balancing selectivity, activity, and stability while managing issues like catalyst surface reoxidation and CO2 adsorption. The specific interactions between the active component, support material, and CO2 appear to be critical factors in determining catalyst performance.

文献提供了一些关于不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解，尽管它并未特别关注铬氧化物催化剂。主要要点包括：

1. CO2分压可以影响选择性和产率。在某些情况下，增加CO2分压被发现可以提高C4脱氢产物的选择性和产率。

2. CO2与催化剂表面的相互作用至关重要。催化剂表面再氧化效率低或CO2强吸附可能导致催化剂性能不佳。

3. 混合氧化物支撑可以提高催化剂性能。混合氧化物支撑的钒氧化物催化剂由于分散钒氧化物的优越酸碱双功能性和可还原性而表现出高活性。

4. 某些支撑和活性组分的组合可能特别有效。例如，CeO2-V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下对芳烃的ODH反应表现出高活性和稳定性。

5. 支撑材料的选择可以显著影响催化剂行为。不同的支撑材料，如氧化金刚石，与简单脱氢相比，显示出对转化率的促进作用。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡可能涉及在平衡选择性、活性和稳定性的同时，管理诸如催化剂表面再氧化和CO2吸附等问题。活性组分、支撑材料和CO2之间的特定相互作用似乎是决定催化剂性能的关键因素。
