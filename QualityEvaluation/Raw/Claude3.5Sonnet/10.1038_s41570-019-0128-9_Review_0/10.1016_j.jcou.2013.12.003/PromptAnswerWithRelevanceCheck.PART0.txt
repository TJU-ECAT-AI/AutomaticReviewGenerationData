[1] "Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar [13]."

[2] "In our previous reports [12,17], a significantly high nB conversion and C4 olefins (1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene) selectivity were noted in the ODH of nB with CO2 as compared to dehydrogenation of nB with N2 over mixed metal oxide supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The high activity of mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts is mainly due to superior acidbase bifunctionality and reducibility of the dispersed vanadium oxide [12]. The existence of synergetic effect in mixed oxide materials plays an important role in enhancing the catalytic activity [12,18]."

[4] "The unique oxygen storage/release capacity and redox properties of CeO2 are known to suppress the deactivation of the catalysts under rigorous reaction conditions."

[5] "The TPR analysis clearly exemplified that the reduction peaks of both vanadium oxide supported samples reduced at lower temperatures compared to the bulk vanadium oxide."

[6] "Therefore, the redox cycle over vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts is an important factor in promoting the catalytic activity for ODH of nB with CO2 [43]. The CZ support is a well-known material for its facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry and oxygen mobility [44]."

The literature does not directly address the influence of various support materials like SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 on chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some insights on related catalysts and supports that can be extrapolated to answer parts of the question:

1. Support materials can significantly influence catalyst performance. Mixed metal oxide supports, particularly those containing CeO2, show promising results due to their redox properties and oxygen mobility.

2. The presence of CO2 as an oxidant generally promotes conversion compared to inert gases like Ar or N2 for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Key factors influencing catalyst performance include:
   - Acid-base bifunctionality of the support
   - Reducibility of the dispersed active metal oxide
   - Oxygen storage/release capacity
   - Redox properties

4. CeO2-containing supports demonstrate improved stability by suppressing catalyst deactivation under rigorous conditions.

5. The redox cycle of the active metal (e.g. vanadium) is crucial for promoting catalytic activity in ODH reactions with CO2.

6. Synergetic effects in mixed oxide materials play an important role in enhancing catalytic activity.

7. Supports can influence the reduction temperature of the active metal oxide, which can affect catalyst performance.

The main challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely involve balancing activity, selectivity, and stability while considering factors such as support acidity/basicity, redox properties, and resistance to deactivation. However, the document does not provide specific information on these challenges for chromium oxide catalysts.

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence the performance of catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, although it does not specifically focus on chromium oxide catalysts. Key points include:

1. CO2 partial pressure can impact selectivity and yield. Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to improve selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products in some cases.

2. The interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface is crucial. Poor catalyst performance can result from inefficient reoxidation of the catalyst surface or strong CO2 adsorption.

3. Mixed oxide supports can enhance catalyst performance. Mixed oxide supported vanadia catalysts showed high activity due to superior acid-base bifunctionality and reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide.

4. Certain combinations of support and active components can be particularly effective. For example, CeO2-V2O5 catalysts demonstrated high activity and stability for ODH of aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2.

5. The choice of support material can significantly influence catalyst behavior. Different supports like oxidized diamond showed promoting effects on conversion compared to simple dehydrogenation.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely involve balancing selectivity, activity, and stability while managing issues like catalyst surface reoxidation and CO2 adsorption. The specific interactions between the active component, support material, and CO2 appear to be critical factors in determining catalyst performance.

文献提供了一些关于不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响CO2氧化脱氢反应中催化剂性能的见解，尽管它并未特别关注铬氧化物催化剂。主要要点包括：

1. CO2分压可以影响选择性和产率。在某些情况下，增加CO2分压被发现可以提高C4脱氢产物的选择性和产率。

2. CO2与催化剂表面的相互作用至关重要。催化剂表面再氧化效率低或CO2强吸附可能导致催化剂性能不佳。

3. 混合氧化物支撑可以提高催化剂性能。混合氧化物支撑的钒氧化物催化剂由于分散钒氧化物的优越酸碱双功能性和可还原性而表现出高活性。

4. 某些支撑和活性组分的组合可能特别有效。例如，CeO2-V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下对芳烃的ODH反应表现出高活性和稳定性。

5. 支撑材料的选择可以显著影响催化剂行为。不同的支撑材料，如氧化金刚石，与简单脱氢相比，显示出对转化率的促进作用。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡可能涉及在平衡选择性、活性和稳定性的同时，管理诸如催化剂表面再氧化和CO2吸附等问题。活性组分、支撑材料和CO2之间的特定相互作用似乎是决定催化剂性能的关键因素。

[1] "Interestingly, promoting effect of CO2 on nB conversion was observed over Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported-oxidized diamond catalysts compared to simple dehydrogenation with Ar"

[2] "CO2 acts as a hydrogen acceptor (soft oxidant) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to shift the reaction equilibrium toward olefin side. It also offers several pronounced advantages to overcome deep oxidation, low product selectivity, and the formation of greenhouse gas CO2 as a byproduct"

The literature does not directly address chromium oxide catalysts, but provides some insights on similar catalytic systems for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Support materials like CeO2 can promote CO2 activation and suppress catalyst deactivation due to its oxygen storage/release capacity and redox properties. This suggests CeO2 could be a beneficial support for chromium oxide catalysts as well.

CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, shifting equilibrium towards olefin products. It helps overcome deep oxidation and low selectivity issues common in ODH reactions. 

Reaction conditions like CO2 partial pressure likely influence activity and selectivity, as CO2 promotes conversion compared to inert gases like Ar.

Key challenges include optimizing redox properties, as the literature notes these significantly influence catalytic activity. Supports that facilitate easier reduction of the active metal oxide (like vanadium in the examples given) tend to show higher activity.

Trade-offs may exist between activity, selectivity and stability. While CO2 can enhance conversion, catalyst deactivation remains an issue that needs to be addressed through support choice and reaction condition optimization.

More specific studies on chromium oxide catalysts would be needed to determine the exact influences of various supports and conditions on their performance in CO2 ODH reactions.

虽然文献没有直接讨论铬氧化物催化剂,但对于CO2氧化脱氢反应的类似催化体系提供了一些见解:

像CeO2这样的载体材料可以促进CO2的活化,并由于其氧储存/释放能力和氧化还原特性而抑制催化剂的失活。这表明CeO2也可能是铬氧化物催化剂的有益载体。

CO2作为一种软氧化剂,将平衡向烯烃产物方向移动。它有助于克服ODH反应中常见的深度氧化和低选择性问题。

CO2分压等反应条件可能会影响活性和选择性,因为与惰性气体(如Ar)相比,CO2可促进转化。

关键挑战包括优化氧化还原性能,因为文献指出这些显著影响催化活性。促进活性金属氧化物(如例子中的钒)更容易还原的载体往往表现出更高的活性。

活性、选择性和稳定性之间可能存在权衡。虽然CO2可以增强转化率,但催化剂失活仍然是一个需要通过载体选择和反应条件优化来解决的问题。

需要对铬氧化物催化剂进行更具体的研究,以确定各种载体和条件对其在CO2 ODH反应中的性能的确切影响。

The literature does not directly compare the performance of chromium oxide catalysts on various supports for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide some insights on how support materials and reaction conditions can influence catalyst performance in related reactions:

1. Support materials: The study focuses on ceria-based mixed oxides as supports, highlighting their high oxygen storage capacity and facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox chemistry. These properties contribute to improved catalytic activity and stability.

2. CO2 partial pressure: An increase in CO2 partial pressure was found to improve selectivity and yield of C4 dehydrogenation products in a related study using VMgO catalysts.

3. Redox properties: The redox properties of the catalyst significantly influence catalytic activity in n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. Supports like ceria-zirconia mixed oxides that facilitate redox cycles can enhance catalyst performance.

4. Stability: The oxygen mobility in ceria-based supports helps prevent coke formation, which is a major deactivation pathway for these catalysts.

5. Mechanistic pathways: The study suggests that the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen (redox) type mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the dehydrogenation process and CO2 reoxidizes the reduced metal oxide.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance likely include balancing activity and selectivity, maintaining long-term stability, and mitigating coking. However, the document does not provide specific information on these aspects for chromium oxide catalysts on various supports.
