Abstract
Ceria catalysts were found active and selective to the oxidehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with CO2 and the actual
contribution for C2H4 formation from heterogeneous catalysis was 7555% in the range 953993 K. The presence of calcium
ions in solid solution in the ceria crystalline network increased significatively the selectivity to ethene and the efficiency of
CO2 as oxidant in the heterogeneous reaction.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
To reach higher selectivities to desired products is
a main challenge in development of the catalytic pro-
cess of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
This is because various oxygen species are in dynamic
equilibrium together with oxygen in gas phase and
different oxidation reactions are taking place simulta-
neously. In order to avoid such complicated reaction
patterns, there are several reports which propose using
inert CO2 as an oxidant for the selective conversion
of alkanes C1C3 in olefins and syngas [16]. CO2
can dissociate on the catalyst surface to produce active
oxygen species as expressed in Eq. (1)
CO2 CO + O

erties of these catalysts can be modified by addition
of other oxides (Cr, Ca, K) and their use was studied
in the transformation of different organic compounds
(olefins, alcohols) [1]. Other catalytic systems like
PbOMgO [2] or La2O3ZnO [5] have been studied
in OCM with CO2, producing high selectivities to C2
products. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of reaction
of organic compounds with CO2 are not clear.
However, it is noteworthy that most data presented
in literature were obtained under high temperature
(around 1000 K), and certainly, under such a reaction
temperature, dehydrogenation of light alkane in gas
phase is seriously involved. For example, the ther-
modynamic equilibrium of ethane dehydrogenation at
1023 K is about 80%, whereas the equilibrium of the
reaction
C2H6 + CO2 C2H4 + CO + H2O
(2)
is about 57% at the same temperature. Therefore, it
is necessary and of significance to identify the real
contribution from heterogeneous catalysis.

In our initial study [7], we analysed the contribu-
tion of the homogeneous and heterogeneous processes
in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) with
CO2 on pure ceria. It was found that this is a real het-
erogeneous catalytic reaction over CeO2 catalysts. It
was concluded that CeO2 is active and selective for
the ODE with CO2. The redox Ce+4/Ce+3 of CeO2
can be used for the activation of CO2 and to produce
active oxygen species for the reaction.
In this communication, we study the ODE over
CeO2 and CaOCeO2 solid solution catalysts to iden-
tify the contribution from heterogeneous catalysis and
to analyse the role of the catalyst composition on the
heterogeneous reaction. We first studied the reaction
in the gas phase and analysed the role of CO2 in this
homogenous reaction. Based on these results, we will
study the contribution and the nature of the net het-
erogeneous reaction on both catalysts and the role of
calcium in the heterogeneous reaction selectivity will
be analysed.
2. Experimental
The ceria catalyst was prepared by precipitation
from a solution of cerium nitrate (C.P. grade) using
an oxalic acid solution (A.R. grade) as the precipi-
tant. The precipitate was filtrated, dried at 393 K for
4 h and calcined in air at 1123 K for 6 h. The mixed
CaOCeO2 catalyst with a calcium oxide content of
10 mol% (hereafter denoted 10CaCe) was prepared
by coprecipitation following the same procedure, but
calcining at 1373 K for 6 h. Surface areas, determined
by the BET method using Ar as adsorbate, were
2.3 and 1.1 m2/g, respectively. The calcined samples
were pressed, crushed and sieved into granules of
2040 mesh for further use.
X-ray diffractograms were obtained with a Rigaku
D/maxRB instrument at room temperature using the
Cu Ka radiation (40 kV and 100 mA, scanning rate
8/min). Raman spectra were obtained with an FT-
Raman Bruker RFS100 spectrometer using Nd-YAG
laser as excitation source. Spectra were obtained at
room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm1 by
averaging 100 scans.
The catalytic tests of ODE with CO2 were carried
out in a fixed-bed tubular, down flow reactor at
9731023 K, using a mixture C2H6/CO2/He=10/20/
170 ml/min, and a catalyst load of 1 g. Prior to the
test, the catalyst was pretreated at 1023 K in a flow
of mixture He/CO2 for 2 h. Then the reactor was
cooled down to the desired reaction temperature and
the feeding of reacting mixture was started. Blank
tests were conducted under the same conditions, by
substituting the catalyst for SiC particles of the same
size. Pre- and post-catalytic zones of the reactor were
filled with SiC bits to reduce the extent of gas-phase
reactions. The reactor effluent was analysed on line
by gas chromatography. In all cases, mass and carbon
balances were within 1003%. In the initial stage,
conversions of ethane and CO2 were calculated as-
suming that all hydrocarbons in the exit gas (C2H4
and CH4) came from the conversion of C2H6 while
CO came from CO2. Selectivities and differential
rates were calculated in the conventional way. The
reaction tests were carried out at short residence-time
to maintain the ethane conversion relatively low, in
such a way that the contribution from heterogeneous
catalysis to the title reaction may be estimated on the
basis of addition principle of the contributions from
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Homogeneous reaction
The reaction in the gas phase between ethane
and CO2 was studied in detail in a previous work
[8]. It was shown that conversion depended linearly
with residence times for total gas flows lower than
200 ml/min. At higher flows, this linearity disappears
indicating that the reaction goes on proceeding at the
post-catalytic volume, probably by dragging of rad-
ical intermediates by the gas flow. Accordingly, our
experiments here were conducted with a total gas flow
of 200 ml/min. The homogeneous reaction of ethane
and CO2 is mainly an ethane dehydrogenation, as the
products were ethene (selectivity about 95.2%), hy-
drogen, and minor amounts of methane at the higher
temperatures. The evolution of the yield of the prod-
ucts with the residence time allows to establish that
ethene and H2 are primary products while methane
is a secondary product formed by hydrocracking of
ethane according to the reaction
C2H6 + H2 2CH4

However, under all experimental conditions used in
this work, the highest conversion of CO2 observed in
the homogeneous reaction in the gas phase between
C2H6 and CO2 was only about 0.1%. This is indica-
tive that the homogeneous reaction between C2H6 and
CO2 was negligible, CO being formed at the higher
temperatures, probably by a reverse-water gas shift
reaction:
H2 + CO2 CO + H2O
(4)
Thus, CO2 is not activated in this gas-phase reaction.
To clarify its role in the reaction, we repeated the
same experiments but substituting the CO2 by inert
(i.e. C2H6+He mixture, 10:190 ml/min). The results
(Table 1) show clearly that CO2 acts as an inhibitor in
the gas-phase reaction.
3.2. Reaction in the presence of catalysts:
heterogeneous ODE
The results of the tests in the presence of each cata-
lyst are compared with those obtained in their absence
in Fig. 1. As it can be seen there, in the presence of
both catalysts, the conversion of ethene increases, but
the most relevant feature is that the dissociation reac-
tion of CO2 proceeds following the reaction equation
(1), its conversion being equal or higher than that
of ethane. The reaction products are the same in the
three cases, but their distribution varies: in the pres-
ence of catalysts, the yield of ethene increases while
that of methane shows practically no change. This
reveals that the cracking reaction proceeds only in the
gas phase and not on the catalyst surface.
Noteworthily, the catalytic activity was stable for
at least 80 h on stream. The catalytic results were
also reproducible after treatment with a mixture of He
and CO2 at 1023 K for 1 h. It was observed that after
catalytic tests, the catalyst samples remained white,
which points to the absence of carbon formation on
their surface during the reaction.
As CO2 does not participate in the homogeneous
reaction, we may assume that the homogeneous and
heterogeneous reactions are independent, and the con-
tribution of the net heterogeneous reaction may be es-
timated by calculating the rates of product formation
by difference between the values for the overall and
the homogenous reactions. The results of this calcu-
lation are shown in Fig. 2.
It is clear from the figure that ceria-based catalysts
show a fairly good catalytic performance for the ODE
with CO2. The reaction may be expressed as Eq. (2).
However, the ratio between the rates of formation of
the main products and the product distribution from
the heterogeneous reaction is different on each cata-
lyst. On pure ceria, the rate of CO formation exceeds
that of ethene formation. Taking into account the sto-
ichiometry of reaction (2), this result involves the si-
multaneous presence of a heterogeneous unselective
oxidation of ethane to CO. Since no carbon deposit
was found on the ceria surface, according to Ref. [9],
we may suggest a non-selective catalytic reaction as
follows:
C2H6+5CO2 7CO + 3H2O
(5)
Heterogeneous reactions (2) and (5) separate the het-
erogeneous depletion rates of C2H6 and CO2 and the

formation rate of CO into two parts: one is selective
and responsible for the formation of C2H4, and the
other is non-selective and leads to the production of
CO. The corresponding apparent activation energies
and the reaction order with respect to C2H6 are listed
in Table 2. The apparent activation energy for reaction
(2) is in the range of the ODE with gaseous O2 over

various catalysts [10]. The reaction order with respect
to C2H6 is 0.950.05, which is reasonable. All these
confirm that the analysis for the reaction is correct.
Taking into account the different stoichiometry
between ethane and CO2 in the two heterogeneous re-
actions (2) and (5) and their formation rates, it is pos-
sible to calculate the effectiveness of CO2 for selective
oxidation (i.e. the percentage of CO2 taking part in the
selective ODE reaction (2)) and the actual contribution
from heterogeneous ODE with CO2 to the formation

of C2H4 over CeO2. In the range 9531023 K, the CO2
is of 2227% and the selectivity to ethene of 5865%.
3.3. Influence of calcium in the catalytic activity
At a variance of ceria, over CaOCeO2, the rate of
heterogeneous formation of ethene is rather close to
that of CO (Fig. 2), and similar to that observed on
pure ceria. This implies that the main effect of the
presence of calcium in the catalyst is to inhibit the
non-selective oxidation (5). In fact, the calculated ef-
fectiveness of CO2 increases to 6075% and the het-
erogeneous selectivity to ethene to 8894%. On the
other hand, taking into account their different specific
surface areas, the areal activity of 10CaCe is almost
twofold than that of pure ceria.
X-ray diffractograms of both the pure ceria and
the mixed catalyst were practically identical, showing
only the reflections corresponding to a cubic CeO2
phase (JCPDS file 34-394, cerianite). This result
agrees well with those of Zhang and Baerns [11]
who reported that for mixed calciumcerium oxides,
a fluorite-type CaOCeO2 solid solution was formed
for low Ca content. They also reported that over the
entire range of CaO contents (0100%), the XPS sur-
face composition was approximately the same as the
bulk. The formation of a solid solution in the ceria
network is further evidenced by the Raman spectra:
the spectrum of 10CaCe sample shows only the very
strong peak at 465 cm1 characteristic of CeO2, but
broader than in the pure-ceria spectrum, and the mi-
nor, very weak peak at 609 cm1 of ceria appears
as a small shoulder to the main peak. This supports
the interpretation of a uniformly distributed Ca in the
catalyst.
Zhang and Baerns [11] found that the selectivity to
C2 hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane
(OCM) over these catalysts varied with CaO contents
in parallel to the variation of oxygen-ion conduc-
tivity. This parameter increased linearly with CaO
content up to a maximum for 20 mol% of CaO. Very
recently, Wang et al. [6] reported that CO2 increased
the selectivity to C2 products in the OCM with CO2
over a CaOCeO2 (atomic ratio Ca/Ce=0.5) catalyst.
Although the contribution of the homogeneous reac-
tions, and therefore, the effect of CO2 on them were
not analysed, the authors showed by CO2-TPD stud-
ies that the desorption peak of CO2 shifted to higher
temperatures when the CO2 partial pressure in the gas
phase increased. They interpreted this as being indica-
tive of the existence of a pool of chemisorbed-CO2
on the catalysts surface.
In our case, we may assume that the presence of
Ca in the solid solution of catalyst 10CaCe causes
an increase of oxygen-ion mobility which leads to a
change in the nature of the main oxygen species in
the surface during the reaction. Besides, the surface
basicity must be increased by the presence of Ca. The
combination of these two factors could be responsible
for a quicker desorption of the formed olefin, thus
favouring the selectivity to ethene.
4. Conclusions
Our present study shows evidence that the ODE
with CO2 over ceria-based catalysts is a heteroge-
neous catalytic reaction. The reaction is rather com-
plicated because of the coexistence of homogeneous
dehydrogenation in the gas phase and heterogeneous
catalysis on the catalyst surface. In the ODE with CO2
over CeO2 catalyst, CeO2 plays the role of a redox
catalyst. Therefore, we suggest that the catalytic reac-
tion is carried out via the reduction of the catalyst by
C2H6 and its oxidation by CO2, expressed as follows:
or expressed in the following equations:
2CeO2 + C2H6 Ce2O3 + C2H4 + H2O
(6)
Ce2O3 + CO2 2CeO2 + CO
(7)
The overall reaction, i.e. (6)+(7), is reaction (2).
Therefore, the redox properties and the ability to
store and release oxygen of CeO2 are also seen when
CO2 is used as an oxygen source and/or oxidant in
48

the ODE. The selectivity to olefin is highly increased
by the solid solution of calcium ions in the cubic
framework of CeO2.
The features for this reaction are that the selectivity
to C2H4 of the heterogeneous reaction can be higher
than 90% under a proper catalyst composition and re-
action condition, and that in addition to H2O, CO is
the only non-selective product. As presently available
technologies may use CO as raw material, the prac-
tical application of this type of reaction could lead
to processes that could make use of the 100% of the
carbon-containing products.
Summarizing, ceria-based catalysts are able to ac-
tivate CO2 and to use it as a selective oxidant for the
oxidehydrogenation of ethane. A more detailed study
on the oxidehydrogenation of other light alkanes with
CO2 on CeO2 and CeO2-based catalysts is now un-
derway.
