[1] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Support materials: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond showed the most promising results for supporting chromium oxide catalysts. Other supports mentioned include various oxides, zeolites, and active carbon.

Chromium loading: The optimal chromium loading appears to be in the range of 1.7-8.0 wt%. Higher loadings (>3.0 wt%) led to the formation of Cr(III) oxide, while lower loadings resulted in more dispersed chromates, which correlated with higher catalyst activity.

Reaction conditions: Adding oxygen (up to 5.0 vol%) to the reaction mixture significantly increased catalyst activity and stability. This resulted in some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity, but increased selectivity towards lighter olefins, leading to an overall increase in total olefin selectivity.

Key challenges and trade-offs:
1. Balancing chromium loading to optimize dispersion and activity while avoiding Cr(III) oxide formation.
2. Managing the trade-off between increased activity/stability and potential loss of selectivity when adding oxygen to the reaction mixture.
3. Optimizing support materials to enhance catalyst performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding other support materials like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and the specific effects of CO2 partial pressure on catalyst performance.

该文献提供了一些关于不同载体材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

载体材料：SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石显示出最有前景的氧化铬催化剂载体效果。其他提到的载体包括各种氧化物、分子筛和活性炭。

铬负载量：最佳铬负载量似乎在1.7-8.0 wt%范围内。较高的负载量（>3.0 wt%）导致Cr(III)氧化物的形成，而较低的负载量则产生更分散的铬酸盐，这与更高的催化剂活性相关。

反应条件：向反应混合物中添加氧气（最高5.0 vol%）显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。这导致丙烯和异丁烯选择性略有下降，但增加了对较轻烯烃的选择性，从而导致总烯烃选择性增加。

主要挑战和权衡：
1. 平衡铬负载量，以优化分散性和活性，同时避免Cr(III)氧化物的形成。
2. 在添加氧气到反应混合物时，管理活性/稳定性增加与潜在选择性损失之间的权衡。
3. 优化载体材料以增强催化剂性能。

文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响或详细机理途径的具体信息。需要进行更多研究以全面解答问题的所有方面，特别是关于其他载体材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2，以及CO2分压对催化剂性能的具体影响。
