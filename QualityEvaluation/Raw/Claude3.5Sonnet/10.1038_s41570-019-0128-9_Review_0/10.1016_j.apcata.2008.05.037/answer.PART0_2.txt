[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions:

Support materials: Among various supports tested (oxides, zeolites, active carbon, diamond), silica (SiO2) showed the most promising results, including in mesoporous form. Diamond was also mentioned as an effective support.

Chromium loading: A 5.0 wt% Cr loading exhibited the highest activity, selectivity, and stability.

Reaction conditions: Adding oxygen (up to 5.0 vol%) to the reaction mixture significantly increased catalyst activity and stability. This resulted in some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity but increased overall olefin selectivity due to higher selectivity towards lighter olefins.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Higher activity may come at the cost of decreased selectivity for specific products.

2. Optimizing oxygen content: While oxygen improves activity and stability, it can affect product distribution.

3. Choosing appropriate support material: Different supports can significantly impact catalyst performance.

4. Determining optimal chromium loading: The amount of chromium affects activity, selectivity, and stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways for different support materials. More comprehensive studies comparing various supports and reaction conditions would be needed to fully address the question.

文献对二氧化碳氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料和反应条件的影响提供了一些见解：

载体材料：在测试的各种载体中（氧化物、分子筛、活性炭、金刚石），二氧化硅（SiO2）显示出最有前景的结果，包括其介孔形式。金刚石也被提到是一种有效的载体。

铬含量：5.0 wt%的铬含量展现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

反应条件：向反应混合物中添加氧气（最高5.0 vol%）显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。这导致丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降，但由于对轻质烯烃的选择性提高，总烯烃选择性增加。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：更高的活性可能会以特定产品选择性降低为代价。

2. 优化氧气含量：虽然氧气改善了活性和稳定性，但它可能影响产品分布。

3. 选择适当的载体材料：不同的载体可能会显著影响催化剂性能。

4. 确定最佳铬含量：铬的含量影响活性、选择性和稳定性。

文献没有提供关于二氧化碳分压影响或不同载体材料详细机理途径的具体信息。需要更全面的研究来比较各种载体和反应条件，以充分回答这个问题。
