[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Support materials: Among various supports tested (oxides, zeolites, active carbon, diamond), silica (SiO2) showed the most promising results, including in mesoporous form. Diamond was also mentioned as an effective support.

Chromium loading: A Cr loading of 5.0 wt% exhibited the highest activity, selectivity, and stability.

Reaction conditions: Adding oxygen (up to 5.0 vol%) to the reaction mixture significantly increased catalyst activity and stability. This resulted in some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity, but increased selectivity towards lighter olefins, leading to higher total olefin selectivity.

Key challenges and trade-offs:
1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Adding oxygen increases activity but may decrease selectivity for specific olefins.
2. Optimizing Cr loading: Finding the optimal Cr loading (around 5.0 wt% in this case) to maximize performance.
3. Support selection: Choosing the most suitable support material to enhance catalyst performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure or detailed mechanistic pathways. More research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding the effects of different supports like MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2.

文献提供了一些关于不同支撑材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的氧化铬催化剂的见解：

支撑材料：在测试的各种支撑材料中（氧化物、沸石、活性炭、金刚石），二氧化硅（SiO2）显示出最有前景的结果，包括其介孔形式。金刚石也被提及为有效的支撑材料。

铬负载量：5.0 wt%的铬负载量表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

反应条件：向反应混合物中添加氧气（最高5.0 vol%）显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。这导致丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降，但增加了对较轻烯烃的选择性，从而提高了总烯烃选择性。

主要挑战和权衡：
1. 平衡活性和选择性：添加氧气可以提高活性，但可能会降低对特定烯烃的选择性。
2. 优化铬负载量：找到最佳的铬负载量（在本例中约为5.0 wt%）以最大化性能。
3. 支撑材料选择：选择最合适的支撑材料以提高催化剂性能。

文献未提供关于二氧化碳分压影响或详细反应机理途径的具体信息。需要进行更多研究以全面解答问题的所有方面，特别是关于不同支撑材料如MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2的影响。
