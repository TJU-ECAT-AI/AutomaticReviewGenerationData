[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%."

[5] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."

[6] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

The literature provides some insights into how different support materials and reaction conditions influence chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

Support materials: Among various supports tested (oxides, zeolites, active carbon, diamond), SiO2 and diamond showed the most promising results for chromium-based catalysts. Mesoporous SiO2 was also effective. The optimal chromium loading was found to be in the range of 1.7-8.0 wt%.

Reaction conditions: Adding oxygen (up to 5.0 vol%) to the reaction mixture significantly increased catalyst activity and stability. However, this led to a slight decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity, but increased overall olefin selectivity due to higher production of lighter olefins.

Mechanistic insights: The catalyst activity correlated with more dispersed chromate species. Cr(VI) species (mono-, di-, and polychromates) were present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide formed only at higher Cr loadings (>3.0 wt%).

Key challenges and trade-offs:
1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Adding oxygen improves activity and stability but affects product distribution.
2. Optimizing chromium loading: Higher loadings may lead to Cr(III) oxide formation, potentially affecting catalyst performance.
3. Choosing appropriate support: Different supports can influence chromium dispersion and oxidation state, affecting catalyst performance.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how CO2 partial pressure influences the reaction or detailed comparisons between all mentioned support materials. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects and optimize overall catalyst performance.

该文献提供了一些关于不同载体材料和反应条件如何影响二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的铬氧化物催化剂的见解：

载体材料：在测试的各种载体（氧化物、沸石、活性炭、金刚石）中，SiO2和金刚石对铬基催化剂显示出最有前景的结果。介孔SiO2也很有效。最佳的铬负载量在1.7-8.0 wt%范围内。

反应条件：向反应混合物中添加氧气（最高5.0 vol%）显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。然而，这导致丙烯和异丁烯选择性略有下降，但由于轻质烯烃产量增加，总体烯烃选择性反而提高。

机理见解：催化剂活性与更分散的铬酸盐物种相关。所有催化剂中都存在Cr(VI)物种（单铬酸盐、双铬酸盐和多铬酸盐），而Cr(III)氧化物仅在较高的Cr负载量（>3.0 wt%）下形成。

主要挑战和权衡：
1. 平衡活性和选择性：添加氧气可以提高活性和稳定性，但会影响产品分布。
2. 优化铬负载量：更高的负载量可能导致Cr(III)氧化物的形成，可能影响催化剂性能。
3. 选择适当的载体：不同的载体可以影响铬的分散性和氧化态，从而影响催化剂性能。

该文献并未提供CO2分压如何影响反应的全面信息，也没有详细比较所有提到的载体材料。需要进一步研究以全面解决这些方面并优化催化剂的整体性能。
