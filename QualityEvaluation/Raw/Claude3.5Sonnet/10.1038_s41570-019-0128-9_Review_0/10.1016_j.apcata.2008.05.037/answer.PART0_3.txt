[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."

[2] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2, but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."

[3] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

[4] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."

[5] "Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."

The literature provides some insights into the influence of support materials and reaction conditions on chromium oxide catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: SiO2 (including mesoporous forms) and diamond showed the most promising results among various supports tested, including oxides, zeolites, and active carbon. 

2. Chromium loading: A Cr loading of 5.0 wt% exhibited the highest activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. Reaction conditions: Adding oxygen (up to 5.0 vol%) to the reaction mixture significantly increased catalyst activity and stability. This resulted in some decrease in propene and isobutene selectivity but increased overall olefin selectivity due to higher selectivity towards lighter olefins.

4. CO2 partial pressure: The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure.

Key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing overall performance include:

1. Balancing activity and selectivity: Adding oxygen increases activity and stability but may decrease selectivity for specific olefins.

2. Optimizing support material and Cr loading: Different supports and Cr loadings affect catalyst performance, requiring careful optimization.

3. Controlling product distribution: The reaction conditions influence the distribution of lighter and heavier olefins, which needs to be managed based on desired outcomes.

The literature does not provide detailed information on mechanistic pathways or specific comparisons between different support materials beyond SiO2 and diamond. More research would be needed to fully address the influence of various supports and reaction conditions on mechanistic pathways and to comprehensively compare performance across different support materials.

文献为二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料和反应条件的影响提供了一些见解：

1. 载体材料：在测试的各种载体中，包括氧化物、沸石和活性炭，SiO2（包括介孔形式）和金刚石显示出最有前景的结果。

2. 铬负载量：5.0 wt%的Cr负载表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 反应条件：向反应混合物中添加氧气（最高5.0 vol%）显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。这导致丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降，但由于对轻质烯烃的选择性提高，总烯烃选择性增加。

4. CO2分压：文献没有提供关于CO2分压影响的具体信息。

优化整体性能的主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡活性和选择性：添加氧气会提高活性和稳定性，但可能降低特定烯烃的选择性。

2. 优化载体材料和Cr负载量：不同的载体和Cr负载量会影响催化剂性能，需要仔细优化。

3. 控制产物分布：反应条件影响轻质和重质烯烃的分布，需要根据所需结果进行管理。

文献没有提供关于机理途径的详细信息，也没有提供除SiO2和金刚石之外的不同载体材料之间的具体比较。需要进行更多研究以全面解决各种载体和反应条件对机理途径的影响，并全面比较不同载体材料的性能。
