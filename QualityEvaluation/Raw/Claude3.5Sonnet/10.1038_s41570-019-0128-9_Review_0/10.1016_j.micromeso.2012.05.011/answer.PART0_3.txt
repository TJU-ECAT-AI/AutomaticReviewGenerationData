[1] "Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."

[2] "The high-surface-area supports provide more adsorption sites which may stabilize the redox Cr species. Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts."

[3] "Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."

[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties."

[5] "In addition, it is known that the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS) can proceed over redox and nonredox Cr sites [18,23,39]. This reaction enhances the yield of propene by consumption of hydrogen which is produced in the nonoxidative pathway (in equilibrium propane dehydrogenation, Scheme 1)."

The support material and reaction conditions significantly influence the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support materials: High-surface-area mesoporous supports like SBA-1, MCM-41, and SBA-15 provide more adsorption sites to stabilize redox Cr species, leading to better catalytic performance. These supports allow for higher Cr dispersion and delayed formation of less active Cr2O3 crystallites compared to traditional silica supports.

2. CO2 partial pressure: Increasing CO2 concentration enhances propene yield and catalyst stability. CO2 acts as a weak oxidizing agent, helping to regenerate reduced chromium sites and shift the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation products.

3. Activity and selectivity: The activity of chromium catalysts depends on the concentration of high-valent redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+). These species participate in redox cycles responsible for high catalytic activity. Selectivity to propene is generally high (85-93%) for chromium catalysts on mesoporous supports.

4. Stability: CO2 improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation. However, higher CO2 concentrations can lead to faster catalyst darkening due to increased propene reactivity.

5. Mechanistic pathways: The main pathway involves redox cycles between oxidized (CrOx) and reduced (CrOx-1) chromium species. Additionally, the reverse water-gas shift reaction occurs over both redox and non-redox Cr sites, enhancing propene yield by consuming hydrogen.

Key challenges and trade-offs include:

1. Balancing Cr loading to maximize active species while avoiding formation of less active Cr2O3 crystallites.
2. Optimizing CO2 concentration to enhance propene yield and stability without accelerating catalyst deactivation.
3. Developing supports that provide high surface area and thermal stability while maintaining accessibility to active sites.
4. Minimizing irreversible deactivation caused by loss of redox Cr species or pore structure collapse during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

支持材料和反应条件显著影响了铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 支持材料：高比表面积的介孔支持材料如SBA-1、MCM-41和SBA-15提供了更多的吸附位点来稳定氧化还原铬物种，从而带来更好的催化性能。与传统的二氧化硅支持相比，这些支持材料允许更高的铬分散度，并延迟了活性较低的Cr2O3晶体的形成。

2. CO2分压：增加CO2浓度可以提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。CO2作为一种弱氧化剂，有助于再生还原的铬位点，并将平衡向脱氢产物方向移动。

3. 活性和选择性：铬催化剂的活性取决于高价氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+）的浓度。这些物种参与负责高催化活性的氧化还原循环。对于介孔支持的铬催化剂，丙烯的选择性通常很高（85-93%）。

4. 稳定性：CO2通过抑制积碳形成来提高催化剂稳定性。然而，较高的CO2浓度可能导致催化剂变黑速度加快，这是由于丙烯反应性增加。

5. 机理途径：主要途径涉及氧化态（CrOx）和还原态（CrOx-1）铬物种之间的氧化还原循环。此外，逆水气变换反应在氧化还原和非氧化还原铬位点上进行，通过消耗氢气来增加丙烯产率。

主要挑战和权衡包括：

1. 平衡铬负载量，以最大化活性物种，同时避免形成活性较低的Cr2O3晶体。
2. 优化CO2浓度，以提高丙烯产率和稳定性，同时不加速催化剂失活。
3. 开发提供高比表面积和热稳定性的支持材料，同时保持活性位点的可接近性。
4. 最小化在多次反应-再生循环过程中由于氧化还原铬物种损失或孔结构崩塌导致的不可逆失活。
