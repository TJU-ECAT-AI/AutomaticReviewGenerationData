Methane activation: the past and future
Pei Tang,a Qingjun Zhu,b Zhaoxuan Wua and Ding Ma*a
The conversion of methane to more valuable chemicals is one of the most intensively studied topics in
catalysis. The direct conversion of methane is attractive because the process is simple, but unfortunately
its products are chemicals that are more reactive than methane. The current status of this research field
is discussed with an emphasis on CH bond activation and future challenges.
1.
Introduction
Methane is the main component in natural gas and methane
clathrates, and with the depletion of petroleum reserves, it will
become the most important hydrocarbon feedstock for the
synthesis of fuels and chemicals. The development of hydraulic
fracturing technology and the possible exploitation of shale gas
have significantly increased the recoverable reserves and
supplies of natural gas.1 Consequently, chemical processes
based on methane activation are getting more economically
attractive. Nevertheless, because most of the methane is burned
for heating and electrical generation and a tiny fraction is used
as a fuel in vehicles, the carbon and hydrogen contents in this
hydrocarbon resource are not utilized to their full potential in
the chemical industry.2 This is because methane, with the
highest hydrogen to carbon atom ratio among the hydrocar-
bons, has four strong and localized CH bonds (bond energy of
413 kJ mol1), and the absence of low-energy empty orbitals and
high-energy filled orbitals makes it difficult for methane to
readily participate in a chemical reaction.
Presently, in industry, methane is transformed into bulk
chemicals by the indirect route. That is, methane is converted
into syngas (CO + H2) at an elevated temperature (>973 K),3,4 and
then the syngas is used to make a wide spectrum of hydrocar-
bons or alcohols with the use of catalysts.5,6 The process is
energy intensive and the cost is high, and so it would be useful
to lower the reaction temperature for the transformation of
methane into chemicals. Ironically, the direct conversion of
methane to derivatives, e.g., methanol, is thermodynamically
feasible, but kinetically difficult.7,8 Moreover, methanol or some
other products or intermediates are more reactive than the CH4
reactant, and so the kinetic protection or the selective separa-
tion of the product is necessary, which leads to more challenges
in the chemical process. However, much effort has been
devoted to direct methane conversion to produce the desired
chemicals in high yields in order to make the direct conversion
process economically competitive with the indirect route. Many
researchers have given examples of how CH bond conversion
can be controlled with the use of catalysts and the correct
reaction environment. The ultimate goal of these studies is the
development of strategies to exploit methane resources more
efficiently and cleanly.
The scope of this mini-review is limited to the one-step
reaction of methane conversion. We restrict our discussion to
reactions that have been clearly shown to involve CH bond
scission and the subsequent functionalization of the carbon
atom in methane. The examples include reactions that are in
the initial stage of fundamental study and those that have been
used in industrial applications for years. We categorized our
reactions into four types on the basis of the degree of CH bond
removal and the oxidation states of the carbon atom in the final
product: (1) complete CH bond removal from methane and
partial oxidation of the carbon atom; (2) complete CH bond
removal from methane to give carbon black and hydrogen; (3)
partial CH bond removal from methane and further CC
coupling reaction to form chemicals such as C2 hydrocarbons
and aromatics; and (4) partial CH bond removal and their
substitution by heteroatom functional groups. The examples
discussed are chosen to illustrate how methane activity is
controlled by the use of different catalysts, oxidants or the
reaction environment. A detailed understanding of CH bond
activation in direct methane conversion is crucial for process
development.

the partial oxidation of carbon:

The complete oxidation of methane at low temperatures is
thermodynamically favorable. More important is that the
resulting mixture of CO2 and H2O is of less value in the

chemical industry, whereas converting methane to syngas (CO +
H2) with an oxidant is much more attractive than the complete
oxidation of methane.9 These processes of converting methane
to syngas are called the reforming of methane. The reforming of
methane to syngas (CO + H2) is the most important industrial
process that utilizes methane in large scale industrial applica-
tions at present. Syngas, which is a very versatile intermediate,
can be used in methanol synthesis with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts
or in FischerTropsch synthesis on Fe, Co or Ru catalysts to
produce hydrocarbons.6,10 The first process has better atomic
economy since the oxygen atom in CO is included in the
product, whereas the oxygen atom of CO and some hydrogen
atoms are wasted in the form of water in FischerTropsch
synthesis.
There are three possible reforming processes for the
conversion of methane to syngas: steam reforming shown in
eqn (1), CO2 reforming (dry reforming) shown in eqn (2), and
partial oxidation of methane to syngas shown in eqn (3). These
three reforming processes produce syngas with different CO/H2
ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3).

Thermodynamics indicate that steam reforming and dry
reforming hardly occur at low temperatures (<450 K). Indeed, both
the reactions of steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane
to syngas favor the production of CO2 and H2 rather than CO and
H2 according to the thermodynamic equilibrium as shown in
Fig. 1. Also, high pressure reaction conditions neither favor the
formation of CO and H2 nor the conversion of methane.11 The
thermodynamic data of the reaction of partial oxidation of
methane to syngas are shown in Fig. 1. At high temperatures
(11001300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,
these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90%
methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2.
However, high temperature reaction conditions mean that the
costs are very high in the industrial operations.
The steam reforming of methane is a well-established
process in industry. This process is widely used to produce
syngas for methanol synthesis, and hydrogen for ammonia
synthesis and refining processes. About 48% of the hydrogen in
the world is produced by steam reforming.12 However, hot spots
in the catalyst bed and high temperature reaction conditions
cause difficulties in the operation, and excess steam is needed
to suppress the formation of coke.11 In contrast, CO2 reforming
consumes two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) to make the
valuable syngas. This reaction not only mitigates CO2 and CH4
emission but also provides an effective way to utilize low grade
natural gas resources consisting of CH4 and CO2, e.g., coal bed
gas. Nevertheless, the catalyst is readily deactivated, and excess
CO2 has to be used to remove the coke.4,13 Interestingly, the
reaction of partial oxidation of methane to syngas is the only
methane reforming process that is exothermic with an optimal
CO : H2 ratio (1 : 2) in the reaction product, but this reaction
still needs high temperatures (11001200 K) in order to obtain
CO and H2. The main problems in the partial oxidation of
methane to syngas are safety issues. First, a mixture of methane
and oxygen is extremely dangerous in industrial application.
Second, the partial oxidation of methane to syngas is only
autonomous at high temperature, where the reaction is very
difficult to control. Finally, hot spots formed in this autono-
mous oxidative process are difficult to handle and would result
in local overheating.3,4 In addition to these issues, the stability
of the catalyst is another factor that prevents this process from
being industrialized. In order to overcome the catalyst deacti-
vation problem, the catalysts are carefully designed, particularly
in the choice and modification of the support and the addition
of auxiliary metals.6,14 It was found that the metal crystallite size
strongly affects the coke formation rate.15 When Ni particles are
smaller than 1 nm, almost no coke is formed on the metal
surface.16
It is interesting to note that all three reforming processes
show similar orders of activity on different catalysts. Most of the
initial research focused on the noble catalysts of Rh, Ir, Pt, Ru
and Pd, with Ru and Rh being the most active.3 For non-noble
metals, Ni-based catalysts have the highest catalytic activity and
their activity is even comparable to those of the noble metal
catalysts in all three reforming processes.17 The similarities
among these reforming processes18 make it possible to combine
two or three of these reforming reactions to adjust the final
CO : H2 ratio in the product as the three reforming reactions

give different CO : H2 ratios. These combined reforming reac-
tions are called bi-/tri-reforming processes. For example, Olah
et al. suggested that bi-reforming of methane to syngas with a
CO : H2 ratio of 1 : 2 is possible under high pressures, and this
can be used directly in methanol synthesis.19 The tri-reforming
process is more economical if the exothermic partial oxidation
process is combined with the endothermic steam reforming
and CO2 reforming, which can give a new reaction route to
prevent hot spots and coke formation in the reaction.20 In
addition to the catalytic reforming reactions above, the non-
catalytic

partial
oxidation
of
methane
for
synthesis gas production, even though kinetically unfavorable,
is also well-established and applied.21

Complete CH bond removal:
production of C and H2
The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure
hydrogen and solid carbon, shown in eqn (4), is another process
for the transformation of methane with high selectivity. Unlike
the reforming processes, the TCD process only produces solid
carbon and hydrogen. The absence of CO or CO2 implies a
simple gas product separation process yielding high quality
hydrogen. Meanwhile, different types of carbon, such as
amorphous carbons, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes
(see Fig. 2) and layered carbon materials, can be produced
depending on the operating conditions.22,23 The TCD process
offers a convenient way to maximize the production of hydrogen
gas from the methane molecule, and many forms of value-
added carbon products add importance to this process.

The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a
reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and
carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction
temperature. High product yields are obtained with carbon
catalysts in the temperature range of 11001300 K while the
reaction temperature range is 7001100 K with metal catalysts.
The rate of methane decomposition activity on the transition
metals follows the order: Co, Ru, Ni, Rh > Pt, Re, Ir > Pd, Cu, W,
Fe, Mo.22 Currently, most of the research is focused on Ni- and
Fe-based catalysts. The metal loading for the supported cata-
lysts used in this process is usually more than 10% which is
high compared to normal supported metal catalysts. For
example, for Ni-based catalysts, the optimum loading of Ni was
40%, while the particle size of the Ni catalysts is pivotal for good
activity.24,25 In the TCD process, although the production of
solid carbon facilitates the gas separation, the drawback is that
the large amounts of carbon formed cover and poison the
catalysts as well as change the morphology and composition of
metal catalysts, which leads to severe deactivation of the cata-
lysts.22,23,25,26 The choice of the support and the addition of
promoters are widely used to enhance the tolerance of carbo-
naceous deposits.22,23
Interestingly, carbon materials themselves can catalyze the
TCD reaction. A different kinetics behavior was observed with
carbon materials as compared with that of metal catalysts,
illustrating the catalytic effect of carbon in the TCD reaction.27
Various carbon materials have been tested in the TCD reactions.
Amorphous carbons (e.g., activated carbon and carbon black)
are more active than well-ordered carbons (e.g., graphite and
carbon nanotubes).2729 The carbon deposits produced in the
reaction also dramatically reduce the surface area of the carbon
catalyst, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. With
activated carbon and carbon black, which are the most widely
used catalysts, activated carbon shows a higher initial reaction
rate and a faster deactivation rate than carbon black. It was
suggested that the pores in activated carbon, especially the
micropores, are readily blocked by the carbonaceous deposits,
whereas the surface of carbon black is much more accessible to
methane since the size of the carbon black particles is between
10 and 250 nm.28,30 Defects in the carbon materials are believed
to be the active sites for the TCD reaction. In some cases, as the
TCD reaction proceeds, the newly formed carbon is responsible
for the activation of methane.27,30
The TCD process is not industrially used because it is not yet
economically
competitive
with
the
well-developed
steam
reforming process of methane. However, with the increasing
demand for high quality hydrogen, the TCD process is getting
more attractive as the pure hydrogen produced this way, with
the absence of CO and CO2, is suitable for fuel cells.22,23 The
water splitting reaction (2H2O  2H2 + O2, DH  484 kJ mol1) is
another important reaction to produce high-quality hydrogen.
First, using solar energy to split water to hydrogen and oxygen is
still far from the practical applications. Secondly, the electrol-
ysis of water to high-quality hydrogen, although well estab-
lished, also needs more energy than the TCD process. It is
because the DH of this reaction is much higher than that of the
TCD reaction and this process costs electricity, the efficiency of
which is limited by the electricity generation and trans-
portation. Therefore, as methane has the highest H/C ratio in
fossil fuel, we propose that the TCD process would play a more
and more important role in the production of hydrogen in the
future. The reasons why this process is not applied on a large
scale are: first, a continuous reaction process that is suitable for

TCD industrial application is still to be developed. In the
laboratory, a circulating uidized bed is used to develop a
continuous process, but this process requires the regeneration
of the catalysts by oxidation, resulting in the release of large
amounts of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2).31 Second, carbon
market value is believed to be a key factor in the economics of
the TCD process.23,32 If this process is industrialized, it will
produce huge amounts of carbon each year. Therefore,
producing uniform types of carbon and finding suitable appli-
cations for these carbons are the key factors that govern the
viability of the TCD process.

Ethane and ethylene
Ethylene, a main building block in the chemical society, is now
obtained by the pyrolysis of naphtha and dehydrogenation of
ethane. The direct conversion of methane to ethylene would
provide an alternative to these traditional processes based on
petroleum and syngas.
In the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, shown
in eqn (5) and (6), methane is directly converted into ethane,
ethylene and water in the presence of oxygen and a suitable
catalyst. Ethylene, as one of the most important building feed-
stocks in polymer industry, could be converted to propylene or
polymerized to polyethylene. Ethane could be easily converted
to ethylene by an oxidative dehydrogenation process. This
reaction has been extensively studied and reviewed in the
literature.3336 Briey, the reaction proceeds by a two-step
process. First, oxidized catalyst sites abstract H from CH4, and
the resulting methyl radicals couple to form ethane. The exis-
tence of methyl radicals has been shown by synchrotron VUV
photoionization mass spectroscopy.37 In the second step, the
ethane dehydrogenates to produce ethylene. A wide range of
metal oxides are active for this reaction. LiMgO and WMn
SiO2 are the most widely studied catalysts. Some typical results
are shown in Table 1. Despite much effort devoted to the OCM
reaction, only a few catalysts can give a C2+ yield higher than
25% and selectivity to C2+ higher than 80%, which are the
minimum criteria for its industrial applications.38

The Li/MgO catalyst was shown to be very active in the OCM
reaction by Lunsford et al. Lithium in the catalyst create surface
defects and favor the formation of O, which is believed to be
responsible for the activation of methane.33,39 However, the Li/
MgO catalysts are unstable under the reaction conditions, and
deactivation occurs because of the loss of Li and sintering of the
catalysts. Various dopants such as auxiliary metals and Cl are
used to modify the Li/MgO catalysts to improve the stability and
the selectivity towards C2.6,39 The WMnSiO2 catalyst is also
one of the most active catalysts in the OCM reaction. In this
catalyst, Na is proposed to suppress the over-oxidation of
methane and favor the migration of Mn and W to the catalyst
surface. Both the NaOW and NaOMn species are the active
sites in this reaction. The near-surface concentration of Mn was
correlated with CH4 conversion and C2H4 selectivity. Concern-
ing the W species, both tetrahedral WO4 and octahedral WO6
were found on the catalyst surface, and WO4 was more active
and selective for the reaction.34,40 Beside pure oxygen, other
oxidants such as CO2 have been used in the OCM reaction as
well, although their C2 yields are much lower.41,42
As the main problem in the OCM reaction is that the activity
of ethane and ethylene products are much higher than that of
methane in the oxygen atmosphere, a so oxidant that has
less oxidation ability may partly solve this problem. Recently, a
process using S2 as a mild oxidant to oxidize methane to ethane
and ethylene was developed.43 The thermodynamic data for S2
and O2 are shown in Fig. 3. The metal sulfides used as the
catalysts were like the metal oxides in the OCM reaction. The
bond energy of the CS bond is believed to play an important
role in controlling the activation of methane. However, this
mild oxidation process needs a higher reaction temperature
than the traditional oxidation process using oxygen.
The non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) reactions,
shown in eqn (7) and (8), to ethane and ethylene are thermo-
dynamically unfavorable. However, due to high selectivity and
low reaction temperatures, this reaction still attracted much
