[1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."

[2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[3] "The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP."

[4] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."

Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized through various methods show different catalytic performances in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Steam treatment: This method, applied to isomorphously substituted zeolite frameworks, produces catalysts with high performance. At 450°C, these catalysts show 48% C3H8 conversion, 96% N2O conversion, and 45% C3H6 selectivity.

2. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange: These methods also yield effective catalysts. In the temperature range of 377-527°C, these catalysts demonstrate C3H8 conversion between 20-60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25-70%, and C3H6 yield between 14-30%.

3. High-temperature steam pretreatment: This method has a particularly positive effect on C3H6 yield and selectivity. It produces extra-framework iron species that are more active for N2O-ODHP than framework iron species. This pretreatment also reduces surface acidity, leading to higher C3H6 selectivity and decreased selectivity towards CO2.

The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The specific values for these metrics vary depending on the synthesis method and reaction conditions, but generally fall within the ranges mentioned above.

含铁ZSM-5沸石通过不同的合成方法制备，在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出不同的催化性能：

1. 蒸汽处理：这种方法应用于同晶置换的沸石骨架，产生高性能的催化剂。在450°C下，这些催化剂显示48%的C3H8转化率，96%的N2O转化率，和45%的C3H6选择性。

2. 固态离子交换和液体交换：这些方法也能产生有效的催化剂。在377-527°C的温度范围内，这些催化剂表现出20-60%的C3H8转化率，25-70%的C3H6选择性，和14-30%的C3H6收率。

3. 高温蒸汽预处理：这种方法对C3H6收率和选择性有特别积极的影响。它产生的骨架外铁物种比骨架铁物种对N2O-ODHP更活跃。这种预处理还降低了表面酸度，导致更高的C3H6选择性和降低了对CO2的选择性。

证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6收率。这些指标的具体值取决于合成方法和反应条件，但通常落在上述提到的范围内。
