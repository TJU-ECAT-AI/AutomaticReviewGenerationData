          [1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."

[2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[3] "The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP."

[4] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."

[5] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."

          Different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction:

1. Steam treatment: This method produces catalysts with high performance, showing C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C. High-temperature steam pretreatment has a positive effect on C3H6 yield and selectivity by producing extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species.

2. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange: These methods also deliver good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527°C.

3. High-temperature steam pretreatment: This method leads to a decrease in selectivity toward CO2 and an increase in C3H6 selectivity. It also causes a significant decrease in acid site concentration due to extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in the density of Brønsted acid sites.

Key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, play a crucial role in determining these metrics, with the reported range being 377 to 527°C.

          不同的铁含量ZSM-5沸石合成方法对N2O辅助ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 蒸汽处理：这种方法产生的催化剂性能高，在450°C时显示C3H8转化率为48%，N2O转化率为96%，C3H6选择性为45%。高温蒸汽预处理通过产生比框架内铁物种更活跃的框架外铁物种，对C3H6产率和选择性有积极影响。

2. 固态离子交换和液体交换：这些方法也能提供良好的催化性能，在377至527°C的温度范围内，C3H8转化率在20%至60%之间，C3H6选择性在25%至70%之间，C3H6产率在14%至30%之间。

3. 高温蒸汽预处理：这种方法导致对CO2的选择性降低，同时C3H6选择性增加。它还导致酸性位浓度显著降低，这可能是由于沸石的大量脱铝和布朗斯特酸位密度的降低。

证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。反应条件，特别是温度，在决定这些指标方面起着至关重要的作用，报告的温度范围为377至527°C。
