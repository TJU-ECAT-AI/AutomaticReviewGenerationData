The given literature does not contain information about the influence of various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites on their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document does not discuss this specific reaction or provide performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield under different reaction conditions. The literature primarily focuses on the physicochemical characterization of isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 during activation, including calcination and steam treatment, but does not address the ODHP reaction or compare different synthesis methods in terms of catalytic performance.

给定的文献中没有关于各种含铁ZSM-5沸石合成方法对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能影响的信息。文档没有讨论这个特定反应，也没有提供不同反应条件下的性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。该文献主要集中在同晶取代FeZSM-5在活化过程中的物理化学表征，包括煅烧和蒸汽处理，但没有涉及ODHP反应或比较不同合成方法在催化性能方面的差异。
