The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the influence of various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites on their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on the physicochemical characterization of isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 during activation, but does not discuss the ODHP reaction or provide performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield under different reaction conditions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.
