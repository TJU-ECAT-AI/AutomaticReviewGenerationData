[1] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."

[2] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

[3] "The propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16 to 2% during the first 40 min on stream). In contrast, FeGa-st displayed remarkable performance, and the propylene yield was stable for a relatively long period on stream even if large amounts of coke were formed on the sample [Y(C3H6) = 22% and Ccoke = 13 wt% after 80 min]."

[4] "Previous studies by some of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke deposition [11]."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The study compares three different synthesis methods:

1. Steam-activated FeGaSi zeolite (FeGa-st)
2. Liquid ion-exchanged FeAlSi zeolite (FeAl-lie)
3. Steam-activated FeGeSi zeolite (FeGe-st)

Key performance metrics and their effectiveness:

1. C3H8 conversion: FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6 selectivity: Similar for all catalysts, ranging from 40% to 50%
3. C3H6 yield: FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
4. Stability: FeGa-st showed remarkable stability, maintaining a high propylene yield (22%) even after 80 minutes on stream, while FeAl-lie and FeGe-st experienced rapid decay in propylene yield.

The steam-activated FeGaSi zeolite (FeGa-st) demonstrated the best overall performance, with the highest initial propylene yield, propane conversion, and stability. This superior performance is attributed to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and increased resistance to deactivation by coke deposition. The liquid ion-exchanged FeAlSi zeolite (FeAl-lie) showed intermediate performance, while the steam-activated FeGeSi zeolite (FeGe-st) exhibited the lowest catalytic activity among the three.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能有显著影响。该研究比较了三种不同的合成方法：

1. 蒸汽活化的FeGaSi沸石(FeGa-st)
2. 液相离子交换的FeAlSi沸石(FeAl-lie)
3. 蒸汽活化的FeGeSi沸石(FeGe-st)

关键性能指标及其效果：

1. C3H8转化率：FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6选择性：所有催化剂相似，范围在40%到50%之间
3. C3H6收率：FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
4. 稳定性：FeGa-st表现出卓越的稳定性，即使在反应80分钟后仍保持较高的丙烯收率(22%)，而FeAl-lie和FeGe-st的丙烯收率迅速下降。

蒸汽活化的FeGaSi沸石(FeGa-st)表现出最佳的整体性能，具有最高的初始丙烯收率、丙烷转化率和稳定性。这种优越的性能归因于更多的ODHP活性铁中心和对焦炭沉积的增强抗性。液相离子交换的FeAlSi沸石(FeAl-lie)表现出中等性能，而蒸汽活化的FeGeSi沸石(FeGe-st)在三者中表现出最低的催化活性。
