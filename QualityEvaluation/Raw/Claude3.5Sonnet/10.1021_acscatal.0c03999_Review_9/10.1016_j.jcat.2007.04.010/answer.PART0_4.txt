[1] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."

[2] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

[3] "The propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16 to 2% during the first 40 min on stream). In contrast, FeGa-st displayed remarkable performance, and the propylene yield was stable for a relatively long period on stream even if large amounts of coke were formed on the sample [Y(C3H6) = 22% and Ccoke = 13 wt% after 80 min]."

[4] "Previous studies by some of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke deposition [11]."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics demonstrating their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

Steam-activated catalysts (FeGa-st and FeGe-st) generally showed better performance compared to the liquid ion-exchanged sample (FeAl-lie). Among these, the FeGa-st catalyst exhibited the best overall performance:

1. C3H8 conversion: FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. Initial C3H6 yield: FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
3. C3H6 selectivity: Similar for all catalysts, ranging from 40% to 50%

The FeGa-st catalyst also demonstrated superior stability, maintaining a high propylene yield (22%) even after 80 minutes on stream, despite significant coke formation. In contrast, the FeAl-lie sample showed rapid deactivation, with propylene yield dropping from 16% to 2% within 40 minutes.

The outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites (FeGa-st) is attributed to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or increased resistance to deactivation by coke deposition. This suggests that the steam activation method is particularly effective in creating catalysts with desirable properties for the ODHP reaction.

While N2O conversion was not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpts, it can be inferred that higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield would correspond to higher N2O conversion, as N2O is the oxidizing agent in this reaction.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。证明其有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

蒸汽活化的催化剂(FeGa-st和FeGe-st)通常比液相离子交换样品(FeAl-lie)表现更好。其中，FeGa-st催化剂展现了最佳的整体性能：

1. C3H8转化率：FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. 初始C3H6产率：FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
3. C3H6选择性：所有催化剂相似，范围在40%到50%之间

FeGa-st催化剂还表现出优异的稳定性，即使在反应80分钟后形成大量积碳，仍能保持较高的丙烯产率(22%)。相比之下，FeAl-lie样品显示出快速失活，丙烯产率在40分钟内从16%下降到2%。

蒸汽活化的MFI沸石(FeGa-st)的出色性能归因于更多的ODHP活性铁中心和/或对积碳失活的更强抗性。这表明蒸汽活化方法特别有效，能够制备出具有ODHP反应所需性质的催化剂。

虽然在给定的摘录中没有明确提到N2O转化率，但可以推断更高的C3H8转化率和C3H6产率会对应更高的N2O转化率，因为N2O是该反应中的氧化剂。
