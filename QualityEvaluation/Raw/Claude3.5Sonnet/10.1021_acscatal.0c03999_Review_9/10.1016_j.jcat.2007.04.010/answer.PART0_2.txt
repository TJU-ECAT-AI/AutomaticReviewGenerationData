[1] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."

[2] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

[3] "Previous studies by some of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke deposition [11]."

[4] "The reduced Brnsted acidity in these samples due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ (M3+ = Fe, Ga, Al) groups on high-temperature steam treatment and the presence of (limited) mesoporosity also have been identified as possible reasons for the decreased deactivation."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The study compares three different catalysts: FeGa-st (steam-activated), FeAl-lie (liquid ion-exchanged), and FeGe-st (steam-activated).

Key performance metrics:

1. C3H8 conversion: FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6 selectivity: 40-50% for all three catalysts
3. C3H6 yield: FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)

The steam-activated FeGa-st catalyst showed the best overall performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield. This superior performance is attributed to:

1. A higher number of active iron centers for ODHP
2. Increased resistance to deactivation by coke deposition
3. Reduced Brønsted acidity due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ groups during high-temperature steam treatment
4. The presence of limited mesoporosity

The liquid ion-exchanged FeAl-lie catalyst showed intermediate performance, while the steam-activated FeGe-st catalyst had the lowest performance among the three.

These results demonstrate that the synthesis method, particularly steam activation, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction. The steam treatment appears to create a more favorable iron speciation and pore structure, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。该研究比较了三种不同的催化剂：FeGa-st（蒸汽活化）、FeAl-lie（液体离子交换）和FeGe-st（蒸汽活化）。

关键性能指标：

1. C3H8转化率：FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6选择性：三种催化剂均为40-50%
3. C3H6产率：FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)

蒸汽活化的FeGa-st催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯产率方面表现最佳。这种优越的性能归因于：

1. ODHP活性铁中心数量更多
2. 对焦炭沉积导致的失活具有更强的抵抗力
3. 由于高温蒸汽处理过程中SiOM3+基团的广泛水解，导致Brønsted酸性降低
4. 存在有限的介孔结构

液体离子交换的FeAl-lie催化剂表现中等，而蒸汽活化的FeGe-st催化剂在三者中表现最差。

这些结果表明，合成方法，特别是蒸汽活化，在提高铁含量ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。蒸汽处理似乎创造了更有利的铁物种分布和孔结构，从而导致催化活性和稳定性的提高。
