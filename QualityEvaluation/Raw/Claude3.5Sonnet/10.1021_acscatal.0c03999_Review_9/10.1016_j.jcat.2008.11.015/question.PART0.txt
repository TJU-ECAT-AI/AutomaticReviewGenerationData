Iron (2 wt%) was incorporated into the structure of microporous AlPO4-5 (FAPOcal) and the mesoporous
materials TUD-1 and Al-TUD-1 (Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1). FAPOcal was also additionally modified by
steaming (FAPOste). Compared to literature data on optimized Fe-ZSM-5, FAPOcal shows relatively low
activity and comparable selectivities in N2O induced propane selective oxidation. Steaming reduces the
performance of this AlPO4-5 based catalyst. Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than
FAPOcal. However, the stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe-
ZSM-5. This is explained by differences in surface chemistry: operando DRIFT studies show formation of
carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke.
Reasons for the different behavior of the herein investigated catalysts as compared to Fe-ZSM-5 are
discussed.

1. Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with dioxygen
to produce propene has been intensively studied in the literature
[13]. A problem of this route is extensive COx formation already
at moderate conversions, leading to low propene selectivity. N2O is
an attractive alternative oxidation agent for ODHP, steam-activated
Fe-ZSM-5 being a promising catalytic system showing high initial
activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity are
comparable with those reported for V- and Mo-based catalysts,
employing dioxygen [4,5]. Unfortunately, a major drawback of iron
zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation by coke, causing a rapid
decrease of the propylene yield [6].
Another promising catalytic system reported in the literature
for the application of N2O-mediated oxidation is bulk FePO4. When
N2O or mixtures of H2 and O2 are used as oxidants [7,8], this
catalyst shows low activity but remarkable selectivity in oxida-
tion of light alkanes to alcohols (C1C2), assigned to a selectiv-
ity promoting function of the phosphate groups. A way to po-
tentially combine the high activity of iron sites in a zeolite ma-

trix with the functionality of the phosphate groups is the use of
iron-incorporated aluminophosphate molecular sieves Fe-AlPO4-5
(FAPO). While these sieves are hardly active in direct N2O decom-
position, even after steaming [9], they show comparable activity to
Fe-ZSM-5 in the conversion of benzene to phenol [10]. The activ-
ity of iron-incorporated aluminophosphate molecular sieves in N2O
mediated propane ODH has not been previously investigated.
The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the activity, se-
lectivity and stability of FAPO, before and after steaming, in the
N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. To evaluate the nature of the active
site, as well as to assess the role of the pore structure, the catalytic
performance of FAPO is compared with Fe-TUD-1 and aluminum
promoted Fe-TUD-1 [11,12]. In particular the nature of deposits
formed on the catalyst surfaces during the reaction is analyzed by
DRIFT spectroscopy, and discussed in relation to the observed de-
activation behavior.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst synthesis procedures
An iron substituted AlPO4-5 catalyst was synthesized according
to the recipe of Catana et al. [13]. An iron source (Fe3+ chlo-
ride hexahydrate; Janssen Chimica) was added to a solution of

phosphoric acid (85 wt% solution in water; Janssen Chimica) and
water while stirring, until complete dissolution. Pseudo-boehmite
(Catapal; 70% Al2O3, 30% H2O; Vista) was added under vigorous
stirring, followed by the dropwise addition of triethylamine (TEA
99%; Janssen Chimica). All reagents were mixed in an ice bath. The
obtained gel with a molar composition 1.0 TEAOH:0.004 Fe:0.996
Al:1.0 PO4:80 H2O was stirred for 1 h and heated in a Teflon-lined
autoclave at 150 C for 20 h. The resulting solid was washed and
then dried at 60 C. Then it was calcined at 500 C in static air
for 10 h applying a ramp rate of 5 C/min in air to remove the
template (denoted as 2FAPOcal). Afterward, a fraction (500 mg)
of the powdered sample was steamed in a quartz reactor with
a 30 ml(STP) min1 flow containing a water partial pressure of
300 mbar in N2 at 600 C for 5 h, again applying a ramp rate of
5 C/min to heat the sample from room temperature to 600 C. The
sample is denoted as 2FAPOste.
Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, +98% ACROS), triethanolamine
(TEA, 97%, ACROS), tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 35%
Aldrich) and the iron source ferric chloride (FeCl3, Aldrich) were
used for the synthesis of the Fe-TUD-1 mesoporous material
[11,12,14]. A mixture of 25 g TEA and 18.4 mL of de-ionized wa-
ter was added drop-wise into a mixture of 34.6 g TEOS and 1.33 g
FeCl3, while stirring vigorously. After stirring for about 30 min,
20.5 g of TEAOH was added. The mixture was aged at room
temperature for 24 h, dried at about 100 C for 24 h and then
hydrothermally treated in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave
at 180 C for 8 h. Finally the solid, as-synthesized samples were
calcined at 600 C for 10 h using a ramp rate of 1 C/min in air
(denoted as 2Fe-TUD-1).
For bi-metallic 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, 1.23 g aluminum isopropoxide
(Aldrich) was used as alumina source and added together with
the FeCl3 solution. The remainder of the procedure is the same as
described above, involving aging, hydrothermal treating and calci-
nation of the homogeneous synthesis mixture.
2.2. Characterization techniques
The amount of P in the chemical composition of the catalysts
was determined by ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer Optima 4300DV). The
elemental analysis of the other elements, i.e. Fe, and Al was de-
termined using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA),
conducted on a THER nuclear reactor with a thermal power of
2 MW and maximum neutron reflux of 2.10 m2 s1. The method
proceeds in three steps: irradiation of the elements with neutrons
in the nuclear reactor, followed by a period of decay, and finally
a measurement of the radioactivity resulting from irradiation. The
energy of the radiation and the half-life period of the radioactivity
enable a highly accurate quantitative analysis.
Nitrogen
ad-
and

isotherms
were
recorded
at
196 C on a QuantaChrome Autosorb-6B. Prior to the analysis, the
samples were evacuated and preheated at 300 C overnight. The
BET method was used to calculate the surface area (SBET), and the
total pore volume (V tot) was obtained at 0.99 p/p0. The pore size
distribution was calculated from the adsorption branch using the
BarretJoynerHalenda (BJH) model, while the t-plot method was
used to calculate the pore volume (V micro). For FAPO catalysts, Ar
adsorption isotherms at 184 C were obtained in a Micromerit-
ics ASAP 2010 apparatus. The pore size distribution was calculated
from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the SatioFoley
(SF) model.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using
a Philips CM30T electron microscope with a LaB6 filament as the
source of electrons, and a Phillips CM30UT electron microscope
with a FEG as source of electrons, both operated at 300 kV. Sam-
ples were mounted on a Quantifoil microgrid carbon polymer,
supported on a copper grid from an ethanol suspension.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was carried out in a Nico-
let Magna 550 Fourier transform spectrometer, equipped with
a high-temperature cell, in which the as-synthesized, calcined
and steamed samples were placed in a holder. To characterize
the Fe-sites in the obtained materials by NO adsorption, dif-
fuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed (DRIFT) spectra were
recorded in a flow of 30 ml/min, 5 vol% NO in He at 100 C. The
spectra were acquired by coaddition of 256 scans with a nominal
resolution of 4 cm1. Using the same DRIFT accessory, which was
coupled to a mass spectrometer, the ODHP reaction was analyzed.
The feed composition in these experiments was 0.5 vol% propane
and 1.0 vol% N2O with He as balance gas. The IR-MS system has
been described in detail elsewhere [15].
2.3. N2O-induced propane ODH
The N2O-induced propane oxidative dehydrogenation was car-
ried out in a six-flow reactor set-up. The set up, and definitions
applied for conversion, selectivity, and yield were described in de-
tail elsewhere [16]. The turnover frequencies (TOF) were calculated
by assuming all Fe in the catalysts to participate in the reaction.
In other words, the TOF is defined as the number of moles of N2O
(or propane) converted per second (nreact.convert.) per mole of iron
in the catalyst (nFe-present), using the following formula:
TOF = nreact.convert. (mole)
nFe-present (mole)
(s1).
The catalysts were ground and sieved to a size of 150212 μm.
Before reaction, 50 mg of all the samples was pre-treated in
50 ml/min He at 400 C for 1 h. This was followed by increasing
the temperature to 500 C, and switching the feed to 50 ml/min 1%
N2O in He. All samples show hardly activity in N2O decomposition,
as discussed previously [9]. Then the samples were cooled down
to 375 C, and the reaction mixture was changed to 50 ml/min 1%
N2O and 0.5% C3H8. It should be mentioned that an excess of N2O
in the ODHP was used to limit coke formation, while studies re-
ported in the literature typically used a N2O/C3H8 ratio of one at
significantly higher propane feed concentrations [5]. This was fol-
lowed by increasing the temperature with a rate of 10 C/min to
525 C, at which steady state performance was determined.
C3H8, C3H6, O2, CO, CO2 and H2O were analyzed with a GC
(Chrompack CP9001) equipped with a thermal conductivity detec-
tor (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID), using a Poraplot Q
column (for C3H8, C3H6, CO2 and H2O separation) and a Molsieve
5 Å column (for O2 and CO separation). Each GC measurement was
performed after a stabilization time of at least 20 min.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization  composition and morphology
The elemental composition and characterization data of all the
samples are summarized in Table 1. The N2 and Ar adsorption
isotherms have been discussed and presented elsewhere [9,11,12].
The micropore size distribution of the 2FAPOcal maximizes at
0.64 nm, which is characteristic of the AlPO4-5 structure. After
steaming, the micropore volume and surface area are significantly
reduced, suggesting that a fraction of the micropores are blocked
or have collapsed as a result of the steaming procedure [9]. The
steam treatment did not result in new phases, while the long-
range structural order of AlPO4-5 was basically maintained, as evi-
dent from XRD data reported elsewhere [9].
N2 sorption isotherms of 2Fe-TUD-1 indicate a pore volume of
1.24 cm3/g, and a relatively narrow pore size distribution maxi-
mizing at approximately 11.5 nm. HR-TEM analysis confirmed that
2Fe-TUD-1 consists of the sponge-like structure of TUD-1 with no

particles evident (comparable to 1Fe-TUD-1 as presented in [12]).
For 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, the pore volume is 0.55 cm3/g and the pore
size distribution maximizes at only 3.4 nm. The low pore vol-
ume and small pore size of 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 is comparable to the
characteristics of 3Al-TUD-1 [14]. This suggests that Al is not very
well dispersed on the walls of the SiO2 based channels in the
preparation procedures. Instead, particles composed of Al and/or
Fe-Al oxides might exist, affecting apparent pore volume and sizes.
This is confirmed by the HR-TEM image of 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 (Fig. 1),
which shows the presence of particles in a size range of 10 nm.
The morphology is comparable to other TUD-1 formulations with
approximately 5 wt% metal oxide loading, as discussed elsewhere
[11,12]. XRD analysis suggests that both 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-
TUD-1 are non-crystalline, meso-structured materials (not shown
for brevity). Apparently, the particles observed in the TEM pictures
of 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 are amorphous in nature, or too low in concen-
tration to be detected in a X-ray diffractogram.
3.2. Characterization  nature of the Fe-sites
To characterize the nature of the Fe-sites in the four catalytic
materials, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO was performed. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 2. An NO absorption feature at 1830 cm1,
tentatively assigned to NO adsorbed on ex-framework Fe2+-sites
[17], is apparent in the spectrum of 2FAPOste. This band is hardly
visible in the spectrum of 2FAPOcal [9]. This suggests a larger
quantity of Fe2+ sites to be formed upon steaming, in agreement
with the results of other characterization techniques. After steam-
ing, migration of Fe from tetrahedral positions to octahedral po-
sitions has also been identified by increasing UVVis absorptions
at wavelengths larger than 350 nm [9]. The migration of Fe to
ex-framework positions induced by steaming is well known for Fe-
ZSM-5 catalysts [18].
Fig. 2 also shows the absorption features of adsorbed NO on
the surfaces of 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1. NO adsorption on
mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1 is very weak and hard to detect in the FTIR
measurements, suggesting that little Fe2+ sites are present or ac-
cessible to NO. In contrast, NO adsorbs strongly on the surface of
2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, and two peaks at 1874 and 2151 cm1 are readily
identified. These two peaks were previously reported in [17,19] for
steam-activated ex-Fe-ZSM-5: the peak at 2133 cm1 was assigned
to NO adsorbed on cationic sites associated with Al3+ in the zeolite
structure, and the peak at 1874 cm1 to Fe2+ at extra-framework
positions.
We previously proposed the presence of mixed FeAl oxide
nanoparticles to contribute to the spectral signature of adsorbed
NO in Fe-ZSM-5, and propose similar species to be present on
the amorphous silica matrix of TUD-1. This is supported by the
similarity in the TEM pictures of 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 and ex-Fe-ZSM-5
[20], and the nature of the UVVis spectra of 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-
2Al-TUD-1 [12]. In the UVVis spectrum of 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, a peak
around 465 nm was detected, indicative of a significant fraction of
iron oxide containing particles [12].
3.3. Catalytic performance
3.3.1. N2O-induced propane ODH
The catalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated in
N2O-induced propane oxidation. Fig. 3 shows the turnover fre-
quency of N2O and C3H8, and the yield to propene as a function
of temperature. Since N2O is hardly converted in the absence of
propane over these catalysts [9,11], it is apparent that N2O conver-
sion is improved significantly due to the presence of propane in
the feed. Table 2 gives the TOF and product selectivity for the cata-
lysts at 525 C. Around 80%, 83%, 58%, and 59% of N2O is converted
at 525 C over 2FAPOcal, 2FAPOste, 2Fe-TUD-1, and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1,
respectively. For the FAPO catalysts, propene is the main product
with a selectivity ranging from 27 to 30% at around 44% conver-
sion, while CO and CO2 are the main by-products and 3% is con-
verted to the oxygenate acrolein. 2FAPOste shows lower selectivity
to propene than 2FAPOcal. Selectivity to propene is apparently not
favored by extracting Fe species from the framework of 2FAPOcal.
Although the applied feed conditions were different, it is evident
that the FAPO systems are less active than optimized Fe-ZSM-5,
comparing the TOF values reported in [5].
The propane conversion obtained for mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1
at 525 C is significantly lower than obtained for microporous
2FAPOcal, while at these lower conversion levels the selectivity to
propene is also significantly lower. 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1
are thus inferior catalysts to the FAPO based systems for propene
production.
While the performance remains lower than reported for opti-
mized Fe-ZSM-5 [5], it should be mentioned that the stability of
the TUD-1 and FAPO based catalysts is quite good: at most a re-
duction in propene yield of 3% was observed after 12 h on stream
(not shown for brevity), compared to a reported drop in propane
conversion from 48% to 10% after 7 h on stream for Fe-ZSM-5 [5].
It is clear from Table 2 that the C and O mass balance of the
analyses of the catalysts are not closed to 100%. Besides being re-
lated to experimental errors, this suggests that oxygenates might
be accumulating on the surface of the catalysts, as will be demon-
strated by the investigation of the nature and extent of deposits
formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction by DRIFT spec-
troscopy.
Fig. 4 shows the spectral development in the region where ab-
sorptions of the OH-groups of the 2FAPOcal catalyst are to be ex-
pected. The strongest intensity at 3665 cm1 has been assigned to
Brnsted sites, i.e. POH [2023]. The weak features at 3780 cm1
and 3400 cm1 are most likely associated with AlOH [24] and
hydrogen bonded OH-groups, respectively. AlOH vibrations have
been reported for mixed Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [24]. Clearly, the

negative intensities of the OH related features at 3780, 3665, and
3400 cm1 intensify, suggesting that OH-groups are converted by
interaction with products of propane oxidation.
Certainly features in the 1200 to 1800 cm1 region of the
spectra indicate the formation of strongly bound surface adsorbed
species (see Fig. 5). The most predominant bands in the re-
gion 14001650 cm1 have been assigned to carboxylate and
carbonate type species on the surface of various support ma-
terials [24,25]. The band at 1585 cm1 has typically been as-
signed to formate [24,26], while the lower band frequencies are
most likely related to acetate vibrations (νas(COO), 1564 cm1,
νs(COO), 1450 cm1). The band observed in the later stages of
the reaction at 1720 cm1, is most likely related to adsorbed
acrolein, in view of the product distribution observed in the gas
phase analyses. The strong band at 1300 cm1 has not been
previously reported in the literature on propane oxidation over
metal oxide catalysts. Frei and coworkers adsorbed acetaldehyde
on FAPO [22], with the CH bending modes located in the region
13501400 cm1, rather than at 1300 cm1. Only bands in the
13501400 cm1 region were observed after formic acid or acetic
acid adsorption on alumina surfaces, whereas acrolein adsorption
does not give rise to the low frequency band at 1300 cm1 either.
Two options remain: nitrate bands have been assigned to absorp-
tions in the region of 12901310 cm1. If nitrates are formed, this
is most likely the result of a small fraction of NO in the N2O feed
applied, which is commonly the case. Alternatively, the band might
be related to phosphate vibrational modes, which are enhanced by
the changes in the chemical environment of the phosphate groups
upon deposition of the carbonates and carboxylates.
In the experiment conducted with 2FAPOste, the IR bands are
located at similar positions (not shown for brevity) as observed for
2FAPOcal, besides the presence of an additional band, located at
3735 cm1. The novel band at 3735 cm1 is most likely related to
ex-framework Al species, in view of literature assignments [24]. In
the 1200 to 1800 cm1 region the bands are also quite similar be-
fore and after steaming, indicating that the surface species formed
on the steamed and calcined FAPO are alike. It should be men-
tioned that both catalysts turned black during the in situ analysis,
suggesting that besides the carboxylates, some carbon is deposited
on the surface of the catalysts, which does not have an IR sig-
nature. After flushing the DRIFT cell with He, we were unable to
identify the CH stretches reported in a spectroscopic study on
Fe-ZSM-5 catalyzed N2O mediated ODHP [6]. We tried to analyze
the samples with Raman spectroscopy to identify the aliphatic and
aromatic content of the samples, but failed due to strong fluores-
cence of the samples at the applied laser wavelength (514 nm).
In Fig. 6, the development of the IR bands upon N2O induced
propane oxidation as a function of time is shown for the 2Fe-
TUD-1 sample. Maxima of the IR absorptions are located at 1645,
1530, and 1450 cm1. In view of the product distribution, oxy-
genates are likely to be the surface species causing these vibra-
tions. The broad features at 1530 and 1450 cm1 are the result
of acetate deposits, while the band at 1645 cm1 is located in
the region of hydrogen bonded carbonates (bicarbonate). The broad
negative band in the 3100 to 3900 cm1 region (see insert) is de-
creasing as a result of chemical interactions of surface OH groups
with the products of propane oxidation.

propene yields up to 25% [4,5]. The performance of 2FAPOcal re-
ported in the present study is significantly smaller, although the
catalyst exhibits relatively high selectivity to propene. Metal phos-
phate catalysts generally show relatively low activity and high se-
lectivity in oxidation reactions, such as bulk FePO4 in oxidation of
light alkanes to alcohols (C1C2) [27], Mn2P2O7 in propane oxida-
tion to acetaldehyde, acrolein, or methanol [28], and (VO)2P2O7 in
oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [29]. As evident from
Table 2, contrary to Fe-ZSM-5, steaming does not dramatically im-
prove the performance of 2FAPOcal: the conversion is slightly de-
creased, as is the selectivity to propene. Apparently the significant
activity of FAPO in the N2O mediated conversion of benzene to
phenol [10] is not achieved in the conversion of propane under
the applied process conditions in the present study.
Mesoporous catalysts, 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 show less
activity and lower selectivity than the microporous FAPO cata-
lysts. Recently Bruckner and coworkers [30] investigated the per-
formance of mesoporous Fe-SBA-15 in the same reaction and at-
tributed the bad performance to the low degree of adsorption of
reactants, a result of the large pore size. Besides this explanation,
we believe that the presence of a considerable amount of iron ox-
ide clusters in the mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, i.e.

a low dispersion, correlates with low activity. These clusters were
identified to be present by UVVis spectroscopy and TEM images,
to the largest extent in the 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 system.
In conclusion, nor the presence of phosphate groups, nor the
open pore texture of mesoporous materials, leading to relatively
large FeOx containing clusters, are beneficial for N2O mediated
ODHP. The reason for the lower activity of 2FAPOste and the
2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 catalysts, as compared to steam-
activated Fe-ZSM-5, will be further discussed in the following para-
graph, on the basis of a mechanistic evaluation.
4.2. Mechanistic considerations
Activation of N2O over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts is generally accepted
to produce α-oxygen and N2. It has furthermore been demon-
strated by the temporal analysis of products (TAP) that the re-
combination and desorption of α-oxygen, yielding O2, is the rate
determining step in direct N2O decomposition over ex-Fe-ZSM-
5 [17]. In view of the previously reported very low activity over
FAPO in direct N2O decomposition, this step is considered to be
hardly possible over calcined FAPO, tentatively explained by the
nature of Fe3+ sites and the vicinity of phosphate groups, which
might inhibit the oxygen desorption and the regeneration of the
iron sites [9]. The enhanced N2O decomposition rate of 2FAPOcal
in N2O-mediated propane ODH is therefore very likely the result
of reaction of propane with surface activated oxygen, regenerating
the active site. Similar observations were reported in N2O medi-
ated benzene oxidation over FAPO by Sankar and coworkers [10].
The following elemental steps are proposed to be involved in the
reaction:
N2O + N2 + α-O,
(1)
2α-OO2 + 2,
(2)
C3H8 + α-OC3H6+ H2O,
(3)
C3H6C3H6 + ,
(4)
C3H6+ α-Oor N2O carboxylates,
(5)
C3H6coke.
(6)
Obviously the reaction between α-oxygen and propane, step (3),
is much faster than the recombination and desorption of α-oxygen,
step (2). Two neighboring sites are needed for O2 desorption, while
reaction step (3) principally only requires one, isolated, site. As a
result, the N2O conversion is greatly enhanced due to the presence
of propane in the feed. Although steam treatment creates active
(clustered) Fe2+ sites in 2FAPOste, enhancing N2O conversion [9],
the local environment of catalytic Fe2+ sites is chemically different
(including phosphate interactions) than obtained by steaming of
isomorphously substituted Fe-ZSM-5, explaining the relatively low
activity of 2FAPOste as compared to steam activated Fe-ZSM-5. It
should be mentioned that the steaming procedure (time, temper-
ature) has not been optimized for 2FAPOste, and the performance
can potentially be improved by alteration of this procedure. The
importance of a specific isolated site created in Fe-ZSM-5 [5] is
also evident from the low performance of the TUD-1 samples in
the present study. While the nature of the clustered Fe-sites in the
TUD-1 samples and Fe-ZSM-5 is similar, the highly active isolated
site [5] is apparently not formed in the TUD-1 based catalysts.
In the following it will be discussed why the deactivating sur-
face species formed during the reaction are so much different in
nature in 2FAPO, and the TUD-1 samples, as compared to steam
activated Fe-ZSM-5.
4.3. Catalyst stability
Surface species as side products of selective propane oxida-
tion have been observed in DRIFT spectra for both FAPO systems
investigated, as well as for the TUD-1 systems. These are most
likely the result of consecutive reactions of propene. Once surface
propene has been formed, it has three options: (i) it can desorb,
(ii) the surface complex can be converted to carboxylates by reac-
tion with surface oxygen or N2O, and (iii) the surface complex can
form coke-like species, depositing on the catalyst surface yield-
ing the black color. The selectivity to propene, carboxylates and
coke is determined by the relative rates of reaction steps (4), (5),
and (6). The discrepancy of C and O mass balance for all cata-
lysts presented in Table 2 is consistent with oxygenate formation
and coke deposition. Based on the relatively stable baseline in the
DRIFT measurements, we assume the amount of coke formed to be
relatively small. This is consistent with the relatively high stability
of the catalysts on stream. It should be mentioned that the ap-
plied propane concentration in our studies was relatively low, and
that further stability evaluation in the presence of higher propane
concentrations, and at different propane/N2O ratio should be per-
formed, which might affect the rates of reaction steps (5) and (6).
The small deactivation rate and formation of carboxylates,
rather than coke, is also tentatively explained by the relatively
slow desorption rate of surface activated oxygen from 2FAPOcal,
2FAPOste, 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1. The high oxygen cov-
erage results in the consecutive formation of carboxylates from
propene, rather than coke, which is preferred over Fe-ZSM-5 as
shown by Perez-Ramirez and coworkers [6]. We propose this to
be the result of a relatively low surface oxygen coverage of Fe-
ZSM-5 during the reaction, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Based on the
operando DRIFT study, the similar surface carboxylate species on
2FAPOcal and 2FAPOste suggest they are mainly interacting with
POH or AlOH groups, explaining the small effect on the activity
of the Fe-sites. For the TUD-1 catalysts, the broad negative feature
in the OH-range of the spectrum also suggests that the majority
of the carboxylates and adsorbed species involve interactions with
(hydrated) silanol groups.
Although the investigated catalysts show low coke formation
and relatively little deactivation, the performance still does not
compete with Fe-ZSM-5. While coke is relatively easily formed on
ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and leads to a drop in propane conversion from 48%
to 10% after 7 h on stream [4,31], it should be mentioned that
deactivation is reversible, and in practice C3H6 can be produced
continuously in a battery of parallel reactors [32].
5. Conclusions
While less effective than steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, 2FAPOcal
is found active, selective and relatively stable in N2O induced
propane ODH. Extracting Fe3+ species from the framework of
2FAPOcal does not favor propane conversion and reduces selectiv-
ity to propene.
Mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 generally exhibit
lower activity and selectivity than the FAPO systems investigated,
which is related to the presence of a considerable amount of iron
clusters and oxides in these catalysts. This indicates that the pore
structure is less important than the chemical nature of the iron
sites in selective N2O induced propane oxidation.
The nature of the deactivating surface species formed during
the reaction is quite different for the investigated FAPO and Fe-
TUD-1 catalysts than reported for Fe-ZSM-5 in the literature [6].
This is tentatively explained by the surface oxygen coverage of the
catalytic formulations, which is proposed to be high for FAPO and
Fe-TUD-1, and relatively low for Fe-ZSM-5.
