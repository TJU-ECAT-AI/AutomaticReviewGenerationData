The provided literature does not contain information specifically about the synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on other catalysts such as FAPO and Fe-TUD-1, rather than Fe-ZSM-5. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the given information.

However, the document does mention Fe-ZSM-5 as a reference point, noting that it is generally considered the most promising zeolitic system for N2O mediated ODHP. It states that steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 can achieve initial propene yields up to 25%, which is significantly higher than the performance of the catalysts investigated in this study.

The document also briefly mentions that the steaming procedure for Fe-ZSM-5 creates highly active isolated sites, which are not formed in the TUD-1 based catalysts. This suggests that the synthesis method (in this case, steam treatment) does have a significant impact on the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 in the ODHP reaction.

Without more specific information about various synthesis methods for Fe-ZSM-5 and their effects on catalytic performance, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question as posed.

提供的文献中没有包含关于含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)催化性能影响的具体信息。该文档主要关注其他催化剂,如FAPO和Fe-TUD-1,而不是Fe-ZSM-5。因此,无法根据给定信息直接回答这个问题。

然而,该文档确实提到了Fe-ZSM-5作为参考点,指出它通常被认为是N2O介导ODHP最有前途的沸石体系。文中提到,蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5可以达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率,这明显高于本研究中调查的催化剂的性能。

文档还简要提到,Fe-ZSM-5的蒸汽处理过程会产生高活性的孤立位点,而这些位点在TUD-1基催化剂中并未形成。这表明合成方法(在这种情况下是蒸汽处理)确实对Fe-ZSM-5在ODHP反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

由于缺乏关于Fe-ZSM-5各种合成方法及其对催化性能影响的更具体信息,无法对所提出的问题给出全面的回答。
