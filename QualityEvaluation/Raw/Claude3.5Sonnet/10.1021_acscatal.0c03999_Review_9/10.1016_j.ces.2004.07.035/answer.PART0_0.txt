[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

[2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how different synthesis methods specifically influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. However, it does mention that steam activation was used for all the iron zeolites studied (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta).

The key performance metrics reported include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Around 45% for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
2. N2O conversion: Complete (100%) for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Around 50% for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K for all steam-activated iron zeolites.

The main difference observed among the zeolites was in their deactivation behavior, with FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance to deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite, and then Fe-beta. FeZSM-5 maintained a high C3H6 yield (increasing from 22% to 25%) for 75 minutes, while the other zeolites deactivated more quickly.

文献中没有提供关于不同合成方法如何特别影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到所有研究的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅石和Fe-beta）都使用了蒸汽活化。

报告的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为45%。
2. N2O转化率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石都达到完全（100%）转化。
3. C3H6选择性：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为50%。
4. C3H6收率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石的初始收率在19-22%范围内。

沸石之间观察到的主要差异在于它们的失活行为，FeZSM-5表现出最佳的抗失活性能，其次是Fe-硅石，然后是Fe-beta。FeZSM-5在75分钟内保持了较高的C3H6收率（从22%增加到25%），而其他沸石失活更快。
