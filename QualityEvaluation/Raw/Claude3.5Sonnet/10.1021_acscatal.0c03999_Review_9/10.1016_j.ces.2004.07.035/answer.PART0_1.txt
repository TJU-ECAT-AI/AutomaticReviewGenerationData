[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

[2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream. In addition, a residual propene yield of 8% was obtained over FeZSM-5 after 400 min on stream."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does provide information on the performance of steam-activated iron zeolites, including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta.

All steam-activated iron zeolites showed similar initial performance, with propene yields of 19-22% at 723 K, propane conversion around 45%, propene selectivity around 50%, and complete N2O conversion. This suggests that the steam activation method is effective for preparing catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

The main difference between the catalysts was in their deactivation rates. FeZSM-5 showed the best resistance to deactivation, maintaining a high propene yield of 25% for 75 minutes and retaining a residual yield of 8% after 400 minutes. Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta deactivated more quickly.

While the study doesn't compare different synthesis methods, it demonstrates that steam-activated FeZSM-5 is particularly effective for the ODHP reaction, showing high initial activity and good resistance to deactivation. The key performance metrics highlighted are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, as well as resistance to deactivation over time.

该文献并未直接比较铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的不同合成方法。然而，它提供了关于蒸汽活化的铁沸石（包括FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta）性能的信息。

所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石显示出相似的初始性能，在723 K下丙烯收率为19-22%，丙烷转化率约为45%，丙烯选择性约为50%，N2O完全转化。这表明蒸汽活化方法对于制备ODHP反应的催化剂是有效的。

催化剂之间的主要区别在于它们的失活速率。FeZSM-5显示出最好的抗失活性能，在75分钟内保持25%的高丙烯收率，并在400分钟后仍保持8%的残余收率。Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta失活更快。

虽然该研究没有比较不同的合成方法，但它表明蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5对ODHP反应特别有效，显示出高初始活性和良好的抗失活性能。强调的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6收率，以及随时间推移的抗失活能力。
