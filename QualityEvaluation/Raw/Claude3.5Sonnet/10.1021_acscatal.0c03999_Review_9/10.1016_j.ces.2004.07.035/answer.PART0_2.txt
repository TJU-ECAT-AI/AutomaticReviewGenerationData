[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

[2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species"

[3] "Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on ODHP performance. However, it does mention that steam-activated iron zeolites (including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) were synthesized hydrothermally, calcined in air, and then activated in flowing steam. 

The key performance metrics mentioned for these steam-activated iron zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction at 723 K include:

1. C3H8 conversion: approximately 45%
2. N2O conversion: complete (100%)
3. C3H6 selectivity: approximately 50%
4. C3H6 yield: 19-22%

The study notes that the initial performance was similar across different zeolite hosts, regardless of their acidic properties or the forms of extraframework iron species present. This suggests that the steam activation process may be more influential on catalytic performance than the specific synthesis method or zeolite structure.

However, the study does not provide information on how other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange might affect the catalytic performance in comparison to the hydrothermal synthesis and steam activation method described.

这篇文献并没有直接比较不同合成方法对含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的性能影响。但是,它提到了通过水热法合成的含铁沸石(包括FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-β)经空气焙烧后在蒸汽流中活化。

文中提到这些蒸汽活化的铁沸石在723 K下进行N2O辅助的ODHP反应的主要性能指标包括:

1. C3H8转化率:约45%
2. N2O转化率:完全(100%)  
3. C3H6选择性:约50%
4. C3H6产率:19-22%

研究指出,不同沸石载体的初始性能相似,与其酸性质或存在的骨架外铁物种形式无关。这表明蒸汽活化过程对催化性能的影响可能比特定的合成方法或沸石结构更重要。

然而,该研究并未提供固态离子交换或液相交换等其他合成方法与所述水热合成和蒸汽活化方法相比如何影响催化性能的信息。
