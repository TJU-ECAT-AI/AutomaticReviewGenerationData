[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

[2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how different synthesis methods specifically influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. However, it does mention that all tested iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) were synthesized hydrothermally and then activated by steam treatment.

The key performance metrics reported for these catalysts in the ODHP reaction include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Around 45% for all catalysts initially
2. N2O conversion: Complete (100%) initially
3. C3H6 selectivity: Around 50% for all catalysts initially
4. C3H6 yield: 19-22% initially at 723 K

The main difference observed among the catalysts was their resistance to deactivation, with FeZSM-5 showing the best performance. FeZSM-5 maintained a high C3H6 yield of 25% for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta deactivated more quickly.

While the synthesis method's specific influence is not detailed, the steam activation step appears to be crucial in preparing these catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

文献没有提供关于不同合成方法如何具体影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到所有测试的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta）都是通过水热法合成，然后通过蒸汽处理活化的。

这些催化剂在ODHP反应中报告的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：所有催化剂初始时约为45%
2. N2O转化率：初始时完全（100%）转化
3. C3H6选择性：所有催化剂初始时约为50%
4. C3H6收率：在723 K下初始为19-22%

观察到的催化剂之间的主要区别是它们对失活的抵抗力，其中FeZSM-5表现最佳。FeZSM-5在75分钟内保持了25%的高C3H6收率，而Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta失活更快。

虽然没有详细说明合成方法的具体影响，但蒸汽活化步骤似乎在准备这些催化剂用于ODHP反应中起着关键作用。
