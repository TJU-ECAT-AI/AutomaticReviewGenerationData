[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

[2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how different synthesis methods specifically influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. However, it does mention that steam activation was used for all the iron zeolites studied (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta).

The key performance metrics reported include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Around 45% for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
2. N2O conversion: Complete (100%) for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Around 50% for all steam-activated iron zeolites at 723 K.
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K for all steam-activated iron zeolites.

The main difference observed among the zeolites was in their deactivation behavior, with FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance to deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite, and then Fe-beta. FeZSM-5 maintained a high C3H6 yield (increasing from 22% to 25%) for 75 minutes, while the other zeolites deactivated more quickly.

文献中没有提供关于不同合成方法如何特别影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到所有研究的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅石和Fe-beta）都使用了蒸汽活化。

报告的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为45%。
2. N2O转化率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石都达到完全（100%）转化。
3. C3H6选择性：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为50%。
4. C3H6收率：在723 K下，所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石的初始收率在19-22%范围内。

沸石之间观察到的主要差异在于它们的失活行为，FeZSM-5表现出最佳的抗失活性能，其次是Fe-硅石，然后是Fe-beta。FeZSM-5在75分钟内保持了较高的C3H6收率（从22%增加到25%），而其他沸石失活更快。

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does provide information on the performance of steam-activated iron zeolites, including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta.

All steam-activated iron zeolites showed similar initial performance, with propene yields of 19-22% at 723 K, propane conversion around 45%, propene selectivity around 50%, and complete N2O conversion. This suggests that the steam activation method is effective for preparing catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

The main difference between the catalysts was in their deactivation rates. FeZSM-5 showed the best resistance to deactivation, maintaining a high propene yield of 25% for 75 minutes and retaining a residual yield of 8% after 400 minutes. Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta deactivated more quickly.

While the study doesn't compare different synthesis methods, it demonstrates that steam-activated FeZSM-5 is particularly effective for the ODHP reaction, showing high initial activity and good resistance to deactivation. The key performance metrics highlighted are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, as well as resistance to deactivation over time.

该文献并未直接比较铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的不同合成方法。然而，它提供了关于蒸汽活化的铁沸石（包括FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta）性能的信息。

所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石显示出相似的初始性能，在723 K下丙烯收率为19-22%，丙烷转化率约为45%，丙烯选择性约为50%，N2O完全转化。这表明蒸汽活化方法对于制备ODHP反应的催化剂是有效的。

催化剂之间的主要区别在于它们的失活速率。FeZSM-5显示出最好的抗失活性能，在75分钟内保持25%的高丙烯收率，并在400分钟后仍保持8%的残余收率。Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta失活更快。

虽然该研究没有比较不同的合成方法，但它表明蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5对ODHP反应特别有效，显示出高初始活性和良好的抗失活性能。强调的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6收率，以及随时间推移的抗失活能力。

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on ODHP performance. However, it does mention that steam-activated iron zeolites (including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) were synthesized hydrothermally, calcined in air, and then activated in flowing steam. 

The key performance metrics mentioned for these steam-activated iron zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction at 723 K include:

1. C3H8 conversion: approximately 45%
2. N2O conversion: complete (100%)
3. C3H6 selectivity: approximately 50%
4. C3H6 yield: 19-22%

The study notes that the initial performance was similar across different zeolite hosts, regardless of their acidic properties or the forms of extraframework iron species present. This suggests that the steam activation process may be more influential on catalytic performance than the specific synthesis method or zeolite structure.

However, the study does not provide information on how other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange might affect the catalytic performance in comparison to the hydrothermal synthesis and steam activation method described.

这篇文献并没有直接比较不同合成方法对含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的性能影响。但是,它提到了通过水热法合成的含铁沸石(包括FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-β)经空气焙烧后在蒸汽流中活化。

文中提到这些蒸汽活化的铁沸石在723 K下进行N2O辅助的ODHP反应的主要性能指标包括:

1. C3H8转化率:约45%
2. N2O转化率:完全(100%)  
3. C3H6选择性:约50%
4. C3H6产率:19-22%

研究指出,不同沸石载体的初始性能相似,与其酸性质或存在的骨架外铁物种形式无关。这表明蒸汽活化过程对催化性能的影响可能比特定的合成方法或沸石结构更重要。

然而,该研究并未提供固态离子交换或液相交换等其他合成方法与所述水热合成和蒸汽活化方法相比如何影响催化性能的信息。

文献中没有直接比较不同合成方法对含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能影响。但是，它确实提到所有研究的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅铝石和Fe-β）都是通过水热法合成，在空气中煅烧，并在流动蒸汽中活化。

这些催化剂在ODHP反应中报告的关键性能指标包括：

2. N2O转化率：完全（100%）
3. C3H6选择性：约50%
4. C3H6产率：在723 K下为19-22%

这些性能指标对所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石都相似，不受沸石主体或酸性质的影响。然而，不同沸石的失活速率不同，FeZSM-5显示最慢的失活速率，其次是Fe-硅铝石，然后是Fe-β。

The main difference observed among the catalysts was their resistance to deactivation, with FeZSM-5 showing the best performance. FeZSM-5 maintained a high C3H6 yield of 25% for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta deactivated more quickly.
