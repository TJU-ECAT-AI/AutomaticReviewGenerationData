          [1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

          [2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

          [3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

          [4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

          The literature does not provide a direct comparison of different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. However, it mentions that all studied iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) were synthesized hydrothermally, calcined in air, and activated in flowing steam.

          The key performance metrics reported for these catalysts in the ODHP reaction include:

          1. C3H8 conversion: around 45%
          2. N2O conversion: complete (100%)
          3. C3H6 selectivity: around 50%
          4. C3H6 yield: 19-22% at 723 K

          These performance metrics were initially similar for all steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite host or acidic properties. However, the rate of deactivation differed among the zeolites, with FeZSM-5 showing the slowest deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite, and then Fe-beta. FeZSM-5 exhibited remarkable resistance to deactivation, maintaining a high C3H6 yield of 25% for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta deactivated more quickly.

          The study does not provide information on how other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange affect the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction. However, the steam activation step appears to be crucial in preparing these catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

          文献没有直接比较不同合成方法对含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能影响。但是，它提到所有研究的铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta）都是通过水热法合成，在空气中煅烧，并在流动蒸汽中活化。

          这些催化剂在ODHP反应中报告的关键性能指标包括：

          1. C3H8转化率：约45%
          2. N2O转化率：完全（100%）
          3. C3H6选择性：约50%
          4. C3H6产率：在723 K下为19-22%

          这些性能指标初始时对所有蒸汽活化的铁沸石都相似，不受沸石主体或酸性质的影响。然而，不同沸石的失活速率不同，FeZSM-5显示最慢的失活速率，其次是Fe-硅酸盐，然后是Fe-beta。FeZSM-5表现出显著的抗失活能力，在75分钟内保持25%的高C3H6产率，而Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta失活更快。

          这项研究没有提供其他合成方法，如固态离子交换或液体交换，如何影响含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能的信息。然而，蒸汽活化步骤似乎在准备这些催化剂用于ODHP反应中起着关键作用。
