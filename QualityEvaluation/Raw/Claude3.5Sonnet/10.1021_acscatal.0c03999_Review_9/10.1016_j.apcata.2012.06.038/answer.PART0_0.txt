[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Extra-framework iron methods: These lead to higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODHP, but lower resistance to deactivation.

2. Solid-state ion exchange: This method produces catalysts with various active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species.

3. Steam treatment and high-temperature treatment: These increase the amount of extra-framework iron species and enhance activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP, particularly for catalysts prepared by ion exchange.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

1. N2O conversion: Higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron.
2. C3H8 conversion: Increased by extra-framework iron and high-temperature treatments.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Highest for Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity.
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yield is higher for Fe-ZSM-5 compared to FeSiO2, due to the presence of weak/medium acid sites and various iron species.

The combination of weak/medium acid sites, oligonuclear iron species, and iron oxides on ZSM-5 enhances N2O activation, leading to improved catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 骨架外铁方法：这些方法导致N2O分解活性和ODHP初始活性更高，但抗失活能力较低。

2. 固态离子交换：这种方法产生的催化剂含有各种活性铁物种，包括大型氧化物簇、小型含氧纳米簇和孤立的铁物种。

3. 蒸汽处理和高温处理：这些处理增加了骨架外铁物种的数量，并提高了N2O分解和ODHP的活性，特别是对于通过离子交换制备的催化剂。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. N2O转化率：骨架外铁的催化剂较高。
2. C3H8转化率：通过骨架外铁和高温处理提高。
3. C3H6选择性：低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5最高。
4. C3H6产率：由于存在弱/中等酸性位点和各种铁物种，Fe-ZSM-5的初始产率高于FeSiO2。

ZSM-5上弱/中等酸性位点、寡核铁物种和氧化铁的组合增强了N2O的活化，从而提高了ODHP反应的催化性能。
