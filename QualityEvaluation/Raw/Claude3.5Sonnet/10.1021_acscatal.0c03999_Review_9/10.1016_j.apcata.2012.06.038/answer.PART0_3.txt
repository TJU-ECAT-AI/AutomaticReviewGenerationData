[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Extra-framework iron: Methods leading to extra-framework iron result in catalysts with higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODHP. However, these materials show lower resistance to deactivation.

2. Solid-state ion exchange: This method produces catalysts with diverse active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters (Fe4O4 and Fe3O4), and isolated iron species.

3. Steam treatment and high-temperature calcination: These treatments increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in hydrothermally prepared Fe-ZSM-5. For ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5, high-temperature treatments enhance activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP.

4. Acidity control: Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity shows the highest selectivity and yield of propene. The presence of weak/medium acid sites along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides enhances N2O activation, resulting in higher initial propene yield compared to FeSiO2.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion
2. N2O conversion
3. C3H6 selectivity
4. C3H6 yield

The synthesis method and subsequent treatments influence these metrics by altering the iron speciation, acidity, and overall catalyst structure, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响其在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能:

1. 骨架外铁：导致骨架外铁的方法产生的催化剂对N2O分解和ODHP的初始活性较高。然而，这些材料抗失活能力较差。

2. 固态离子交换：这种方法产生的催化剂具有多样化的活性铁物种，包括大型氧化物簇、小型含氧纳米簇(Fe4O4和Fe3O4)以及孤立的铁物种。

3. 蒸汽处理和高温煅烧：这些处理增加了水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中骨架外铁物种的数量。对于离子交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5，高温处理增强了N2O分解和ODHP的活性。

4. 酸度控制：低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5表现出最高的丙烯选择性和产率。弱/中等酸性位点与寡核铁物种和氧化铁的存在增强了N2O的活化，导致比FeSiO2更高的初始丙烯产率。

在不同反应条件下展示有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率
2. N2O转化率
3. C3H6选择性
4. C3H6产率

合成方法和后续处理通过改变铁物种、酸度和整体催化剂结构来影响这些指标，进而影响催化剂在ODHP反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
