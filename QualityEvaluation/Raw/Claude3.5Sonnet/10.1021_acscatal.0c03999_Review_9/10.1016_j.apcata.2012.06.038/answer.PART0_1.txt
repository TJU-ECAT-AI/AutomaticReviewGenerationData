[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Extra-framework iron methods: These produce catalysts with higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODHP, but lower resistance to deactivation.

2. Solid-state ion exchange: This method results in different active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters (Fe4O4, Fe3O4), and isolated iron species.

3. Steam treatment and high-temperature calcination: These treatments increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in hydrothermally prepared Fe-ZSM-5. They also increase the activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP in ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. N2O conversion: Higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron.
2. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Highest for Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity.
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yield is highest for Fe-ZSM-5 compared to FeSiO2, due to the presence of weak/medium acid sites and various iron species (oligonuclear and oxides) that enhance N2O activation.

The presence of weak and/or medium acid sites, along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on ZSM-5, enhances N2O activation and leads to better overall performance in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 骨架外铁方法：这种方法产生的催化剂对N2O分解和ODHP初始活性更高，但抗失活能力较低。

2. 固态离子交换：这种方法产生不同的活性铁物种，包括大型氧化物簇、小型含氧纳米簇(Fe4O4, Fe3O4)和孤立的铁物种。

3. 蒸汽处理和高温煅烧：这些处理增加了水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中骨架外铁物种的数量。它们还增加了离子交换Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的N2O分解和ODHP活性。

在不同反应条件下展示有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. N2O转化率：骨架外铁催化剂的转化率较高。
2. C3H8转化率：骨架外铁催化剂的转化率通常较高。
3. C3H6选择性：低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5最高。
4. C3H6收率：由于存在弱/中等酸性位和各种铁物种（寡核和氧化物）增强了N2O活化，Fe-ZSM-5的初始收率比FeSiO2高。

弱和/或中等酸性位的存在，以及ZSM-5上的寡核铁物种和铁氧化物，增强了N2O的活化，从而在ODHP反应中表现出更好的整体性能。
