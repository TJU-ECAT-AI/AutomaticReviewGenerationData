[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Catalysts prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron, such as hydrothermal synthesis and ion exchange, showed higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODHP with N2O. However, these catalysts also exhibited lower resistance to deactivation.

Solid-state ion exchange methods produce catalysts with different active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species. This diversity in iron species can contribute to the catalyst's performance.

High-temperature treatment and steaming have been shown to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal methods. These treatments also increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP with N2O in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange.

The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts include propane conversion, N2O conversion, propene selectivity, and propene yield. Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts with low Al contents and reduced acidity showed the highest selectivity and yield of propene. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2, attributed to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance N2O activation.

Overall, the synthesis method plays a crucial role in determining the nature of iron species, acidity, and structural properties of the catalyst, which in turn affects its performance in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5分子筛的不同合成方法对其在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

通过导致形成骨架外铁的方法制备的催化剂，如水热合成和离子交换，表现出更高的N2O分解活性和更高的初始ODHP活性。然而，这些催化剂也表现出较低的抗失活能力。

固态离子交换方法制备的催化剂具有不同的活性铁物种，包括大的氧化物簇、小的含氧纳米簇和孤立的铁物种。这种铁物种的多样性可以贡献于催化剂的性能。

高温处理和蒸汽处理被证明可以增加水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中骨架外铁物种的数量。这些处理也增加了离子交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的N2O分解和ODHP活性。

证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率。低铝含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂表现出最高的丙烯选择性和产率。Fe-ZSM-5的初始丙烯产率显著高于FeSiO2，这归因于ZSM-5上存在弱酸和/或中等强度酸位以及寡核铁物种和铁氧化物，这些因素增强了N2O的活化。

总的来说，合成方法在决定催化剂的铁物种性质、酸度和结构特性方面起着至关重要的作用，这反过来又影响了其在ODHP反应中的性能。
