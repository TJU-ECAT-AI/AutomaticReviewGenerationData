[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Solid-state ion exchange produces catalysts with various active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species. This method allows for better control of metal loading, reproducibility, and generation of different active sites.

Methods leading to extra-framework iron, such as hydrothermal synthesis and liquid ion exchange, result in catalysts with higher initial activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP. However, these catalysts tend to have lower resistance to deactivation.

High-temperature treatment and steaming increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. For ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5, these treatments enhance activity for both N2O decomposition and ODHP.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

1. N2O conversion: Higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron species.
2. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Highest for Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity.
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yield is higher for Fe-ZSM-5 compared to FeSiO2, due to the presence of weak/medium acid sites and various iron species enhancing N2O activation.

The optimal catalyst performance appears to be a balance between extra-framework iron species, which enhance initial activity, and controlled acidity, which improves selectivity and stability. The solid-state ion exchange method, combined with appropriate post-synthesis treatments, may offer a good compromise between these factors.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能有显著影响。

固态离子交换法生产的催化剂具有各种活性铁物种,包括大型氧化物簇、小型含氧纳米簇和孤立的铁物种。这种方法可以更好地控制金属负载量、重现性,并生成不同的活性位点。

导致骨架外铁的方法,如水热合成和液相离子交换,产生的催化剂对N2O分解和ODHP具有较高的初始活性。但是,这些催化剂抗失活性能较差。

高温处理和蒸汽处理增加了水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中骨架外铁物种的数量。对于离子交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5,这些处理提高了N2O分解和ODHP的活性。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括:

1. N2O转化率:骨架外铁物种的催化剂较高。
2. C3H8转化率:通常骨架外铁的催化剂较高。
3. C3H6选择性:低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5最高。
4. C3H6收率:由于存在弱/中等酸性位点和各种铁物种增强N2O活化,Fe-ZSM-5的初始收率高于FeSiO2。

最佳催化剂性能似乎是骨架外铁物种(提高初始活性)和控制酸度(改善选择性和稳定性)之间的平衡。固态离子交换法,结合适当的后合成处理,可能在这些因素之间提供良好的折中方案。
