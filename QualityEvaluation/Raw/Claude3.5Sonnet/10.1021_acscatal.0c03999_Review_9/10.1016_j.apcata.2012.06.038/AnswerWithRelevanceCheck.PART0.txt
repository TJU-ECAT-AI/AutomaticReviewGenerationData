          [1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

          The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Extra-framework iron methods (e.g., hydrothermal synthesis, liquid ion exchange):
   - Higher activity for N2O decomposition
   - Higher initial activity for ODHP
   - Lower resistance to deactivation

2. Solid-state ion exchange:
   - Produces various active iron species (large oxide clusters, small oxygen-containing nanoclusters like Fe4O4 and Fe3O4, isolated iron species)
   - Better control of metal loading and reproducibility

3. Steam treatment and high-temperature calcination:
   - Increase extra-framework iron species in hydrothermally prepared Fe-ZSM-5
   - Enhance activity for N2O decomposition and ODHP in ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness under different reaction conditions:

1. N2O conversion: Higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron
2. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron
3. C3H6 selectivity: Highest for Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yield higher for Fe-ZSM-5 compared to FeSiO2, due to weak/medium acid sites and various iron species enhancing N2O activation

The optimal catalyst performance is achieved through a balance of extra-framework iron species (enhancing initial activity) and controlled acidity (improving selectivity and stability). The combination of weak/medium acid sites, oligonuclear iron species, and iron oxides on ZSM-5 enhances N2O activation, leading to improved catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

          含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 骨架外铁方法（如水热合成、液相离子交换）：
   - N2O分解活性更高
   - ODHP初始活性更高
   - 抗失活能力较低

2. 固态离子交换：
   - 产生各种活性铁物种（大型氧化物簇、小型含氧纳米簇如Fe4O4和Fe3O4、孤立铁物种）
   - 更好地控制金属负载量和重现性

3. 蒸汽处理和高温煅烧：
   - 增加水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中骨架外铁物种的数量
   - 提高离子交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5的N2O分解和ODHP活性

在不同反应条件下展示有效性的关键性能指标：

1. N2O转化率：骨架外铁催化剂较高
2. C3H8转化率：骨架外铁催化剂通常较高
3. C3H6选择性：低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5最高
4. C3H6产率：由于弱/中等酸性位点和各种铁物种增强N2O活化，Fe-ZSM-5的初始产率高于FeSiO2

最佳催化剂性能是通过骨架外铁物种（提高初始活性）和控制酸度（改善选择性和稳定性）之间的平衡来实现的。ZSM-5上弱/中等酸性位点、寡核铁物种和铁氧化物的组合增强了N2O的活化，从而提高了ODHP反应的催化性能。
