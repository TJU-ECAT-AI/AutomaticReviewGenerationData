[1] "The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation"

[2] "Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)−O complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene"

[3] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization."

[4] "Under the reducing conditions of propane/N2O reaction at 400 °C not only Fe in cationic sites, but also Td-coordinated Fe(III) in extra-framework Fe−Al−Si were reduced to Fe(II) ions (90% of total Fe) in both the non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites."

[5] "Beside Fe(II) ions highly stabilized by framework rings with two AlO4− charges, also other Fe(III)-oxo species reduced to Fe(II) under the conditions of propane/N2O reaction provide opportunity to form Fe(III)−O, which immediately interacts with propane."

The study compares different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, focusing on steam treatment and its effects on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Steam treatment significantly alters the structure of Fe species in both isomorphously substituted and ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5. This structural change leads to improved yields and lower catalyst deactivation rates.

For the ODHP reaction, the key performance metrics discussed are propane conversion, propene yield, and catalyst stability. The reaction mechanism involves propane hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)-O complex, followed by dehydration to propene.

Steamed Fe-zeolites showed higher and more stable propene yields compared to non-steamed ones. This improvement is attributed to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization.

Under reaction conditions (400°C, propane/N2O), both Fe in cationic sites and Td-coordinated Fe(III) in extra-framework Fe-Al-Si were reduced to Fe(II) ions in steamed and non-steamed zeolites. These Fe(II) species, along with other reduced Fe(III)-oxo species, can form Fe(III)-O complexes that interact with propane.

While specific numerical values for conversion, selectivity, and yield are not provided, the study emphasizes the superior performance of steamed Fe-zeolites in terms of propene yield and catalyst stability. The research highlights the importance of Fe species structure and acidity control in optimizing catalyst performance for the ODHP reaction.

这项研究比较了含铁ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法,重点关注蒸汽处理及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响。

蒸汽处理显著改变了同晶取代和离子交换Fe-ZSM-5中Fe物种的结构。这种结构变化导致了产率的提高和催化剂失活速率的降低。

对于ODHP反应,讨论的关键性能指标是丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。反应机理涉及丙烷在Fe(III)-O络合物上羟基化为丙醇,然后脱水生成丙烯。

经蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石与未经处理的相比,显示出更高且更稳定的丙烯产率。这种改进归因于经蒸汽处理的沸石中质子位点浓度较低,限制了丙烯的寡聚化。

在反应条件下(400°C,丙烷/N2O),阳离子位点中的Fe和骨架外Fe-Al-Si中的四面体配位Fe(III)在经蒸汽处理和未处理的沸石中都被还原为Fe(II)离子。这些Fe(II)物种,连同其他被还原的Fe(III)-氧物种,可以形成与丙烷相互作用的Fe(III)-O络合物。

虽然没有提供转化率、选择性和产率的具体数值,但研究强调了经蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石在丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性方面的优越性能。研究突出了Fe物种结构和酸度控制在优化ODHP反应催化剂性能中的重要性。
