[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C at 30% water vapor produced a considerable loss of the bridging hydroxyls and partial loss of the terminal silanols. The decreased concentration of hydroxyls is consistent with the removal of Al from the framework with formation of extra-framework Al species and condensation of silanol groups."

[2] "Steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C at 30% water vapor produced a considerable loss of the bridging hydroxyls and partial loss of the terminal silanols."

[3] "The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation"

[4] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization."

[5] "Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

[6] "The TOS analysis of conversion of propane, yields of propene and CO/CO2, and relative consumption of N2O and character of deposits formed compared over FeH- and steamed Fe(H)-zeolites (Fig. 6 and Table 8) showed detrimental effect of the high concentration of Brnsted sites on the propene yield and a decrease in propane conversion."

The study primarily compares steam-treated Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with non-steamed versions for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Steam treatment at 600°C significantly alters the structure of Fe species in the zeolite, removing Al from the framework and forming extra-framework Al species.

2. Steamed Fe-zeolites showed higher and more stable yields of propene compared to non-steamed versions. This improvement is attributed to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization.

3. The reaction mechanism involves the hydroxylation of propane to propanol over an Fe(III)-O complex, followed by dehydration to propene. Further transformations can occur over acid sites, leading to oligomers, aromatics, and carbon oxides.

4. High concentrations of Brønsted acid sites in non-steamed zeolites had a detrimental effect on propene yield and propane conversion over time.

5. Steamed Fe-zeolites demonstrated better catalyst stability and lower rates of deactivation compared to non-steamed versions.

The study does not provide specific numerical comparisons of C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield between different synthesis methods. However, it emphasizes that steam treatment improves overall catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction by modifying the Fe species structure and reducing acid site concentration.

这项研究主要比较了经过蒸汽处理的Fe-ZSM-5沸石与未经蒸汽处理的版本在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的表现。主要发现如下：

1. 在600°C下进行的蒸汽处理显著改变了沸石中Fe物种的结构，从骨架中移除Al并形成了骨架外Al物种。

2. 经过蒸汽处理的Fe沸石显示出更高且更稳定的丙烯产率，相比未经处理的版本。这种改善归因于经过蒸汽处理的沸石中质子位点浓度较低，限制了丙烯的寡聚化。

3. 反应机理涉及丙烷在Fe(III)-O复合物上羟基化为丙醇，随后脱水生成丙烯。进一步的转化可能在酸性位点上发生，导致生成寡聚物、芳香族化合物和碳氧化物。

4. 未经蒸汽处理的沸石中高浓度的Brønsted酸位随时间对丙烯产率和丙烷转化率产生了不利影响。

5. 经过蒸汽处理的Fe沸石展现出更好的催化剂稳定性和更低的失活率，相比未经处理的版本。

这项研究没有提供不同合成方法之间C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率的具体数值比较。然而，它强调蒸汽处理通过修改Fe物种结构和降低酸位浓度，改善了ODHP反应中的整体催化性能。
