[1] "The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration of Brnsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (1619%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (912%)."

[2] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

[3] "Both the non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites exhibited a similar type of reactivity toward O2, N2O and propane/N2O, but the population of the individual Fe products was different"

[4] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS. These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed"

[5] "On contrary, the initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."

The study compares non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 and steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentrations of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), with smaller amounts of mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (16-19%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (9-12%).

2. Steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites had low concentrations of both Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, with Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in FeAAlASi extra-framework species (43-47%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (30-33%) prevailing.

3. Both non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites showed similar reactivity towards O2, N2O, and propane/N2O, but the distribution of Fe species differed.

4. The initial turnover frequency for propane conversion (TOFC3H8) was similar for both non-steamed and steamed zeolites, regardless of crystal size, and decreased similarly with time-on-stream (TOS).

5. Steamed zeolites showed substantially higher initial propene yields (TOFC3H6) compared to non-steamed ones, and these yields were more stable over time.

These results indicate that while the steam treatment significantly alters the structure and distribution of Fe species in the zeolites, it does not greatly affect the initial propane conversion. However, it does improve propene yield and stability, likely due to the reduction in Brønsted acid sites that can cause side reactions. The study demonstrates that the steam treatment is an effective method for enhancing the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, particularly in terms of propene selectivity and yield stability.

该研究比较了非蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5和蒸汽处理的Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。主要发现包括：

1. 非蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5含有高浓度的Brønsted酸性位和主要为裸露的Fe(II)离子（72%），以及少量的单核和双核Fe(III)（16-19%）和寡聚Fe(III)-氧物种（9-12%）。

2. 蒸汽处理的Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石中Brønsted酸性位和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度较低，以四面体配位的Fe(III)离子为主，这些离子存在于FeAAlASi骨架外物种（43-47%）和Fe氧化物类颗粒（30-33%）中。

3. 非蒸汽处理和蒸汽处理的Fe沸石对O2、N2O和丙烷/N2O表现出类似的反应活性，但Fe物种的分布不同。

4. 两种沸石的初始丙烷转化频率（TOFC3H8）相似，且随反应时间的延长呈现相似的下降趋势，这一特性不受晶体尺寸和蒸汽处理的显著影响。

5. 相比非蒸汽处理的沸石，蒸汽处理的沸石表现出更高的初始丙烯产率（TOFC3H6），且这些产率随时间更加稳定。

这些结果表明，尽管蒸汽处理显著改变了沸石中Fe物种的结构和分布，但它并不大幅影响初始丙烷转化率。然而，蒸汽处理确实提高了丙烯产率和稳定性，这可能是由于减少了可能导致副反应的Brønsted酸性位。该研究表明，蒸汽处理是一种有效的方法，可以增强Fe-ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能，特别是在丙烯选择性和产率稳定性方面。
