[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C resulted in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

[2] "The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration of Brnsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (1619%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (912%)."

[3] "The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."

[4] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

[5] "Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites contain a high concentration of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions, with smaller amounts of mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species. This composition leads to higher propane conversion but lower propene selectivity due to the oligomerization of formed propene on the abundant Brønsted acid sites.

Steam treatment at 600°C dramatically changes the structure and distribution of iron species in the zeolite. It results in a low concentration of both Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, while increasing the proportion of Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in extra-framework FeAAlASi species and Fe-oxide-like particles. This new composition improves the catalytic performance in ODHP by reducing propene oligomerization and increasing propene yield.

The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for non-steamed catalysts due to higher concentration of active sites.
2. N2O conversion: Correlates with the amount of available Fe(II) sites for N2O decomposition.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Higher for steamed catalysts due to reduced Brønsted acidity and propene oligomerization.
4. C3H6 yield: Higher and more stable for steamed catalysts, especially those with smaller crystal sizes.

Crystal size also plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Smaller crystallites are preferred as they do not support propene oligomerization and allow for easier removal of products from the pores, leading to higher propene selectivity and yield.

In summary, steam treatment and smaller crystal sizes generally lead to better overall performance in the ODHP reaction, with higher propene selectivity and yield, despite potentially lower initial propane conversion rates.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。

未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5沸石含有高浓度的Brønsted酸性位和主要的裸露Fe(II)离子，以及少量的单核和双核Fe(III)和寡聚Fe(III)-氧物种。这种组成导致了较高的丙烷转化率，但由于在丰富的Brønsted酸性位上形成的丙烯发生寡聚反应，丙烯选择性较低。

600°C的蒸汽处理显著改变了沸石中铁物种的结构和分布。它降低了Brønsted酸性位和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度，同时增加了骨架外FeAAlASi物种中四面体配位Fe(III)离子和类Fe氧化物颗粒的比例。这种新的组成通过减少丙烯寡聚和增加丙烯产率，改善了ODHP反应的催化性能。

在不同反应条件下证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：由于活性位浓度较高，未经蒸汽处理的催化剂通常较高。
2. N2O转化率：与可用于N2O分解的Fe(II)位数量相关。
3. C3H6选择性：由于Brønsted酸性和丙烯寡聚反应减少，经蒸汽处理的催化剂较高。
4. C3H6产率：经蒸汽处理的催化剂，特别是晶体尺寸较小的催化剂，产率较高且更稳定。

晶体尺寸在催化剂性能中也起着至关重要的作用。较小的晶体更受欢迎，因为它们不支持丙烯寡聚反应，并允许产物更容易从孔中移除，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性和产率。

总之，蒸汽处理和较小的晶体尺寸通常会导致ODHP反应中更好的整体性能，具有更高的丙烯选择性和产率，尽管初始丙烷转化率可能较低。

[2] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C at 30% water vapor produced a considerable loss of the bridging hydroxyls and partial loss of the terminal silanols.

[3] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization. On contrary, with FeH-ZSM-5 and particularly of larger crystals, retention of more reactive polyolefins in the pores in TOS increases their oxidation to CO/CO2."

[4] "Fig. 6 depicts progressive changes with TOS in the propane conversion, yield of propene and CO/CO2 (COx), and the ratio of converted N2O/C3H8 at 400 C over the FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly steam treatment, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Steam treatment of FeH-ZSM-5 at 600°C results in the removal of framework Al and formation of extra-framework Al species. This leads to a decrease in bridging hydroxyls and terminal silanols, which reduces the concentration of protonic sites.

The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts include:

1. C3H8 conversion
2. N2O conversion
3. C3H6 selectivity
4. C3H6 yield

Steamed Fe-zeolites show higher and more stable yields of propene compared to non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5. This is primarily due to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization.

In contrast, non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5, especially those with larger crystals, retain more reactive polyolefins in their pores over time-on-stream (TOS). This leads to increased oxidation of these polyolefins to CO/CO2, reducing the selectivity and yield of propene.

The study compares the performance of FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st (steamed) zeolites at 400°C, showing progressive changes in propane conversion, propene yield, COx yield, and the ratio of converted N2O/C3H8 over time-on-stream.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods, it emphasizes the importance of the synthesis method, particularly steam treatment, in determining the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5分子筛的合成方法，尤其是蒸汽处理，显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。

在600°C下对FeH-ZSM-5进行蒸汽处理会导致骨架Al的移除和额外骨架Al物种的形成。这导致了桥接羟基和端基硅醇的减少，从而降低了质子位点的浓度。

展示这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率
2. N2O转化率
3. C3H6选择性
4. C3H6收率

经蒸汽处理的Fe-分子筛相比未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5表现出更高且更稳定的丙烯收率。这主要是由于经蒸汽处理的分子筛中质子位点浓度较低，限制了丙烯的寡聚反应。

相比之下，未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5，特别是那些具有较大晶体的分子筛，在反应时间(TOS)内会在其孔道中保留更多的活性聚烯烃。这导致了这些聚烯烃向CO/CO2的增加氧化，降低了丙烯的选择性和收率。

该研究比较了FeH-ZSM-5和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st（经蒸汽处理）分子筛在400°C下的性能，展示了随时间推移丙烷转化率、丙烯收率、COx收率和转化的N2O/C3H8比率的渐进变化。

虽然文档没有明确讨论固态离子交换或液体交换方法，但它强调了合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，在决定Fe-ZSM-5分子筛在ODHP反应中的催化性能方面的重要性。

[2] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

The study compares non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 and steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentrations of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), with smaller amounts of mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (16-19%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (9-12%).

2. Steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites had low concentrations of both Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, with Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in FeAAlASi extra-framework species (43-47%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (30-33%) prevailing.

3. Both non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites showed similar reactivity towards O2, N2O, and propane/N2O, but the distribution of Fe species differed.

4. The initial turnover frequency for propane conversion (TOFC3H8) was similar for both non-steamed and steamed zeolites, regardless of crystal size, and decreased similarly with time-on-stream (TOS).

5. Steamed zeolites showed substantially higher initial propene yields (TOFC3H6) compared to non-steamed ones, and these yields were more stable over time.

These results indicate that while the steam treatment significantly alters the structure and distribution of Fe species in the zeolites, it does not greatly affect the initial propane conversion. However, it does improve propene yield and stability, likely due to the reduction in Brønsted acid sites that can cause side reactions. The study demonstrates that the steam treatment is an effective method for enhancing the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, particularly in terms of propene selectivity and yield stability.

该研究比较了非蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5和蒸汽处理的Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。主要发现包括：

1. 非蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5含有高浓度的Brønsted酸性位和主要为裸露的Fe(II)离子（72%），以及少量的单核和双核Fe(III)（16-19%）和寡聚Fe(III)-氧物种（9-12%）。

2. 蒸汽处理的Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石中Brønsted酸性位和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度较低，以四面体配位的Fe(III)离子为主，这些离子存在于FeAAlASi骨架外物种（43-47%）和Fe氧化物类颗粒（30-33%）中。

3. 非蒸汽处理和蒸汽处理的Fe沸石对O2、N2O和丙烷/N2O表现出类似的反应活性，但Fe物种的分布不同。

4. 两种沸石的初始丙烷转化频率（TOFC3H8）相似，且随反应时间的延长呈现相似的下降趋势，这一特性不受晶体尺寸和蒸汽处理的显著影响。

5. 相比非蒸汽处理的沸石，蒸汽处理的沸石表现出更高的初始丙烯产率（TOFC3H6），且这些产率随时间更加稳定。

这些结果表明，尽管蒸汽处理显著改变了沸石中Fe物种的结构和分布，但它并不大幅影响初始丙烷转化率。然而，蒸汽处理确实提高了丙烯产率和稳定性，这可能是由于减少了可能导致副反应的Brønsted酸性位。该研究表明，蒸汽处理是一种有效的方法，可以增强Fe-ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能，特别是在丙烯选择性和产率稳定性方面。

[5] "Beside Fe(II) ions highly stabilized by framework rings with two AlO4− charges, also other Fe(III)-oxo species reduced to Fe(II) under the conditions of propane/N2O reaction provide opportunity to form Fe(III)−O, which immediately interacts with propane."

The study compares different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, focusing on steam treatment and its effects on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Steam treatment significantly alters the structure of Fe species in both isomorphously substituted and ion-exchanged Fe-ZSM-5. This structural change leads to improved yields and lower catalyst deactivation rates.

For the ODHP reaction, the key performance metrics discussed are propane conversion, propene yield, and catalyst stability. The reaction mechanism involves propane hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)-O complex, followed by dehydration to propene.

Steamed Fe-zeolites showed higher and more stable propene yields compared to non-steamed ones. This improvement is attributed to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization.

Under reaction conditions (400°C, propane/N2O), both Fe in cationic sites and Td-coordinated Fe(III) in extra-framework Fe-Al-Si were reduced to Fe(II) ions in steamed and non-steamed zeolites. These Fe(II) species, along with other reduced Fe(III)-oxo species, can form Fe(III)-O complexes that interact with propane.

While specific numerical values for conversion, selectivity, and yield are not provided, the study emphasizes the superior performance of steamed Fe-zeolites in terms of propene yield and catalyst stability. The research highlights the importance of Fe species structure and acidity control in optimizing catalyst performance for the ODHP reaction.

这项研究比较了含铁ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法,重点关注蒸汽处理及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响。

蒸汽处理显著改变了同晶取代和离子交换Fe-ZSM-5中Fe物种的结构。这种结构变化导致了产率的提高和催化剂失活速率的降低。

对于ODHP反应,讨论的关键性能指标是丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。反应机理涉及丙烷在Fe(III)-O络合物上羟基化为丙醇,然后脱水生成丙烯。

经蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石与未经处理的相比,显示出更高且更稳定的丙烯产率。这种改进归因于经蒸汽处理的沸石中质子位点浓度较低,限制了丙烯的寡聚化。

在反应条件下(400°C,丙烷/N2O),阳离子位点中的Fe和骨架外Fe-Al-Si中的四面体配位Fe(III)在经蒸汽处理和未处理的沸石中都被还原为Fe(II)离子。这些Fe(II)物种,连同其他被还原的Fe(III)-氧物种,可以形成与丙烷相互作用的Fe(III)-O络合物。

虽然没有提供转化率、选择性和产率的具体数值,但研究强调了经蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石在丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性方面的优越性能。研究突出了Fe物种结构和酸度控制在优化ODHP反应催化剂性能中的重要性。
