[1] "Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

[2] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C at 30% water vapor produced a considerable loss of the bridging hydroxyls and partial loss of the terminal silanols. The decreased concentration of hydroxyls is consistent with the removal of Al from the framework with formation of extra-framework Al species and condensation of silanol groups."

[3] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization. On contrary, with FeH-ZSM-5 and particularly of larger crystals, retention of more reactive polyolefins in the pores in TOS increases their oxidation to CO/CO2."

[4] "Fig. 6 depicts progressive changes with TOS in the propane conversion, yield of propene and CO/CO2 (COx), and the ratio of converted N2O/C3H8 at 400 C over the FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly steam treatment, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Steam treatment of FeH-ZSM-5 at 600°C results in the removal of framework Al and formation of extra-framework Al species. This leads to a decrease in bridging hydroxyls and terminal silanols, which reduces the concentration of protonic sites.

The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts include:

1. C3H8 conversion
2. N2O conversion
3. C3H6 selectivity
4. C3H6 yield

Steamed Fe-zeolites show higher and more stable yields of propene compared to non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5. This is primarily due to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization.

In contrast, non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5, especially those with larger crystals, retain more reactive polyolefins in their pores over time-on-stream (TOS). This leads to increased oxidation of these polyolefins to CO/CO2, reducing the selectivity and yield of propene.

The study compares the performance of FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st (steamed) zeolites at 400°C, showing progressive changes in propane conversion, propene yield, COx yield, and the ratio of converted N2O/C3H8 over time-on-stream.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods, it emphasizes the importance of the synthesis method, particularly steam treatment, in determining the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

含铁ZSM-5分子筛的合成方法，尤其是蒸汽处理，显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。

在600°C下对FeH-ZSM-5进行蒸汽处理会导致骨架Al的移除和额外骨架Al物种的形成。这导致了桥接羟基和端基硅醇的减少，从而降低了质子位点的浓度。

展示这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率
2. N2O转化率
3. C3H6选择性
4. C3H6收率

经蒸汽处理的Fe-分子筛相比未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5表现出更高且更稳定的丙烯收率。这主要是由于经蒸汽处理的分子筛中质子位点浓度较低，限制了丙烯的寡聚反应。

相比之下，未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5，特别是那些具有较大晶体的分子筛，在反应时间(TOS)内会在其孔道中保留更多的活性聚烯烃。这导致了这些聚烯烃向CO/CO2的增加氧化，降低了丙烯的选择性和收率。

该研究比较了FeH-ZSM-5和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st（经蒸汽处理）分子筛在400°C下的性能，展示了随时间推移丙烷转化率、丙烯收率、COx收率和转化的N2O/C3H8比率的渐进变化。

虽然文档没有明确讨论固态离子交换或液体交换方法，但它强调了合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，在决定Fe-ZSM-5分子筛在ODHP反应中的催化性能方面的重要性。
