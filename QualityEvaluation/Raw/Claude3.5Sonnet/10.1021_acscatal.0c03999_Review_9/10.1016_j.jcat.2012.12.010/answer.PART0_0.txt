[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C resulted in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

[2] "The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration of Brnsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (1619%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (912%)."

[3] "The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."

[4] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

[5] "Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites contain a high concentration of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions, with smaller amounts of mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species. This composition leads to higher propane conversion but lower propene selectivity due to the oligomerization of formed propene on the abundant Brønsted acid sites.

Steam treatment at 600°C dramatically changes the structure and distribution of iron species in the zeolite. It results in a low concentration of both Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, while increasing the proportion of Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in extra-framework FeAAlASi species and Fe-oxide-like particles. This new composition improves the catalytic performance in ODHP by reducing propene oligomerization and increasing propene yield.

The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for non-steamed catalysts due to higher concentration of active sites.
2. N2O conversion: Correlates with the amount of available Fe(II) sites for N2O decomposition.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Higher for steamed catalysts due to reduced Brønsted acidity and propene oligomerization.
4. C3H6 yield: Higher and more stable for steamed catalysts, especially those with smaller crystal sizes.

Crystal size also plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Smaller crystallites are preferred as they do not support propene oligomerization and allow for easier removal of products from the pores, leading to higher propene selectivity and yield.

In summary, steam treatment and smaller crystal sizes generally lead to better overall performance in the ODHP reaction, with higher propene selectivity and yield, despite potentially lower initial propane conversion rates.

含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。

未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5沸石含有高浓度的Brønsted酸性位和主要的裸露Fe(II)离子，以及少量的单核和双核Fe(III)和寡聚Fe(III)-氧物种。这种组成导致了较高的丙烷转化率，但由于在丰富的Brønsted酸性位上形成的丙烯发生寡聚反应，丙烯选择性较低。

600°C的蒸汽处理显著改变了沸石中铁物种的结构和分布。它降低了Brønsted酸性位和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度，同时增加了骨架外FeAAlASi物种中四面体配位Fe(III)离子和类Fe氧化物颗粒的比例。这种新的组成通过减少丙烯寡聚和增加丙烯产率，改善了ODHP反应的催化性能。

在不同反应条件下证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：由于活性位浓度较高，未经蒸汽处理的催化剂通常较高。
2. N2O转化率：与可用于N2O分解的Fe(II)位数量相关。
3. C3H6选择性：由于Brønsted酸性和丙烯寡聚反应减少，经蒸汽处理的催化剂较高。
4. C3H6产率：经蒸汽处理的催化剂，特别是晶体尺寸较小的催化剂，产率较高且更稳定。

晶体尺寸在催化剂性能中也起着至关重要的作用。较小的晶体更受欢迎，因为它们不支持丙烯寡聚反应，并允许产物更容易从孔中移除，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性和产率。

总之，蒸汽处理和较小的晶体尺寸通常会导致ODHP反应中更好的整体性能，具有更高的丙烯选择性和产率，尽管初始丙烷转化率可能较低。
