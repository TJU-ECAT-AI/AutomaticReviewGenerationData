[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed."

[2] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 °C."

[3] "The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments."

[4] "Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at 600 °C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT)."

[5] "An increase in the activity was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus 55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0% versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites."

The study compares various synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their impact on catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Key findings include:

1. Steamed Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites showed high catalytic activity in propane oxidation with N2O, while calcined zeolites and those using only oxygen as an oxidant exhibited low activity.

2. Fe-zeolites with the highest iron content (1200 ppm) that were steamed at 600°C in water vapor flow demonstrated the best catalytic performance.

3. The activity of Fe-zeolites was dependent on both iron content and pre-treatment conditions.

4. Replacing oxygen with N2O as the oxidant significantly increased propane conversion, especially for steamed zeolites. For example, FeH-MFI-1200-HT showed a dramatic increase from 3.4% to 43.5% conversion.

5. The increase in activity was accompanied by improved selectivity towards propene (from 44.0% to 55.9%) and increased production of aromatics and oxygenates (from 0% to 29.0%) for steamed zeolites.

Key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts include propane conversion, selectivity to propene, and yield of valuable products such as aromatics and oxygenates. The study highlights the superiority of steam treatment over other synthesis methods for enhancing the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

这项研究比较了含铁ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响。主要发现包括：

1. 经蒸汽处理的Fe-ZSM-5沸石在使用N2O进行丙烷氧化时表现出高催化活性，而煅烧的沸石和仅使用氧气作为氧化剂的沸石则表现出低活性。

2. 铁含量最高(1200 ppm)并在600°C水蒸气流中进行蒸汽处理的Fe沸石展示了最佳的催化性能。

3. Fe沸石的活性取决于铁含量和预处理条件。

4. 用N2O替代氧气作为氧化剂显著提高了丙烷转化率，尤其是对于经蒸汽处理的沸石。例如，FeH-MFI-1200-HT的转化率从3.4%大幅提升至43.5%。

5. 活性的提高伴随着对丙烯选择性的改善（从44.0%提高到55.9%）以及芳烃和含氧化合物产量的增加（从0%增加到29.0%），这些改善在经蒸汽处理的沸石中最为显著。

证明这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性以及有价值产品（如芳烃和含氧化合物）的产率。该研究强调了蒸汽处理相比其他合成方法在提高Fe-ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能方面的优越性。
