[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed."

[2] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 °C."

[3] "The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments."

[4] "Catalytic activity of FeH-zeolites expressed in terms of propane conversion, yield of propene and product selectivity with respect to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, is summarized in Table 2."

[5] "Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane conversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene yields."

The study examines various synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their impact on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Steaming treatment: Zeolites steamed at 600°C in water vapor flow showed the highest catalytic activity, especially those with high iron content (1200 ppm).

2. Calcination: Calcined zeolites showed lower activity compared to steamed ones.

3. Iron content: Higher iron content (30-1200 ppm range) generally led to improved catalytic performance.

4. Oxidant mixture: Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide increased propane conversion but decreased propene selectivity, while propene yields remained relatively unchanged.

Key performance metrics reported include:

- Propane conversion
- Propene yield
- Product selectivity (hydrocarbons and oxygenates)

The study does not explicitly mention solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods. The most effective catalysts were those with high iron content (1200 ppm) that underwent steaming treatment, showing high activity in propane oxidation by N2O. However, specific numerical values for N2O conversion are not provided in the given excerpts.

这项研究考察了含铁ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响。主要发现如下：

1. 蒸汽处理：在600°C水蒸气流中蒸汽处理的沸石显示出最高的催化活性，特别是那些铁含量高(1200 ppm)的沸石。

2. 煅烧：与蒸汽处理的沸石相比，煅烧的沸石显示出较低的活性。

3. 铁含量：较高的铁含量(30-1200 ppm范围)通常会导致更好的催化性能。

4. 氧化剂混合物：使用氧气和一氧化二氮的混合物增加了丙烷转化率，但降低了丙烯选择性，而丙烯产率相对保持不变。

报告的关键性能指标包括：

- 丙烷转化率
- 丙烯产率
- 产品选择性(烃类和含氧化合物)

该研究没有明确提及固态离子交换或液体交换方法。最有效的催化剂是那些经过蒸汽处理的高铁含量(1200 ppm)的催化剂，在N2O辅助丙烷氧化中显示出高活性。然而，在给出的摘录中没有提供N2O转化率的具体数值。
