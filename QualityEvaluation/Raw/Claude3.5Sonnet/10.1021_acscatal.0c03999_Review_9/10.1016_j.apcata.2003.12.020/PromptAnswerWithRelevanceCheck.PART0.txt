[1] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."

[2] "Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species."

[3] "Oxidation of propane with N2O over the steamed Fe-zeolites led to production of a high amount of propene. In addition, a considerable amount of other oxygenates (methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohol, phenol and acrolein) and aromatics (benzene and toluene) were formed."

[4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."

The study primarily compares steam treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites to calcination in dry oxygen. Steam treatment at 600°C was found to be the most effective method for enhancing catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

1. Propane conversion: Highest achieved was 51.7% using a mixture of O2 and N2O over steamed FeH-ZSM-5.

2. Propene selectivity: 39.7% for the same conditions as above.

3. Yield of other valuable products: 11.5% selectivity to aromatics and oxygenates (mainly C1-C3 alcohols).

4. N2O conversion: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be high for steamed samples.

Steamed Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts showed significantly higher activity compared to calcined samples, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. The enhanced performance is attributed to the extraction of framework Fe to extra-framework positions during steaming, creating active sites for N2O decomposition and propane activation.

The study did not directly compare solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods. However, it emphasized the importance of extra-framework Fe species, which are most effectively generated through steam treatment at 600°C.

该研究主要比较了Fe-ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽处理和干氧气煅烧。在600°C下进行蒸汽处理被发现是提高N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)催化性能的最有效方法。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烷转化率：使用O2和N2O混合物在蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5上达到最高51.7%。

2. 丙烯选择性：在相同条件下为39.7%。

3. 其他有价值产物的产率：芳烃和含氧化合物（主要是C1-C3醇类）的选择性为11.5%。

4. N2O转化率：虽未明确说明，但暗示蒸汽处理样品的转化率较高。

与煅烧样品相比，蒸汽处理的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂显示出显著更高的活性，特别是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。性能提升归因于蒸汽处理过程中骨架Fe被提取到骨架外位置，创造了N2O分解和丙烷活化的活性位点。

该研究没有直接比较固态离子交换或液体交换方法。然而，它强调了骨架外Fe物种的重要性，这些物种最有效地通过600°C的蒸汽处理生成。

An increase in the activity was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus 55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0% versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment at 600°C is particularly effective, as it extracts tetrahedrally coordinated Fe from the framework to cationic positions, forming various iron species including isolated ions and oligonuclear complexes. This process greatly enhances the catalytic activity.

Key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of steamed Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites include:

1. Propane conversion: Dramatically increased from 3.4% with oxygen to 43.5% with N2O for FeH-MFI-1200-HT.

2. Propene selectivity: Increased from 44.0% to 55.9% when using N2O instead of oxygen.

3. Aromatics and oxygenates selectivity: Increased from 0% to 29.0% with N2O.

4. Product distribution: High amounts of propene, along with other valuable products like methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohols, phenol, acrolein, benzene, and toluene.

The most effective catalysts were Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content, steamed in water vapor at 600°C. These showed the highest catalytic activity in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. The study does not provide specific information on solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods for comparison.
