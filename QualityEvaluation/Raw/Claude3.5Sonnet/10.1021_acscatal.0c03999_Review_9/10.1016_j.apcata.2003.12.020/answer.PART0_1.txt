[1] "Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species."

[2] "Oxidation of propane with N2O over the steamed Fe-zeolites led to production of a high amount of propene. In addition, a considerable amount of other oxygenates (methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohol, phenol and acrolein) and aromatics (benzene and toluene) were formed."

[3] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."

[4] "Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at 600 C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT). An increase in the activity was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus 55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0% versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment at 600°C is particularly effective, as it extracts tetrahedrally coordinated Fe from the framework to cationic positions, forming various iron species including isolated ions and oligonuclear complexes. This process greatly enhances the catalytic activity.

Key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of steamed Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites include:

1. Propane conversion: Dramatically increased from 3.4% with oxygen to 43.5% with N2O for FeH-MFI-1200-HT.

2. Propene selectivity: Increased from 44.0% to 55.9% when using N2O instead of oxygen.

3. Aromatics and oxygenates selectivity: Increased from 0% to 29.0% with N2O.

4. Product distribution: High amounts of propene, along with other valuable products like methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohols, phenol, acrolein, benzene, and toluene.

The most effective catalysts were Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content, steamed in water vapor at 600°C. These showed the highest catalytic activity in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. The study does not provide specific information on solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods for comparison.

铁含量ZSM-5分子筛的合成方法显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。600°C的蒸汽处理特别有效，因为它将四面体配位的Fe从骨架提取到阳离子位置，形成各种铁物种，包括孤立离子和寡核络合物。这个过程大大提高了催化活性。

证明蒸汽处理Fe-ZSM-5分子筛有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烷转化率：对于FeH-MFI-1200-HT，从使用氧气时的3.4%显著增加到使用N2O时的43.5%。

2. 丙烯选择性：从使用氧气时的44.0%增加到使用N2O时的55.9%。

3. 芳烃和含氧化合物选择性：使用N2O时从0%增加到29.0%。

4. 产物分布：大量丙烯，以及其他有价值的产品如甲醇、乙醇、异丙醇和正丙醇、苯酚、丙烯醛、苯和甲苯。

最有效的催化剂是Fe含量最高、在600°C水蒸气中处理的Fe-分子筛。这些催化剂在N2O辅助的ODHP反应中表现出最高的催化活性。该研究没有提供固态离子交换或液体交换方法的具体比较信息。
