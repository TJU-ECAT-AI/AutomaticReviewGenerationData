[1] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."

[2] "Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species."

[3] "Oxidation of propane with N2O over the steamed Fe-zeolites led to production of a high amount of propene. In addition, a considerable amount of other oxygenates (methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohol, phenol and acrolein) and aromatics (benzene and toluene) were formed."

[4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."

The study primarily compares steam treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites to calcination in dry oxygen. Steam treatment at 600°C was found to be the most effective method for enhancing catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

1. Propane conversion: Highest achieved was 51.7% using a mixture of O2 and N2O over steamed FeH-ZSM-5.

2. Propene selectivity: 39.7% for the same conditions as above.

3. Yield of other valuable products: 11.5% selectivity to aromatics and oxygenates (mainly C1-C3 alcohols).

4. N2O conversion: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be high for steamed samples.

Steamed Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts showed significantly higher activity compared to calcined samples, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. The enhanced performance is attributed to the extraction of framework Fe to extra-framework positions during steaming, creating active sites for N2O decomposition and propane activation.

The study did not directly compare solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods. However, it emphasized the importance of extra-framework Fe species, which are most effectively generated through steam treatment at 600°C.

该研究主要比较了Fe-ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽处理和干氧气煅烧。在600°C下进行蒸汽处理被发现是提高N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)催化性能的最有效方法。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烷转化率：使用O2和N2O混合物在蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5上达到最高51.7%。

2. 丙烯选择性：在相同条件下为39.7%。

3. 其他有价值产物的产率：芳烃和含氧化合物（主要是C1-C3醇类）的选择性为11.5%。

4. N2O转化率：虽未明确说明，但暗示蒸汽处理样品的转化率较高。

与煅烧样品相比，蒸汽处理的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂显示出显著更高的活性，特别是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。性能提升归因于蒸汽处理过程中骨架Fe被提取到骨架外位置，创造了N2O分解和丙烷活化的活性位点。

该研究没有直接比较固态离子交换或液体交换方法。然而，它强调了骨架外Fe物种的重要性，这些物种最有效地通过600°C的蒸汽处理生成。
