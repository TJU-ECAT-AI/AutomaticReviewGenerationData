[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed."

[2] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 °C."

[3] "The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments."

[4] "Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane conversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene yields."

[5] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high selectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1–C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%). Yield of propene is comparable to that one achieved with most active mixed metal oxides for propane oxidative dehydrogenation."

The study demonstrates that various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key findings include:

1. Steamed Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites showed high catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O, while calcined zeolites and those using only oxygen as an oxidant exhibited low activity.

2. Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content (1200 ppm) steamed at 600°C in water vapor flow demonstrated the highest catalytic activity.

3. The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on both the Fe content and the pre-treatment conditions.

4. Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants increased propane conversion but decreased propene selectivity, without substantially changing propene yields.

5. Key performance metrics for the most effective catalyst (steamed FeH-ZSM-5) include:
   - Propane conversion: 44%
   - Propene selectivity: 56%
   - Propene yield: Comparable to the most active mixed metal oxides for propane ODH

These results highlight the importance of synthesis method, particularly steam treatment, in optimizing the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

研究表明，不同的铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能有显著影响。主要发现包括：

1. 经蒸汽处理的Fe-ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化中表现出高催化活性，而煅烧的沸石和仅使用氧气作为氧化剂的沸石表现出低活性。

2. 在600°C水蒸气流中蒸汽处理的高铁含量(1200 ppm)Fe沸石表现出最高的催化活性。

3. Fe沸石的活性取决于铁含量和预处理条件。

4. 使用氧气和一氧化二氮的混合物作为氧化剂可以提高丙烷转化率，但会降低丙烯选择性，而丙烯产率没有显著变化。

5. 最有效催化剂(蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5)的关键性能指标包括：
   - 丙烷转化率：44%
   - 丙烯选择性：56%
   - 丙烯产率：与最活跃的混合金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷ODH的产率相当

这些结果强调了合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，在优化Fe-ZSM-5沸石用于N2O辅助ODHP反应的催化性能中的重要性。
