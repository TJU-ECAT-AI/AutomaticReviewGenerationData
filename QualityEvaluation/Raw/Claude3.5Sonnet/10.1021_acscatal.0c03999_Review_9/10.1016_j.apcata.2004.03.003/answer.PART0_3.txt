[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde."

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. However, it does discuss the performance of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites, specifically comparing ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite.

Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are described as highly efficient catalysts for this reaction. Ex-FeZSM-5 showed superior performance compared to ex-Fe-silicalite in terms of activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation by coking.

Key performance metrics reported for ex-FeZSM-5 include:
- C3H8 conversion: 52%
- N2O conversion: 86%
- C3H6 yield: 22%
- Propionaldehyde yield: 5.5%

For ex-Fe-silicalite, the metrics were:
- C3H8 conversion: 26%
- N2O conversion: 49%
- C3H6 yield: 16.5%
- Propionaldehyde yield: 3.6%

These results demonstrate that the steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 catalyst is more effective for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction under the conditions studied.

文献没有直接比较不同合成方法对铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能影响。但是,它确实讨论了蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石的性能,特别是比较了ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-硅铝石。

蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石被描述为这种反应的高效催化剂。与ex-Fe-硅铝石相比,ex-FeZSM-5在活性、选择性和抗积炭失活方面表现更优。

ex-FeZSM-5的关键性能指标包括:
- C3H8转化率: 52%
- N2O转化率: 86%
- C3H6收率: 22%
- 丙醛收率: 5.5%

ex-Fe-硅铝石的指标为:
- C3H8转化率: 26%
- N2O转化率: 49%
- C3H6收率: 16.5%
- 丙醛收率: 3.6%

这些结果表明,在所研究的条件下,蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5催化剂对N2O辅助ODHP反应更有效。
