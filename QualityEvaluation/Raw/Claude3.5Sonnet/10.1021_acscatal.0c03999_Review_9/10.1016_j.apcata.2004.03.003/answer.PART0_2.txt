[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde."

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

The literature primarily focuses on steam-activated FeMFI zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various synthesis methods such as solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange.

The key performance metrics discussed are:
1. C3H8 conversion
2. N2O conversion  
3. C3H6 (propene) yield
4. Propionaldehyde yield

Steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 showed superior performance compared to ex-Fe-silicalite:

- C3H8 conversion: 52% vs 26%
- N2O conversion: 86% vs 49% 
- C3H6 yield: 22% vs 16.5%
- Propionaldehyde yield: 5.5% vs 3.6%

Ex-FeZSM-5 also demonstrated higher resistance to deactivation by coking. The study highlights that steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for this reaction, but does not provide detailed information on other synthesis methods or reaction conditions.

这篇文献主要关注蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。它没有提供各种合成方法(如固态离子交换或液体交换)的全面比较。

讨论的关键性能指标包括：
1. C3H8转化率
2. N2O转化率
3. C3H6(丙烯)收率
4. 丙醛收率

蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5相比ex-Fe-硅铝石表现出更优异的性能：

- C3H8转化率：52%对26%
- N2O转化率：86%对49%
- C3H6收率：22%对16.5%
- 丙醛收率：5.5%对3.6%

Ex-FeZSM-5还表现出对结焦失活的更高抗性。这项研究强调蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石是该反应的高效催化剂，但没有提供其他合成方法或反应条件的详细信息。
