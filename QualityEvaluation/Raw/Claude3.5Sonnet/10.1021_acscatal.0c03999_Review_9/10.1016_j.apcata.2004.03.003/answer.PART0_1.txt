[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde."

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

[4] "The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites. The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the catalytic performance as compared to extraframework isolated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. However, it does discuss the performance of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites, particularly ex-FeZSM-5, show high efficiency in the ODHP reaction. The key performance metrics mentioned are:

1. C3H8 conversion: 52% for ex-FeZSM-5, 26% for ex-Fe-silicalite
2. N2O conversion: 86% for ex-FeZSM-5, 49% for ex-Fe-silicalite
3. C3H6 yield: 22% for ex-FeZSM-5, 16.5% for ex-Fe-silicalite
4. Propionaldehyde yield: 5.5% for ex-FeZSM-5, 3.6% for ex-Fe-silicalite

The superior performance of ex-FeZSM-5 is attributed to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which are formed during the steam activation process. These clusters provide better catalytic performance compared to the isolated iron ions found in ex-Fe-silicalite.

While the literature does not discuss other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange, it emphasizes the importance of the nature and distribution of iron species in determining catalytic performance. The steam activation process appears to be crucial in creating the desired iron species distribution for effective ODHP catalysis.

文献并未直接比较不同的铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法。然而,它确实讨论了蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。

蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石,特别是ex-FeZSM-5,在ODHP反应中表现出高效率。提到的关键性能指标有:

1. C3H8转化率:ex-FeZSM-5为52%,ex-Fe-硅石为26%
2. N2O转化率:ex-FeZSM-5为86%,ex-Fe-硅石为49%
3. C3H6产率:ex-FeZSM-5为22%,ex-Fe-硅石为16.5%
4. 丙醛产率:ex-FeZSM-5为5.5%,ex-Fe-硅石为3.6%

ex-FeZSM-5的优异性能归因于寡核FexOy簇的存在,这些簇是在蒸汽活化过程中形成的。与ex-Fe-硅石中发现的孤立铁离子相比,这些簇提供了更好的催化性能。

虽然文献没有讨论其他合成方法,如固态离子交换或液体交换,但它强调了铁物种的性质和分布在决定催化性能方面的重要性。蒸汽活化过程似乎对创造有效ODHP催化所需的铁物种分布至关重要。
