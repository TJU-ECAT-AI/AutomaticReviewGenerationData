[1] "The performance of steam-activated iron zeolites used in this study, based on a multi-technique approach, has been reported elsewhere [12,13,15]. The iron content in ex-FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and ex-Fe-silicalite (Si/Al and 0.68 wt.% Fe) catalysts was very similar, although the catalyst constitution with respect to iron (nature and distribution of species) differs strongly."

[2] "When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 min."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

[4] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the context of the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does provide information on the performance of steam-activated iron zeolites, specifically ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite.

The key performance metrics mentioned include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 (propene) yield, and propionaldehyde yield. The study shows that ex-FeZSM-5 outperforms ex-Fe-silicalite in these metrics:

1. C3H8 conversion: 52% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs. 26% for ex-Fe-silicalite
2. N2O conversion: 86% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs. 49% for ex-Fe-silicalite
3. C3H6 yield: 22% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs. 16.5% for ex-Fe-silicalite
4. Propionaldehyde yield: 5.5% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs. 3.6% for ex-Fe-silicalite

The study also notes that ex-FeZSM-5 shows superior activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation by coking compared to ex-Fe-silicalite in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O.

Both catalysts experience deactivation due to coke formation over time, but can recover their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes.

While the study does not directly address how different synthesis methods influence catalytic performance, it does highlight the importance of iron distribution within the zeolite structure, which can be affected by the synthesis method.

这篇文献并没有直接比较不同合成方法对铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能的影响。但是,它提供了蒸汽活化的铁沸石,特别是ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-硅铝石的性能信息。

文中提到的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6(丙烯)收率和丙醛收率。研究表明,ex-FeZSM-5在这些指标上优于ex-Fe-硅铝石:

1. C3H8转化率:ex-FeZSM-5为52%,ex-Fe-硅铝石为26%
2. N2O转化率:ex-FeZSM-5为86%,ex-Fe-硅铝石为49%
3. C3H6收率:ex-FeZSM-5为22%,ex-Fe-硅铝石为16.5%
4. 丙醛收率:ex-FeZSM-5为5.5%,ex-Fe-硅铝石为3.6%

研究还指出,在C3H8与N2O的氧化转化中,ex-FeZSM-5表现出更优异的活性、选择性和抗积碳失活能力。

两种催化剂随时间推移都会因积碳而失活,但在773 K下经氧气处理30分钟后可恢复初始活性。

虽然这项研究没有直接讨论不同合成方法如何影响催化性能,但它确实强调了沸石结构中铁分布的重要性,而铁的分布可能受合成方法的影响。
