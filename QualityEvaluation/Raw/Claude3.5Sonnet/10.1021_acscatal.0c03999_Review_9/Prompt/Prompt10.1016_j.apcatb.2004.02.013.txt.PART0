Abstract
Zeolite supported iron catalysts were prepared by different methods and their catalytic performance was studied in the N2O decomposition
reaction. Iron-zeolite was prepared in accordance with the best-known recipes described in literature, not only at Energy research Centre of
the Netherlands (ECN), but also at other independent institutes to ensure that the best available expertise in the field was applied for each
method. The preparation methods subject to investigation were the wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapour deposition/sublimation and
ex-framework method. All catalysts were subjected to similar reaction conditions representative of exhaust emissions from nitric acid factories
and the total conversion of N2O by decomposition reaction were compared.
With respect to the catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture, the wet ion-exchange based preparation method to prepare iron-zeolite
is slightly favoured over alternative methods. WIE based Fe-zeolite catalysts combine high N2O decomposition (and selective catalytic
reduction, SCR) activity with good hydro-thermal stability. The pH of the suspension of the iron salt and the zeolite during WIE is a key factor
in achieving catalysts with high activity in N2O decomposition. The topology of the zeolite is also a key factor for both activity and stability
under realistic practical conditions. However, over-exchange (Fe/Al ratio = 1), which can be achieved with the chemical vapour deposition
(CVD) method, but which is also a goal in studies on WIE preparation, is not a key factor in gaining high activity. Wet ion-exchange yields a
catalyst with less than 50% of the exchange sites occupied by Fe.

1. Introduction
The concentration of the potent greenhouse gas N2O in
the atmosphere is rising [1]. Industrial sources e.g. nylon
production (adipic acid) and fertiliser production (HNO3)
are responsible for 23% of the world-wide emissions [2].
Agriculture (fertiliser use, leguminous crops), and to a lesser
extent, transport (mainly three-way catalyst, diesel engines)
make up for the rest.
Direct decomposition of N2O and selective catalytic re-
duction of N2O with hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) are inves-
tigated as potential cost-efficient technologies (
per ton
CO2 equivalents removed) to remove nitrous oxide from
industrial off-gases [3]. Direct catalytic decomposition of
N2O is a relatively simple method to remove nitrous oxide

from industrial off-gases. It is generally believed to be more
cost-efficient than HC-SCR as hydrocarbons are not often
present on-site and an external supply of hydrocarbons is
expensive. Nevertheless, the temperature of the off-gases of
many plants is below 450 C and the challenge is to decom-
pose N2O at this temperature. Until now, only HC-SCR has
been successfully applied at low temperature, which leaves
both reactions of primary interest to many researchers.
Iron-zeolites, especially Fe-ZSM5, are being studied for
use as DeNOx catalysts in lean-burn gasoline and diesel en-
gines [4] and also for N2O decomposition and reduction (3).
Also, high activity of Fe-ZSM5 was observed for selective
oxidations using N2O as an oxidant (e.g. direct oxidation of
benzene to phenol) [5].
The Energy research Centre of The Netherlands (ECN)
has developed a process for the hydrocarbon-assisted selec-
tive catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide, which is based on
an iron-substituted ZSM5 zeolite catalyst prepared by wet
ion-exchange methodology. The use of this catalyst for the

hydrocarbon-assisted destruction of N2O has been disclosed
in two patents [6,7]. The catalyst also shows great potential
for the direct decomposition of N2O [3,8].
Iron-zeolites are also known for the controversies regard-
ing their preparation. Several different methods are described
in the literature to prepare iron-zeolite catalysts. From them,
the best known are the following:
(1) Wet ion-exchange: WIE is the most common method
to prepare metal-exchanged zeolites. A limitation of
this technique is that it appeared to be impossible to
make use of the full ion-exchange capacity of the zeo-
lite, i.e. the Fe/Al ratio is limited to about 50% (apart
from some reports of Fe/Al 0.9 obtained with WIE of
FeC2O4 by Feng and Hall [911] that appeared not re-
producible [4,12]). Furthermore, it is reported that when
the ion-exchange procedure is carried out in air, Fe2O3
(hematite) is formed which is said to have a negative
effect on the catalytic activity [4].
(2) Solid-state ion-exchange: An solid iron salt (e.g. FeSO4)
is mechanically mixed with the zeolite powder and sub-
sequently heated rapidly in an oven [13,14].
(3) Sublimation or chemical vapour deposition (CVD): A
iron salt with a low evaporation temperature, e.g. FeCl3,
is evaporated and reacted with a H-form zeolite. This
procedure gives a catalyst with a very high exchange
rate, i.e. every Al-exchange site contains a Fe-ion (Fe/Al
1). After CVD, the catalyst has to be washed thoroughly
to remove the chlorine and calcined carefully [3,1520].
(4) Ex-framework: This method is based on isomorphous
substitution, i.e. part of the aluminium in the framework
is replaced by iron. Using a steaming procedure, the Fe
is removed from the framework and becomes available
for reaction [8,2123].
Currently, there is some consensus in literature that in or-
der to achieve active catalysts the iron content should be
high, i.e. the Fe/Al ratio should approach one. The iron
should be of an ionic nature: the presence of iron oxide
should be avoided [9,1619,22,23]. Chemical vapour depo-
sition is believed to fulfil the criteria and is therefore cur-
rently the most studied methodology.
Nevertheless, it remains difficult to judge on the most at-
tractive method to prepare iron-zeolite. The interpretation
of the activity data obtained with the various preparation
methods and among the different researchers as well as their
evaluation is complicated by variations in the test conditions
chosen. Together with the fact that the gas composition is
sometimes far from that of true off-gases, the true poten-
tial is not always straightforwardly deduced. Especially NOx
(positively) and water (negatively) are known to affect N2O
decomposition activity over iron-zeolites [13] and its pres-
ence in different amounts may obscure evaluations. Also,
the post-modification method was reported to be important
[18,24].
Therefore, an important objective of this study is to eval-
uate iron-zeolite catalysts, prepared differently at ECN and
kindly donated by other independent institutes, subjecting
them to similar reaction conditions representative of prac-
tical situations. Zeolite based iron catalysts were prepared
by wet ion-exchange, chemical vapour deposition, i.e. sub-
limation and the ex-framework method. Moreover, ECN at-
tained expertise in the preparation of iron-zeolite with wet
ion-exchange. Others have developed alternative prepara-
tion methods in more detail. The evaluation of ECNs sam-
ples and samples prepared elsewhere ensures comparing the
best catalysts accomplished by the most relevant expertise
available in the field. Special attention is given to the wet
ion-exchange preparation method to optimise activity and
stability.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
2.1.1. Wet-ion-exchange
All catalysts are prepared at ECN. Support zeolites are
ZSM5 (Alsi Penta SM27), BEA (Zeolyst CP814A), MOR
(zeolyst CBV21a, CBV10a, CBV90a). Typically the iron
salt was dissolved in demiwater and added to the zeolite at
once. The suspension was further diluted by adding addi-
tional demiwater up to a solid to liquid ratio of ca. 1015
(gl1). The exchange was carried out at 8085 C (a temper-
ature of ca. 80 C reduce the size of the hydration sphere of
the Fe2+ increasing the diffusivity inside micropores [26])
and for a period of between 6 and 48 h, while stirring at
500 rpm. The catalysts are coded according to the exchange
parameters (Table 1). Occasionally, the catalysts were pre-
pared by adding a zeolite in water suspension drop-wise to
the dissolved iron salt under continuous stirring (more de-
tails elsewhere in the text). For filtration and washing ei-
ther of the two following procedures were used; the samples
were filtered and the filter cake was suspended in 1 l water
for 30 min, while stirring and filtered once more under vac-
uum. The other procedure was to keep the cake under vac-
uum and pouring two times 500 ml (per 10 g cake) on the
cake (coding contains asterisk (*)). The zeolites were cal-
cined at 550 C during 5 h (heating rate 1 C min1) in static
air under shallow bed conditions, unless stated differently.
2.1.2. Chemical vapour deposition
Catalysts were prepared at Eindhoven University, at Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), and at ECN.
2.1.2.1. University of Eindhoven.
FeCl3 was sublimed
into the H-ZSM5 (AKZO Nobel Si/Al = 20), followed by
calcination at 550 C. Further treatments of Fe-ZSM5 in-
cluded calcination at 700 C, followed by exposure to 10%
water vapour treatment at 500 C in a repetitive fashion.
Every treatment took 3 h. Further details are provided in
[19,20].

Mohrs is used to denote Mohrs salt, ((NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2).
The washing procedure was different (see elsewhere in the text).
2.1.2.2. ETH.
FeCl3 was sublimed into H-ZSM5 Sd-
chemie AG (Na-MFI-46, Si/Al = 20 was transformed
into NH4-MFI and in H-MFI by ion-exchange with 1 M
NH4NO3 and subsequent calcination): the procedure is
explained in detail by Marturano et al. [18]. The paper ad-
dresses several pre- and post- modification methods of the
samples in full detail. The sample we have studied in detail
is denoted SC69. After sublimation, the sample was washed
thoroughly in order to remove chlorine, subsequently
calcined.
2.1.2.3. ECN.
Alsi Penta ZSM5 SM27 was calcined at
500 C and the zeolite together with FeCl3 was handled
in a glove box. The oven was heated to 170 C for 2 h to
dehydrate the zeolite and then the temperature was increased
to 320 C to sublime the FeCl3 into the zeolite under argon
atmosphere during 2 h. Several attempts led to the general
feature of a non-uniform colour in a gradient ranging from
light yellow to light orange.
2.1.3. Ex-framework method
This catalyst was obtained from Delft University of Tech-
nology. This preparation method is based on isomorphous
substitution and is described in detail in Ref. [23].
The catalysts are compiled in Table 1.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The metal loading of the ECN catalysts were examined us-
ing ICP elemental analysis. The results are listed in Table 2.
Micropore volume was determined by t-plot analysis of the
nitrogen sorption isotherms.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) gives infor-
mation about the nature of the iron species on the catalyst.
H2-TPR spectra were recorded with an Altamira AMI-1
apparatus equipped with a TCD detector and a Balzers
MS-detector, applying 30 ml min1 flow of 10% H2 in Ar-
gon at a heating rate of 20 C min1. 200 mg of sample
with sieve fraction 0.250.5 mm was introduced in the reac-
tor without further dilution. The H2/Fe ratio is determined
by dividing the integrated area of the total TPR peak(s)
divided by the amount of Fe in the sample. The integrated
area is related to moles of hydrogen by pulse calibration
with a known volume. The H2/Fe ratio is 0.5 when only the
reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ takes place (i.e. when cationic
Fe is counterbalancing the negative charge of the zeolite
framework). If all the iron is present as Fe2O3 the H2/Fe
ratio is 1.5.
Infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements were per-
formed with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFT) on
a BIORAD FTS-175 spectrometer equipped with a Har-
rick HV-DR2 flow cell. Spectra were recorded in the

KubelkaMunk (KM) modes at 350 C. Spectra were
recorded with a spectral resolution of 4 cm1. 120 scans
were averaged for one spectrum. DRIFT spectral intensi-
ties depend on relative amounts of surface reflection and
radiation that has penetrated the sample. Quantification of
spectral intensities would require that particle size, particle
distribution, packing density, humidity should be kept con-
stant. This complex quantitative characterisation is beyond
the scope of the paper and we will only describe spectra in
terms of relative peak positions.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL J6330F) was
used to study the morphology of the catalysts. EDX (con-
nected to the SEM) was also used for elemental analysis.
Two set-ups were used for catalysts screening:
(1) Miniflow catalyst test facility: The gases are supplied by
electronic mass flow controllers and water is fed using
a liqui-flow controller (Bronkhorst Hi-Tec). All compo-
nents are mixed in a controlled evaporator mixer and
the lines are kept at approximately 120 C to prevent
condensation. A stainless steel reactor with an internal
diameter of 25 mm was used. The first part of the re-
actor is filled with Al2O3 pellets for pre-heating of
the gases. The catalyst particles are placed on a quartz
grid. The temperature of the gases in the reactor is mea-
sured at the entrance and the exit of the catalyst bed. A
back-pressure regulator is placed behind the reactor to
allow the pressure to be adjusted between 1 and 10 (a).
An FTIR gas analyser is used for measuring the con-
centration of the various constituents in the gas phase.
Concentrations of N2O, NO, NO2, NH3, CH4, CO, CO2,
and H2O were measured directly.
(2) Microflow catalyst test facility: The principle of the sys-
tem is the same as of the miniflow, only the scale is
smaller (see Table 3). Water was dosed by bubbling ni-
trogen through a temperature-controlled evaporator. The
reactor was made of glass. Gas analysis was performed
by FTIR and with GC-TCD.

The gas composition (see Table 3) is selected as being
typical for a (larger) nitric acid plant. The N2O conversion
in the feed without reductant (decomposition) is calculated
directly from the changes in concentration N2O in the gas
phase (selectivity conversion N2O to N2 was 100%). In the
feed with reductant (see Table 5, WIE based samples) the
same approach was used; the conversion levels reflect there-
fore the sum of the SCR and decomposition activity (no
decomposition activity below 350 C). The propane conver-
sion is calculated directly from the changes in concentration
propane in the gas phase: this includes the conversion of
propane by reaction with N2O, the conversion of propane
by reaction with NOx as well as the conversion of propane
by direct oxidation.
3. Results
3.1. Characterisation of fresh iron catalysts
3.1.1. Elemental analysis
In Table 2 the results of the elemental analysis are given.
The Si/Al ratio of the Alsi Penta SM27 catalyst is about
11.7. A measured Si/Al ratio of 11.4 (close to our ICP re-
sults) of the same zeolite has been reported by Rauser et al.
[14]. Also the three ion-exchanged zeolites from Zeolyst
had a slightly lower Si/Al ratio than specified. Treatment of
the Alsi Penta SM27 Fe-ZSM5 with HCl did not change the
Si/Al ratio.
In the Fe(Cl)-Na-ZSM5-SN27-sub(2) catalyst the Na/Al
is about 1. The catalyst is prepared by sublimation of FeCl3
on Na-ZSM5, which did not result in replacement of the Na
ions by Fe. It can be safely assumed that all iron is present as
Fe2O3 particles on the surface of the zeolite (as confirmed
by TPR).
The zeolites used for ECNs catalysts were checked for
the presence of iron as an impurity. Alsi Penta ZSM5 SM27
contained about 0.060.07 wt.% iron. MOR CBV21a con-
tained about 0.05 wt.% iron. BEA CP814E did not contain
any detectable iron.
Fig. 1. Hydrogen-TPR of iron-ZSM5 SM27 zeolites prepared by WIE and CVD. The sample code in the legend represents the spectrum next to it.
3.1.2. H2-TPR
Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen-TPR spectra of ZSM5 AP
based iron catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction
(TPR) with H2 can detect the presence of iron oxide,
which is formed as a by-product in many syntheses of
Fe-ZSM5. Hematite (Fe2O3) has a sharp peak at 380 C
and a broad peak around 700 C [25] corresponding to
the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 (magnetite), FeO [17]
and possibly Fe0 [11]. The H2/Fe ratios are compiled in
Table 2. For the Mohrs salt based Fe-ZSM5 catalyst, the
H2/Fe ratio is 1, which means that roughly 50% of the Fe
is present as Fe2O3. With the aid of TPR, the Fe/Al* is
determined, i.e. ionic iron co-ordinated at Al sites (so Fe
in the form of Fe2O3 subtracted, Table 2). The spectrum of
Fe(Cl)-Na-ZSM5-SN27-sub(2), prepared by sublimation of
Fe(Cl)3 into SN27 AP matches the one of bulk Fe2O3 pre-
sented by Lobree et al [17]. Fe(Cl)-H-ZSM5-SM27-sub(1)
was prepared by sublimation of Fe(Cl)3 into calcined SM27
AP and the spectrum resembles the spectrum of WIE based
iron ZSM5 indicating a relative high amount of ionic iron.
The Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-SM27 WIE (80 C/6 h) catalyst
reveals a sharp peak at ca. 400 C and a broad peak between
500 and 750 C. This is in accordance with the TPR spec-
tra published by Chen and Sachtler [11]. Exchanged Fe on
ZSM5 has a sharp peak with H2/Fe = 0.5 at 400430 C
[11,25].
3.2. Activity of iron-zeolite catalyst prepared by different
methods
Iron-zeolite catalysts have been prepared with the methods
described above. In Fig. 2 the N2O conversion of (some of)
the resulting catalysts are plotted against the temperature.
The activity of the catalysts prepared by wet ion-exchange
is relatively high. Fe-ZSM5 WIE based on iron sulphate and
Fe-ZSM5 WIE based on Mohrs salt are both equally active.
The Fe-ZSM5 WIE based on Mohrs salt here is slightly
different to the one previously described in van den Brink
et al. [3,8],: the preparation procedure has been changed to
favour the activity. This will be explained in more detail
elsewhere in the text. The ex-framework method yields a

less active Fe-ZSM5 catalyst, which can partly be explained
by the low iron content (0.7 wt.%) of the catalyst.
The ETH CVD [18] catalyst has a high iron-loading
(3.6 wt.%, Fe/Al ratio = 1) while the ECN CVD catalyst has
a much lower iron-loading (2.6 wt.%, Fe/Al ratio = 0.38).
Surprisingly, the catalyst with the low iron-loading is more
active. A third CVD based catalysts was prepared in Eind-
hoven [19], having 3.6 wt.%, Fe/Al ratio = 1 and Si/Al 20
(i.e. very similar to the ETH catalyst) and it had comparable
activity to ECNs CVD catalyst. The steamed analogue of
the CVD catalysts from Eindhoven was also tested: in line
with the reports in literature [19,20], steaming increases the
activity.
Fe(Cl)-Na-ZSM5-SN27-sub(2) (not shown), in which all
iron was in the form of iron oxide, did not have any activity
in the direct decomposition of N2O.
3.3. Iron-zeolite catalysts prepared by wet ion-exchange
method
In order to explore the full potential of the WIE prepa-
ration method in conversion of N2O, several parame-
ters of the preparation of ZSM5 AP based catalysts as
well as post-modification treatments were explored. The
iron-to-zeolite ratio in the suspension is kept constant unless
stated differently.
3.3.1. Time of ion-exchange
The time of the exchange was adjusted to 6 and 24 h
for iron ZSM5 prepared using Mohrs salt. The colour of
the material changes from yellow to orange with increasing
time of exchange. The orange colour indicates the presence
of iron oxide. While the samples were similarly active in
N2O decomposition reaction, the 6 h exchanged sample was
more active in the SCR of N2O with propane (Table 5).
Fig. 5A and B show the SEM pictures of respectively
H-ZSM5 and Fe-ZSM5 prepared with Mohrs salt for 24 h
exchange. Small Fe2O3 crystallites are present outside the
zeolite micropores and in-between zeolite particles. The
majority of these Fe2O3 crystallites were absent after the
washing with HCl (see Fig. 5D). The catalyst from which
the Fe2O3 was removed with HCl showed higher activity
in the propane-assisted SCR of N2O (see Table 5).
3.3.2. Aerobic versus anaerobic ion-exchange
Fe2+ is easily oxidised in aqueous media giving rise to
the formation of iron hydroxide species [27]. These species
are believed to be intermediate to the formation of hematite.
Our sample was prepared in nitrogen atmosphere using a
similar set-up Feng and Hall explained in their papers. The
obtained sample has yellow colour and the TPR spectrum
shows a lower contribution of the high temperature band, i.e.
500700 C. This method prevented the formation of iron
oxide adequately but anaerobic condition does not alter the
number of iron entities active in N2O decomposition.
3.3.3. Conventional ion-exchange versus reversed
ion-exchange
Conventional wet ion-exchange is considered here as
stirring a suspension of the zeolite in a solution containing
the metal in an amount that ideally would give the desired
amount of incorporated metal. Competitive ion-exchange is
known to improve dispersion at high metal loading [28].
The principle of this method is based on the equilibrium
chemistry of the exchange reaction: by keeping the reaction
to the left, i.e. toward the metal salt in solution, the driving
force of micropore diffusion will be retained. Usually iron
ions will be quantitatively and strongly fixed on the first
sites encountered, i.e. the periphery of the grain. The con-
centration of the solution will thus decrease rapidly. As a
consequence, limited or heterogeneous distribution of metal
deposit will occur. Addition of an appropriate ammonium
salt in excess to the exchange solution will keep the amount
of iron in solution high. However, competitive ion-exchange
with, e.g. NH4NO3, will also affect the pH of the suspen-
sion. In order to avoid changing more parameters at the
same time, the self-named Reverse ion-exchange method
is tried with basically the same principle in mind: now
the suspension of the zeolite in water is added drop-wise
to a solution containing the metal-salt. As a consequence,

the majority of the zeolite-water suspension faces a very
high salt to zeolite ratio. The TPR of the thus created
Fe(SO4)-ZSM5-WIE (80 C/2 h)-REV shows indeed much
less high temperature contribution (i.e. lower Fe2O3 con-
tent) as compared to FeSO4-WIE-ZSM5. However, also
the total amount of iron is slightly lower (2.2 wt.% versus
1.8 wt.%). This means that the method only prevents the
formation of Fe2O3.
3.3.4. Influence of iron precursor salt/pH of the
ion-exchange
WIE was carried out with ZSM5 SM27 AP together with
Mohrs salt, iron sulphate and iron nitrate. Catalysts prepared
with Mohrs salt and iron sulphate give the same activity.
Catalysts prepared by iron nitrate, however, are much less
active. Strikingly, the amount of iron that is co-ordinated to
exchange sites (as estimated by ICP and TPR analysis) is
quite similar. The pH during exchange of ZSM5 SM27 with
the sulphate salts and iron nitrate is different (as is the pH
of the salts in water). The pH values are listed in Table 4.
The pH of the exchange solution was allowed to change
during the exchange. Adjusting the pH to pH 7 [11] during
exchange resulted in high amounts of iron oxide and was
therefore abandoned. The pH of NH4-BEA in suspension
with iron nitrate and iron sulphate was similar and the N2O
decomposition activity of the corresponding Fe-BEAs too.
3.3.5. Washing and filtration/reproducibility
Recently the washing procedure applied prior to calcina-
tion has gained attention (Marturano et al. [18,29]). Two dif-
ferent ways to filtrate and wash the cake were compared. The
Fig. 3. Evaluation of washing procedure on Mohrs salt prepared Iron-ZSM5 in N2O decomposition reaction (30,000 h1).
catalyst described in van den Brink et al. [3,8] was prepared
by filtration of the exchange suspension and suspending the
filter cake 1 l demiwater, stirred for 30 min and subsequently
filtrated once again. A more recently applied method of
filtration and washing is, after the filtration of the parent
solution, based on keeping the cake under vacuum while
pouring 2 times 500 ml of demiwater on 10 g of cake. The
first method was applied to test the possibility of leaching
potential iron oxide presursors out of the catalysts. The latter
method is believed to ensure the quick removal of the coun-
terions of the iron precursors used in the exchange reaction.
Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the two washing procedures
for Mohrs salt and FeSO4 based ZSM5 SM27. The recently
applied vacuum filtration appears to give superior catalysts
in line with observations of Marturano et al. Exactly the
same was observed with FeSO4 based ZSM5 SM27. The
samples denoted in batches 13 are shown here in order to
show that ion-exchange gives iron-zeolite that is perfectly
reproducible. The difference in the washing procedure is
also clearly reflected in the H2-TPR spectra (Fig. 4). Clearly,
the low temperature shoulder at 350 C is much more pro-
nounced after vacuum washing. We speculate that the low
temperature shoulder may reflect the reduction of isolated
iron III cationic sites to divalent state.
3.4. Post-modification
3.4.1. Procedure of activation: temperature of calcination,
steaming and nitrogen activation
CVD based catalysts obtained from Eindhoven benefit-
ted from high temperature calcination and steaming pre-
treatment (Fig. 2, Ref. [19,20]). Table 6 compares several
temperatures of activation in air with or without steam and
activation in nitrogen for Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-SM27-
WIE (80 C/6 h) AP catalyst. Compared to the air calcina-
tion at 550 C, subtle steaming (10% water) gave a small
activity gain. Activation in nitrogen gave a slightly larger
gain in activity. Lowering the temperature of activation to
400 C as well as severe steaming for several hours gave
rise to decreased activity.

next to it.
3.5. Presence of protons/stability of ZSM5 based iron
catalyst
The presence of protons is believed to affect the
hydro-thermal stability of the zeolites and, as over-exchange
with wet ion-exchange was not achieved, this may have
consequences accordingly. The ZSM5 SM27 catalyst pre-
pared with Mohrs salt was studied for prolonged times on
stream at severe reaction conditions, i.e. up to 5% H2O and
450 C. Fig. 6 shows time on stream trends as a function
of time. Water inhibits the N2O decomposition reaction.
Therefore, the GHSV was varied to start at a similar ini-
tial activity level. It follows that the catalyst deactivates.
While this deactivation is hardly noticeable without water
in the feed, rapid decline was observed with 5% water
in the feed. Fig. 7 shows the infrared DRIFT spectra of
Fe-ZSM5 spent in the reaction with 0, 0.5 and 5% water.
Two regions of particular interest are encircled in the graph.
The first one shows bands assigned to bridging OH at ca.
3600 cm1. This band represents the exchange position of
the zeolite. Compared to the H-ZSM5, prior to exchange
with iron (not shown), this band decreases in intensity
due to exchange of H+ for Fe2+/Fe(OH)+ and at about
3740 cm1 silanol bands could be observed. Specific bands
around 3640 and 3680 cm1 assigned to the formation of
octahedral aluminium (hydroxy) species were also present
(36403680 cm1 may have contribution of OH groups
bound to iron cations too). The presence of these bands in-
dicates that aluminum from the lattice has migrated toward
exchange positions [35]. The sample used in the reaction
with 0.5% water shows some additional loss of bridging
OH intensity and increased intensity of the bands at 3640
and 3680 cm1. The sample exposed to 5% water shows
decreased intensities between 3600 and 3700 cm1 indicat-
ing the partial collapse of the zeolite structure. The high
frequency region provides information on the fate of the
iron cation during exposure to wet conditions. The figure
shows the lattice vibrations of the zeolite (framework TO
bonds) between 1100 and 1000 cm1 and additional bands
between 980 and 900 cm1. The latter peaks stems from
the shift of the unperturbed antisymmetric vibrations of the
framework TO bonds between 10001100 cm1 due to
perturbation by cations [30]. This peak is characteristic for
the cation co-ordination at the exchange (proton) site of the
zeolite. According to Wichterlov and co-workers [31,37]
and references therein different types of exchange sites ex-
ist in zeolites, so-called ,  and  sites, all of which have
a different accessibility and activity. The DRIFT spectra do
not allow detailed analysis of the various sites. However, on
comparing the spectra it seems that the intensity between
980 and 900 cm1 in the case of 5% water is shifted to lower
wavenumber. This may indicate a change in the direct en-
vironment of the iron. In combination with the crystallinity
loss expected from the less intense hydroxy bands between
3700 and 3600 cm1 it implicates a change of structure that
affected the docking of iron in the zeolite pores.
3.6. Influence of zeolite topology
The zeolite topology is known to have a profound im-
pact on the stabilisation of cations in the micropore system
[32]. Consequently, both activity and (hydro-thermal) sta-
bility may be affected as well, as pointed out by Mauvezin
et al. [34].
Iron-BEA and iron-mordenite zeolite (three different
Si/Al ratios) were prepared with wet ion-exchange of
FeSO4·7H2O. Activity plots are compiled in Fig. 8. It fol-
lows that ZSM5 SM27 based iron catalysts is most active.
MOR appears somewhat less active than BEA. MOR was
also prepared by Reversed ion-exchange method and, like
the results with ZSM5 SM27, it avoided the formation of
hematite adequately but resulted in a similar activity (not
shown). Strikingly, opposed to Fe-ZSM5, the Fe-MOR and
Fe-BEA (Fig. 9) catalysts proved very durable catalysts
even with 10% water in the feed.
4. Discussion
4.1. Evaluation of different methods to prepare iron-ZSM5
Iron-zeolites are very interesting as catalysts for, among
others, direct decomposition of N2O and SCR of N2O. The

223
exact nature of the active iron sites is subject to many studies
[1719,23,33].
The application of iron-zeolite in practical conditions re-
quires high activity for the conversion of N2O in the pres-
ence of other components usually present in the off-gas.
The presence of water in the off-gases may challenge the
well-known limited hydro-thermal stability of zeolites: the
presence of protons left after introduction of iron may cause
steam-dealumination, eventually resulting in structural col-
lapse, agglomeration of iron and deactivation. Therefore, the
method of preparation of iron-zeolite should be considered
with care.
Generally, upon preparing iron ZSM5 catalysts the incen-
tive is to prepare so-called over-exchanged, Fe/Al ratio = 1,
Fe-ZSM5 catalyst. Independent research groups [4,18,19]
reported the preparation of over-exchanged Fe-ZSM5 by
sublimation method. Ion-exchange in the solid state was
reported by Kgel et al. [13] that despite the lack of
over-exchange, it appeared to give active catalysts. In addi-
tion, Delft reported on an alternative superior preparation
method based on post-modified isomorphously substituted
iron-zeolite [23].
Some of these samples previously described in litera-
ture have now been tested for the first time under condi-
tions representative of the nitric acid off-gases. From these
tests, it follows that the superiority of the sublimation and

ion-exchange bear the highest activity (Fig. 2). Based on the
studies by Feng and Hall of iron-ZSM5 prepared with wet
ion-exchange, the reproducibility of wet ion-exchange has
been questioned by many researchers. However, the results
depicted in Fig. 3 show 3 different batches of iron-ZSM5
prepared with Mohrs salt. These Fe(Mohrs)-ZSM5 cata-
lysts have been reproduced numerous times at ECN.
Strikingly, as the WIE based ZSM5 catalyst have low iron
loading the importance of over-exchange for activity is not
yet clear. Chen and Sachtler [4] point out that the preference
of high iron loading in Fe-zeolite is based on DeNOx cata-
lysts for whom the presence of oxy-, hydroxy- and oxygen
bridged ions are crucial, and their relative concentration is
known to increase with metal loading. However, no direct
link between Fe/Al > 0.5 and N2O decomposition activity
was given by them and, to our best knowledge, not by others.
Apparently, over-exchange is not a factor that controls
the activity in N2O decomposition under realistic condi-
tions. An explanation might be that the iron species exclu-
sively formed at over-exchange conditions may work well
for DeNOx but are simply not the most active ones for N2O
decomposition. An alternative explanation is the restricted
accessibility of the active iron sites in the micropores after
CVD. The over-exchanged CVD catalyst from Eindhoven

was characterised by less micropore volume after CVD com-
pared to the parent ZSM5 sample [19]. After steaming at
high temperature, increase of the micropore volume was
observed accompanied by increased activity [19,20]. Some
iron species may have blocked the micropores and access to
active sites. Also, mesopores can be formed during steam-
ing and improve accessibility [36]. One may speculate that
the low micropore volume of the ETH sample as compared
to the Eindhoven sample (see Table 2) causes the activity
differences of two otherwise largely identical samples. Nev-
ertheless, the authors in [19,20] favour another explanation
on the influence of steaming of the CVD based sample: the
ruling activation step in this Fe-ZSM5 sample is the reaction
of FeO with protons to form FeO+.
With respect to ease of catalyst manufacture and ac-
tivity of iron-zeolites the WIE based methods seem
favourite. However, the presence of protons in WIE based
catalysts may ease steam-dealumination and affect sta-
bility. In this respect, ex-framework [Fe,Al]-ZSM5 was
tested for 500 h in the presence of water at 500 C and
proved durable [39]. The optimisation of wet ion-exchange
based zeolite catalysts for application in practical con-
ditions is discussed in the light of several parameters of
preparation considering both activity and (hydro-thermal)
stability.

4.2. Parameters that control activity and stability of wet
ion-exchange based iron-zeolite catalysts
Active iron-zeolite catalysts for the direct decompo-
sition of N2O in true off-gases can be prepared using
wet ion-exchange. The same holds true for SCR of N2O
with hydrocarbons as we previously reported [3,8]. How-
ever, the specific conditions of wet ion-exchange as well
as the after-treatment conditions should be chosen with
care. From our results we infer that wet ion-exchange
with ZSM5 is preferably carried out with FeSO4·7H2O
and (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2 instead of Fe(NO3)·9H2O. In the
latter case iron has a formal oxidation state of 3+ while
this is 2+ in the former cases. Delgass [27] reported that
Fe2+ is easily oxidised in aqueous media, so also with
FeSO4 and in Mohrs salt the Fe3+ ions will be present.
Fe3+ ion may be hydrated to form a rather strong acid.
The dissolution of a Fe3+ salt in water will lower the
pH of the solution due to the hydrolysis of the complex
ion:
Fe3+ + 6 H2O
[Fe(H2O)6]3+ [Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+ + H+
(1)
[Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+ [Fe(OH)2(H2O)4]+ + H+

225
and dissociation of the remaining co-ordinated water
molecules form hydrolysed species and protons
[Fe(OH)2(H2O)4]+ Fe(OH)+ + H+ + 4 H2O
The pKa of reaction 1 is 2.2 the pKa of reaction 2 is 3.3
[40]. This suggests that the pH of the solution will determine
whether ion-exchange is done with a 3+, 2+ or 1+ ion. Re-
garding pH, both the FeSO4·7H2O and (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2
in suspension with SM27 give rise to 3.3 while with FeNO3,
pH ends at 1.8. In fact the low pH established with iron

nitrate gives rise to a very limited change for iron of ionic
nature. The majority of the iron will remain in solution or
is disposed at the external surface and transformed into iron
oxide after calcination. Indeed, SEM analysis reveals that
the outsides of the zeolite particles are completely covered
by Fe2O3 (Fig. 5C). The rather straightforward theory set
out above can explain the observations. It does also explain
an observation that the choice of the iron salt is much less
crucial on BEA zeolite (41). The pH of iron nitrate sus-
pended with CP814e gives rise to a pH of 4.13.9 and the
226

thus-formed iron-BEA catalysts was found similarly active
as compared to iron-BEA prepared with FeSO4 (pH 4 with
CP814e BEA). On the other hand, as we never succeed to
produce over-exchanged iron-ZSM5 by controlling pH, the
kinetics of ion-exchange are believed important too.
The N2O decomposition activity over iron oxide is close to
zero, however, the presence of iron oxide in quantities up to
as much as 1 wt.% does not affect the decomposition activity
of exchanged iron negatively. On the other hand, one would
expect the presence of hematite to constrain access to micro-
pores that may effect reaction of N2O with (larger) hydrocar-
bons, i.e. selective catalytic reduction. When hydrocarbon is
present in the off-gases, the SCR of N2O is attractive to boost
the conversion of N2O at low temperature and prevent hy-
drocarbon slip. To show the effect of increased crowding at
the poremouth in the presence of iron oxide under SCR con-
ditions, the performance of the Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-AP
sample is shown for both N2O decomposition reaction and
SCR of N2O with propane. While 80% N2O conversion by
decomposition occurs at the same temperature irrespective
to the presence of hematite, SCR of N2O benefits from the
absence of hematite (see Table 5). For SCR purposes, the
formation of hematite can be avoided by controlling pH, the
reversed wet ion-exchange method or under anaerobic con-
ditions.
The washing method was found to affect the activity sig-
nificantly. Marturano [18,29] previously reported this. De-
pending on whether the sample was suspended or washed
under vacuum the TPR spectra of iron-ZSM5-SM27 is re-
markably different (Fig. 4). Leaching of iron out of the sam-
ple was not observed. The H2/Fe ratios are the same, i.e., the
presence of iron oxide in relation to the washing procedure
is not obvious. The washing procedure may have affected
the distribution of iron over the different exchange sites (,
 and  sites, [37]). These sites have a different reducibil-
ity and activity. In the case of ZSM5 the low temperature
shoulder in the TPR spectrum may represent the reduction
of Fe3+ (Fe3+(OH)2)+ to Fe2+ at  sites as pointed out
by Lobree et al.[17].
WIE based ZSM5 catalysts have somewhat higher activity
after treatment in nitrogen as compared to air. Visual inspec-
tion of yellow coloured nitrogen pre-treated sample and dark
yellow/orange air treated sample leads to the conclusion that
air gives rise to the presence of Fe2O3. The lower intensity
of the high temperature band in the TPR spectrum upon ac-
tivation in nitrogen supports this hypothesis. Note that Mar-
turano [18] and Lobree et al. [17] reported that if the thermal
treatment was carried out in helium, partial auto reduction
of the iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+ takes place together with the
formation of larger Fe3O4 clusters. CVD based iron-zeolite
and WIE based iron-zeolite react differently to the parame-
ters of preparation and post-modification methods.
Over-exchange ensures that the majority of the neg-
ative charge in the zeolite is counterbalanced by iron
cations. This limits the number of protons that may affect
the hydro-thermal stability of zeolites negatively [38]. As

shown in the Figs. 6 and 7, the WIE based iron-ZSM5 cat-
alyst studied in detail with respect to long term stability did
not prove very stable in the presence of high concentration
water at 450 C. This catalyst with Fe/Al= 0.2 has a large
number of protons. If one compares Fig. 6 with Table 6
it is apparent that conditions for steam-activation and
steam-deactivation are very close to each other. Compared
to the air calcination at 550 C, steaming gives a small ac-
tivity gain. Lowering the temperature of activation to 400 C
as well as severe steaming for several hours gives rise to de-
creased activity. Apparently the presence of a small amount
of defect sites in the zeolite already present after calcina-
tion at 550 C and modest steaming is beneficial. Prolonged
exposure to wet conditions results in deactivation. Fortu-
nately, wet ion-exchange with iron on BEA and MOR give
catalysts that, while not yet as active as ZSM5 SM27 AP
(Fig. 8), are durable in the presence of high amounts of
water in the feed composition as shown for BEA in Fig. 9.
BEA and MOR catalysts were tested for a period of over
100 h at 450 C in the presence of up to 10% water without
apparent loss in activity. Recently, we observed that zeolite
FER supported iron catalysts combines high activity and
high stability in the decomposition of N2O [41]. Obviously,
the zeolites topology is a key factor for both the activity
and stability under realistic practical conditions.

5. Conclusions
Zeolite supported iron catalysts were prepared by different
methods and their catalytic performance was studied in N2O
decomposition reaction under realistic tail gases of the nitric
acid industry. The evaluation is part of a larger effort to se-
lect the preparation method with potential for commerciali-
sation.
With respect to the catalytic activity and ease of cata-
lyst manufacture, the wet ion-exchange based preparation
method to prepare iron-zeolite is slightly favoured over
alternative methods. Activity of WIE based Fe-zeolite cata-
lysts combine high N2O decomposition (and SCR) activity
with good (hydro-thermal) stability. The pH of the sus-
pension of the iron salt and the zeolite during WIE is a
key factor in achieving catalysts with high activity in N2O
decomposition. The topology of the zeolite is also a key
factor for activity as well as stability under realistic practi-
cal conditions. The (hydro-thermal) stability of WIE based
Fe-BEA and FE-MOR is better than Fe-ZSM5. However,
over-exchange (Fe/Al ratio = 1), which can be achieved
with the CVD method, but which is also a goal in studies on
WIE preparation, is not a key factor in gaining high activity.
Wet ion-exchange yields a catalyst with less than 50% of
the exchange sites occupied by Fe. The presence of some
additional iron oxide does not affect the N2O decomposition
activity.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
