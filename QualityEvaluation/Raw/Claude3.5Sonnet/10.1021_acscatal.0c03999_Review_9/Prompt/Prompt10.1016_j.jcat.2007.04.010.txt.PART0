Abstract
The N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over iron-containing MFI zeolites was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, complemented by analyses in a tapered element oscillating microbalance coupled with gas chromatography
and characterization by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption. Samples with different iron speciation and acidic
properties, induced by the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and Fe
GeSi) were analyzed. Real-time monitoring of the reaction under operando conditions allowed us to gain insight into the mechanism and kinetics
of deactivation and coke formation, as well as zeolite regeneration in air. Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species. The mechanism of coke formation and the nature of the deposits were similar
over the samples, independent of the catalytic performance and deactivation pattern. Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related
bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact. The initial propylene yield over
the fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites was the same, but the latter sample exhibited faster deactivation. This is attributed to a change of iron
constitution in the first reactionregeneration cycle. The alteration of the local environment of the iron species was indirectly concluded from the
appearance of a band associated with Lewis centers in the infrared spectra of the regenerated zeolite. In support of this, TEM studies demonstrated
an extensive degree of iron clustering as FeOx nanoparticles in the regenerated catalyst compared with the fresh and coked catalysts.

1. Introduction
Iron-containing pentasyl-type zeolites exhibit unique cat-
alytic properties in N2O-mediated oxidation. The extensive
number of studies in this topic was triggered by the accomplish-
ments in the direct hydroxylation of paraffins to alcohols and of
aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols [1,2]. More recently, several
groups applied these materials in the functionalization of light
alkanes for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respec-
tive olefinic feedstocks. Particular emphasis has been put on the
N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)
to propylene [36]. Efficient on-purpose propylene technolo-

gies are being required in view of the widening gap between
conventional propylene supply and demand [7].
The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has
been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor
and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating re-
active atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate
propane [4]. The most promising zeolitic system reported so far
is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields
up to 25% [4,8]. These results are comparable with the high-
est values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2 as
the oxidant [9]. A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP
with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid de-
crease of the propylene yield [4]. The tapered element oscil-
lating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chro-
matography (GC) analysis has proved to be a suitable tool for
correlating deactivation and mass changes due to coking in the

C3H8 + N2O reaction [10,11]. This information was the basis
for the engineering of a cyclic process for continuous propylene
production with alternation of reaction, purging, and regenera-
tion steps using a battery of parallel fixed-bed reactors [12,13].
The level of detail and accuracy for in situ investigation of
coke formation as obtained by TEOM cannot be accomplished
using typical approaches to study deactivation, in which coke
is characterized after exposing the catalyst to reaction condi-
tions and taking samples at defined times for ex situ analyses
[1416]. However, TEOM does not provide information on
the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level, be-
cause the nature of coke as well as its interaction with chemical
groups in the zeolite cannot be probed. To gain a better under-
standing of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the
C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air,
complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions
are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing
coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion
[1720], by monitoring in real time the formation of carbona-
ceous deposits and eventual changes in vibrations associated
with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous ma-
terial.
Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true
process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of
the ODHP reaction. To the best of our knowledge, in situ in-
vestigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O
over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. More-
over, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts (i.e., to what
extent the catalytic performance is recovered on successive re-
action and regeneration cycles) has not yet been addressed in
detail. Infrared spectroscopy has been applied to quantitatively
characterize the nature and density of Brnsted and Lewis acid
centers in the fresh zeolite catalysts by adsorption of probe
molecules such as pyridine and d3-acetonitrile over the fresh
samples [11,16,21,22]. Based on these infrared characteriza-
tions and activity measurements in benzene hydroxylation with
N2O, it was concluded that there is no correlation between the
acidity and the rate of phenol formation, although the former
accelerates the catalyst deactivation by coking.
In the present work, we performed an operando DRIFTS
study to gain insight into the kinetics of coke formation and
the deactivation mechanism of iron-containing MFI zeolites in
the N2O-mediated ODHP, and their subsequent regeneration in
air. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC exper-
iments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of
catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated
and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characteri-
zation of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray
diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and nitrogen adsorption.

ration methods and characterization of the iron speciation and
acidity of the samples has been given elsewhere [11,23,24].
Briefly, steam-activated iron zeolites were prepared by hy-
drothermal synthesis of MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and Fe
GeSi frameworks, followed by calcination at 823 K for
10 h. The nominal molar ratios in the synthesis gels were
TPAOH/Si = 0.1, NaOH/Si = 0.2, H2O/Si = 45, Si/Ga = 35,
Si/Ge = 250, and Si/Fe = 150. The calcined zeolites were ac-
tivated in steam (300 mbar H2O in 30 cm3 STP N2 min1)
at 873 K for 5 h; these catalysts are denoted hereinafter as
FeGa-st and FeGe-st. The FeAl-lie sample was prepared
by liquid-ion exchange of commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (P&Q,
CBV 8020, nominal Si/Al ratio = 37.5) at room temperature
with a diluted aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. The ion-
exchanged zeolite was washed with deionized water, dried, and
calcined in static air at 823 K for 5 h.
2.2. TEOMGC
Reaction and coke deactivation studies were carried out
in a Rupprecht and Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass ana-
lyzer coupled to a gas chromatograph. The experimental pro-
cedure and data processing have been described in detail else-
where [10,11]. Briefly, the TEOM microreactor (4 mm i.d.) was
loaded with 30 mg of catalyst particles (sieve fraction 125
250 m), followed by pretreatment in He at 723 K for 2 h. The
ODHP was carried out in a feed mixture of 50 mbar C3H8 and
50 mbar N2O in He at ambient pressure and a weight-hourly
space velocity (WHSV) of 400,000 ml h1 g1
cat. The coke con-
tent was determined from the total mass uptake measured by the
TEOM, and the product gases were analyzed online by a gas
micro-chromatograph (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a
thermal conductivity detector, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve
5A columns.
2.3. Infrared spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was carried out
in a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a
Spectratech collector II diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) accessory
equipped with a high-temperature chamber, ZnSe windows, and
a MCT detector. The latter was cooled with liquid nitrogen
for at least 1 h before the experiments. The equipment was
purged with Ar before and during the experiment to prevent
traces of humidity in the path of the beam in the spectrom-
eter. The sample cell was filled with ca. 40 mg of powdered
catalyst and carefully leveled off with spatula to reduce reflec-
tions off the sample surface and to ensure reproducible results.
Before the experiments, the sample was pretreated in helium

125
(100 cm3 STP min1) at the reaction temperature for 20 min,
using a ramp rate of 5 K min1. Then the spectrum of the
fresh zeolite was obtained using KBr (Aldrich, IR spectroscopy
grade) in He at the same temperature as the background. Sub-
sequently, He was replaced by the reaction mixture, and spectra
were automatically recorded every 20 s for 120 min. The re-
action of propane and nitrous oxide was carried out at 723 K
in a mixture of 50 mbar C3H8 and 50 mbar N2O in He at am-
bient pressure, using a total gas flow of 100 cm3 STP min1.
Gases were introduced in the cell by means of flow meters, and
the outlet flow was recorded continuously during the experi-
ment by a DryCal DC-lite gas-flow calibrator from Biosint. The
intensity of the bands related to coke, Brnsted acid centers,
and silanol groups in the zeolite during ODHP was monitored
at the position of maximum absorbance in each background-
corrected spectrum. After the reaction period, the C3H8 + N2O
mixture was switched to He (100 cm3 STP min1) for 15 min
to flush the cell and to remove weakly adsorbed species on the
zeolite surface. Then He was replaced by air, and the regener-
ation of the catalyst was carried out at 723 K for 90 min. In
the reaction and regeneration experiments, the spectra of the
reaction mixture and air in KBr, respectively, were taken as ref-
erences. Spectra were systematically recorded in the range of
6504000 cm1 by the co-addition of 32 scans and with a nom-
inal resolution of 4 cm1. A fresh sample was normally used in
each run. In addition, several reactionregeneration cycles were
conducted over the same sample.
2.4. Characterization
The fresh, coked, and regenerated zeolites were character-
ized by XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption. Powder XRD pat-
terns were measured in a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with
Bragg-Brentano geometry and Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (λ =
0.1541 nm). Data were collected in the 2θ range of 570us-
ing an angular step of 0.05and a counting time of 8 s per step.
TEM was done using a JEOL JEM-1011 microscope operated
at 100 kV and equipped with a SIS Megaview III CCD cam-
era. A few droplets of the sample suspended in ethanol were
placed on a carbon-coated copper grid, followed by evapora-
tion at ambient conditions. N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms
at 77 K were measured in a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-MP an-
alyzer. Before the measurements, the samples were evacuated
at 373 K for 12 h. The BET method [25] was applied to cal-
culate the total surface area, which was used for comparative
purposes. The t-plot method [26] was used to discriminate be-
tween microporosity and mesoporosity.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fresh zeolites
The infrared spectra of the iron-containing zeolites in the
CH and OH stretching regions are shown in Fig. 1. The spec-
tra in the framework region (16001990 cm1) closely repro-
duce results in the literature [27] and are not displayed for

the sake of conciseness. No bands associated with the tem-
plate or any sort of organic-related contamination appeared in
the region of 28003000 cm1. The infrared band at around
3730 cm1 present in the three samples is typically assigned to
terminal silanol groups (SiOH) on the external surface of the
zeolite crystal [28]. This absorption also has been attributed to
nonacidic silanol groups located in the zeolite pores [29]. The
band at 3600 cm1 observed in FeAl-lie and FeGa-st corre-
sponds to bridging hydroxyl groups associated with Brnsted
acidity [27,28]. This band did not appear in FeGe-st due to the
absence of framework Al or Ga.
The band at 3600 cm1 was considerably more intense in
FeAl-lie than in FeGa-st, indicating that the former sample
was more acidic despite the similar bulk Si/Al and Si/Ga ra-
tios in the samples (ca. 35, Table 1). This certainly was the
case, because FeGa-st was activated in steam at high tempera-
ture, inducing the hydrolysis of a fraction of SiOH-Ga groups
and resulting in extra-framework gallium species [23]. How-
ever, this did not lead to an easily distinguishable absorption at
36503700 cm1 in the spectrum of the sample, often related
to extra-framework trivalent cations such as Al3+ with Lewis
acid character [30]. The presence of significant amounts of
extra-framework aluminum in FeAl-lie also can be excluded
attending to the absence of this band.
The Ge-containing zeolite showed weak bands at 3680 and
3620 cm1 and a broad absorption at 3520 cm1. The band
at 3680 cm1 is related to the contribution of terminal GeOH
groups [31,32], which are reported to have an intermediate acid-
ity between bridged hydroxyls and silanol groups. The band
at around 3620 cm1 can be assigned to bridging Si(OH)Fe
groups [33], which result from the incomplete dislodgement
of lattice iron on steaming. It has been demonstrated that the
absence of Al and Ga in iron-substituted MFI frameworks in-
duces a less pronounced degree of Fe extraction on steam treat-
ment at a certain condition of temperature and steam partial
pressure [23,24,34]. The broad band at 3520 cm1 is typically
assigned to hydrogen-bonded silanols resulting from structural
defects due to incomplete condensation or removal of lattice
atoms [28]. Recent work by van der Water et al. [31] reported
that germanium incorporation in the MFI framework caused

an increased number of local distortions and defects, originat-
ing a greater variety of OH groups. Accordingly, we tentatively
assigned this feature to dislocations in the MFI framework con-
nected with germanium substitution. It should be stressed that
this feature is not exclusive to Ge-containing zeolites; in fact,
the FeAl-lie sample exhibited a shoulder at around 3520 cm1
(Fig. 1), indicating defects in this zeolite framework.
3.2. ODHP performance
The catalysts considered in this study exhibited distinct
ODHP performance. The propylene yield and coke content de-
termined by the TEOM technique coupled to GC analysis is
shown in Fig. 2. At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after
2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over
FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%). As reported elsewhere
[8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over
FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The
C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to
50%. The general correlation between the decreased Y(C3H6)
and the increased amount of coke made it possible to con-
clude that propylene is the main precursor of coke [10]. The
propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-
st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16
to 2% during the first 40 min on stream). In contrast, FeGa-
st displayed remarkable performance, and the propylene yield
was stable for a relatively long period on stream even if large
amounts of coke were formed on the sample [Y(C3H6) = 22%
and Ccoke = 13 wt% after 80 min]. Apparently, the active iron
species in this particular catalyst were not affected (blocked or
poisoned) by the carbonaceous deposits. After the 80-min pe-
riod, the propylene yield decayed progressively, and the rate
of coke formation was reduced. Based on TEOM results, the
profile of coke buildup over FeAl-lie was steeper than over
FeGa-st, which can be related to the higher density of Brn-
sted acid centers in the former sample. Previous studies by some
of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance
of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi
frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP
and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke de-
position [11]. The reduced Brnsted acidity in these samples
due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ (M3+ = Fe, Ga, Al)
groups on high-temperature steam treatment and the presence
of (limited) mesoporosity also have been identified as possible
reasons for the decreased deactivation.
3.3. Infrared studies during ODHP
Infrared experiments were conducted at 723 K, which can
be considered the optimal temperature for the N2O-mediated
propane oxidative dehydrogenation over iron-containing zeo-
lites [11,13]. The evolution of the catalysts in the CH and OH
stretching regions during ODHP is shown in Fig. 3. In the ex-
periments, spectra were continuously acquired every 20 s for
120 min, but for clarity, only those at times when represen-
tative changes occur are depicted here. Coke-related bands in
the region of 28003100 cm1 progressively develop during
the first 20 min of reaction, with incremental changes there-
after. Coke formation is connected to the presence of strong
acidic protons in the zeolite surface, as well as to the pres-
ence of trivalent cations (Fe3+, Ga3+, Al3+) as electron ac-
ceptor sites [5]. Simultaneous with coke formation, a gradual
decrease of the bands at 3600 and 3730 cm1 occurred due to
coke deposition on Brnsted acidic centers and terminal silanol
groups. It is well known that Brnsted acid sites catalyze the
formation of carbenium ions [35,36], where double bonds can
oligomerize, initiating the coking process. As shown in Fig. 3,
the broad absorption centered at 3520 cm1 in FeGe-st, as-
signed to hydrogen-bonded silanols connected with framework
dislocations, does not experience an apparent change during the
ODHP reaction. However, the weak absorption at 3620 cm1
vanishes after 10 min on stream. The latter observation further
supports its assignment to Brnsted acidity caused by incom-
plete extraction of framework iron in the sample on steaming.
Characteristic vibrations of the MFI framework did not experi-
ence significant changes during the reaction (not shown).

carbonaceous deposits in the catalysts after 120 min in contact

is intended to remove weakly adsorbed species on the samples
before infrared analysis. The position and relative intensities of

the four absorption bands are very similar, suggesting the simi-
lar nature of coke in the samples despite the markedly different
catalytic performance. The band at 3053 cm1 is attributed to
CH stretching in aromatic groups [37]. The other bands have
been assigned to aliphatic compounds; features at 2969 and
2930 cm1 are related to asymmetric CH stretching of CH3
and CH2 groups, respectively, whereas the band at 2880 cm1
is attributed to symmetric CH stretching of CH3 groups [29,37].
The evolution of the band at 2930 cm1 was taken as a mea-
sure of the coke build-up during ODHP. As shown in Fig. 5,
the intensity of this absorption increased in the first 20 min
on stream over the catalysts. After 4050 min, the intensity
did not change over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, but increased
over FeGa-st. These results are qualitatively in good agree-
ment with the TEOM profiles in Fig. 2, indicating continuous
coke build-up in the latter sample due to its superior ability to
produce propylene. Similar trends were obtained when other
coke-related bands related to aliphatic groups were considered.
This can be anticipated because the intensity ratio of the ab-
sorptions at 2880, 2930, and 2969 cm1 did not change sig-
nificantly along the reaction. Coke was deposited on Brnsted
acid centers and terminal silanols in the zeolites, leading to de-
creases in the bands associated with these groups at 3600 and
3730 cm1, respectively (Fig. 5). The intensity decrease was
most pronounced in the more acidic FeAl-lie sample, which
can be correlated with the faster deactivation of this catalyst
(Fig. 2). The relatively fast deactivation of the FeGe-st sample
may be due to the limited number of active extra-framework
iron sites and the favored coke formation connected with the
occurrence of iron in lattice positions. The coke profiles deter-
mined by TEOM and in situ DRIFTS agree reasonably well
for FeAl-lie and FeGe-st. The decrease in propylene yield
over these samples was correlated with the increased amount
of coke, indicating that deposition of carbonaceous deposits
was responsible for catalyst deactivation. In contrast, attending
merely to the coke buildup, the higher resistance of FeGa-st
toward deactivation (stable C3H6 production for 80 min) can-

not be anticipated. This reveals that the coke production was
not necessarily accompanied by decreased propylene produc-
tion. The agreement between the shapes of the coke profiles

lie and FeGe-st is not applicable to FeGa-st. For the latter
catalyst, the buildup of carbonaceous deposits determined by
DRIFTS appears to be faster than the TEOM-derived profiles.
The reason for the mismatch cannot be currently ascertained.
3.4. Coked zeolites
The color of the zeolites after reaction was black due to the
presence of coke, in contrast with the light-yellow (FeGa-st
and FeGe-st) or yellow-ocher (FeAl-lie) color of the start-
ing zeolites. TEM indicated abundant carbonaceous deposits
of amorphous nature coexisting with the zeolite crystals in the
sample after use in ODHP at 723 K for 120 min (Fig. 6). In
addition, despite its low magnification, iron oxide nanoparti-
cles could be identified in the micrograph of the fresh zeolite
(see crystal indicated by the solid arrow). These particles were
highly dispersed (size 13 nm), as we elaborate on later.
The coked samples were also characterized by N2 adsorption
to evaluate the impact of the reaction on the porous characteris-
tics of the zeolite. As shown in Fig. 7, the isotherms of the fresh
samples exhibited high nitrogen uptakes at low relative pres-
sures (p/p0 < 0.3), exhibiting the type I behavior typical of
microporous materials [38]. The samples exhibited hysteresis
at p/p0 > 0.45, which can be attributed to the presence of lim-
ited mesoporosity. The porosity parameters resulting from the
application of the BET model [25] and the t-plot method [26],
shown in Table 2, were characteristic of MFI materials. The

N2 uptake of the spent zeolites was significantly reduced due
to the presence of coke, but the shape of the isotherms did
not change (Fig. 7). The micropore and total pore volumes of
FeGa-st were decreased by 25% after ODHP. As expected,
the BET surface area experienced a decrease as well. The de-
crease in porosity was more notorious in the ion-exchanged
FeAl-lie, because approximately 65% of the micropore vol-
ume in the fresh sample was not available in the deactivated
zeolite.
Studies on benzene hydroxylation with N2O over iron-
containing zeolites have reached equivocal conclusions regard-
ing the deactivation mechanism in terms of coke deposition.
Selli et al. [16] stated that deactivation of Fe-MFI was caused by
pore blockage due to molecules trapped in their intersections,
whereas Ivanov et al. [14,15] concluded that coke poisons the
active iron sites, the concentration of which decreased linearly
with coke content. The N2 adsorption results presented here
do not allow us to exclude any of these possible mechanisms.
In fact, their relative contribution to the activity loss appears
to be related to the specific catalyst. For example, the limited
decrease in micropore volume of FeGa-st after the reaction
strongly suggests that the main deactivation mechanism is for-
mation of carbonaceous deposits obstructing the active surface,
rather than the total inaccessibility of the active sites within the
micropore network due to pore blockage. The coke content in
FeGa-st at the end of the experiment was ca. 16% (see Fig. 2).
Less coke was formed in FeAl-lie (ca. 10%), whereas the mi-
croporous properties were more severely affected. Accordingly,
pore blockage can be considered more prominent in the ion-
exchange catalyst than in the steam-activated catalyst.

Previous TEOM studies have shown that the maximum rate of
coke burn-off occurs at around 800 K, but longer regeneration
periods at 723 K are preferred to run a battery of parallel re-
actors sequentially at the same temperature during reaction and
regeneration [13]. Bands related to the carbonaceous deposits in
the CH stretching region progressively disappear due to coke
combustion, and the terminal silanol groups and Brnsted acid
centers become distinguishable. Infrared spectra suggest that
the 3730 and 3600 cm1 bands in the regenerated samples were
not totally restored, implying certain differences with respect to
the fresh counterparts. In contrast to this, the porous character-
istics of the regenerated and fresh zeolites practically matched
(as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8 for FeGa-st).
A strong indication supporting the change of the catalyst
structure in the reaction and regeneration steps stems from the
appearance of a band at 3670 cm1 in the regenerated ver-
sion of the best-performing FeGa-st catalyst, which is not
present in the fresh sample (Fig. 8). This new feature is dis-
played more clearly in Fig. 9, which shows the spectra of the
coked and regenerated FeGa-st from two successive runs with
the same specimen. The absorption at 3670 cm1 can be as-
signed to extra-framework gallium cations with Lewis acid
character [30] and indicates dislodgement of framework gal-
lium toward extra-lattice positions in the course of the reaction
regeneration cycle. This substantiates that the absorption asso-
ciated with Brnsted acidity was not fully recovered. Changes
in the local environment of gallium on reaction and/or regener-
ation can certainly affect the iron constitution. Intrapore active
iron species are stabilized in ion-exchange positions as isolated
and/or oligonuclear species, and the eventual extraction of lat-
tice Ga3+ ions connected to such sites will very likely disrupt
the structure of the iron center. The spectra of the regenerated
sample did not change on successive reaction-regenerated cy-

cles (see Fig. 9), indicating that the catalyst was stabilized after
the first run. As expected, the band at 3670 cm1 disappeared
during the second ODHP run, as the formed coke covered the

newly generated Lewis sites as well as the remaining Brn-
sted sites and silanol groups. The new feature in the infrared
spectrum of the regenerated FeGa-st catalyst prompted us to
compare the ODHP performance of the regenerated and fresh
FeGa-st zeolites and to undertake further characterization of
the samples.
3.6. Fresh versus regenerated catalysts in ODHP
In our previous study over steam-activated FeAl-MFI [13],
we found that the regenerated zeolite presented practically the
same initial and residual propylene yields as the fresh zeolite,
but that deactivation of the former sample was significantly
faster. A very similar observation was made over FeGa-st us-
ing the TEOMGC analysis (Fig. 10); the initial C3H6 yield
(ca. 22%) was similar in the fresh and regenerated zeolites,
but the latter sample suffered faster deactivation. The yield to
propylene began to decrease after 20 min on stream, in contrast
with the stable performance of the fresh zeolite during the first
80 min on stream. As a result of the higher C3H6 production, the
amount of coke formed determined by the TEOM after 120 min
was 4 times higher in the fresh zeolite than in the regenerated
zeolite. In agreement, the intensity of the coke-related bands
was also lower in the run with the regenerated sample, as shown
in Fig. 10 for the infrared absorption at 2930 cm1. However,
the ratio of intensities was much lower than the ratio of carbon
contents determined by the microbalance. The Y(C3H6) versus
time profiles in subsequent runs were practically identical to
those of the zeolite after the first regeneration, confirming that
the catalyst was stabilized after the first reactionregeneration
cycle.
Clearly, the regenerated FeGa-st catalyst did not exhibit the
same performance as the fresh zeolite. As shown in the pre-
vious section, regeneration in air largely restored the porous
properties of the zeolite. Moreover, the crystallinity of the fresh
and regenerated samples was identical, as revealed by X-ray
diffraction (Fig. 11). We propose that the distinct deactivation

behavior can be originated by a change in iron constitution dur-
ing the first reactionregeneration cycle. Supporting evidence
for this statement comes from the feature at 3670 cm1 in the
infrared spectra of the regenerated FeGa-st catalyst, which can
be indirectly associated with changes in the local environment
of the iron species. This has been supported by TEM studies

over the zeolites. As shown in Fig. 12, a marked clustering of
iron can be seen in the regenerated FeGa-st sample. The iron
oxide nanoparticles in the fresh FeGa-st sample were highly
dispersed and of uniform size. The histogram given in supple-
mentary material, determined by measuring 100150 particles
in different regions of the specimen using the software package
of the microscope, reveals that ca. 95% of the particles were
in the narrow range of 13 nm. The oxidic nanoparticles in
the regenerated specimen were significantly larger and have a
broader size distribution (37 nm, centered at 5 nm). Occasion-
ally, larger particles were also identified (up to 30 nm; see the
bottom-right micrograph in Fig. 12). The latter observation was
not made in any of the multiple spots scouted over the fresh ze-
olite. Despite the marked degree of clustering in the regenerated
sample, no reflections associated with Fe2O3 were revealed by
XRD (Fig. 11). This is likely due to the relatively low amount
of this oxidic phase (the total iron content in the sample was
0.6 wt%) and/or its amorphous nature. TEM investigations also
made it possible to conclude that the size and distribution of
FeOx entities in the coked sample resemble those in the fresh
zeolite (Fig. 12), strongly suggesting that alteration of the cata-
lyst structure leading to clustering of iron species occurs mainly
during coke burn-off.
Our results demonstrate for the first time that the regenera-
tion of iron-containing zeolites in N2O-mediated selective ox-
idations is not fully reversible. In situ infrared spectroscopy in
combination with TEOMGC and additional characterization
enabled us to monitor the processes and explain this behavior.
The absorption band at 3670 cm1 assigned to the extraction
of framework gallium entails a change in the nature of the as-
sociated extra-framework iron species, resulting in extensive
clustering as confirmed by TEM. It is widely established that
the active extra-framework iron species in selective oxidation
over Fe-zeolites are located in the micropore system and are sta-
bilized in ion-exchanged positions as isolated and oligonuclear
iron species, whereas iron oxide nanoparticles at the external
surface are inactive [2]. The fact that the initial propylene yields
over the fresh and regenerated zeolites were practically coin-
cident suggests that the most effective iron species for ODHP
retained their structure after the first reactionregeneration cy-
cle. However, alteration of the iron constitution resulted in a

catalyst with lower resistance to coke deactivation and/or a re-
duced number of active sites by clustering. Accordingly, the
regenerated zeolite was able to maintain high levels of propy-
lene production for a considerably shorter period compared
with the fresh counterpart. Appropriate strategies for catalyst
regeneration should be designed to avoid modification of the
iron speciation on coke removal leading to diminished ODHP
performance. We put forward that the conclusions derived from
this study apply to other actual or prospective applications of
N2O as selective oxidant of hydrocarbons over Fe-zeolites, be-
cause deactivation by coke and generation are common denom-
inators.
4. Conclusion
In situ infrared spectroscopy has provided valuable insights
into the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in ODHP with
N2O and their subsequent regeneration in air. DRIFTS proved
rather complementary to TEOMGC experiments, stressing the
importance of integrating in situ techniques to monitor deacti-
vation and derive a solid understanding of catalytic processes.
Coke formation, connected to the presence of strong acidic pro-
tons in the zeolite and trivalent cations (Fe3+, Ga3+, and Al3+)
as electron acceptor sites, was very fast. The nature of coke
was similar in the different samples, despite their markedly
different catalytic performance. Deactivation of Fe-zeolites in
ODHP was caused mainly by coke deposition in active extra-
framework iron species. Coke deposits can be removed by air
treatment, largely restoring the porous properties of the original
zeolite and having no effect on the crystallinity. The regenera-
tion process is not completely reversible, however; the initial
propylene yield was equal in the fresh and regenerated sam-
ples, but the latter exhibited faster deactivation. This finding can
be explained by the alteration of iron speciation in the catalyst
during the first reactionregeneration cycle. In particular, it was
proven that air treatment of the spent sample for coke burn-off
caused significant iron clustering, leading to a reduced number
of active sites and thus a less efficient catalyst for ODHP. Re-
generation strategies should be carefully designed to avoid iron
site modification.
