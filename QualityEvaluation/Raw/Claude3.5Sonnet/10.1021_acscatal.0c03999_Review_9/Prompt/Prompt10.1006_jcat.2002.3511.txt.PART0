Physicochemical characteristics of isomorphously substituted
FeZSM-5 both after preparation and after activation have been
determined by gas (Ar and N2) physisorption, 27Al and 29Si magic-
angle spinningnuclear magnetic resonance, NH3 temperature-
programmed desorption, transmission electron microscopy, H2
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), 57Fe M
ossbauer spec-
troscopy, and voltammetric response techniques. The activation
of as-synthesized FeZSM-5 comprises calcination at 823 K and a
subsequent steam treatment (300 mbar of H2O in N2) at 873 K.
Calcination leads to complete removal of the template. During this
process a significant fraction of iron is dislodged to extraframe-
work positions (ca. 50%), while Al is hardly affected. Steam treat-
ment leads to significant dealumination of the zeolite structure, the
complete extraction of isomorphously substituted iron, and the clus-
tering of extraframework iron species into highly dispersed oxide
nanoparticles of 12 nm, containing Fe and probably Al. Various
Fe species were identified in the final catalyst. A large fraction of
iron in the steamed FeZSM-5 catalyst is in the form of these iron
oxide nanoparticles. No larger particles were identified. Apart from
these nanoparticles, framework iron, extraframework isolated iron
ions, and small oligonuclear oxo-iron complexes in the zeolite chan-
nels were identified by M
ossbauer spectroscopy and voltammetry.
Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 decreases the density and strength of
acid sites and leads to mesopore formation (around 11 nm), while
the apparent crystalline structure and morphology are not altered.
In the steamed sample, at room temperature, iron is mainly present
as Fe(III), with a fraction of Fe(II) (at least 10%). H2-TPR indicates
that the fraction of Fe(II) in the material increases up to 50% by
pretreatment in He at 623 K, by autoreduction of Fe(III) species.
The fraction of Fe(III) reduced to Fe(II) depends on the duration
of this pretreatment and appears to involve different species in the
catalyst.

INTRODUCTION
Fe-based zeolites with MFI structure, including ZSM-5
and silicalite, are receiving increasing attention in the litera-
ture. Reactions catalyzed by these materials include isomer-
izationandoxidativedehydrogenationofalkanes(1,2),and
selective oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as the
oxidant (3, 4). FeMFI also plays an important role in envi-
ronmental catalysis for the reduction of NOx and N2O with
hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) or ammonia (NH3-SCR) (512),
direct N2O decomposition (13, 14), and selective oxidation
of NH3 to N2 with O2 (15).
Various techniques have been described in the liter-
ature to characterize Fe-zeolites, including transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared,
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electron spin
resonance, and recently extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (14, 1623). Different forms of iron have been
identified in FeZSM-5 (Fig. 1). These include isolated ions
either (a) in framework positions (isomorphously substi-
tuted) or (b) in cationic positions in the zeolite channels,
(c)binuclearand,ingeneral,oligonuclearironcomplexesin
extraframework positions, (d) iron oxide FeOx nanoparti-
cles of size 2 nm, and (e) large iron oxide particles (Fe2O3)
in a wide distribution (up to 25 nm in size) located at the
surface of the zeolite crystal.
FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and
liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using com-
mercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads
to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide
particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the
different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17). Also,
ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility (16, 24),
which makes them unattractive from a catalytic point of
view. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the
channels of HZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method
for preparing FeZSM-5. The water-free conditions under
which the exchange takes place allow full exchange of the

ZSM-5 zeolite, where iron is mainly present in the form
of binuclear hydroxide clusters at ion-exchange positions.
However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD ex-
change strongly affect the state of the iron species. Cal-
cination of the exchanged sample before a hydrolysis step
mainly leads to the formation of large iron oxide (hematite)
particles (18). The heating rate during calcination was
also found crucial in the development of these particles
(25, 26).
In an earlier paper (20), some of us reported the per-
formance of steamed FeZSM-5 for selective oxidation of
benzene to phenol with N2O, displaying high phenol pro-
ductivities (0.8 mmol of phenol · h1 ·g1 during 7 h time on
stream). This catalyst, hereafter denoted ex-FeZSM-5, was
prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis of isomorphously
substituted FeZSM-5, followed by calcination at 823 K and
steam treatment at 873 K. We recently reported that ex-
FeZSM-5 also yields significantly higher N2O decomposi-
tion activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via
other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion ex-
change and sublimation (26, 27). Furthermore, an improved
stability for direct N2O decomposition in the presence of
O2, NO, SO2, and H2O, typically present in tail-gases from
nitric acid manufacture and combustion processes, has been
observed (26, 27).
The nature of the active Fe species of ex-FeZSM-5 in
the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol was previously in-
vestigated by some of us using ultravioletvisible (UVvis),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic res-
onance (EPR) (20). UVvis analysis showed that steam
treatment induces the migration of Fe to extraframework
positions, without an apparent modification of the long-
range ordering of the crystalline structure, as concluded
from XRD. From EPR, two redox active species were iden-
tified but an unambiguous assignment of the iron species
in the catalyst could not be given. Although different au-
thors have investigated the extraction of iron from isomor-
phously substituted Fe-silicalite upon thermal treatment in
the range of 7731073 K in air (28, 29), a detailed charac-
terization of the activation of the FeZSM-5 and nature of
the species formed by the steaming procedure has not been
reported.
In this paper, a detailed characterization of the activation
of isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 by calcination and
steaming is presented, based on gas (Ar, N2) physisorp-
tion, 27Al and 29Si magic-angle spinning (MAS)nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), TEM, NH3 temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD), H2-TPR, 57Fe M
ossbauer
spectroscopy, and voltammetric response techniques. The
results lead to a detailed description of the physicochemical
changes induced by the postsynthesis treatments, as well as
of the nature of the different species in the catalysts.
EXPERIMENTAL
Material Preparation
The isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 was synthe-
sized hydrothermally using tetrapropylammonium hydrox-
ide as the template (20). A solution of the silica source
(tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS, Acros, 98%), the template
(tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, TPAOH, Fluka, 20% in
water),andNaOHwasaddedtoamixtureofaluminum(III)
nitrate (Al(NO3)3 · 9H2O, Merck, 99%) and iron(III) ni-
trate (Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O, Merck, 98.5%). The molar ratios
between components were H2O/Si = 45, TPAOH/Si = 0.1,
NaOH/Si = 0.2, Si/Al = 36, and Si/Fe = 152. The solution
was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave lined with
Teflon and kept in a static air oven at 448 K for 5 days.
The crystalline material was filtered and washed with
deionized water until the sample was free of nitrates. The
as-synthesized sample (FeZSM-5as), in which Fe(III) is
isomorphously substituted in the zeolite framework, was
calcined in air at 823 K for 10 h and was then converted
into the H-form by three consecutive exchanges with an
ammonium nitrate solution (0.1 M) overnight and subse-
quent calcination at 823 K for 5 h (FeZSM-5c). Finally,
the catalyst was steamed at ambient pressure (water par-
tial pressure of 300 mbar and 30 ml · min1 of N2 flow) at
873 K during 5 h, yielding ex-FeZSM-5. The sample was
stored at room temperature in dry atmosphere.
In order to perform 57Fe M
ossbauer measurements with
the different samples, 57Fe-enriched FeZSM-5as was pre-
pared. For this purpose, a small piece of 57Fe foil was
dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (1 M). Subsequently,
ammonium hydroxide was added to neutralize the solution,
followed by addition of the aluminum source. The synthesis
and postsynthesis treatments were as described above.

Characterization
The chemical composition of the catalysts was determi-
nedbyinductivelycoupledplasmaopticalemissionspectro-
scopy (PerkinElmer Plasma 40 (Si) and Optima 3000DV
(axial)) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer
1100).
Ar adsorption isotherms at 87 K were obtained in a Mi-
cromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. The pore size distri-
bution was calculated from the adsorption branch of the
isothermusingtheSaitoFoleymodel(30).N2 adsorptionat
77 K was carried out in a QuantaChrome Autosorb-6B ap-
paratus. The pore size distribution was calculated from the
desorption branch of the isotherm using the BarretJoyner
Halenda model (31). Samples were previously evacuated at
623 K for 16 h. The BET method was used to calculate the
surface area (SBET) of the samples, while the micropore
volume (Vmicro) and external surface area (ESA) were de-
termined using the t-plot method according to Lippens and
de Boer (32).
29Si and 27Al MASNMR were recorded at 79.46 and
104.26 MHz, respectively, with a Varian VXR-400S spec-
trometer. The narrow-bore magnet (50 nm) was fitted with
a high-speed magic spinning (MAS) Doty probe. The sam-
ples were spun in 5-mm-diameter rotors made of zirconia.
The length of the radio frequency pulses was 3.1 s for Si
and 0.5 s for Al. The spinning frequency was in the range
44.5 kHz for Si and 7.0 kHz for Al. Acquisition time was
0.05 s for Si and 0.2 s for Al. A time interval of 5 s for Si and
1 s for Al between successive accumulations was selected in
order to avoid saturation effects. The number of accumula-
tions (688 for Si and 10,000 for Al) allowed a signal-to-noise
ratio higher than 20. The 27Al and 29Si chemical shifts were
