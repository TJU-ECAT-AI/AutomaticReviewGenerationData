ABSTRACT 
The catalytic 
oxidation 
of methane at temperatures 
higher 
than 5OO'C leads 
to carbon 
monoxide 
when using 
O2 ; whereas 
formaldehyde 
is 
produced 
with a good 
selectivity 
when N 0 is 
used. 
Surface 
potenti 
3 1 measurements 
have been performed 
to determine 
the nature 
of the oxygen species involved 
during the methane oxidation. Both 0 
and N 0 
give O- which is localized 
at 
the catalyst 
surface. At temperatures hf?gher 
thgn 
400C,0- is transformed 
into O--. Depending on the temperature, 
methane reacts 
with these two negative oxygen species. 
Surface potential 
measurements 
under catalytic 
conditions 
show that the 
catalyst is more oxidized 
in the case of 0 than it is when N 0 is used. The

INTRODUCTION 
Natural gas is the major source of methane, containing 40 to 95 volume 
percent 
of CH4. The use of methane for other purposes than heat production 
is 
limited because of the difficulty to store and transport this compound. 
There- 
fore it would be extremely valuable to convert methane into products easier 
to 
handle and more valuable for the chemical industry, like methanol or 
formalde- 
hyde. 
The direct partial oxidation of methane by air has been extensively 
studied 
in 
the past (I) ; conversions 
and selectivities 
measured were always very low. 
So far the research on methane conversion by heterogeneous 
catalysis has been 
developed 
along two lines : the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and 
ethylene 
on catalysts 
such as doped MgO or rare earths oxides (2-4) and the 
partial oxidation 
of methane to methanol 
and formaldehyde 
by using nitrous 
oxide (5-8). In the later reaction, the most selective catalysts 
are 
Moo8 
or 
v205 supported on silica. Although the mechanism of the 
oxidation 
by 
nitrous 
oxide has not been studied, an O- species has been claimed 
to be the active

intermediate. 
The aim 
of the present 
work is the study of the difference of reactivity of 
methane on MoO3 
supported on silica catalysts, when 
oxygen 
or nitrous 
oxide 
are 
used as oxidizing 
agents 
using surface 
potential 
measurements. 
This technique 
has 
been shown to be able to provide information about the nature of the oxygen 
species involved in the catalytic oxidation reactions (9). 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Catalysts 
The samples of MoO3 supported on SiO2. 
were prepared by impregnation 
of 
silica (Aerosil 
DEGUSSA 130 m2.g-') by an ammonium heptamolybdate 
solution, 
followed by evaporation under continuous stirring, and drying at llOC 
for 
16 
hours. 
The 
catalyst 
was then 
calcined 
at 5OO*C 
under 
dry air for 16 hours. The 
concentration 
of lybdenum is 
expressed 
in 
weight 
percent 
of atomic 
molybdenum. 
Catalytic 
activity 
measurements 
The catalytic activity measurements were performed in a fixed 
bed 
reactor, 
under 
continuous 
flow at atmospheric 
pressure. 
The 
mass of the catalyst 
was lg 
and 
the 
total 
flow 
rate 
of the gas was 3 1-h-l. 
The partial 
pressures 
(in 
atm.) 
of the gases were : CH, : 0.11, 02 or N20 : 0.33, H20 : 0.22, He : 0.34,for 
experiments conducted with water: and CH 
4 : 0.13, 02 or N20 : 0.42, 
He : 0.45, 
for experiments 
without 
water. 
The chromatographic 
analysis 
of the products 
was 
perfoed on two columns : carbosieve and Porapak Q, with a cathareter 
detector. 
Surface 
potential 
asurements 
The surface 
potential 
of the samples 
was 
measured 
by the vibrating 
capacitor 
method. 
The reference 
electrode 
was made of graphite. 
The potential 
measuring 
cell was connected 
to a gas flow system which allowed controlled streams of 
oxygen 
or nitrous 
oxide, 
methane, 
argon 
and 
their mixtures 
to pass through 
the 
apparatus. 
All 
the surface 
potential 
values 
presented 
in 
this work are relative 
to the 
graphite 
electrode 
potential 
: V = Vtgraphitel 
- Vtsamplef. 
Hence, 
an increase 
of the value of the potential difference indicates 
that the surface becomes 
more negative. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Catalytic 
activity 
measurements 
The conversions and selectivities measured after establishment of the steady 
state are reported in table 1. The catalytic oxidation of methane 
with 
02 on 
SiO*. 1 wt% /Mo/Si02 and 4.3 wtX No/'Si02 catalysts leads to total 
oxidation 
to 
carbon oxides,CQ 
and coy The presence 
of water in the flowing 
gas Iowers 
the 
nvrsn and changes the selectivity with an enhan@nt 
of the CO production 
at the 
expense 
of C02. 
When N2Q is used as the oxidizing 
agent, the reaction 
produces formal- 
dehyde 
only 
on MOO3 
suprt an SiO2. 
During 
the first 
minutes 
of the reaction, 
the conversion 
is 
high (up 
to 30%) 
and subsequently 
drops rapidly.

of the MoO3/SiO2 
samples 
treated at 500C in 
pure oxygen, and in an oxygen-argon 
mixture (PO = 0.05 atm.) have been 
measured in the temperature 
range 200-500C and deported in figure 1. The 
curves 
for the molybdena-covered 
silica show three 
temperature 
regions where 
potential values are constant or vary slowly : 240-3OO"C, 
340-420C and 
> 
45O'C. Between these regions, 
potential values rise rapidly, the surface 
becoming 
more negative 
when 
the temperature 
increases.

In 
these three temperature 
ranges, 
the variations 
of the potential value 
when the partial 
pressure 
of oxygen is changed 
have been interpreted 
on the 
151 
basis 
of a method 
previously 
described 
(9). 
This 
method 
allows 
the determine 
tion of the nature 
of the negative 
oxygea-species 
adsorbed 
on the surface 
and 
in equilibrium 
with gaseous oxygen. The dependence 
of the potential 
on the 
partial 
oxygen 
pressure 
is : 
V = g 
In PO2 + constant 
with k the Boltzman constant, T the absolute temperature and e the 
charge 
of 
the electron. 
The value of n depends on the equilibrium 
between gaseous and adsorbed 
oxygen 
species.

value of the Mo03/Si02

with the partial pressure of

equal 
to kT/ne

to values

are adsor-

Mo03fSi02 
catalyst, 
02A being the dominant 
species 
at the 
temperatures 
higher 
than 450C. 
The same 
measurements 
done 
on the Si02

two

regions 
(figure

n values 
calculated 
from 
the slope 
of the V = f(lnPo ) straight 
lines as indicated in table 3, show that now the O- is the dominant & ecies at 
high temperature. 
When the Mo03/Si02 
sample is reduced- 
in a hydrogen-argon 
flow (P,., 
= 0.1 
atm.) at 500 for 30 minutes, the potential 
value falls 
down, the%urface

becoming less negative. 
After cooling at lOO*C, an oxygen flow was been

the varfations 
of the pcrtentiai,Yrhenjincreasing

have been recorded and reported in figure 3. The three temperature 
regions 
observed 
before 
can be seen again,but the potential variation between each 
plateau is now larger than in the case of the well 
oxidized 
sample. However, 
the oxygen species adsorbed an the surface in equilibrium with 
gaseous,oxygen 
is still the same, 
as determined 
by the Y = f(lnP0 ) variations.

Potential

The potential 
variations 
measured in the course of the reoxidation 
of the 
reduced 
Mo03/Si02 
sample 
by a N20-argon 
flow fPN 
o = 0.1 atm.1 are shown in 
figure 3 and can be compared 
with 
the reoxdationy Oz. 
At temperatures 
lower than 24O"C, surface potential values are lower 
than 
the corresponding 
values 
obtained 
under 
oxygen 
atmosphere. 
In 
the 240-28OOC 
temperature 
range, 
potential 
values 
under O2 and N20 are equal. Between 280 
and 480C, the potential value in 120 atmosphere is constant,and it rises 
rapidly 
between 
490 
and SOO*C. 
At 
this temperature, 
the potential 
value under 
N20 
reaches 
the value 
obtained in oxygen atmosphere. 
When the temperature 
is 
lowered, the surface potential decreases slowly, as can been seen 
in figure 
3. 
In the temperature range 140-280C, 
the surface potential variations 
obtained 
in N20 atmosphere 
can be explained 
by the adsorption 
of 0; and O* 
species. created 
by the 
decompasition 
of N20 on the surface, folfowing: 
N20 + e- - 
N2 t O-

At tperatus higher 
than 280% 
under oxygen atmosphere, 
O- species 
are 
in 
equilibrium 
with 
gaseous 02 molecules. 
This is not the case in N20 atmos- 
phere ; the 0' species 
created 
by the N20 adsorption 
desorb 
to give gaseous 
153 
oxygen: 
the surface 
potential 
value is 
then 
constant. 
In 
the temperature 
range 360-42O"C, 
under oxygen,the potential rises, as 
the O- species transform into 02-, 
which reoxidizes 
the reduced MOOS. Under 
N20, the O- species 
can either desorb or transform 
into 02-_ The stable 
potential value observed up to 48O'C shows that desorption is faster than 
reoxidation. 
Reoxidation only 
occurs 
at 
temperatures 
higher 
than 49O*C.

In 
the catalysis 
temperature 
range 
(T > 550C), 
02- can be adsorbed 
on the 
surface 
of Mo03/Si02 catalysts, in O2 as well as in N 0 atmosphere, the O- 
being an intermediate 
species giving 02- 
2 
adsorbed ions. In the stationary 
state 
under 
CH4 
and O2 or N20 
gaseous 
mixture, 
the 
two species O- and 02- can 
coexist on the surface. The reaction creating them constitutes the reoxidation 
step 
of the redox 
reaction. 
Steady 
state 
surface 
potential 
measurements 
In general, the values of the surface potential decrease when the 
catalysts 
are exposed to the reaction mixture and reach stable values 
in a few 
hours. 
Such steady state surface potentials for different reactant flows are 
reported 
in figure 4. 
164 
When MoO,/SiO2 
catalysts 
are placed in CH4-02 
or CH4-N20 
gaseous 
mixtures 
at 
temperatures 
higher 
than 500C, 
the potential 
value is intermediate 
between 
the oxidized 
state (02 or N20) and the reduced 
state (CH4) (figure 4). This 
indicates 
that the surface of the catalyst is partially reduced during the 
reaction. 
Interestingly,the 
value 
measured in CH4-02 
flow is higher than in 
CH4-N20 
flow,implying 
that 
the surface 
layers 
are more oxidized in the former 
case. 
At constant 
temperature, 
the stationary 
potential 
values vary reversibly 
when increasing 
and 
decreasing 
the partial 
pressures 
of 02 or N20 and CH4_

Such 
variations 
could 
be explained 
by a chanism of reduction 
and 
oxidation 
of the surface 
(lO,tt), 
The oxidation 
reaction 
step 
involves 
the adsorption 
of 
negative 
oxygen species; 
the reduction 
step is the attack 
/on 
these negative 
species by methane. In the oxidation step, two electrons are given by the 
catalyst 
for one oxygen or nitrous 
oxide molecule. 
That could mean that the 
active 
oxygen 
species 
are O-(in the case 
of catalytic 
oxidation 
of methane by 
oxygen)and 
02-(in the 
case 
of N20),

The proposed 
mechanism is in accordance 
with the classification 
of oxygen 
species proposed in the literature (9,12) for the catalytic oxidation of 
hydrocarbons. 
The O- species lead to total oxidation while the 02- species 
give partial 
oxidation 
products. 
However 
recently 
Liu et al. (6) have conclu- 
ded to the contrary 
for the oxidation 
of methane. 
Their EPR results 
obtained 
at low 
temperature 
have 
clearly 
demonstrated 
the generation 
of O- species 
and 
of methyl 
radical 
on these 
catalysts 
but these results were obtained 
far 
from 
the actual reaction conditions. The results 
obtained 
in 
situ, 
reported 
in this 
work, complete 
Liu's et.al. results by demonstrating 
the role of 0 
2- species in 
the selective oxidation process. 
CONCLUSION 
The adsorption 
of gaseous 
oxygen or nitrous oxide on Mo03/Si02 catalysts 
creates 
02, 
O- and 02- species 
within 
the range 
of temperature 
160-5OOY. 
In 
the course 
of the catalytic oxidation of methane, the surface of the 
catalyst 
is 
partially 
reduced, 
out 
to a greater 
extent 
in 
the case 
of N20 than 
in 
the 
case 
oi 
Oz. 
The catalytic 
oxidation 
of methane 
can be explained 
by a reduction-oxidation 
mechanism 
of the catalyst 
surface. 
The negative 
oxygen 
species 
involved 
in 
the 
catalytic 
oxidation 
by oxygen is an O-; the main products 
formed are CO and 
C02. In 
the case 
of N20, 
the negative 
species 
taking part in the reaction 
are 
02- species 
and 
formaldehyde 
is 
formed 
with a good selectivity.
