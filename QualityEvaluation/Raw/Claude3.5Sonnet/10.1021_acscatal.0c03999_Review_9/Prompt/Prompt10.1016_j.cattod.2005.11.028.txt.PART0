Abstract
The effect of the nature and distribution of VOx species over amorphous and well-ordered (MCM-41) SiO2 as well as over g-Al2O3 on their
performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 and N2O was studied using in situ UVvis, ex situ XRD and H2-TPR analysis in
combination with steady-state catalytic tests. As compared to the alumina support, differently structured SiO2 supports stabilise highly dispersed
surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading. These species are more selective over the latter materials than over V/g-Al2O3 catalysts. This
finding was explained by the difference in acidic properties of silica- and alumina-based supports. C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is
improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species. Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by
using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst
reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such
separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation.

1. Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes to high-
value added olefins is an attractive field of oxidative
heterogeneous catalysis because such operation offers an
economical alternative to the existing technologies of alkene
production by thermal dehydrogenation, which is thermo-
dynamically limited, and energy demanding. Additionally, the
ODH operation does not suffer from catalyst deactivation by
cocking; therefore, stable catalytic performance is enabled.
Numerous catalytic systems have been evaluated for the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene and
the relevant results have been recently reviewed [1,2].
Vanadium- and molybdenum-based catalytic materials are
claimed to be the most active and selective ones for the ODP
reaction with O2 [35]. Different properties of the solid
material such as reducibility, acidity and basicity, co-ordination
geometry and dispersion of VOx species have been identified as
being important in affecting catalytic performance [611].
However, all these factors are still being debated.
The present work aims at understanding the role of support
(MCM-41, amorphous SiO2 and g-Al2O3) on the structure and
catalytic performance of VOx species in the ODP reaction. For
comparing activity of various catalytic materials, apparent
turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane conversion were
obtained from steady-state reaction rates determined under
differential conditions. Attention is particularly focussed on the
effect of different oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) on activity and
selectivity of VOx species in the ODP reaction.

structural properties as well as for deriving insights into the
distribution and reducibility of surface as well as near surface
VOx species. H2-TPR measurements were performed by
heating 20100 mg of sample with 20 K/min up to 1073 K
in a gas mixture of hydrogen (10 vol.% in argon for V/SiO2 and
V/MCM-41 as well as 5 vol.% in neon for V/Al2O3) with a total
flow rate of 50 cm3

density SV was calculated according to Eq. (1):
SV  NV

where NV is the number of vanadium atoms per gram of catalyst
(atoms/g) and SBET is the catalyst specific surface area.
For characterizing the performance of the catalytic materials,
continuous flow experiments were performed at atmospheric
pressure and different temperatures (673773 K) in an U-shaped
fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 6 mm) made of quartz. The following
reaction
feeds
were
used:
C3H8:O2:N2 = 30:15:55
and
C3H8:N2O:Ne = 30:30:40 (for V/g-Al2O3 catalytic materials)
as wellasC3H8:O2:N2 = 40:20:40andC3H8:N2O:Ne = 40:40:20
(for V/MCM-41 and V/SiO2). The initial rates of products
formation and turnover frequencies (TOFs) were determined at
degrees of propane conversion of less than 4% according to
Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The rate units was defined as
nC3H8 s1 g1, where nC3H8 is the number of moles of propane
converted toa certainreactionproduct, gthemassof catalyst,and
TOF is the number of propane molecules converted per V atom

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterisation
The specific surface areas (SBET), apparent vanadium
surface densities, phase composition from XRD analysis,
and Tmax of hydrogen consumption in temperature-pro-
grammed reduction (TPR) tests are shown in Table 1. The
SBET values of V/MCM-41 and V/SiO2 materials do not
strongly depend on vanadium loading up to 5 wt.%. For V/g-
Al2O3 materials, such possible vanadium loading is, however,
lower (1 wt.%). The SBET values of V(11.2)/MCM-41, V(4.6)/
g-Al2O3 and V(9.5)/g-Al2O3 are significantly lower than those
of the other V/MCM-41 and V/g-Al2O3 catalytic materials
indicating that the microstructure of MCM-41 and g-Al2O3 is
influenced by the comparatively high loading of vanadium.
This is explained by the fact that the support surfaces are fully
covered by larger vanadia crystallites and that pores of alumina
and silica are plugged by vanadia. Intense peaks corresponding
to V2O5 were identified in XRD-patterns of V(4.6)/g-Al2O3,
V(9.5)/g-Al2O3 and V(11.2)/MCM-41 (Table 1), i.e. in samples
with the lowest BET values. Accordingly, H2-TPR profiles of
these three samples have several maxima (Table 1). To derive
further insights into the degree of vanadium site isolation and
reducibility of VOx species, catalytic materials were char-
acterised by in situ UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
UVvis spectra of selected V/MCM-41, V/SiO2 and V/g-Al2O3
materials are compared in Fig. 1. The UVvis spectra are
essentially the same for all V/MCM-41, V/SiO2 and V/g-Al2O3
catalysts with vanadium loadings up to 5, 2.9 and 1 wt.%,
respectively. For these samples, the ligand to metal charge
transfer (LMCT) bands at 224, 275 and 310 nm are identified.
These bands are characteristic of highly dispersed VOx species
[13]. Thus, the same surface VOx species are present in all of
these catalysts. New broad UVvis bands between 400 and
600 nm appear in V(4.6)/g-Al2O3, V(9.5)/g-Al2O3 (not shown)
and
V(11.2)/MCM-41.
These
bands
originate
from
the
extensively polymerised VOx sites present in crystalline
V2O5 nanoparticles [14]. This is in agreement with the XRD
and H2-TPR results shown in Table 1. Independent of the
support, both, polymerised and highly dispersed VOx species
are reduced in flows of H2 (Table 1) or C3H8 (results are not
shown). The reduced surface VOx species are easily reoxidized
to surface V5+ species. These results support the assumption
that the ODP reaction over the catalysts used proceeds via a
Marsvan-Krevelen sequence.
Thus, depending upon the vanadium loading, VOx species of
different degrees of polymerisation exist in the catalysts
studied. As compared to the alumina support differently
structured SiO2 supports (amorphous silica and MCM-41)
enable stabilisation of VOx species of lower degrees of

polymerisation at higher vanadium loading. This is due to
higher specific surface areas of the latter supports as compared
to g-Al2O3.
3.2. Reactivity of various VOx species in the ODP reaction
with O2 and N2O
The effect of vanadium surface density on the rate of
propane consumption per V atom, i.e. the apparent turnover
frequency (TOF), is shown in Fig. 2. For both N2O and O2,
TOFs pass through a maximum at ca. 1 V/nm2 for all the
catalytic materials. For a given vanadium surface density, the
TOF values obtained with N2O as oxidant is lower than with O2.
According to [9], the lower activity of N2O is explained by the
lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites.
A similar dependence of TOFs on vanadium surface density
has been previously found for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane and propane over V/Al2O3 materials using O2 as oxidant
[15]. Since the TOF values for materials with vanadium surface
densities up to 1 V/nm2 do not significantly depend on the
vanadium surface densities, these materials should possess
VOx species of similar structure and reactivity. From the results
of catalyst characterisation in Section 3.1, highly dispersed
surface VOx species are concluded to be stabilised over these
materials. The decrease of TOFs at vanadium surface densities
above 1 V/nm2 in Fig. 2 is explained by changing the structure
of surface VOx species. Not only highly dispersed surface VOx
species but also three-dimensional V2O5 clusters appear over
materials with high vanadium surface densities (Table 1,
Fig. 1). In such clusters, only a small part of surface VOx
species is accessible for the ODP reaction, while bulk VOx
species do not actively participate in the reaction. These
species were found to be active for propane oxidation in a
periodic mode of operation, i.e. alternating feeding of O2 and
C3H8 [16].
3.3. Selectivity determining factors in the ODP reaction
Fig. 3 demonstrates that C3H6 selectivity over V(2.9)/SiO2
and V(2.7)/MCM-41 is very close. The selectivity is, however,
influenced by oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) being higher with
N2O than with O2. As compared to these materials, C3H6
selectivity is significantly lower over V(1)/g-Al2O3 using both
O2 and N2O. Since apparent vanadium surface densities,
structure and distribution of VOx species over V(2.9)/SiO2,
V(2.7)/MCM-41 and V(1)/g-Al2O3 are very similar (Section
3.1), the support itself is concluded to influence catalytic
performance of the supported vanadia-based catalysts. The
differences between the alumina- and silica-supported catalysts
can be related to their acidbase properties. g-Al2O3 is well
known to be a stronger acidic support than silica. Based on the
values of apparent surface density of vanadium (Table 1), it is
concluded that the surface area of V(1)/g-Al2O3 exposes a
significant fraction of free alumina, on which adsorption of
propene occurs. The adsorbed propene transforms further to
COx as previously suggested [17,18]. Taking into account the

present and earlier observations as well as the fact that COx
products are mainly formed via consecutive propene combus-
tion, C3H6 selectivity is suggested to be a function of the rates
of propene desorption and its consecutive oxidation. The higher
the ratio of the rates of propene desorption to oxidation of
propene, the higher is propene selectivity.
Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic
performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their
catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O
instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O
on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that
catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9].
This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of
active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface
density of oxidising sites decreases. Such a decrease favours
selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation,
since only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary in an active
site for the former reaction. Active sites having more than two
lattice oxygen species favour the formation of waste products,
i.e. CO and CO2. Such a hypothesis of active site isolation in
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons was first formulated and
published by Callaham and Grasselli [19].
The
effect
of
the
oxidising
agent
on
the
catalytic
performance can be also related to the nature of oxygen
species originating from O2 and N2O. Since molecular oxygen
consists of two oxygen atoms, both polyatomic (O2
, O2
2) and
monoatomic (O, O or O2) species can be formed from O2.
All these species were identified over various oxide materials
[20]. In contrast to molecular oxygen, decomposition of N2O
results in the formation of one atomic oxygen species only [21].
Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this
stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O,
O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic
oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation
[2224].
4. Conclusions
This study has shown that the nature of VOx species, i.e.
highly dispersed versus polymerised ones, depends on their
apparent surface density and the supporting material. High-
surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of
highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to
5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is
due to lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3. The apparent
TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the
ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities,
supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs
with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability
of N2O for catalyst reoxidation. However, C3H6 selectivity is
improved in the presence
of N2O. Additionally, C3H6
selectivity depends on the support material at similar vanadium
surface densities. Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 ought
to be fully covered by small VOx aggregates in order to achieve
a high selectivity in ODP. For weakly acidic supports like SiO2,
highly dispersed surface VOx species perform similarly for
vanadium surface densities up to 1 V/nm2.
