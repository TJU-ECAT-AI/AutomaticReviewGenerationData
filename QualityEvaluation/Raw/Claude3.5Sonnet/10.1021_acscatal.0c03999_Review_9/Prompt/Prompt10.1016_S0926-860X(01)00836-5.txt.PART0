Abstract
For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded
VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two
different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O. By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards
propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion. The fundamental insights into phase composition,
reduction, structure and dispersion of vanadium sites as well as electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 were derived from
characterisation of the materials by XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (UVVIS-DRS), contact
potential difference (CPD) and electrical conductivity measurements. UVVIS and conductivity measurements were applied
for in situ studies. As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and
solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover
the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx. A high selectivity to propene can be
achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species. Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate-
rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the
propene selectivity is achieved.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Light olefins are mainly produced by the non-
oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes at high
temperatures. Unfortunately, coke formation becomes
significant at these temperatures resulting in deacti-
vation of the catalytic materials. Oxidative dehydro-
genation is an alternative route to alkenes production
at lower temperatures usually not requiring catalyst
regeneration. However, the desired products of the ox-

idative dehydrogenation of light alkanes are typically
more reactive than the respective alkanes themselves.
This gives rise to a fundamental problem of activation
of less reactive alkanes in the presence of more reac-
tive reaction products. Numerous catalysts have been
tested for these reactions and the success in this field
has been recently reviewed [13]. For the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based
materials were reported to be very active and selec-
tive [1,4,5]. Over these catalysts, ODP was proposed
to occur via a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence [6],
in which propane reacts with lattice oxygen resulting
in anion vacancies followed by oxygen dissociative
adsorption and catalyst reoxidation. Total oxidation

is proposed to occur at different surface sites or to in-
volve distinct forms of reactive oxygen [7,8]. Different
solid-material properties such as reducibility, acidity
basicity, co-ordination geometry and dispersion of
VOx species have been assumed to be important fac-
tors affecting catalytic performance of the oxidative
dehydrogenation of light alkanes [913]. All these
properties depend upon the oxide support and vanadia
loading.
In spite of many studies on the subject, it is clear
that deeper fundamental knowledge of catalyst opera-
tion is required to better understand the relationships
between catalytic performance and solid-material
properties, which in turn, are necessary for further
improvement of the catalytic materials. Against this
background, the aim of the present study was to elu-
cidate the effect of structural, redox and electronic
peculiarities of differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 ma-
terials as well as vanadia distribution on catalytic
performance using both ex situ and in situ charac-
terisation techniques. The catalytic performance of
the various materials in ODP was also studied in the
presence of different oxidants such as N2O and O2.
The results obtained lead to a better understanding of
the role of oxidant activation and may eventually lead
to improved catalyst design and/or process operation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
V2O5 (Merck), -Al2O3 (Degussa) and boehmite
(Disperal, Condea) were used for the catalyst prepa-
ration. The required amount of V2O5 was dissolved
in oxalic acid at 348 K followed by adding 1 g of

polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) under stirring until the
solution became clear. Four grams of boehmite and
4 g of -Al2O3 were added to the solution under con-
tinuous stirring. From the resulting mixture, water was
evaporated under vacuum conditions at 333 K for 12 h
followed by calcination at 973 K for 6 h. Boehmite
and PVA were added for homogeneous distribution of
the vanadia on the catalyst surface. After calcination,
the actual vanadia concentration was determined by
ICPOES. The exact vanadium concentrations are
listed in Table 1. The surface and bulk properties of
these catalytic materials are described further below.
2.2. Catalytic tests
Catalytic measurements were carried out in a fixed-
bed U-type reactor made of quartz (i.d. = 6 mm)
at ambient pressure. The feed consisted of 15 vol.%
of oxygen and 30 vol.% of propane in nitrogen or
30 vol.% of nitrous oxide and 30 vol.% of propane
in argon. Argon was used to control the formation
of nitrogen when N2O was decomposed. The total
flow rate and the reaction temperature were varied
between 50150 cm3 min1 and 633803 K, respec-
tively. Reactor effluent compositions were analysed
by gas chromatography (HP-5890) using Poraplot Q
and Molsiev 5 columns. The contact times were ad-
justed for achieving propane conversions of less than
2%. This allowed determination of approximate ini-
tial propene selectivities and estimations of the initial
rates of products formation.
2.3. Catalyst characterisation
Specific surface areas of the catalysts were deter-
mined by N2 physisorption at 77 K using standard

one-point BET analysis (Gemini III analyser) and are
presented in Table 1.
EPR spectra of vanadiaalumina materials were
acquired with an ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) spec-
trometer in X band at both 298 and 77 K. The mag-
netic field was measured with respect to the standard
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH).
UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (UV
VIS-DRS) spectra of vanadiaalumina materials were
obtained using a spectrometer (Cary 400 Varian)
which was equipped with a diffuse reflectance ac-
cessory (praying mantis, Harrick). The samples for
in situ measurements were pre-treated in an O2/N2
(20% O2) mixture at 773 K for 1 h with a total flow of
50 cm3 min1 before any further treatment. After this
pre-treatment, UVVIS-DRS spectra of the catalytic
materials were recorded in either hydrogen (H2/N2 =
20/80) or propane (C3H8/N2 = 30/70) atmosphere and
under reaction conditions (C3H8/O2/N2 = 30/15/55
or C3H8/N2O/N2 = 30/30/40) at 773 K with a total
flow rate of 50 cm3 min1. The reflectance spectra
were converted into the KubelkaMunk function,
F(R), which is proportional to the absorption coef-
ficient for low values of F(R). Spectra were decon-
voluted into Gaussian bands using the GRAMS/386
program (Galactic Industries Corporation).
TPR measurements were carried out using a mass
spectrometer (Sensorlab VG Quadrupoles). AMU of
2, 18 and 28 were used to measure the concentrations
of hydrogen, water and nitrogen, respectively. The cat-
alytic material was loaded in an U-type reactor and
pre-heated at 973 K in an oxygen flow (20% O2 in N2)
of 50 cm3 min1 for 1 h. The reactor was subsequently
cooled down to 30 C and flushed with pure N2 un-
til no traces of oxygen were observed. After flushing,
N2 was replaced by a hydrogen/nitrogen (H2/N2 =
5/95) mixture (50 cm3 min1). The temperature was
then ramped (20 K min1) up to 973 K in this mixture.
The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic
materials was determined between 673873 K ap-
plying the ac method with two platinum electrodes
[14], between which the catalyst sample was placed.
A parallel connection of a condenser and an Ohmic
resistance served as an equivalent circuit [15]. The
catalyst samples were pressed into disks 7 mm in
diameter and ca. 1 mm thickness. To minimise con-
tact resistance, the catalyst disc was covered by a
platinum paste on each side and was then treated in
air for 30 min at 873 K. To separate the various types
of conductivities (p-type, n-type and ion-type), total
conductivity was measured at different oxygen partial
pressures (220 kPa).
The contact potential difference (CPD) between
the samples and a reference gold electrode was mea-
sured by the vibrating condenser method. Details of
the apparatus have been reported elsewhere [16]. A
catalyst disk covered only on one side by the Pt paste
was placed on the measuring electrode in a vacuum
chamber connected to a gas-supply system. The total
pressure was 102 Pa. The interaction of oxygen, ni-
trous oxide and propane with the catalyst sample was
studied at 698 K applying partial pressure of the gases
of 2 × 103, 4 × 103 and 2 × 103 Pa, respectively.
The carrier gas was nitrogen.
3. Results and discussion
In order to gain information on vanadia distribu-
tion (isolated, polymerised sites), its reducibility and
structure, phase composition and electronic proper-
ties, differently-loaded vanadiaalumina supported
materials were characterised using XRD, TPR, EPR,
UVVIS-DRS, CPD and electrical conductivity mea-
surements. The results of these studies are discussed
in relation with catalytic performance to derive
structure-selectivityactivity relationships.
3.1. Surface properties and bulk compositions
of VOx/γ -Al2O3 materials
The materials with a low vanadia loading (<1 wt.%)
exhibit the highest surface area. With a further increase
of vanadia content, the surface area decreases strongly.
VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 displays the lowest surface
area. This can be due to the fact that the support parti-
cles are fully covered by vanadia and pores of alumina
are plugged by vanadia with an increase in its concen-
tration. The effect of vanadia loading on crystallisation
behaviour of vanadiaalumina materials was studied
by powder XRD. For VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and
VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials, only broad feature-
less peaks of -Al2O3 were observed (Fig. 1). This
is probably either due to small crystalline domains,
which are not detectable by XRD, or due to the pres-
ence of amorphous phases. Intense peaks correspond-

VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3
(Fig. 1). The intensity of these peaks increases with
vanadia loading.
3.2. Distribution and reduction of vanadia species
To derive basic insights into the effect of the
content of vanadia on the redox properties and its
dispersion, the materials were tested by TPR. The
respective profiles of all the catalytic materials are
presented in Fig. 2. For VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and
VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3, only a single peak of H2 con-

sumption was observed with a maximum at ca. 868 K.
This can be assigned to the reduction of monomeric or
low oligomeric VOx species. However, the TPR spec-
tra of catalytic materials with higher vanadia loading
show more peaks with maxima shifted to higher tem-
peratures (Fig. 2, Table 1). Koranne et al. [17] have
studied TPR of bulk V2O5. They found maxima of hy-
drogen consumption at 953, 993, 1148 K. The peaks at
the first two temperatures are present in the TPR spec-
trum of VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3. Based on the litera-
ture data [17], we can assume that the TPR spectra of
VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3
reveal a portion of oligomeric or bulk-like V2O5
species. This agrees well with XRD results showing
the presence of a V2O5 phase in these samples.
To gain further information on the degree of
vanadium-site isolation and to follow reduction and
reoxidation of vanadia species, the vanadiaalumina
catalytic materials were studied by ex situ EPR and
in situ UVVIS-DRS.
The ex situ EPR spectra (T = 77 K) of all the
catalytic materials studied show the characteristic
hyperfine splitting multiplet (hfs) of well-isolated
octahedrally co-ordinated VO2+ species [18] super-
imposed on a broad isotropic singlet of weakly inter-
acting VO2+ species. Fig. 3 presents the EPR spectra
of all VOx/-Al2O3 materials. The total amount of
VO2+ species and the fraction of the weakly interact-
ing VO2+ species increase with an increase in vanadia
loading.
The UVVIS spectra of all the vanadiaalumina
materials after oxygen pre-treatment at 773 K are
presented in Fig. 4. The oxidised catalytic materials

exhibit charge-transfer (CT) bands below 500 nm.
For samples with a low vanadia loading (<1 wt.%),
CT bands at 224, 275 and 310 nm can be identified
by spectra deconvolution (Fig. 4a and b), which can
be assigned to isolated tetrahedrally co-ordinated
V5+ species [19]. Additional weak bands at 359 and
376 nm are observed in these materials. They re-
veal either the presence of oligomeric tetrahedrally
or isolated octahedrally co-ordinated V5+ species.
The EPR spectra of VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and of
VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 show the characteristic hfs of
well-isolated octahedrally co-ordinated VO2+ species
(Fig. 3). Based on these results, we can assume
that the bands at 359 and 376 nm in UVVIS spec-
tra (Fig. 4a and b) belong to isolated octahedrally
co-ordinated V5+ species. The spectra of samples
VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3,
VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3
(Fig. 4c and d) show additional CT bands at 468
and 535 nm, which can be assigned to octahedraly
co-ordinated V5+ species in V2O5 clusters; from
XRD, a crystalline form of V2O5 was also observed.
After reduction of VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx
(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 by C3H8, the intensity of the CT
bands centred at 230 and 300 nm decreased signifi-
cantly due to reduction of the V5+ species (Fig. 5).
The adsorption bands which remained below 250 nm
can be assigned to the CT of V3+ and/or V4+ species
[20,21]. For VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3, broad bands
caused by V4+ and/or V3+ dd transitions appear
in the region of 450800 nm (Fig. 5b). These bands
can indicate that agglomerated vanadia species exist
as already proven by XRD, EPR and TPR studies.

In

to
VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3
for
VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3, broad bands appear in the re-
gion of 300600 nm (Fig. 5a). In order to check the
nature of these bands, both materials were reduced
by hydrogen at 773 K after they had been previously
oxidised before. The respective spectra are presented
in Fig. 5. For reduced VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3, the in-
tensity of the CT bands centred at 230 and 300 nm
decreases significantly due to reduction of the V5+
species, while a band with a maximum at ca. 620 nm
appears (Fig. 5a), which can be assigned to forbid-
den dd transitions of isolated V4+ species [22].
There were no bands in the region of 300600 nm
which are characteristic of this material reduced by
propane (Fig. 5a). The appearance of these bands
only after C3H8 pre-treatment can be explained by
the fact that carbon containing species are deposited
on the catalyst surface during C3H8 pre-treatment
at 773 K. IR microscopy measurements of this cat-
alytic material pre-treated with propane at 773 K gave
hints of formation of carbon containing species. For
VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 there was no significant dif-
ference in the UVVIS spectra after both propane
and hydrogen pre-treatment (Fig. 5b). Based on this
data we can assume that the carbon deposition on
this material is considerably depressed in comparison
with materials with a low vanadia loading (<1 wt.%).
3.3. Reoxidation of VOx/γ -Al2O3 by O2 and N2O
In order to check the ability of both N2O and
O2 for catalyst reoxidation, VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3
and VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 catalytic materials were
first reduced in flowing hydrogen (20% H2 in N2)
at 773 K and their subsequent reoxidation was mon-
itored over time. Reoxidation of the reduced cat-
alytic materials was found to be affected strongly
by the type of oxidant. Catalyst oxidation with N2O
is slower as compared to O2. This phenomenon
was also supported by UVVIS measurements un-
der C3H8/N2O/N2 and C3H8/O2/N2 conditions at
773 K. The experimental data are presented in Fig. 6
for VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3, the intensity of the CT
bands of V5+ species does not decrease significantly,
when the catalytic material was treated by a reaction
mixture containing propane and oxygen. This means
that only a small fraction of surface V5+ cations is
reduced during propane oxidation with oxygen. How-

ever, additional surface V5+ cations are reduced when
propane oxidation is carried out by N2O. An increase
of the intensity of CT and dd transitions of V3+ or
V4+ is observed below 230 nm and in the range of
450800 nm, respectively.
3.4. Electronic properties of VOx/γ -Al2O3
In order to gain information on the electronic prop-
erties of VOx/-Al2O3 and their role in the ODP,
the electrical conductivity of differently-loaded VOx/
-Al2O3 materials was measured as a function of reac-
tant (O2, N2O and C3H8), partial pressure and temper-
ature. The electrical conductivity of the catalytic ma-
terials increased with the content of vanadia deposited
(Table 1). For materials with a vanadia loading in the
range of 19.5 wt.%, the total conductivity decreased
with oxygen partial pressure, as is typical for n-type
semiconductors while for VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3,
it did not depend on oxygen partial pressure, which
corresponds to either an inherent dielectric or ionic
conductor. On replacing O2 by N2O, the total con-
ductivity of the VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 material in-
creased (Table 1). Such type of experiments was not
carried out with other materials; however, the effect
should be the same, since the materials are of the
same nature. The increase of the total conductivity
observed by replacing O2 with N2O can be explained
by the fact that N2O does not fully fill anion vacan-
cies of the oxide material as is the case with oxygen;
n-type semiconductors are not effective for N2O de-
composition [23]. A low ability of N2O for catalyst
reoxidation was also supported by UVVIS measure-
ments (see previous sections). Due to the low ability
of N2O to oxidise the catalyst, the number of free
electrons is higher in the presence of N2O than in
the presence of O2; therefore, the total conductivity
increases. When the VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 material
was exposed to a reducing atmosphere (30% C3H8 in
N2) at 400 C, the electrical conductivity increased by
several orders of magnitude due to the reduction of
the catalytic material and formation of anion vacan-
cies with two electrons (Eq. (1)), which can be easily
released into the conduction band. The conductivity
decreased reversibly under oxygen, because anion
vacancy with two electrons are filled by gas-phase
oxygen (Eq. (2)). This can be explained by the redox
properties of these catalytic materials.

(2)
where V0 is the anion vacancy with two electrons.
To further elucidate the effect of the two different
oxidants and of vanadia loading on catalytic perfor-
mance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials, the CPD
was measured under oxidising and reducing con-
ditions. These measurements give information on
surface electronic properties of the materials studied.
The contact potential at 102 Pa nitrogen was taken
as a reference potential value. The potential increased
when the catalytic material was exposed to oxidis-
ing conditions (O2/N2 = 20/80 or N2O/N2 = 40/60,
P total = 102 Pa). The growth of CPD corresponds to
the formation of negatively-charged oxygen species
due to the activation of O2 or N2O and stabilisation
of these species on the catalyst surface. A replace-
ment of an oxidising mixture by nitrogen does not
significantly change CPD during 1 h over VOx(4.6,
9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3
catalytic
materials,
while
for
VOx(0.5, 1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 CPD decreases sharply.
From these results, it can be derived that the oxygen
species formed over the highly VOx-loaded alumina
stay on the catalysts surface. However, these species
desorb easily from alumina with low VOx loading.
Reaction of an oxidised catalytic material with
propane leads to a CPD decrease corresponding to a
reduction of the catalytic material by propane. As an
example, Fig. 7 presents temporal CPD evolution un-
der a C3H8 atmosphere. One can see that the reaction
between gas-phase propane and the oxidised cata-
lyst surface does not markedly depend on oxidising
pre-treatment (Fig. 7a). This means that O2 and N2O
activation on the catalytic materials studied results in
formation of the same oxygen species. Reoxidation
of the reduced catalyst surface is, however, affected
by an oxidant (Fig. 7b). Catalyst oxidation with N2O
is slower in comparison to that with O2.

valid for the whole temperature range from 633 to
803 K. Higher propene selectivities were achieved in
the presence of N2O over all catalytic materials at
similar levels of propane conversion. Replacing oxy-
gen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial
rates of products formation at all temperatures studied.
The catalytic data obtained at low degrees of propane
conversion (<2%) were used to estimate these rates.
The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than
the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by
N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic
materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide
(4.69.5% wt.%). The specific rates related to the
total catalyst surface area (C3H8 molecules s1 m2)
are presented in Table 2. An increase of the vanadia
concentration implies an increase in these specific
rates and selectivity towards propene in the presence
of both oxygen and nitrous oxide. However, the rates
normalised with respect to the total vanadium content
have a maximum for VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 (Ta-
ble 2). A further increase in vanadium loading results
in a decrease in catalytic activity (Table 2). This is
due to the fact that the materials with a high vanadia
content have bulk VOx, which are not available for
ODP. XRD results of this study show the presence of
a V2O5 phase in these samples.
For low amounts of vanadia, i.e. 0.5 and 1 wt.%,
the selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8a) show that
all the main products (CO, CO2 and C3H6) are of
primary nature. Increasing concentration of vanadia
resulted in a decrease in direct propane oxidation to
COx. These products are mainly formed via secondary

oxidation of propene. This is particularly significant
for (4.6 or 9.5 wt.%)VOx/-Al2O3 (Fig. 8b). It should
be noted that the scheme of ODP does not depend on
the oxidant.
From the above, it became obvious that cat-
alytic performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system
depends on vanadia loading and the oxidant used. The
results on catalyst characterisation are discussed to
establish relationships between catalytic performance
and solid-material properties such as electronic prop-
erties, reducibility and structure of VOx species as
well as the catalyst ability for oxidant activation.
The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic
materials increases with the content of deposited vana-
dia (Table 1). Since these materials are predominantly
n-conductors, the dependence of the conductivity on
vanadia loading is attributed to an increase in the
concentration of free electrons in the conduction band.
In agreement with the redox mechanism of the ODP
reaction (Eqs. (1) and (2)), a higher concentration of
free electrons implies a higher rate of incorporation
of gas-phase oxygen into lattice oxygen (the active
oxygen species Eq. (2)), which influences the rate of
propane activation (Eq. (1)).
To explain the influence of vanadia loading on
product selectivity, the conversionselectivity rela-
tionships are discussed with respect to vanadia struc-
ture and its distribution determined by TPR, EPR and
UVVIS. The characterisation results of the oxidised
materials indicate that the degree of polymerisation of
vanadia species is a strong function of vanadia load-
ing. On low-loaded aluminavanadia materials (0.5
and 1 wt.%) mainly isolated tetrahedral V5+ species
are stabilised (Fig. 4). With a further increase in the
vanadia loading, the fraction of polymerised V5+
species increases. This agrees well with earlier results
on characterisation of VOx/-Al2O3 materials [24].
The most important differences observed between
materials with predominantly isolated and materials
with isolated and polymeric vanadia species are the
selectivityconversion plots (Fig. 8). Over catalytic
materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane
is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene
oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium
species propene and COx products are mainly formed
directly from propane. The differences may be due to
the fact that a significant fraction of free alumina on
the catalyst surface is exposed to propene on the cat-
alytic materials with a low vanadia amount (predom-
inantly isolated species). -Al2O3 is a well-known
acidic support [9], on which adsorption of propene
can take place. The UVVIS data of this work support
this assumption. The interaction of propane with the
oxidised VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 material results in the
formation of coke-like species on the catalyst surface,
while over VOx(4.6 or 9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 materials,
there was no formation of such species. Thus, direct
routes of propene and COx formation from propane on
low-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 materials can be explained
by the fact that all these products are formed from
adsorbed propene. In other words, formed propene
stays adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Its desorp-
tion results in formation of gas-phase propene, while
its further oxidation leads to COx. With increasing
142
E.V. Kondratenko, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 222 (2001) 133143
vanadia loading, the adsorption of propene decreases
due to a decrease in the fraction of free alumina and,
therefore, the route of COx formation from adsorbed
propene is not a predominant with catalytic materials
in which their free support surface is not exposed to
propene anymore. Therefore, COx formation occurs
via a secondary oxidation of gas-phase propene.
Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP
occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism.
Therefore, the decrease of catalytic activity on replac-
ing O2 by N2O can be caused by the ability of the
oxidant to oxidise the catalytic reduced material. The
UVVIS and CPD studies support this assumption.
Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials
more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide. Besides,
UVVIS measurements under reaction conditions
(C3H8/N2O/N2 or C3H8/O2/N2) demonstrate that
additional V5+ cations are in a reduced state when
oxygen is replaced by N2O. Therefore, the catalytic
material is more reduced under reaction conditions
in the presence of N2O. In our previous work [25],
we found that the selectivity towards propene forma-
tion is affected by surface reduction: the higher the
surface reduction, the higher is the selectivity. From
the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the
steady-state concentration of active oxygen species
should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the
decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared
to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species
are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst sur-
face at the same total concentration of vanadia, when
N2O is used as an oxidant. In turn, the non-selective
secondary oxidation of propene to COx is inhibited.
This suggestion is in agreement with our results on
ODP over complex mixed oxide materials [26] and
the well-known site-isolation theory [27], which
claims that a statistically controlled number of ac-
tive sites favours selective oxidation reactions over
combustion reaction. Thus, we assume that reducing
the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen
species enhances the selectivity of propene in the
ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O.
4. Conclusions
This study has shown that catalytic performance of
various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly
affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibil-
ity, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties
and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced
active sites. The efficiency of isolated VOx species
for the selective ODP reaction is superimposed by
non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of
the acidic support, which is not covered by active
vanadia. To achieve a high performance in ODP, it
appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which
are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species
for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the
support surface. The non-selective oxidation is, of
course, also suppressed when a non-acidic support is
used. The steady-state concentration of active lattice
oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene
activation, should be optimised to control selective ox-
idation and combustion reactions. This was achieved
by using N2O instead of O2.
