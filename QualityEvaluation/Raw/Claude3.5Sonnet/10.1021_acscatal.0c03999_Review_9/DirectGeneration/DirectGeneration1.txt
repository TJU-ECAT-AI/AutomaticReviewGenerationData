Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites have garnered significant attention as catalysts in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions due to their promising effectiveness and performance. The synthesis method employed in creating these zeolites plays a crucial role in determining their catalytic prowess. Various techniques, such as ion exchange, hydrothermal synthesis, and post-synthesis modification, have been explored to incorporate iron into the ZSM-5 framework, each yielding distinct outcomes in terms of iron distribution, accessibility, and oxidation state. These factors directly influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in ODHP reactions. Researchers evaluate the catalytic performance through key metrics, including propane conversion, propylene yield, and catalyst longevity. Additionally, the impact of reaction conditions, such as temperature and N2O concentration, on the catalytic behavior is thoroughly examined. Understanding the intricate relationship between synthesis methods and catalytic performance is essential for optimizing iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and unlocking their full potential in ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.
