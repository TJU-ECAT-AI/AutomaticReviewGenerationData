[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained"

[3] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The literature primarily discusses the solid-state exchange method for synthesizing Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, using either ferrocene or FeCl3 as iron precursors. The ferrocene-based method, followed by severe calcination, is reported to exhibit superior performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Key performance metrics mentioned include:

1. Maximal initial propylene yield of 30%
2. High turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1
3. Stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1
4. Propylene production rate of approximately 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1, sustained for over 40 hours

These metrics were achieved with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. The study does not provide direct comparisons between different synthesis methods or detailed information on steam treatment or liquid exchange methods. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of various synthesis techniques and their impact on catalytic performance cannot be made based solely on the given information.

该文献主要讨论了合成Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的固态交换方法，使用二茂铁或FeCl3作为铁前体。据报道，使用二茂铁的方法，经过严格煅烧后，在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出优异的性能。

提到的关键性能指标包括：

1. 最大初始丙烯收率为30%
2. 高周转频率为0.037 s-1
3. 稳定的丙烷转化率约为13 mmol gcat-1 h-1
4. 丙烯生产率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，可持续40多小时

这些指标是在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的条件下实现的。该研究没有提供不同合成方法之间的直接比较，也没有详细介绍蒸汽处理或液体交换方法的信息。因此，仅基于所给信息，无法对各种合成技术及其对催化性能的影响进行全面比较。
