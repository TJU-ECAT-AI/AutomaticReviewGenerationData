[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

[3] "A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]. FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The literature primarily discusses two synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites: solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, and conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3. The study focuses on the Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via the ferrocene method as a model catalyst for investigating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide.

Key performance metrics mentioned include:

1. Propylene yield: A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% was obtained.
2. Turnover frequency: A high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1 was achieved.
3. Propane conversion rate: A stable rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was maintained for over 40 hours.
4. Propylene production rate: Approximately 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was sustained for more than 40 hours.

These results were achieved with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. The study identifies FeOAl species as the active sites in the catalyst.

While the literature provides detailed information on the performance of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared using ferrocene, it does not offer comparative data for the FeCl3-prepared catalyst or other synthesis methods such as steam treatment or liquid exchange. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods and their influence on catalytic performance cannot be made based solely on the information provided in this literature.

该文献主要讨论了两种制备含铁ZSM-5沸石的方法：使用茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换法，以及使用FeCl3的传统固态离子交换法。研究重点关注了使用茂铁方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5，将其作为模型催化剂来研究一氧化二氮辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应。

提到的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯收率：获得了30%的最大初始丙烯收率。
2. 转化频率：达到了0.037 s-1的高转化频率。
3. 丙烷转化率：在40多小时内保持了约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1的稳定转化率。
4. 丙烯生产率：在40多小时内维持了约6 mmol gcat-1 h-1的生产率。

这些结果是在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的条件下获得的。研究确定FeOAl物种为催化剂中的活性位点。

虽然文献提供了使用茂铁制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂性能的详细信息，但没有提供使用FeCl3制备的催化剂或其他合成方法（如蒸汽处理或液体交换）的比较数据。因此，仅基于本文献中提供的信息，无法对不同合成方法及其对催化性能的影响进行全面比较。
