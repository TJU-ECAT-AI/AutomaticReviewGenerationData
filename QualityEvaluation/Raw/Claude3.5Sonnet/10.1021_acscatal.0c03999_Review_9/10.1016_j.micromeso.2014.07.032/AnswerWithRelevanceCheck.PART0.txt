          [1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

[3] "A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]. FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[5] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."

[6] "Characterization results reveal that after severe calcination highly isolated FeOAl species are the only exposed iron sites detectable, which account for ca. 60% of the total iron species in Fe-ZSM-5."

          The literature primarily discusses two synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites: solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, and conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3. The ferrocene-based method, followed by severe calcination, is reported to exhibit superior performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Key performance metrics mentioned include:
1. Propylene yield: A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% was achieved.
2. Turnover frequency: A high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1 was reported.
3. Propane conversion rate: A stable rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was maintained for over 40 hours.
4. Propylene production rate: Approximately 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was sustained for more than 40 hours.

These metrics were achieved with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. The study identifies FeOAl species as the active sites in the catalyst, accounting for about 60% of the total iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 after severe calcination.

The ferrocene-based synthesis method appears to produce catalysts with superior performance, as evidenced by the high propylene yield and long-term stability. However, the document does not provide direct comparisons between the different synthesis methods or discuss steam treatment or liquid exchange methods. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully answer the question about the influence of various synthesis methods on catalytic performance.

          该文献主要讨论了两种制备含铁ZSM-5沸石的方法：使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换法，以及使用FeCl3的传统固态离子交换法。据报道，使用二茂铁的方法经过严格煅烧后，在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出优异的性能。

提到的关键性能指标包括：
1. 丙烯收率：达到了30%的最大初始丙烯收率。
2. 转化频率：报告了0.037 s-1的高转化频率。
3. 丙烷转化率：在40多小时内保持稳定的约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1的转化率。
4. 丙烯生产率：在40多小时内维持约6 mmol gcat-1 h-1的生产率。

这些指标是在N2O/C3H8比率为1:2的条件下实现的。研究确定FeOAl物种为催化剂中的活性位点，经过严格煅烧后，这些物种占Fe-ZSM-5中总铁物种的约60%。

二茂铁基合成方法似乎能生产性能更优的催化剂，这从高丙烯收率和长期稳定性可以看出。然而，该文档并未直接比较不同的合成方法，也没有讨论蒸汽处理或液体交换方法。需要更全面的研究才能完整回答关于各种合成方法对催化性能影响的问题。
