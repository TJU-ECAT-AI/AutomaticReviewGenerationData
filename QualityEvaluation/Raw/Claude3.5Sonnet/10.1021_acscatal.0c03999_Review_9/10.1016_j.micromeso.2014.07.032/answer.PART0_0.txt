[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

[3] "A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]. FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The literature discusses two synthesis methods for Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts: solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, and conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3. The ferrocene-based method is highlighted as producing a model catalyst for studying ODHP with N2O.

Key performance metrics mentioned include:

1. Propylene yield: A maximum initial yield of 30% was achieved.
2. Turnover frequency: A high value of 0.037 s-1 was reported.
3. Propane conversion rate: A stable rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was maintained for over 40 hours.
4. Propylene production rate: Approximately 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 was sustained for more than 40 hours.

These metrics were achieved under specific reaction conditions, notably with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. The ferrocene-based synthesis method appears to produce catalysts with superior performance, as evidenced by the high propylene yield and long-term stability.

The literature identifies FeOAl species as the active sites in these catalysts, suggesting that synthesis methods promoting the formation of these species may lead to improved catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

However, the document does not provide direct comparisons between the different synthesis methods or discuss steam treatment or liquid exchange methods. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully answer the question about the influence of various synthesis methods on catalytic performance.

文献讨论了两种Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的合成方法：使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换法，以及使用FeCl3的传统固态离子交换法。二茂铁基方法被强调为生产用于研究N2O辅助ODHP反应的模型催化剂。

提到的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯收率：达到了30%的最大初始收率。
2. 转化频率：报告了0.037 s-1的高值。
3. 丙烷转化率：在40多小时内保持稳定的约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1的转化率。
4. 丙烯生产率：在40多小时内维持约6 mmol gcat-1 h-1的生产率。

这些指标是在特定反应条件下实现的，特别是N2O/C3H8比率为1:2。二茂铁基合成方法似乎能生产性能更优的催化剂，这从高丙烯收率和长期稳定性可以看出。

文献将FeOAl物种确定为这些催化剂中的活性位点，这表明促进这些物种形成的合成方法可能会导致ODHP反应中催化性能的改善。

然而，该文档并未直接比较不同的合成方法，也没有讨论蒸汽处理或液体交换方法。需要更全面的研究才能完整回答关于各种合成方法对催化性能影响的问题。
