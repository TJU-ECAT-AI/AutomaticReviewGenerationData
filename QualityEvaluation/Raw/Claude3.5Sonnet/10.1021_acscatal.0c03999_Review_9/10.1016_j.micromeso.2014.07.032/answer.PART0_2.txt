[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "Characterization results reveal that after severe calcination highly isolated FeOAl species are the only exposed iron sites detectable, which account for ca. 60% of the total iron species in Fe-ZSM-5."

[3] "A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]. FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[5] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

The literature primarily focuses on Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor. This synthesis method, followed by severe calcination, results in highly isolated FeOAl species which are identified as the active sites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The key performance metrics reported for this catalyst include:

1. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30%
2. A high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1
3. A stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1
4. A propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1, maintained for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2

The literature also mentions the preparation of Fe-ZSM-5 by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as the iron precursor, but does not provide performance metrics for this method.

The document does not provide comparative data on steam treatment or liquid exchange methods, nor does it offer detailed information on C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, or C3H6 selectivity under different reaction conditions for the various synthesis methods.

这篇文献主要关注通过固态交换法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5。这种合成方法经过严格煅烧后，产生高度分离的FeOAl物种，被确定为N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的活性位点。

报告的该催化剂的关键性能指标包括：

1. 最大初始丙烯产率为30%
2. 高转化频率为0.037 s-1
3. 稳定的丙烷转化率约为13 mmol gcat-1 h-1
4. 丙烯生产率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，在N2O/C3H8比为1:2的条件下可维持40小时以上

文献还提到了使用FeCl3作为铁前体通过常规固态离子交换法制备Fe-ZSM-5，但没有提供该方法的性能指标。

文献没有提供蒸汽处理或液体交换方法的比较数据，也没有提供不同反应条件下各种合成方法的C3H8转化率、N2O转化率或C3H6选择性的详细信息。
