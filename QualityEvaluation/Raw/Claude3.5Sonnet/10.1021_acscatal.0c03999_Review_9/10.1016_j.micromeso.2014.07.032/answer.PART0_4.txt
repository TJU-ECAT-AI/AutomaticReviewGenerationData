[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained"

[3] "For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron precursor."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The literature primarily discusses two synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites: solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, and conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as the iron precursor. The ferrocene method, followed by severe calcination, is reported to exhibit superior performance for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Key performance metrics mentioned include:

1. Propylene yield: A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% was obtained with the ferrocene method.

2. Turnover frequency: A high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1 was achieved.

3. Stability: With a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2, the catalyst maintained a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 for over 40 hours.

The literature does not provide comparative data for the FeCl3 method or other synthesis techniques like steam treatment or liquid exchange. It also doesn't explicitly discuss N2O conversion or C3H6 selectivity, though these could potentially be inferred from the provided data.

该文献主要讨论了两种合成含铁ZSM-5沸石的方法：使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换法，以及使用FeCl3作为铁前体的常规固态离子交换法。据报道，二茂铁法经过严格煅烧后，在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出优异的性能。

提到的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯产率：使用二茂铁法可获得30%的最大初始丙烯产率。

2. 转化频率：达到了0.037 s-1的高转化频率。

3. 稳定性：在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的条件下，催化剂可以在40多小时内保持稳定的丙烷转化率（约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1）和丙烯生产率（约6 mmol gcat-1 h-1）。

文献没有提供FeCl3法或其他合成技术（如蒸汽处理或液体交换）的对比数据。它也没有明确讨论N2O转化率或C3H6选择性，尽管这些可能从所提供的数据中推断出来。
