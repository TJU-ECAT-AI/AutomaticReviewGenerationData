          [1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with FeAlSi and FeSi frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al  H and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al = 37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to the procedure described above."

[4] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K."

[5] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[6] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%."

[7] "Steam-activated commercial H-ZSM-5, containing 220 ppm Fe, showed a rather low but measurable activity at 723 and 773 K, with propene yields < 10% and traces of propionaldehyde."

          The literature primarily focuses on steam-activated FeMFI zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Three synthesis methods are discussed:

1. Steam activation: Applied to all samples, including isomorphously substituted zeolites and commercial zeolites. The process involved calcination and treatment with 30 vol.% H2O in N2 flow at 873 K for 5 hours.

2. Isomorphous substitution: Used to create FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31, 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al ≈ ∞, 0.68 wt.% Fe) frameworks.

3. Commercial zeolite modification: NH4-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 37.5, 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed.

Key performance metrics for the ODHP reaction include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Ranged from 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature.
2. N2O conversion: Ranged from 45% to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
4. C3H6 yield: Up to 24% at 798 K for steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5.

The steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showed higher propene selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite at similar propane conversion levels. The commercial H-ZSM-5 (220 ppm Fe) showed lower activity, with propene yields below 10%.

These results suggest that the steam activation process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, particularly for those with higher iron content. The isomorphously substituted zeolites (Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) performed better than the modified commercial zeolite, indicating that the synthesis method and iron content play crucial roles in determining catalytic effectiveness.

          这篇文献主要关注蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。讨论了三种合成方法：

1. 蒸汽活化：应用于所有样品，包括同晶取代的沸石和商业沸石。该过程包括在873 K下用30体积%的H2O在N2流中煅烧和处理5小时。

2. 同晶取代：用于创建FeZSM-5（Si/Al = 31，0.67 wt.% Fe）和Fe-硅石（Si/Al ≈ ∞，0.68 wt.% Fe）骨架。

3. 商业沸石改性：NH4-ZSM-5（Si/Al = 37.5，220 ppm Fe）经过煅烧和蒸汽处理。

ODHP反应的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：范围从30%到52%，随温度升高而增加。
2. N2O转化率：范围从45%到95%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
3. C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从59%下降到44%。
4. C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5在798 K时最高可达24%。

在相似的丙烷转化水平下，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5比Fe-硅石显示出更高的丙烯选择性。商业H-ZSM-5（220 ppm Fe）显示出较低的活性，丙烯产率低于10%。

这些结果表明，蒸汽活化过程显著提高了含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能，特别是对于那些铁含量较高的沸石。同晶取代的沸石（Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅石）比改性的商业沸石表现更好，表明合成方法和铁含量在决定催化效果方面起着关键作用。
