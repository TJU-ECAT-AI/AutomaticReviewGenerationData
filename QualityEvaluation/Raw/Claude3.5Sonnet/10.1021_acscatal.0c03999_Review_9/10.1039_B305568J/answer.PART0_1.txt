[1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with Fe–Al–Si and Fe–Si frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min−1 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding Fe–ZSM-5 (Si/ Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al ≈ ∞ and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al = 37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to the procedure described above."

[4] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K. At similar degrees of propane conversion, the propene selectivity over Fe–ZSM-5 was higher than over Fe-silicalite."

[5] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[6] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%."

[7] "Steam-activated commercial H-ZSM-5, containing 220 ppm Fe, showed a rather low but measurable activity at 723 and 773 K, with propene yields < 10% and traces of propionaldehyde."

The literature discusses three synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites: steam activation, isomorphous substitution, and commercial zeolite modification. The steam activation process was applied to all samples, including the commercial one.

Key performance metrics for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Ranged from 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature.
2. N2O conversion: Ranged from 45% to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
4. C3H6 yield: Up to 24% at 798 K for steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5.

The steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showed higher propene selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite at similar propane conversion levels. The commercial H-ZSM-5 (220 ppm Fe) showed lower activity, with propene yields below 10%.

These results suggest that the steam activation process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, particularly for those with higher iron content. The isomorphously substituted zeolites (Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) performed better than the modified commercial zeolite, indicating that the synthesis method and iron content play crucial roles in determining catalytic effectiveness.

文献讨论了三种含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法：蒸汽活化、同晶取代和商业沸石改性。蒸汽活化过程应用于所有样品，包括商业样品。

N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：范围从30%到52%，随温度升高而增加。
2. N2O转化率：范围从45%到95%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
3. C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从59%下降到44%。
4. C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5在798 K时最高可达24%。

在相似的丙烷转化水平下，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5比Fe-硅酸盐显示出更高的丙烯选择性。商业H-ZSM-5（220 ppm Fe）显示出较低的活性，丙烯产率低于10%。

这些结果表明，蒸汽活化过程显著提高了含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能，特别是对于那些铁含量较高的沸石。同晶取代的沸石（Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅酸盐）比改性的商业沸石表现更好，表明合成方法和铁含量在决定催化效果方面起着关键作用。
