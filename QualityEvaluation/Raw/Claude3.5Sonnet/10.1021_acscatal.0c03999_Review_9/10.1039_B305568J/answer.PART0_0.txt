[1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with FeAlSi and FeSi frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al  H and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al = 37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to the procedure described above."

[4] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K."

[5] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[6] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%."

The literature primarily focuses on steam-activated FeMFI zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various synthesis methods, it does offer insights into the performance of steam-activated catalysts:

1. Synthesis: The study used steam activation for both isomorphously substituted zeolites (FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) and commercial NH4-ZSM-5. The steam activation process involved calcination and treatment with 30 vol.% H2O in N2 flow at 873 K for 5 hours.

2. Catalytic Performance:
- C3H8 conversion: Ranged from about 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
- N2O conversion: Ranged from about 45% to 95%, also increasing with temperature and contact time.
- C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from about 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
- C3H6 yield: Reached as high as 24% at 798 K.

The steam-activated FeMFI zeolites showed high efficiency in the ODHP reaction, with initial propene yields comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo oxides using O2 as the oxidant. The study also noted that FeZSM-5 performed slightly better than Fe-silicalite in terms of activity and selectivity.

While the paper doesn't directly compare different synthesis methods, it suggests that the steam activation process is effective in creating catalysts with high performance in the ODHP reaction using N2O as the oxidant.

这篇文献主要关注蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。虽然它没有提供各种合成方法的全面比较，但确实提供了蒸汽活化催化剂性能的见解：

1. 合成：研究使用蒸汽活化处理同形取代的沸石（FeZSM-5和Fe-硅石）和商业NH4-ZSM-5。蒸汽活化过程包括在873 K下用30体积%的H2O在N2流中煅烧和处理5小时。

2. 催化性能：
- C3H8转化率：范围从约30%到52%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
- N2O转化率：范围从约45%到95%，也随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
- C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从约59%下降到44%。
- C3H6产率：在798 K时达到高达24%。

蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在ODHP反应中表现出高效率，初始丙烯产率可与使用O2作为氧化剂的基于V和Mo氧化物的最先进催化剂相媲美。研究还指出，FeZSM-5在活性和选择性方面的表现略优于Fe-硅石。

虽然这篇论文没有直接比较不同的合成方法，但它表明蒸汽活化过程能有效制备出在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP反应中具有高性能的催化剂。
