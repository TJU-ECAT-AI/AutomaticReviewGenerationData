[1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with FeAlSi and FeSi frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al  H and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K. At similar degrees of propane conversion, the propene selectivity over FeZSM-5 was higher than over Fe-silicalite."

[4] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[5] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%."

The literature primarily discusses steam-activated FeMFI zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key synthesis method mentioned is steam activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites at 873 K for 5 hours, yielding FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite.

Performance metrics for these catalysts include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Ranged from about 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature.
2. N2O conversion: Ranged from about 45% to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from about 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
4. C3H6 yield: Reached as high as 24% at 798 K.

FeZSM-5 showed higher propene selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite at similar degrees of propane conversion. The study does not directly compare steam treatment to other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

这篇文献主要讨论了蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。主要提到的合成方法是在873 K下对同质异构替换的沸石进行5小时的蒸汽活化，得到FeZSM-5和Fe-硅石。

这些催化剂的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：范围从约30%到52%，随温度升高而增加。
2. N2O转化率：范围从约45%到95%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
3. C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从约59%降低到44%。
4. C3H6收率：在798 K时达到最高24%。

在相似的丙烷转化程度下，FeZSM-5表现出比Fe-硅石更高的丙烯选择性。这项研究没有直接比较蒸汽处理与其他合成方法（如固态离子交换或液体交换）在ODHP反应中对含铁ZSM-5沸石的影响。
