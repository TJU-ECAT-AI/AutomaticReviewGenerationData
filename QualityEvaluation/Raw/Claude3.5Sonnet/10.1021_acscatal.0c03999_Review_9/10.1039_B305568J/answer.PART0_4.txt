[1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with FeAlSi and FeSi frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al  H and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al = 37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to the procedure described above."

[4] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K. At similar degrees of propane conversion, the propene selectivity over FeZSM-5 was higher than over Fe-silicalite."

[5] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[6] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%. Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) was the main oxygenate formed, with yields up to 6%."

The literature mainly discusses steam-activated FeMFI zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite. The synthesis method described involves calcination and steam activation of isomorphously substituted zeolites. The key performance metrics reported include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Ranged from about 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature.
2. N2O conversion: Ranged from about 45% to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from about 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
4. C3H6 yield: Reached as high as 24% at 798 K.

FeZSM-5 showed higher propene selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite at similar degrees of propane conversion. The steam-activated catalysts also produced propionaldehyde as the main oxygenate, with yields up to 6%.

The study does not provide direct comparisons between different synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange. However, it demonstrates that the steam activation method produces catalysts effective for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

这篇文献主要讨论了蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石,特别是FeZSM-5和Fe-硅铁矿。所描述的合成方法包括同晶取代沸石的煅烧和蒸汽活化。报告的关键性能指标包括:

1. C3H8转化率:范围从约30%到52%,随温度升高而增加。
2. N2O转化率:范围从约45%到95%,随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
3. C3H6选择性:随着丙烷转化率的增加,从约59%降至44%。
4. C3H6收率:在798 K时高达24%。

在相似的丙烷转化程度下,FeZSM-5表现出比Fe-硅铁矿更高的丙烯选择性。蒸汽活化的催化剂还产生丙醛作为主要含氧化合物,收率高达6%。

这项研究没有直接比较不同的合成方法,如固态离子交换或液体交换。然而,它证明了蒸汽活化方法可以生产出对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应有效的催化剂。
