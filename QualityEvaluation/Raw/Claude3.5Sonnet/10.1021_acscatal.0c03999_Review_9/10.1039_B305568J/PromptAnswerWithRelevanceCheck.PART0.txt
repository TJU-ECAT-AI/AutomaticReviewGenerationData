The literature primarily focuses on steam-activated FeMFI zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various synthesis methods, it does offer insights into the performance of steam-activated catalysts:

1. Synthesis: The study used steam activation for both isomorphously substituted zeolites (FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) and commercial NH4-ZSM-5. The steam activation process involved calcination and treatment with 30 vol.% H2O in N2 flow at 873 K for 5 hours.

2. Catalytic Performance:
- C3H8 conversion: Ranged from about 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
- N2O conversion: Ranged from about 45% to 95%, also increasing with temperature and contact time.
- C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from about 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
- C3H6 yield: Reached as high as 24% at 798 K.

The steam-activated FeMFI zeolites showed high efficiency in the ODHP reaction, with initial propene yields comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo oxides using O2 as the oxidant. The study also noted that FeZSM-5 performed slightly better than Fe-silicalite in terms of activity and selectivity.

While the paper doesn't directly compare different synthesis methods, it suggests that the steam activation process is effective in creating catalysts with high performance in the ODHP reaction using N2O as the oxidant.

这篇文献主要关注蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。虽然它没有提供各种合成方法的全面比较，但确实提供了蒸汽活化催化剂性能的见解：

1. 合成：研究使用蒸汽活化处理同形取代的沸石（FeZSM-5和Fe-硅石）和商业NH4-ZSM-5。蒸汽活化过程包括在873 K下用30体积%的H2O在N2流中煅烧和处理5小时。

2. 催化性能：
- C3H8转化率：范围从约30%到52%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
- N2O转化率：范围从约45%到95%，也随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
- C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从约59%下降到44%。
- C3H6产率：在798 K时达到高达24%。

蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在ODHP反应中表现出高效率，初始丙烯产率可与使用O2作为氧化剂的基于V和Mo氧化物的最先进催化剂相媲美。研究还指出，FeZSM-5在活性和选择性方面的表现略优于Fe-硅石。

虽然这篇论文没有直接比较不同的合成方法，但它表明蒸汽活化过程能有效制备出在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP反应中具有高性能的催化剂。

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with Fe–Al–Si and Fe–Si frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min−1 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding Fe–ZSM-5 (Si/ Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al ≈ ∞ and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

The literature discusses three synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites: steam activation, isomorphous substitution, and commercial zeolite modification. The steam activation process was applied to all samples, including the commercial one.

Key performance metrics for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Ranged from 30% to 52%, increasing with temperature.
2. N2O conversion: Ranged from 45% to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreased from 59% to 44% as propane conversion increased.
4. C3H6 yield: Up to 24% at 798 K for steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5.

The steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showed higher propene selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite at similar propane conversion levels. The commercial H-ZSM-5 (220 ppm Fe) showed lower activity, with propene yields below 10%.

These results suggest that the steam activation process significantly enhances the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, particularly for those with higher iron content. The isomorphously substituted zeolites (Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) performed better than the modified commercial zeolite, indicating that the synthesis method and iron content play crucial roles in determining catalytic effectiveness.

文献讨论了三种含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法：蒸汽活化、同晶取代和商业沸石改性。蒸汽活化过程应用于所有样品，包括商业样品。

N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：范围从30%到52%，随温度升高而增加。
2. N2O转化率：范围从45%到95%，随温度和接触时间的增加而增加。
3. C3H6选择性：随着丙烷转化率的增加，从59%下降到44%。
4. C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5在798 K时最高可达24%。

在相似的丙烷转化水平下，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5比Fe-硅酸盐显示出更高的丙烯选择性。商业H-ZSM-5（220 ppm Fe）显示出较低的活性，丙烯产率低于10%。

这些结果表明，蒸汽活化过程显著提高了含铁ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能，特别是对于那些铁含量较高的沸石。同晶取代的沸石（Fe-ZSM-5和Fe-硅酸盐）比改性的商业沸石表现更好，表明合成方法和铁含量在决定催化效果方面起着关键作用。
