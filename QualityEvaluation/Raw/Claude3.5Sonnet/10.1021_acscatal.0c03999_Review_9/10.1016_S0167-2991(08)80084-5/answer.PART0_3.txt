[1] "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1μm) was dried at 150°C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone."

[2] "After 12 h of mixing, excess of the solution was removed, the solid was dried at room temperature and heated under vacuum at 350°C for 4 h. A sample was washed with distilled water and dried in an air at room temperature. Then, the remaining organic species in the Fe-zeolites was removed by calcination at 450°C in air for 10 h."

[3] "The produced catalysts contain 0.6 wt% of Fe. This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites or their effects on ODHP performance. The document focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts rather than Fe-ZSM-5. It describes a single preparation method involving liquid ion exchange with FeCl3 in acetyl acetone, followed by vacuum heating and calcination. The study does not provide information on steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange methods.

The literature does not provide comprehensive performance metrics for ODHP reactions under different conditions for various synthesis methods. It mainly compares catalyst performance based on particle size (micro vs. nano) and N2O concentration, rather than synthesis method.

To fully answer the question, additional information on Fe-ZSM-5 synthesis methods and their impact on ODHP performance would be needed.

该文献并未直接比较铁含量ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法或它们对ODHP性能的影响。该文档主要关注Fe-BEA催化剂，而非Fe-ZSM-5。它描述了一种单一的制备方法，涉及乙酰丙酮中FeCl3的液相离子交换，随后进行真空加热和煅烧。该研究未提供关于蒸汽处理或固态离子交换方法的信息。

该文献没有提供不同条件下各种合成方法的ODHP反应的全面性能指标。它主要基于颗粒大小（微米vs纳米）和N2O浓度来比较催化剂性能，而非合成方法。

要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的关于Fe-ZSM-5合成方法及其对ODHP性能影响的信息。
