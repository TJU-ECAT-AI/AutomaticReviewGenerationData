[1] "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1μm) was dried at 150°C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone. After 12 h of mixing, excess of the solution was removed, the solid was dried at room temperature and heated under vacuum at 350°C for 4 h."

[2] "This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

[3] "Catalytic Oxidative DeHydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) by N2O over Fe-BEA catalysts has been studied in continuous feed regime against time and with periodic changing of in-let feed composition under reaction-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The nano-sized catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation in comparison with micro-sized one."

The literature does not specifically discuss various synthesis methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, or liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. Instead, it focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts prepared by a liquid-phase ion exchange method using FeCl3 in acetyl acetone solution. 

The study compares micro-sized (1 μm) and nano-sized (300 nm) Fe-BEA catalysts in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics mentioned include propylene yield, propane conversion, N2O conversion, and propylene selectivity.

The nano-sized Fe-BEA catalyst showed superior performance in propylene formation compared to the micro-sized catalyst, especially at higher temperatures. This suggests that particle size is a crucial factor in catalyst effectiveness for the ODHP reaction.

The study also examined the effects of N2O concentration and reaction-regeneration cycles on catalyst performance, but did not compare different synthesis methods for iron incorporation into the zeolite structure.

该文献并未具体讨论蒸汽处理、固态离子交换或液相交换等不同合成方法对铁含量ZSM-5沸石的影响。相反，它主要关注使用乙酰丙酮溶液中的FeCl3通过液相离子交换法制备的Fe-BEA催化剂。

研究比较了微米级(1 μm)和纳米级(300 nm) Fe-BEA催化剂在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的表现。提到的关键性能指标包括丙烯产率、丙烷转化率、N2O转化率和丙烯选择性。

纳米级Fe-BEA催化剂在丙烯生成方面表现出优于微米级催化剂的性能，尤其是在较高温度下。这表明粒子尺寸是影响ODHP反应催化剂效能的一个关键因素。

研究还考察了N2O浓度和反应-再生循环对催化剂性能的影响，但并未比较将铁引入沸石结构的不同合成方法。
