[1] "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1m) was dried at 150 C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone."

[2] "This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

[3] "The ODHP was investigated using feeds containing 1.5 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-1), 3 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-2), or 1.5 vol % N2O and 1.5 vol % C3H8, 0.2 vol % O2 (regime RS-3)."

[4] "Increase in N2O concentration resulted in the same propene yields but increased the N2O conversion and decreased the selectivity toward propylene."

The document does not specifically discuss various synthesis methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, or liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. Instead, it focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts prepared by mixing dried BEA zeolite with FeCl3 in acetyl acetone solution. 

The key performance metrics mentioned include propane conversion, N2O conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield. The study found that increasing N2O concentration increased N2O conversion but decreased propylene selectivity, while maintaining similar propylene yields. The document does not provide specific numerical values for these metrics under different reaction conditions for the synthesis method used.

It's important to note that this study does not directly compare different synthesis methods, but rather focuses on the effects of particle size and reaction conditions on the performance of Fe-BEA catalysts prepared using a single method.

该文档并未具体讨论铁含量ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽处理、固态离子交换或液体交换等各种合成方法。相反，它主要关注通过将干燥的BEA沸石与乙酰丙酮溶液中的FeCl3混合制备的Fe-BEA催化剂。

提到的关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率。研究发现，增加N2O浓度会提高N2O转化率，但降低丙烯选择性，同时保持相似的丙烯产率。文档没有提供在不同反应条件下使用这种合成方法的具体数值指标。

需要注意的是，这项研究并未直接比较不同的合成方法，而是专注于粒径和反应条件对使用单一方法制备的Fe-BEA催化剂性能的影响。
