[1] "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1μm) was dried at 150°C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone. After 12 h of mixing, excess of the solution was removed, the solid was dried at room temperature and heated under vacuum at 350°C for 4 h."

[2] "This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]. Two types of catalysts were prepared, Fe-BEA with a particle size of 1 μm (Fe/m-BEA) and Fe-BEA with particle size of 300 nm (Fe/n-BEA)."

[3] "Figures 1 shows the catalytic performance of the Fe-BEA catalysts in the temperature range of 250-550°C. It is clear from the figure that propylene yield depends on particle size of the parent BEA zeolite."

[4] "Nevertheless, comparison of the performance of the catalysts with different particle sizes shown clearly that at higher temperatures the Fe-BEA with nano crystal size display improved catalytic activity as well as propylene yields (see Fig. 1)."

The provided literature does not directly compare various synthesis methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Instead, it focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts prepared by a specific method involving liquid exchange.

The study describes a preparation method using FeCl3 in acetyl acetone solution, which introduces iron predominantly into cationic sites. The key performance metric discussed is propylene yield, which is shown to depend on the particle size of the parent BEA zeolite.

The literature compares two types of Fe-BEA catalysts: one with a particle size of 1 μm (Fe/m-BEA) and another with a particle size of 300 nm (Fe/n-BEA). The results indicate that the nano-sized Fe-BEA catalyst (Fe/n-BEA) exhibits improved catalytic activity and propylene yields at higher temperatures compared to the micro-sized catalyst (Fe/m-BEA).

While the study does not provide specific data on C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, and C3H6 selectivity for different synthesis methods, it does emphasize the importance of particle size in determining catalyst performance for the ODHP reaction.

提供的文献并没有直接比较蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换等各种合成方法对含铁ZSM-5分子筛在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能的影响。相反，它主要关注使用液体交换法制备的Fe-BEA催化剂。

研究描述了一种使用乙酰丙酮溶液中的FeCl3的制备方法，该方法主要将铁引入阳离子位点。讨论的主要性能指标是丙烯收率，结果表明丙烯收率取决于母体BEA分子筛的粒子尺寸。

文献比较了两种类型的Fe-BEA催化剂：一种粒径为1μm（Fe/m-BEA），另一种粒径为300nm（Fe/n-BEA）。结果表明，在较高温度下，纳米尺寸的Fe-BEA催化剂（Fe/n-BEA）表现出更好的催化活性和丙烯收率，相比于微米尺寸的催化剂（Fe/m-BEA）。

虽然研究没有提供不同合成方法的C3H8转化率、N2O转化率和C3H6选择性的具体数据，但它确实强调了粒子尺寸在决定ODHP反应催化剂性能方面的重要性。
