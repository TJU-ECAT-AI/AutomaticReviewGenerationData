[1] "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1m) was dried at 150 C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone."

[2] "This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

[3] "The nano-sized catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation in comparison with micro-sized one."

[4] "Increase in the propylene yield indicated over nano-BEA could be probably attributed to the enhancement of the mass transfer of the product in the zeolite porous structure or better utilization of the zeolite channels by the reactant molecules."

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Instead, it focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts prepared by a single method involving mixing with FeCl3 in acetyl acetone solution. This method introduces iron primarily into cationic sites.

The study compares the performance of Fe-BEA catalysts with different particle sizes (micro vs. nano) rather than different synthesis methods. The nano-sized catalyst shows better performance in propylene formation compared to the micro-sized catalyst. This improved performance is attributed to enhanced mass transfer and better utilization of zeolite channels by reactant molecules.

The literature does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics (C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) for different synthesis methods. It mainly discusses the effects of particle size, N2O concentration, and regeneration on catalyst performance.

To fully answer the question about various synthesis methods and their influence on catalytic performance in ODHP, additional research focusing specifically on ZSM-5 zeolites and different iron incorporation techniques would be necessary.

该文献并未直接比较不同合成方法对铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能影响。相反，它主要关注通过单一方法制备的Fe-BEA催化剂，该方法涉及与乙酰丙酮溶液中的FeCl3混合。这种方法主要将铁引入阳离子位点。

研究比较了不同粒径（微米级vs纳米级）的Fe-BEA催化剂的性能，而非不同的合成方法。纳米级催化剂在丙烯生成方面表现出更好的性能，相比于微米级催化剂。这种性能改善归因于质量传递的增强和反应分子对沸石通道的更好利用。

文献没有提供不同合成方法的具体定量性能指标（C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6得率）。它主要讨论了粒径、N2O浓度和再生对催化剂性能的影响。

要全面回答关于各种合成方法及其对ODHP催化性能影响的问题，需要进行额外的研究，特别关注ZSM-5沸石和不同的铁引入技术。
