          The provided literature does not contain information specifically comparing the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by different methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on a steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst but does not compare it to other synthesis methods.

          However, the document does provide some key performance metrics for the steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst in the ODHP reaction:

          1. C3H8 conversion: Initial conversions of 40-50% were reported in the temperature range of 673-773 K.
          2. N2O conversion: Initial conversions ranged from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 K and 773 K.
          3. C3H6 selectivity: Around 46% selectivity was mentioned at 723 K.
          4. C3H6 yield: Initial yields of 20-25% were achieved at 723-773 K.

          The catalyst showed high initial activity but experienced strong deactivation due to coke formation. Performance could be restored through regeneration by air treatment, allowing for a cyclic process to be developed for continuous propylene production.

          Additional observations:
          - The catalyst performance was affected by temperature, reaction time, and the presence of O2 in the reaction mixture.
          - Addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture was detrimental to propene selectivity.

          提供的文献中没有具体比较通过蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换等不同方法合成的含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。文档主要关注蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5催化剂，但没有与其他合成方法进行比较。

          然而，文档确实提供了蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂在ODHP反应中的一些关键性能指标：

          1. C3H8转化率：在673-773 K温度范围内，初始转化率为40-50%。
          2. N2O转化率：初始转化率在673 K时为76%，在723 K和773 K时达到100%。
          3. C3H6选择性：在723 K时提到约46%的选择性。
          4. C3H6产率：在723-773 K时达到20-25%的初始产率。

          该催化剂表现出很高的初始活性，但由于焦炭形成而出现强烈的失活。通过空气处理再生可以恢复性能，从而开发出一个用于连续丙烯生产的循环过程。

          其他观察结果：
          - 催化剂性能受温度、反应时间和反应混合物中O2存在与否的影响。
          - 向C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2对丙烯选择性有不利影响。
