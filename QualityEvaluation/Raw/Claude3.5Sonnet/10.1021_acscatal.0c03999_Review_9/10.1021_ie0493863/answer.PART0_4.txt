The literature does not contain specific information comparing the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by different methods (steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, liquid exchange) for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on a steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst but does not compare it to other synthesis methods. 

However, the literature does provide some key performance metrics for the steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst in the ODHP reaction:

- C3H8 conversion: Initial conversions of 40-50% were reported in the temperature range of 673-773 K.
- N2O conversion: Initial conversions ranged from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 K and 773 K.
- C3H6 selectivity: Around 46% selectivity was mentioned at 723 K.
- C3H6 yield: Initial yields of 20-25% were achieved at 723-773 K.

The document emphasizes that the steam-activated FeZSM-5 showed high initial activity but suffered from rapid deactivation due to coke formation. The performance could be restored through regeneration, allowing for a cyclic process to be developed for continuous propylene production.

该文献并未包含比较不同方法(蒸汽处理、固态离子交换、液体交换)合成的含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的具体信息。文档主要关注蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5催化剂,但没有与其他合成方法进行比较。

然而,文献确实提供了蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂在ODHP反应中的一些关键性能指标:

- C3H8转化率:在673-773 K温度范围内,初始转化率为40-50%。
- N2O转化率:初始转化率在673 K时为76%,在723 K和773 K时达到100%。
- C3H6选择性:在723 K时提到约46%的选择性。
- C3H6收率:在723-773 K时达到20-25%的初始收率。

文档强调,蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5表现出很高的初始活性,但由于焦炭形成而迅速失活。通过再生可以恢复性能,从而开发出一个用于连续丙烯生产的循环过程。
