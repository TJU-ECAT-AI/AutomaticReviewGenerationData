The literature does not provide information on how different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The text focuses on the performance of a specific steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst, but does not compare it to other synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange. The key performance metrics mentioned (C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) are discussed for the steam-activated FeZSM-5, but not in relation to different synthesis methods. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

文献没有提供不同合成方法如何影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能的信息。文本主要集中于一种特定的蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂的性能,但没有将其与其他合成方法(如固态离子交换或液体交换)进行比较。文中提到的关键性能指标(C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率)仅针对蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5进行了讨论,而没有与不同的合成方法联系起来。因此,根据给定的文献无法全面回答这个问题。
