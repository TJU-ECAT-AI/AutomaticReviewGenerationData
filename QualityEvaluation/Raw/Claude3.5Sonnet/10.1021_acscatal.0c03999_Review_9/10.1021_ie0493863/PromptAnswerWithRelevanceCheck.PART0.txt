The provided literature does not contain information specifically comparing the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by different methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on a steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst but does not compare it to other synthesis methods. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based on the given information.

However, the document does provide some details on the performance of steam-activated FeZSM-5 in the ODHP reaction:

1. Initial propene yields of 20-25% were achieved at 723-773 K.

2. N2O conversion increased from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 and 773 K.

3. C3H8 conversion increased from 40% at 673 K to 50% at 723 K and 773 K.

4. The catalyst showed strong deactivation due to coke formation but could be regenerated by air treatment.

5. Addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture was detrimental to propene selectivity.

These performance metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of steam-activated FeZSM-5 under different reaction conditions, but a comparison with other synthesis methods is not provided in the given literature.

提供的文献中没有具体比较通过蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换等不同方法合成的含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。文档主要关注蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5催化剂，但没有与其他合成方法进行比较。因此，基于给定的信息无法完全回答这个问题。

然而，文档确实提供了一些关于蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在ODHP反应中性能的详细信息：

1. 在723-773 K温度下，初始丙烯产率达到20-25%。

2. N2O转化率从673 K时的76%增加到723 K和773 K时的100%。

3. C3H8转化率从673 K时的40%增加到723 K和773 K时的50%。

4. 催化剂由于积炭而表现出强烈的失活，但可以通过空气处理进行再生。

5. 向C3H8+N2O混合物中添加少量O2对丙烯选择性有不利影响。

这些性能指标展示了蒸汽活化FeZSM-5在不同反应条件下的有效性，但在给定的文献中没有提供与其他合成方法的比较。

The literature does not provide specific information about different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on the performance of a specific steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst rather than comparing various synthesis methods. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the given information.

However, the document does provide some relevant performance metrics for the steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst in the ODHP reaction:

1. C3H8 conversion: Initially around 40-50% at temperatures between 673-773 K.
2. N2O conversion: Initially 76% at 673 K, reaching 100% at 723 K and 773 K.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Around 46% (calculated from initial C3H6 yield and C3H8 conversion at 723 K).
4. C3H6 yield: Initial yields of 20-25% at 723-773 K, with a maximum of 25% achieved at 723 K after a short activation period.

These metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalyst under different reaction conditions, particularly in the temperature range of 673-773 K. The catalyst shows high initial activity but experiences deactivation due to coke formation over time.

该文献没有提供关于不同合成方法对含铁ZSM-5分子筛在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能影响的具体信息。文档主要关注特定的蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂的性能,而不是比较各种合成方法。因此,无法根据给定信息直接回答这个问题。

然而,文档确实提供了蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂在ODHP反应中的一些相关性能指标:

1. C3H8转化率:在673-773 K温度范围内,初始转化率约为40-50%。
2. N2O转化率:在673 K时初始转化率为76%,在723 K和773 K时达到100%。
3. C3H6选择性:约46%(根据723 K时的初始C3H6产率和C3H8转化率计算)。
4. C3H6产率:在723-773 K时初始产率为20-25%,在723 K经过短暂的活化期后达到最高25%。

这些指标展示了蒸汽活化FeZSM-5催化剂在不同反应条件下的有效性,特别是在673-773 K的温度范围内。该催化剂显示出较高的初始活性,但随时间推移会因焦炭形成而发生失活。

4. C3H6 selectivity of around 46% (in the absence of O2).

The document also mentions that the catalyst performance is affected by temperature, reaction time, and the presence of O2 in the reaction mixture. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these metrics for different synthesis methods of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites.

- C3H6 selectivity: Around 46% selectivity was mentioned at 723 K.
- C3H6 yield: Initial yields of 20-25% were achieved at 723-773 K.

The document emphasizes that the steam-activated FeZSM-5 showed high initial activity but suffered from rapid deactivation due to coke formation. The performance could be restored through regeneration, allowing for a cyclic process to be developed for continuous propylene production.

文档强调,蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5表现出很高的初始活性,但由于焦炭形成而迅速失活。通过再生可以恢复性能,从而开发出一个用于连续丙烯生产的循环过程。
