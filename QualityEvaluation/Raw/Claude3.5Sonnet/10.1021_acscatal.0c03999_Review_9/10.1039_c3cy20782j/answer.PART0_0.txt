[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

The study focuses on FeMFI catalysts prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, followed by acid post-treatments. This method shows promising results for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The key performance metrics reported are:

1. Propylene yield: The initial FeMFI catalyst achieved a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. After acid post-treatments, the yield increased to about 25%.

2. Reaction temperature: The optimal reaction temperature was 673 K.

The study does not directly compare different synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange. However, it suggests that acid post-treatments significantly improve catalyst performance by creating more active iron species. The researchers propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species, formed during acid treatment, are more active for ODHP than oligonuclear iron species.

While specific data on propane conversion, N2O conversion, and propylene selectivity are not provided in the given excerpts, the substantial increase in propylene yield suggests improvements in these metrics as well.

这项研究主要关注通过还原溶液离子交换法制备的FeMFI催化剂，并进行酸后处理。这种方法在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中显示出了有前景的结果。

报告的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯产率：初始FeMFI催化剂在673 K下达到了约14%的最大丙烯产率。经过酸后处理后，产率增加到约25%。

2. 反应温度：最佳反应温度为673 K。

该研究没有直接比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等不同的合成方法。但是，研究表明酸后处理通过创造更多活性铁物种显著改善了催化剂性能。研究人员提出，在酸处理过程中形成的骨架外FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种比寡聚核铁物种对ODHP更具活性。

虽然给出的摘录中没有提供关于丙烷转化率、N2O转化率和丙烯选择性的具体数据，但丙烯产率的显著增加表明这些指标也有所改善。
