[3] "Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

The study focuses on FeMFI catalysts prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, followed by acid post-treatments. This method shows promising results for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The key performance metrics reported are:

1. Propylene yield: The initial FeMFI catalyst achieved a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. After acid post-treatments, the yield increased to about 25%.

2. Reaction temperature: The optimal reaction temperature was 673 K.

The study does not directly compare different synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange. However, it suggests that acid post-treatments significantly improve catalyst performance by creating more active iron species. The researchers propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species, formed during acid treatment, are more active for ODHP than oligonuclear iron species.

While specific data on propane conversion, N2O conversion, and propylene selectivity are not provided in the given excerpts, the substantial increase in propylene yield suggests improvements in these metrics as well.

这项研究主要关注通过还原溶液离子交换法制备的FeMFI催化剂，并进行酸后处理。这种方法在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中显示出了有前景的结果。

报告的关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯产率：初始FeMFI催化剂在673 K下达到了约14%的最大丙烯产率。经过酸后处理后，产率增加到约25%。

2. 反应温度：最佳反应温度为673 K。

该研究没有直接比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等不同的合成方法。但是，研究表明酸后处理通过创造更多活性铁物种显著改善了催化剂性能。研究人员提出，在酸处理过程中形成的骨架外FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种比寡聚核铁物种对ODHP更具活性。

虽然给出的摘录中没有提供关于丙烷转化率、N2O转化率和丙烯选择性的具体数据，但丙烯产率的显著增加表明这些指标也有所改善。

The study primarily focuses on FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent acid post-treatments. This method produces an active catalyst for ODHP with nitrous oxide, achieving a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. Acid post-treatments further improve the catalyst's performance, gradually increasing the maximum propylene yield to about 25%.

The synthesis method influences the nature and distribution of iron species in the zeolite, which in turn affects catalytic performance. Reductive solution ion-exchange introduces extra-framework iron species, resulting in ferric ions with different nuclearity (isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles). Acid post-treatments cause migration of iron species and formation of extra-framework FeOAl species.

The key performance metrics mentioned are propylene yield, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. The study suggests that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide compared to oligonuclear iron species.

While the study doesn't directly compare different synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange, it demonstrates that the combination of reductive solution ion-exchange and acid post-treatments can significantly improve catalyst performance in the ODHP reaction.

提到的关键性能指标包括丙烯产率、丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。研究表明，与寡聚铁物种相比，骨架外FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种对N2O辅助丙烷脱氢反应更具活性。

虽然该研究没有直接比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等不同的合成方法，但它证明了还原性溶液离子交换和酸后处理的组合可以显著提高催化剂在ODHP反应中的性能。

The literature mainly discusses the preparation of FeMFI catalysts by reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent acid post-treatments, rather than comparing various synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange. However, it does provide insights into how liquid exchange and acid post-treatments influence catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange shows activity for ODHP with nitrous oxide, achieving a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. Acid post-treatments significantly improve the catalyst's performance, gradually increasing the maximum propylene yield to about 25%.

Key performance metrics discussed include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Increases with rising reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K.
2. N2O conversion: Increases from 0 to 100% as reaction temperature rises.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreases with increasing reaction temperature.
4. C3H6 yield: Shows a volcano-shaped curve with a maximum at 673 K.

Acid post-treatments enhance both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, thereby promoting the overall ODHP reaction with nitrous oxide. The study demonstrates that modifying the synthesis method through acid post-treatments can significantly improve the catalyst's effectiveness in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

该文献主要讨论了通过还原性溶液离子交换和随后的酸后处理制备FeMFI催化剂，而不是比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等各种合成方法。然而，它确实提供了关于液相交换和酸后处理如何影响N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能的见解。

通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI显示出对N2O辅助ODHP反应的活性，在673 K时达到约14%的最大丙烯产率。酸后处理显著改善了催化剂的性能，将最大丙烯产率逐步提高到约25%。

讨论的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：随着反应温度从573 K升至773 K而增加。
2. N2O转化率：随着反应温度的升高从0增加到100%。
3. C3H6选择性：随着反应温度的升高而降低。
4. C3H6产率：在673 K时显示出火山形曲线的最大值。

酸后处理提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，从而促进了整体N2O辅助ODHP反应。研究表明，通过酸后处理修改合成方法可以显著改善催化剂在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的有效性。

The literature discusses the influence of liquid ion exchange and acid post-treatment synthesis methods on the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 (FeMFI) in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

For FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, a maximal propylene yield of about 14% was obtained at 673 K. Acid post-treatments significantly improved the catalytic activity, gradually increasing the maximal propylene yield to about 25%.

The key performance metrics discussed include propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene yield, and nitrous oxide conversion. As the reaction temperature increased from 573 to 773 K, propane conversion increased while propylene selectivity decreased, resulting in a volcano-shaped plot for propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Nitrous oxide conversion increased from 0 to 100% with increasing temperature.

Acid post-treatments enhanced both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, thereby promoting the ODHP reaction with nitrous oxide. The study demonstrates that the synthesis method, particularly the use of acid post-treatments, can significantly influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

对于通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI，在673 K下获得了约14%的最大丙烯产率。酸后处理显著提高了催化活性，最大丙烯产率逐步增加到约25%。

讨论的关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性、丙烯产率和一氧化二氮转化率。随着反应温度从573 K升高到773 K，丙烷转化率增加而丙烯选择性降低，导致丙烯产率呈现火山形曲线，在673 K达到最大值。一氧化二氮转化率随温度升高从0增加到100%。

酸后处理既提高了丙烷转化率又提高了丙烯选择性，从而促进了一氧化二氮辅助的ODHP反应。这项研究表明，合成方法，特别是酸后处理的使用，可以显著影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能。
