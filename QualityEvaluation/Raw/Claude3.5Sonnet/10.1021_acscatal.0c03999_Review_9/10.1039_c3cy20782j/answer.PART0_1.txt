[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "For FeMFI, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K, resulting in a volcano plot of propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Meanwhile, the nitrous oxide conversion increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature."

The study primarily focuses on FeMFI catalysts prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, followed by acid post-treatments. This method shows promising results for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Key performance metrics include:

1. Propylene yield: The initial FeMFI catalyst achieves a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. After acid post-treatments, this yield increases to about 25%.

2. Temperature effects: Propane conversion increases and propylene selectivity decreases as reaction temperature rises from 573 K to 773 K. The propylene yield shows a maximum at 673 K.

3. N2O conversion: It increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature.

The study does not directly compare different synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange. However, it demonstrates that acid post-treatments significantly improve the catalytic performance of FeMFI in the ODHP reaction, suggesting that modifying the synthesis method can greatly influence catalyst effectiveness.

这项研究主要关注通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI催化剂，随后进行酸后处理。这种方法在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中显示出有前景的结果。

关键性能指标包括：

1. 丙烯收率：初始FeMFI催化剂在673 K时达到最大丙烯收率约14%。经过酸后处理后，这一收率增加到约25%。

2. 温度效应：随着反应温度从573 K升高到773 K，丙烷转化率增加，而丙烯选择性降低。丙烯收率在673 K时达到最大值。

3. N2O转化率：随着反应温度的升高，从0增加到100%。

这项研究没有直接比较不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理或固态离子交换。然而，它表明酸后处理显著改善了FeMFI在ODHP反应中的催化性能，这表明改变合成方法可以极大地影响催化剂的有效性。
