[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "For FeMFI, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K, resulting in a volcano plot of propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Meanwhile, the nitrous oxide conversion increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature."

[4] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI enhance both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity to some extent, and therefore, promote the ODHP with nitrous oxide."

The literature discusses the influence of liquid ion exchange and acid post-treatment synthesis methods on the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 (FeMFI) in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

For FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, a maximal propylene yield of about 14% was obtained at 673 K. Acid post-treatments significantly improved the catalytic activity, gradually increasing the maximal propylene yield to about 25%.

The key performance metrics discussed include propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene yield, and nitrous oxide conversion. As the reaction temperature increased from 573 to 773 K, propane conversion increased while propylene selectivity decreased, resulting in a volcano-shaped plot for propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Nitrous oxide conversion increased from 0 to 100% with increasing temperature.

Acid post-treatments enhanced both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, thereby promoting the ODHP reaction with nitrous oxide. The study demonstrates that the synthesis method, particularly the use of acid post-treatments, can significantly influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

该文献讨论了液相离子交换和酸后处理合成方法对铁含量ZSM-5（FeMFI）在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能的影响。

对于通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI，在673 K下获得了约14%的最大丙烯产率。酸后处理显著提高了催化活性，最大丙烯产率逐步增加到约25%。

讨论的关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性、丙烯产率和一氧化二氮转化率。随着反应温度从573 K升高到773 K，丙烷转化率增加而丙烯选择性降低，导致丙烯产率呈现火山形曲线，在673 K达到最大值。一氧化二氮转化率随温度升高从0增加到100%。

酸后处理既提高了丙烷转化率又提高了丙烯选择性，从而促进了一氧化二氮辅助的ODHP反应。这项研究表明，合成方法，特别是酸后处理的使用，可以显著影响铁含量ZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的催化性能。
