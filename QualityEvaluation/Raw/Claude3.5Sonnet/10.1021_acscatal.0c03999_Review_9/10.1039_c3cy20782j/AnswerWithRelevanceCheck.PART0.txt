          [1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "For FeMFI, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K, resulting in a volcano plot of propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Meanwhile, the nitrous oxide conversion increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature."

[4] "Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

[5] "Through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt, extra-framework iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host."

[6] "Characterization results reveal that ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are formed in FeMFI after reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent calcination."

          The study primarily focuses on the synthesis of iron-containing ZSM-5 (FeMFI) catalysts through reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent acid post-treatments. While it doesn't directly compare various synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange, it provides insights into how liquid exchange and acid post-treatments influence catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Key findings include:

1. Synthesis method: FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange introduces extra-framework iron species, resulting in ferric ions with different nuclearity (isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles).

2. Acid post-treatments: These significantly improve catalyst performance, increasing the maximum propylene yield from about 14% to 25%.

3. Active species: Extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are proposed to be more active for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide compared to oligonuclear iron species.

Key performance metrics include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Increases with rising reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K.
2. N2O conversion: Increases from 0 to 100% as reaction temperature rises.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreases with increasing reaction temperature.
4. C3H6 yield: Shows a volcano-shaped curve with a maximum at 673 K, reaching up to 25% after acid post-treatments.

The study demonstrates that modifying the synthesis method through acid post-treatments can significantly improve the catalyst's effectiveness in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

          这项研究主要关注通过还原性溶液离子交换和随后的酸后处理合成铁含量ZSM-5（FeMFI）催化剂。虽然没有直接比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等各种合成方法，但它提供了关于液相交换和酸后处理如何影响N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中催化性能的见解。

主要发现包括：

1. 合成方法：通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI引入了骨架外铁物种，形成不同核数的铁离子（孤立离子、寡聚簇和Fe2O3纳米粒子）。

2. 酸后处理：这显著改善了催化剂性能，将最大丙烯产率从约14%提高到25%。

3. 活性物种：建议骨架外FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种比寡聚铁物种对N2O辅助丙烷脱氢反应更具活性。

关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：随着反应温度从573 K升至773 K而增加。
2. N2O转化率：随着反应温度的升高从0增加到100%。
3. C3H6选择性：随着反应温度的升高而降低。
4. C3H6产率：在673 K时显示出火山形曲线的最大值，经过酸后处理后可达25%。

研究表明，通过酸后处理修改合成方法可以显著改善催化剂在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的有效性。
