[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "Through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt, extra-framework iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host."

[4] "Characterization results reveal that ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are formed in FeMFI after reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent calcination."

[5] "Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

The study primarily focuses on FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent acid post-treatments. This method produces an active catalyst for ODHP with nitrous oxide, achieving a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. Acid post-treatments further improve the catalyst's performance, gradually increasing the maximum propylene yield to about 25%.

The synthesis method influences the nature and distribution of iron species in the zeolite, which in turn affects catalytic performance. Reductive solution ion-exchange introduces extra-framework iron species, resulting in ferric ions with different nuclearity (isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles). Acid post-treatments cause migration of iron species and formation of extra-framework FeOAl species.

The key performance metrics mentioned are propylene yield, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. The study suggests that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide compared to oligonuclear iron species.

While the study doesn't directly compare different synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange, it demonstrates that the combination of reductive solution ion-exchange and acid post-treatments can significantly improve catalyst performance in the ODHP reaction.

该研究主要关注通过还原性溶液离子交换法制备的FeMFI及其后续酸处理。这种方法生产了一种用于N2O辅助ODHP反应的活性催化剂，在673 K时可获得约14%的最大丙烯产率。酸后处理进一步提高了催化剂的性能，使最大丙烯产率逐渐增加到约25%。

合成方法影响沸石中铁物种的性质和分布，从而影响催化性能。还原性溶液离子交换引入了骨架外铁物种，形成不同核数的铁离子（孤立离子、寡聚簇和Fe2O3纳米粒子）。酸后处理导致铁物种迁移和骨架外FeOAl物种的形成。

提到的关键性能指标包括丙烯产率、丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。研究表明，与寡聚铁物种相比，骨架外FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种对N2O辅助丙烷脱氢反应更具活性。

虽然该研究没有直接比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等不同的合成方法，但它证明了还原性溶液离子交换和酸后处理的组合可以显著提高催化剂在ODHP反应中的性能。
