[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

[2] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

[3] "For FeMFI, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K, resulting in a volcano plot of propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Meanwhile, the nitrous oxide conversion increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature."

[4] "Acid post-treatments on FeMFI enhance both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity to some extent, and therefore, promote the ODHP with nitrous oxide."

The literature mainly discusses the preparation of FeMFI catalysts by reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent acid post-treatments, rather than comparing various synthesis methods like steam treatment or solid-state ion exchange. However, it does provide insights into how liquid exchange and acid post-treatments influence catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange shows activity for ODHP with nitrous oxide, achieving a maximum propylene yield of about 14% at 673 K. Acid post-treatments significantly improve the catalyst's performance, gradually increasing the maximum propylene yield to about 25%.

Key performance metrics discussed include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Increases with rising reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K.
2. N2O conversion: Increases from 0 to 100% as reaction temperature rises.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Decreases with increasing reaction temperature.
4. C3H6 yield: Shows a volcano-shaped curve with a maximum at 673 K.

Acid post-treatments enhance both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, thereby promoting the overall ODHP reaction with nitrous oxide. The study demonstrates that modifying the synthesis method through acid post-treatments can significantly improve the catalyst's effectiveness in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

该文献主要讨论了通过还原性溶液离子交换和随后的酸后处理制备FeMFI催化剂，而不是比较蒸汽处理或固态离子交换等各种合成方法。然而，它确实提供了关于液相交换和酸后处理如何影响N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能的见解。

通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI显示出对N2O辅助ODHP反应的活性，在673 K时达到约14%的最大丙烯产率。酸后处理显著改善了催化剂的性能，将最大丙烯产率逐步提高到约25%。

讨论的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：随着反应温度从573 K升至773 K而增加。
2. N2O转化率：随着反应温度的升高从0增加到100%。
3. C3H6选择性：随着反应温度的升高而降低。
4. C3H6产率：在673 K时显示出火山形曲线的最大值。

酸后处理提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，从而促进了整体N2O辅助ODHP反应。研究表明，通过酸后处理修改合成方法可以显著改善催化剂在N2O辅助ODHP反应中的有效性。
