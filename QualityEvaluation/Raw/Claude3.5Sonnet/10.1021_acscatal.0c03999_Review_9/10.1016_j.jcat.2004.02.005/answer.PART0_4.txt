[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[3] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K"

[4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30–40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

The literature primarily discusses steam treatment as a synthesis method for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites used in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam activation is shown to be crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance compared to calcined zeolites. The steam treatment generates extraframework iron species responsible for the ODHP reaction.

Key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of steam-activated Fe-zeolites include:

1. High initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K
2. Higher propene yield compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA zeolites with lower iron content
3. Improved conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites

The study does not provide detailed information on solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods for comparison. However, it does mention that liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been applied in ODHP with N2O, achieving propene yields close to 20% over Fe-ZSM-5.

While initial performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites is superior, the study notes that residual activities after 400 minutes on stream were similar between synthesized Fe-zeolites and commercial zeolites, indicating potential deactivation issues that require further investigation.

这篇文献主要讨论了蒸汽处理作为一种合成含铁ZSM-5沸石的方法，用于N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应。研究表明，蒸汽活化对于获得比煅烧沸石更优越的催化性能至关重要。蒸汽处理产生了负责ODHP反应的骨架外铁物种。

证明蒸汽活化Fe-沸石有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. 在723 K下初始丙烯产率高达25%
2. 与铁含量较低的商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA沸石相比，丙烯产率更高
3. 与煅烧沸石相比，丙烷和N2O的转化率得到改善

该研究没有提供固态离子交换或液体交换方法的详细信息以供比较。然而，它确实提到液体离子交换的M-ZSM-5沸石（M = Fe, Co, Mn）已被应用于N2O辅助的ODHP反应，Fe-ZSM-5的丙烯产率接近20%。

虽然蒸汽活化Fe-沸石的初始性能优越，但研究指出，在反应400分钟后，合成的Fe-沸石和商业沸石的残余活性相似，这表明存在潜在的失活问题，需要进一步研究。
