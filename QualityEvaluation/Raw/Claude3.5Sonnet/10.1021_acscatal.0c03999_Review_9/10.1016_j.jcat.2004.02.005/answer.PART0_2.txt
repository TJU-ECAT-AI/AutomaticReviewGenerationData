[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

The study primarily focuses on steam-activated iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Steam activation is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance. Steamed zeolites showed significantly higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites.

2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA structures) demonstrated high efficiency in the ODHP reaction, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coke formation.

3. The initial propene yield over steam-activated FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was notably higher than commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite the latter having 30-40 times lower iron content. Interestingly, after 400 minutes on stream, the residual activities were similar.

4. Liquid-ion exchanged Fe-ZSM-5 has also been reported to be effective, with propene yields close to 20%.

Key performance metrics mentioned include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The study doesn't provide comprehensive comparisons between different synthesis methods, but emphasizes the superiority of steam-activated iron-containing zeolites for this reaction.

该研究主要关注蒸汽活化的含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。主要发现如下：

1. 蒸汽活化对于获得高催化性能至关重要。经蒸汽处理的沸石显示出明显高于煅烧沸石的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。

2. 蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA结构）在ODHP反应中表现出高效性，在723 K下初始丙烯产率可达25%。然而，它们会因焦炭形成而失活。

3. 蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率明显高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管后者的铁含量低30-40倍。有趣的是，在反应400分钟后，残余活性相似。

4. 液相离子交换的Fe-ZSM-5也被报道具有良好效果，丙烯产率接近20%。

提到的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。该研究没有对不同合成方法进行全面比较，但强调了蒸汽活化含铁沸石在该反应中的优越性。
