The literature discusses several synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in N2O-assisted ODHP:

1. Steam treatment: This method is highlighted as essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (both MFI and BEA structures) show significantly higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites. They achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

2. Liquid-ion exchange: M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) prepared by liquid-ion exchange have been applied in ODHP with N2O, with Fe-ZSM-5 showing propene yields close to 20%.

3. Solid-state ion exchange: While not explicitly mentioned for ZSM-5, the study compares performance of different zeolite structures and preparations.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

- C3H8 conversion: Similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, around 45% initially.
- N2O conversion: Complete (100%) for steam-activated iron zeolites initially.
- C3H6 selectivity: Around 50% for steam-activated iron zeolites.
- C3H6 yield: Up to 25% for steam-activated Fe-zeolites at 723 K.

The study notes that initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite host (MFI vs BEA), acidic properties, or iron content. However, steam activation was crucial, as exemplified by the large difference in propene yields between calcined and steam-activated Fe-silicalite (5% vs 22%, respectively).

文献讨论了几种铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助ODHP催化性能的影响：

1. 蒸汽处理：这种方法被强调为获得优越催化性能的关键。蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（包括MFI和BEA结构）相比于煅烧沸石，显示出明显更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。它们在723 K下能达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。

2. 液相离子交换：通过液相离子交换制备的M-ZSM-5沸石（M = Fe, Co, Mn）已应用于N2O辅助的ODHP反应，其中Fe-ZSM-5显示出接近20%的丙烯产率。

3. 固相离子交换：虽然没有明确提到ZSM-5，但研究比较了不同沸石结构和制备方法的性能。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

- C3H8转化率：蒸汽活化的铁沸石初始转化率相似，约为45%。
- N2O转化率：蒸汽活化的铁沸石初始转化率完全（100%）。
- C3H6选择性：蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为50%。
- C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在723 K下高达25%。

研究指出，蒸汽活化的铁沸石的初始转化率和选择性相当相似，不受沸石宿主（MFI vs BEA）、酸性质或铁含量的影响。然而，蒸汽活化至关重要，这从煅烧和蒸汽活化的Fe-硅铝酸盐的丙烯产率差异巨大（分别为5%和22%）可以看出。

1. Steam activation: This method is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performances. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (both MFI and BEA structures) show much higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites.

2. Hydrothermal synthesis followed by steam activation: This method produces efficient catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

3. Liquid-ion exchange: Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by this method have shown propene yields close to 20% in ODHP with N2O.

The key performance metrics mentioned in the literature include:

- C3H8 conversion
- N2O conversion
- C3H6 selectivity
- C3H6 yield

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites generally show high initial performance in these metrics, with propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they tend to deactivate due to coke formation over time.

The literature also notes that synthesized Fe-zeolites (with higher iron content) show remarkably higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA. However, after 400 minutes on stream, the residual activities become similar, suggesting that the initial iron content affects the initial performance but not necessarily the long-term stability.

文献讨论了几种含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响：

1. 蒸汽活化：这种方法对于获得优异的催化性能至关重要。经蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（包括MFI和BEA结构）比煅烧的沸石表现出更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。

2. 水热合成后进行蒸汽活化：这种方法可以生产出高效的N2O介导ODHP催化剂，在723 K下初始丙烯产率可达25%。

3. 液相离子交换：通过这种方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石在N2O介导的ODHP反应中表现出接近20%的丙烯产率。

文献中提到的关键性能指标包括：

- C3H8转化率
- N2O转化率
- C3H6选择性
- C3H6产率

蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石通常在这些指标上表现出较高的初始性能，在723 K下丙烯产率可达25%。然而，它们随时间推移会因积碳而失活。

文献还指出，合成的Fe-沸石（铁含量较高）比商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA表现出明显更高的初始丙烯产率。但是，在反应400分钟后，残余活性变得相似，这表明初始铁含量影响初始性能，但不一定影响长期稳定性。
