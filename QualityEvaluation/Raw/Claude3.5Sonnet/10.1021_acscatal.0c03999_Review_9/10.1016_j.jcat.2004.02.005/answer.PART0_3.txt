[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Steam activation: This method is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performances. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (both MFI and BEA structures) show much higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites.

2. Hydrothermal synthesis followed by steam activation: This method produces efficient catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

3. Liquid-ion exchange: Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by this method have shown propene yields close to 20% in ODHP with N2O.

The key performance metrics mentioned in the literature include:

- C3H8 conversion
- N2O conversion
- C3H6 selectivity
- C3H6 yield

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites generally show high initial performance in these metrics, with propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they tend to deactivate due to coke formation over time.

The literature also notes that synthesized Fe-zeolites (with higher iron content) show remarkably higher initial propene yields compared to commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA. However, after 400 minutes on stream, the residual activities become similar, suggesting that the initial iron content affects the initial performance but not necessarily the long-term stability.

文献讨论了几种含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响：

1. 蒸汽活化：这种方法对于获得优异的催化性能至关重要。经蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（包括MFI和BEA结构）比煅烧的沸石表现出更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。

2. 水热合成后进行蒸汽活化：这种方法可以生产出高效的N2O介导ODHP催化剂，在723 K下初始丙烯产率可达25%。

3. 液相离子交换：通过这种方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石在N2O介导的ODHP反应中表现出接近20%的丙烯产率。

文献中提到的关键性能指标包括：

- C3H8转化率
- N2O转化率
- C3H6选择性
- C3H6产率

蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石通常在这些指标上表现出较高的初始性能，在723 K下丙烯产率可达25%。然而，它们随时间推移会因积碳而失活。

文献还指出，合成的Fe-沸石（铁含量较高）比商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA表现出明显更高的初始丙烯产率。但是，在反应400分钟后，残余活性变得相似，这表明初始铁含量影响初始性能，但不一定影响长期稳定性。
