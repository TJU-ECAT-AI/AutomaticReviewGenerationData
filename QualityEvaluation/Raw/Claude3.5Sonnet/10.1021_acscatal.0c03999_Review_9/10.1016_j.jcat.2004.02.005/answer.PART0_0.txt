[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30–40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

The literature primarily discusses steam activation of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Steam activation is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performance. Steamed zeolites show significantly higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites.

2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA structures) are efficient catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP, achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

3. The initial propene yield over steam-activated FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was much higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite the latter having 30-40 times lower iron content.

4. Liquid-ion exchanged Fe-ZSM-5 has also been reported to achieve propene yields close to 20% in ODHP with N2O.

The key performance metrics mentioned include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. While the document doesn't provide comprehensive comparisons between different synthesis methods, it emphasizes the effectiveness of steam activation for improving catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

该文献主要讨论了铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的蒸汽活化。主要发现包括：

1. 蒸汽活化对于获得优越的催化性能至关重要。蒸汽处理后的沸石显示出比煅烧沸石明显更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。

2. 蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA结构）是N2O介导的ODHP的高效催化剂，在723 K下可达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。

3. 蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率远高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管后者的铁含量低30-40倍。

4. 液相离子交换的Fe-ZSM-5也被报道在N2O介导的ODHP反应中可以达到接近20%的丙烯产率。

提到的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。虽然文档没有提供不同合成方法之间的全面比较，但它强调了蒸汽活化对提高ODHP反应中催化性能的有效性。
