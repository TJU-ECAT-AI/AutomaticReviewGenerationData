[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

[4] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."

[5] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in N2O-assisted ODHP:

1. Steam treatment: This method is highlighted as essential for achieving superior catalytic performance. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (both MFI and BEA structures) show significantly higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites. They achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K.

2. Liquid-ion exchange: M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) prepared by liquid-ion exchange have been applied in ODHP with N2O, with Fe-ZSM-5 showing propene yields close to 20%.

3. Solid-state ion exchange: While not explicitly mentioned for ZSM-5, the study compares performance of different zeolite structures and preparations.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

- C3H8 conversion: Similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, around 45% initially.
- N2O conversion: Complete (100%) for steam-activated iron zeolites initially.
- C3H6 selectivity: Around 50% for steam-activated iron zeolites.
- C3H6 yield: Up to 25% for steam-activated Fe-zeolites at 723 K.

The study notes that initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite host (MFI vs BEA), acidic properties, or iron content. However, steam activation was crucial, as exemplified by the large difference in propene yields between calcined and steam-activated Fe-silicalite (5% vs 22%, respectively).

文献讨论了几种铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助ODHP催化性能的影响：

1. 蒸汽处理：这种方法被强调为获得优越催化性能的关键。蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（包括MFI和BEA结构）相比于煅烧沸石，显示出明显更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。它们在723 K下能达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。

2. 液相离子交换：通过液相离子交换制备的M-ZSM-5沸石（M = Fe, Co, Mn）已应用于N2O辅助的ODHP反应，其中Fe-ZSM-5显示出接近20%的丙烯产率。

3. 固相离子交换：虽然没有明确提到ZSM-5，但研究比较了不同沸石结构和制备方法的性能。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

- C3H8转化率：蒸汽活化的铁沸石初始转化率相似，约为45%。
- N2O转化率：蒸汽活化的铁沸石初始转化率完全（100%）。
- C3H6选择性：蒸汽活化的铁沸石约为50%。
- C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在723 K下高达25%。

研究指出，蒸汽活化的铁沸石的初始转化率和选择性相当相似，不受沸石宿主（MFI vs BEA）、酸性质或铁含量的影响。然而，蒸汽活化至关重要，这从煅烧和蒸汽活化的Fe-硅铝酸盐的丙烯产率差异巨大（分别为5%和22%）可以看出。
