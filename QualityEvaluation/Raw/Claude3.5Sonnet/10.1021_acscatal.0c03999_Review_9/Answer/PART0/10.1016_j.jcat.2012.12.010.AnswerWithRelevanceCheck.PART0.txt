          "The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C resulted in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

"The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration of Brnsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (1619%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (912%)."

"The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."

"The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

"Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

"The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation"

"The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization."

"The TOS analysis of conversion of propane, yields of propene and CO/CO2, and relative consumption of N2O and character of deposits formed compared over FeH- and steamed Fe(H)-zeolites (Fig. 6 and Table 8) showed detrimental effect of the high concentration of Brnsted sites on the propene yield and a decrease in propane conversion."

          The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly steam treatment, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. 

Steam treatment at 600°C dramatically changes the structure and distribution of iron species in the zeolite:
1. Non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contains high concentrations of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), with smaller amounts of mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (16-19%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (9-12%).
2. Steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5 has low concentrations of both Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, with Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in FeAAlASi extra-framework species (43-47%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (30-33%) prevailing.

The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these catalysts include:
1. C3H8 conversion
2. N2O conversion
3. C3H6 selectivity
4. C3H6 yield

Steamed Fe-zeolites show higher and more stable yields of propene compared to non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5. This is primarily due to the lower concentration of protonic sites in steamed zeolites, which limits propene oligomerization. High concentrations of Brønsted acid sites in non-steamed zeolites had a detrimental effect on propene yield and propane conversion over time.

The reaction mechanism involves propane hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)-O complex, followed by dehydration to propene. Further transformations can occur over acid sites, leading to oligomers, aromatics, and carbon oxides.

Steam treatment improves overall catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction by modifying the Fe species structure and reducing acid site concentration. It also results in lower rates of catalyst deactivation.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods, it emphasizes the importance of the synthesis method, particularly steam treatment, in determining the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction.

          含铁ZSM-5分子筛的合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。

600°C下的蒸汽处理显著改变了分子筛中铁物种的结构和分布：
1. 未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5含有高浓度的Brønsted酸性位和主要为裸露的Fe(II)离子（72%），以及少量的单核和双核Fe(III)（16-19%）和寡聚Fe(III)-氧物种（9-12%）。
2. 经蒸汽处理的Fe(H)-ZSM-5中Brønsted酸性位和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度较低，以四面体配位的Fe(III)离子为主，这些离子存在于FeAAlASi骨架外物种（43-47%）和Fe氧化物类颗粒（30-33%）中。

展示这些催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：
1. C3H8转化率
2. N2O转化率
3. C3H6选择性
4. C3H6收率

经蒸汽处理的Fe-分子筛相比未经蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5表现出更高且更稳定的丙烯收率。这主要是由于经蒸汽处理的分子筛中质子位点浓度较低，限制了丙烯的寡聚反应。未经蒸汽处理的分子筛中高浓度的Brønsted酸性位随时间对丙烯产率和丙烷转化率产生了不利影响。

反应机理涉及丙烷在Fe(III)-O络合物上羟基化为丙醇，然后脱水生成丙烯。进一步的转化可能在酸性位点上发生，导致生成寡聚物、芳香族化合物和碳氧化物。

蒸汽处理通过修改Fe物种结构和降低酸位浓度，改善了ODHP反应中的整体催化性能。它还降低了催化剂的失活速率。

虽然研究没有明确讨论固态离子交换或液体交换方法，但它强调了合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，在决定Fe-ZSM-5分子筛在ODHP反应中的催化性能方面的重要性。
