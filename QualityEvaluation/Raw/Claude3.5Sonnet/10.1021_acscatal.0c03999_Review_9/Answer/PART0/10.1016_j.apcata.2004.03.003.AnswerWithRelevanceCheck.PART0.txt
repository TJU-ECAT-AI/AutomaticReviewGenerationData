          [1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde."

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

[4] "The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites. The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the catalytic performance as compared to extraframework isolated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite."

[5] "When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 min."

          The literature primarily focuses on steam-activated iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. While it doesn't directly compare various synthesis methods such as solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange, it provides insights into the performance of steam-activated catalysts.

Key findings:
1. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites, particularly ex-FeZSM-5, are highly efficient catalysts for this reaction.
2. Ex-FeZSM-5 outperforms ex-Fe-silicalite in terms of activity, selectivity, and resistance to coking deactivation.

Key performance metrics:
- C3H8 conversion: 52% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs 26% for ex-Fe-silicalite
- N2O conversion: 86% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs 49% for ex-Fe-silicalite
- C3H6 yield: 22% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs 16.5% for ex-Fe-silicalite
- Propionaldehyde yield: 5.5% for ex-FeZSM-5 vs 3.6% for ex-Fe-silicalite

The superior performance of ex-FeZSM-5 is attributed to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which are more catalytically active than the isolated iron ions found in ex-Fe-silicalite. This highlights the importance of iron species distribution in determining catalytic performance.

Both catalysts experience deactivation due to coke formation over time but can recover their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes.

While the study doesn't directly address how different synthesis methods influence catalytic performance, it emphasizes the crucial role of the steam activation process in creating the desired iron species distribution for effective ODHP catalysis.

          这项研究主要关注蒸汽活化的含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的应用。虽然它没有直接比较各种合成方法（如固态离子交换或液体交换），但提供了关于蒸汽活化催化剂性能的见解。

主要发现：
1. 蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石，特别是ex-FeZSM-5，是该反应的高效催化剂。
2. Ex-FeZSM-5在活性、选择性和抗结焦失活方面优于ex-Fe-硅酸盐。

关键性能指标：
- C3H8转化率：ex-FeZSM-5为52%，ex-Fe-硅酸盐为26%
- N2O转化率：ex-FeZSM-5为86%，ex-Fe-硅酸盐为49%
- C3H6产率：ex-FeZSM-5为22%，ex-Fe-硅酸盐为16.5%
- 丙醛产率：ex-FeZSM-5为5.5%，ex-Fe-硅酸盐为3.6%

Ex-FeZSM-5的优异性能归因于寡核FexOy簇的存在，这些簇比在ex-Fe-硅酸盐中发现的孤立铁离子具有更高的催化活性。这突出了铁物种分布在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

两种催化剂随时间推移都会因积碳而失活，但在773 K下经氧气处理30分钟后可恢复初始活性。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论不同合成方法如何影响催化性能，但它强调了蒸汽活化过程在创造有效ODHP催化所需的铁物种分布方面的关键作用。
