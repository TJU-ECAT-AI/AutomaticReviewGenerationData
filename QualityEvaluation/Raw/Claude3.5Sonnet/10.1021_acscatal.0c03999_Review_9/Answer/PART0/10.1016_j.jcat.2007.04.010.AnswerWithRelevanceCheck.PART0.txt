          [1] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."

[2] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

[3] "The propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16 to 2% during the first 40 min on stream). In contrast, FeGa-st displayed remarkable performance, and the propylene yield was stable for a relatively long period on stream even if large amounts of coke were formed on the sample [Y(C3H6) = 22% and Ccoke = 13 wt% after 80 min]."

[4] "Previous studies by some of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke deposition [11]."

[5] "The reduced Brnsted acidity in these samples due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ (M3+ = Fe, Ga, Al) groups on high-temperature steam treatment and the presence of (limited) mesoporosity also have been identified as possible reasons for the decreased deactivation."

          The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The study compares three different synthesis methods: steam activation (FeGa-st and FeGe-st) and liquid ion exchange (FeAl-lie).

Key performance metrics include:

1. C3H8 conversion: FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6 selectivity: 40-50% for all three catalysts
3. Initial C3H6 yield: FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
4. Stability: FeGa-st showed the most stable performance, maintaining a high propylene yield (22%) even after 80 minutes on stream.

The steam-activated FeGa-st catalyst demonstrated the best overall performance, with the highest initial propylene yield and excellent stability. This superior performance is attributed to:
1. A higher number of active iron centers for ODHP
2. Increased resistance to deactivation by coke deposition
3. Reduced Brønsted acidity due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ groups during high-temperature steam treatment
4. The presence of limited mesoporosity

The liquid ion-exchanged FeAl-lie sample showed intermediate performance but experienced rapid deactivation. The steam-activated FeGe-st sample had the lowest initial performance among the three catalysts.

These results highlight the importance of the synthesis method in determining the catalytic properties of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for the ODHP reaction, with steam activation of FeGa-containing zeolites proving to be the most effective approach.

          铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法显著影响了它们在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。该研究比较了三种不同的合成方法：蒸汽活化(FeGa-st和FeGe-st)和液相离子交换(FeAl-lie)。

关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：FeGa-st (45%) > FeAl-lie (40%) > FeGe-st (19%)
2. C3H6选择性：三种催化剂均为40-50%
3. 初始C3H6产率：FeGa-st (21%) > FeAl-lie (16%) > FeGe-st (10%)
4. 稳定性：FeGa-st表现出最稳定的性能，即使在反应80分钟后仍保持较高的丙烯产率(22%)。

蒸汽活化的FeGa-st催化剂表现出最佳的整体性能，具有最高的初始丙烯产率和优秀的稳定性。这种卓越的性能归因于：
1. 更多的ODHP活性铁中心
2. 对焦炭沉积导致的失活具有更强的抵抗力
3. 由于高温蒸汽处理过程中SiOM3+基团的广泛水解，导致Brønsted酸性降低
4. 存在有限的介孔结构

液相离子交换的FeAl-lie样品表现出中等性能，但迅速失活。蒸汽活化的FeGe-st样品在三种催化剂中初始性能最低。

这些结果突出了合成方法在决定铁含量ZSM-5沸石用于ODHP反应的催化性能中的重要性，其中FeGa含量沸石的蒸汽活化证明是最有效的方法。
