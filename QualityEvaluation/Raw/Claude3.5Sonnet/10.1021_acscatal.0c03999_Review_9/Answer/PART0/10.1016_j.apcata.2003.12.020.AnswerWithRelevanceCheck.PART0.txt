          [1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed."

[2] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 °C."

[3] "The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments."

[4] "Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at 600 C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT). An increase in the activity was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus 55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0% versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites."

[5] "Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane conversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene yields."

[6] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high selectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1–C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%). Yield of propene is comparable to that one achieved with most active mixed metal oxides for propane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[7] "Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species."

          The study investigates various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key findings are:

1. Synthesis methods:
   - Steam treatment: Most effective method, especially at 600°C in water vapor flow.
   - Calcination: Less effective compared to steam treatment.
   - The study does not explicitly mention solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods.

2. Influence of synthesis methods:
   - Steam treatment extracts tetrahedrally coordinated Fe from the framework to cationic positions, forming various iron species including isolated ions and oligonuclear complexes.
   - This process significantly enhances catalytic activity.

3. Key performance metrics:
   - Propane conversion: Increased from 3.4% with oxygen to 43.5% with N2O for FeH-MFI-1200-HT (steamed at 600°C).
   - Propene selectivity: Increased from 44.0% to 55.9% when using N2O instead of oxygen.
   - Aromatics and oxygenates selectivity: Increased from 0% to 29.0% with N2O.
   - Best performing catalyst (steamed FeH-ZSM-5) achieved 44% propane conversion and 56% propene selectivity.

4. Reaction conditions:
   - N2O as oxidant: Dramatically increased propane conversion and improved selectivity towards propene and other valuable products.
   - Mixture of O2 and N2O: Increased propane conversion but decreased propene selectivity, without substantial changes in propene yields.

5. Factors affecting performance:
   - Fe content: Higher Fe content (up to 1200 ppm) generally led to improved catalytic performance.
   - Pre-treatment conditions: Steam treatment at 600°C was most effective.

In conclusion, steam treatment at 600°C of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Fe content (1200 ppm) proved to be the most effective synthesis method for enhancing catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction.

          该研究考察了含铁ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法及其对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响。主要发现包括：

1. 合成方法：
   - 蒸汽处理：最有效的方法，特别是在600°C水蒸气流中进行处理。
   - 煅烧：相比蒸汽处理效果较差。
   - 研究没有明确提及固态离子交换或液体交换方法。

2. 合成方法的影响：
   - 蒸汽处理将四面体配位的Fe从骨架提取到阳离子位置，形成各种铁物种，包括孤立离子和寡核络合物。
   - 这个过程显著提高了催化活性。

3. 关键性能指标：
   - 丙烷转化率：对于FeH-MFI-1200-HT（600°C蒸汽处理），从使用氧气时的3.4%增加到使用N2O时的43.5%。
   - 丙烯选择性：从使用氧气时的44.0%增加到使用N2O时的55.9%。
   - 芳烃和含氧化合物选择性：使用N2O时从0%增加到29.0%。
   - 性能最佳的催化剂（蒸汽处理的FeH-ZSM-5）达到44%的丙烷转化率和56%的丙烯选择性。

4. 反应条件：
   - 使用N2O作为氧化剂：显著提高丙烷转化率，改善对丙烯和其他有价值产物的选择性。
   - O2和N2O混合物：提高丙烷转化率但降低丙烯选择性，丙烯产率没有显著变化。

5. 影响性能的因素：
   - Fe含量：较高的Fe含量（最高1200 ppm）通常会导致更好的催化性能。
   - 预处理条件：600°C蒸汽处理最为有效。

总之，对高Fe含量（1200 ppm）的Fe-ZSM-5沸石进行600°C蒸汽处理被证明是最有效的合成方法，可以显著提高N2O辅助ODHP反应中的催化性能。
