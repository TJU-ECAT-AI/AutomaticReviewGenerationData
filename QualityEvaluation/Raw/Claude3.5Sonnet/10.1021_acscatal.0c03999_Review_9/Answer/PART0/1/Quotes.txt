[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and 30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K during 5 h."

          [2] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the different form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion."

          [3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

          [4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

[1] "Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites have been described elsewhere."

[2] "The isomorphously substituted zeolites, with FeAlSi and FeSi frameworks, were calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP) min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al  H and 0.68 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al = 37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to the procedure described above."

[4] "At all the temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with yields as high as 24% at 798 K."

[5] "N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to 95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed for C3H8 conversion."

[6] "The increase in propane conversion was accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59 to 44%."

[7] "Steam-activated commercial H-ZSM-5, containing 220 ppm Fe, showed a rather low but measurable activity at 723 and 773 K, with propene yields < 10% and traces of propionaldehyde."

[1] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."

[2] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

[3] "The propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16 to 2% during the first 40 min on stream). In contrast, FeGa-st displayed remarkable performance, and the propylene yield was stable for a relatively long period on stream even if large amounts of coke were formed on the sample [Y(C3H6) = 22% and Ccoke = 13 wt% after 80 min]."

[4] "Previous studies by some of us have tentatively attributed the outstanding performance of steam-activated MFI zeolites with FeGaSi and FeAlSi frameworks to a higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and/or to increased resistance toward deactivation by coke deposition [11]."

[5] "The reduced Brnsted acidity in these samples due to extensive hydrolysis of SiOM3+ (M3+ = Fe, Ga, Al) groups on high-temperature steam treatment and the presence of (limited) mesoporosity also have been identified as possible reasons for the decreased deactivation."

"Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1μm) was dried at 150°C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone."

"This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

"The ODHP was investigated using feeds containing 1.5 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-1), 3 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-2), or 1.5 vol % N2O and 1.5 vol % C3H8, 0.2 vol % O2 (regime RS-3)."

"Increase in N2O concentration resulted in the same propene yields but increased the N2O conversion and decreased the selectivity toward propylene."

"The nano-sized catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation in comparison with micro-sized one."

"Increase in the propylene yield indicated over nano-BEA could be probably attributed to the enhancement of the mass transfer of the product in the zeolite porous structure or better utilization of the zeolite channels by the reactant molecules."

[1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."

[2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[3] "The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP."

[4] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."

[5] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."

[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (30–1200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed."

[2] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 °C."

[3] "The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments."

[4] "Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at 600 C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT). An increase in the activity was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus 55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0% versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites."

[5] "Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane conversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene yields."

[6] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high selectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1–C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%). Yield of propene is comparable to that one achieved with most active mixed metal oxides for propane oxidative dehydrogenation."

[7] "Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species."

[4] "Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

[5] "Through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt, extra-framework iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host."

[6] "Characterization results reveal that ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are formed in FeMFI after reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent calcination."

[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation. These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation."

[2] "Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method, as studied in detail by Lobree et al. [25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clusters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species."

[3] "The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method. It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for N2O decomposition and ODH of propane with N2O of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31]."

[4] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."

"The steaming of FeH-zeolites at 600 C resulted in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."

"The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration of Brnsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III) (1619%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (912%)."

"The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."

"The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

"Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxylation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by immediate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to various oxygenates of polyolefins, and carbon oxides."

"The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation"

"The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization."

"The TOS analysis of conversion of propane, yields of propene and CO/CO2, and relative consumption of N2O and character of deposits formed compared over FeH- and steamed Fe(H)-zeolites (Fig. 6 and Table 8) showed detrimental effect of the high concentration of Brnsted sites on the propene yield and a decrease in propane conversion."

[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde."

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

[4] "The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites. The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the catalytic performance as compared to extraframework isolated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite."

[5] "When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 min."

[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30–40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

[5] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[6] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."

[7] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."

[1] "The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004).

[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."

[3] "Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

[4] "The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites. The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the catalytic performance as compared to extraframework isolated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite."

[5] "When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 min."

[1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30–40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

[5] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[6] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."

[7] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."
