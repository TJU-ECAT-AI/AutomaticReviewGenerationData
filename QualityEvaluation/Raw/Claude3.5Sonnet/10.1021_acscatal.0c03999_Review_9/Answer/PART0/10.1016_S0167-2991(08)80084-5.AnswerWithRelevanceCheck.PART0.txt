          "Fe-zeolites were prepared using the NH4 form of BEA Si/Al = 13.5. Parent BEA zeolite (average particle size of 300 nm or 1μm) was dried at 150°C for 4 h and then mixed with a solution of FeCl3 in acetyl acetone."

"This preparation procedure predominantly provides iron introduction into cationic sites [3]."

"The ODHP was investigated using feeds containing 1.5 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-1), 3 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-2), or 1.5 vol % N2O and 1.5 vol % C3H8, 0.2 vol % O2 (regime RS-3)."

"Increase in N2O concentration resulted in the same propene yields but increased the N2O conversion and decreased the selectivity toward propylene."

"The nano-sized catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation in comparison with micro-sized one."

"Increase in the propylene yield indicated over nano-BEA could be probably attributed to the enhancement of the mass transfer of the product in the zeolite porous structure or better utilization of the zeolite channels by the reactant molecules."

          The provided literature does not directly compare various synthesis methods like steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Instead, it focuses on Fe-BEA catalysts prepared by a specific method involving liquid exchange with FeCl3 in acetyl acetone solution.

The study compares two types of Fe-BEA catalysts: one with a particle size of 1 μm (micro-sized) and another with a particle size of 300 nm (nano-sized). The nano-sized Fe-BEA catalyst exhibits superior performance in propylene formation compared to the micro-sized catalyst. This improved performance is attributed to enhanced mass transfer and better utilization of zeolite channels by reactant molecules.

Key performance metrics mentioned include propylene yield, propane conversion, N2O conversion, and propylene selectivity. The study found that increasing N2O concentration increased N2O conversion but decreased propylene selectivity, while maintaining similar propylene yields.

While the study does not provide comprehensive data on C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, and C3H6 selectivity for different synthesis methods, it emphasizes the importance of particle size in determining catalyst performance for the ODHP reaction. To fully answer the question about various synthesis methods and their influence on catalytic performance in ODHP, additional research focusing specifically on ZSM-5 zeolites and different iron incorporation techniques would be necessary.

          提供的文献并未直接比较蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换等各种合成方法对含铁ZSM-5分子筛在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能的影响。相反，它主要关注使用乙酰丙酮溶液中的FeCl3进行液体交换的特定方法制备的Fe-BEA催化剂。

研究比较了两种类型的Fe-BEA催化剂：一种粒径为1μm（微米级），另一种粒径为300nm（纳米级）。纳米级Fe-BEA催化剂在丙烯生成方面表现出优于微米级催化剂的性能。这种性能改善归因于质量传递的增强和反应分子对沸石通道的更好利用。

提到的关键性能指标包括丙烯产率、丙烷转化率、N2O转化率和丙烯选择性。研究发现，增加N2O浓度会提高N2O转化率，但降低丙烯选择性，同时保持相似的丙烯产率。

虽然研究没有提供不同合成方法的C3H8转化率、N2O转化率和C3H6选择性的全面数据，但它确实强调了粒子尺寸在决定ODHP反应催化剂性能方面的重要性。要全面回答关于各种合成方法及其对ODHP催化性能影响的问题，需要进行额外的研究，特别关注ZSM-5沸石和不同的铁引入技术。
