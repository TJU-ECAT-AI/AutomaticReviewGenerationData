          [1] "Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances. The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites."

[2] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[3] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30–40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

[4] "Liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) have been recently applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O, and propene yields close to 20% were reported over Fe-ZSM-5"

[5] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[6] "The initial propene yields over c-Fe-silicalite and ex-Fe-silicalite largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."

[7] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."

          The literature discusses several synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites and their influence on catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction:

1. Steam activation: This method is crucial for achieving superior catalytic performances. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (both MFI and BEA structures) show significantly higher initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to calcined zeolites. They achieve initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The steam treatment generates extraframework iron species responsible for the ODHP reaction.

2. Liquid-ion exchange: M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M = Fe, Co, Mn) prepared by liquid-ion exchange have been applied in ODHP with N2O, with Fe-ZSM-5 showing propene yields close to 20%.

3. Calcination: While not explicitly discussed as a synthesis method, calcined zeolites are mentioned to have very low initial conversions of propane and N2O compared to steamed zeolites.

Key performance metrics demonstrating effectiveness include:

- C3H8 conversion: Similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite structure or iron content.
- N2O conversion: Higher for steam-activated zeolites compared to calcined ones.
- C3H6 selectivity: Similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite structure or iron content.
- C3H6 yield: Up to 25% for steam-activated Fe-zeolites at 723 K, around 20% for liquid-ion exchanged Fe-ZSM-5, and significantly lower for calcined zeolites (e.g., 5% for calcined Fe-silicalite vs 22% for steam-activated Fe-silicalite).

The study notes that initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar for steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the zeolite host (MFI vs BEA), acidic properties, or iron content. However, steam activation was crucial, as exemplified by the large difference in propene yields between calcined and steam-activated Fe-silicalite.

While initial performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites is superior, the study mentions that residual activities after 400 minutes on stream were similar between synthesized Fe-zeolites and commercial zeolites with lower iron content, indicating potential deactivation issues due to coke formation.

          文献讨论了几种含铁ZSM-5沸石的合成方法及其对N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中催化性能的影响：

1. 蒸汽活化：这种方法对于获得优异的催化性能至关重要。经蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（包括MFI和BEA结构）比煅烧的沸石表现出显著更高的丙烷和N2O初始转化率。它们在723 K下可达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。蒸汽处理产生了负责ODHP反应的骨架外铁物种。

2. 液相离子交换：通过液相离子交换制备的M-ZSM-5沸石（M = Fe, Co, Mn）已应用于N2O辅助的ODHP反应，其中Fe-ZSM-5显示出接近20%的丙烯产率。

3. 煅烧：虽然没有明确讨论作为合成方法，但提到煅烧的沸石与蒸汽处理的沸石相比，丙烷和N2O的初始转化率非常低。

证明有效性的关键性能指标包括：

- C3H8转化率：蒸汽活化的铁沸石相似，不受沸石结构或铁含量的影响。
- N2O转化率：蒸汽活化的沸石比煅烧的沸石更高。
- C3H6选择性：蒸汽活化的铁沸石相似，不受沸石结构或铁含量的影响。
- C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在723 K下高达25%，液相离子交换的Fe-ZSM-5约为20%，煅烧的沸石显著较低（例如，煅烧的Fe-硅铝酸盐为5%，而蒸汽活化的Fe-硅铝酸盐为22%）。

研究指出，蒸汽活化的铁沸石的初始转化率和选择性相当相似，不受沸石宿主（MFI vs BEA）、酸性质或铁含量的影响。然而，蒸汽活化至关重要，这从煅烧和蒸汽活化的Fe-硅铝酸盐的丙烯产率差异巨大可以看出。

虽然蒸汽活化Fe-沸石的初始性能优越，但研究提到在反应400分钟后，合成的Fe-沸石和铁含量较低的商业沸石的残余活性相似，这表明由于焦炭形成而存在潜在的失活问题。
