The effectiveness and performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions are significantly influenced by their synthesis methods. This review analyzes the impact of various preparation techniques on catalytic performance and evaluates their effectiveness through key performance metrics.

Steam activation emerges as a crucial synthesis method for achieving superior catalytic performance. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts consistently demonstrate high activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions. For instance, steam-activated FeZSM-5 shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. The effectiveness of steam activation is attributed to the formation of extra-framework iron species, which are more active than framework iron species for N2O-ODHP [Placeholder_Of_DOI1].

Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange methods also produce effective catalysts, with C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527°C [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. However, the performance of these catalysts is generally lower than that of steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5.

The synthesis method significantly affects the nature and distribution of iron species in the zeolite, which in turn determines catalytic performance. For example, steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 outperforms ex-Fe-silicalite due to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which are more catalytically active than isolated iron ions [Placeholder_Of_DOI2].

Key performance metrics used to evaluate catalyst effectiveness include:

1. C3H8 conversion: Generally higher for catalysts with extra-framework iron species.
2. N2O conversion: Increases with temperature and is higher for steam-activated catalysts.
3. C3H6 selectivity: Highest for Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity.
4. C3H6 yield: Up to 25% for steam-activated Fe-zeolites at 723 K [Placeholder_Of_DOI3].

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, significantly influence these metrics. The optimal temperature range for ODHP reactions is typically between 673 K and 773 K.

While steam activation produces highly active catalysts, it can lead to faster deactivation due to coke formation. Strategies to mitigate this issue include optimizing iron content and balancing acidity. For instance, Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al content and reduced acidity shows higher selectivity and yield of propene [Placeholder_Of_DOI4].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The extensive research on iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for N2O-assisted ODHP reactions has provided valuable insights into the relationship between synthesis methods, catalyst structure, and performance. However, there are still opportunities for further advancement in this field.

Future research directions may include:

1. Developing novel synthesis methods that combine the advantages of steam activation with improved stability against deactivation.
2. Exploring the potential of hierarchical zeolite structures to enhance mass transfer and catalytic performance.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects of bimetallic or multi-metallic zeolite catalysts for ODHP reactions.
4. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the nature and evolution of active sites during the reaction.
5. Exploring the application of machine learning and high-throughput experimentation to optimize catalyst composition and synthesis parameters.
6. Investigating the scalability and long-term stability of promising catalysts for potential industrial applications.

By addressing these areas, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and stable catalysts for N2O-assisted ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more sustainable and economical propylene production processes.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石作为N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的催化剂的有效性和性能受其合成方法的显著影响。本综述分析了各种制备技术对催化性能的影响，并通过关键性能指标评估其有效性。

蒸汽活化作为一种关键的合成方法，可以获得卓越的催化性能。蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂在ODHP反应中始终表现出高活性和选择性。例如，蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5在450°C下显示出48%的C3H8转化率、96%的N2O转化率和45%的C3H6选择性[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。蒸汽活化的有效性归因于形成了比骨架铁物种更活跃的非骨架铁物种[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。

固态离子交换和液体交换方法也能产生有效的催化剂，在377至527°C的温度范围内，C3H8转化率在20%至60%之间，C3H6选择性在25%至70%之间，C3H6产率在14%至30%之间[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。然而，这些催化剂的性能通常低于蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5。

合成方法显著影响沸石中铁物种的性质和分布，进而决定催化性能。例如，蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5优于ex-Fe-硅铝石，这是由于存在比孤立铁离子更具催化活性的寡核FexOy簇[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。

用于评估催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：含有非骨架铁物种的催化剂通常较高。
2. N2O转化率：随温度升高而增加，蒸汽活化催化剂较高。
3. C3H6选择性：低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5最高。
4. C3H6产率：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在723 K时可达25%[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。

反应条件，特别是温度，显著影响这些指标。ODHP反应的最佳温度范围通常在673 K至773 K之间。

虽然蒸汽活化产生高活性催化剂，但可能导致由于积碳而更快失活。缓解这一问题的策略包括优化铁含量和平衡酸度。例如，低Al含量和降低酸度的Fe-ZSM-5显示出更高的丙烯选择性和产率[Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。

综合理解与未来展望：
对铁含量ZSM-5沸石用于N2O辅助ODHP反应的广泛研究为合成方法、催化剂结构和性能之间的关系提供了宝贵的见解。然而，这一领域仍有进一步发展的机会。

1. 开发结合蒸汽活化优势和改进抗失活稳定性的新型合成方法。
2. 探索分层沸石结构的潜力，以增强传质和催化性能。

4. 利用先进表征技术深入了解反应过程中活性位点的性质和演变。
5. 探索机器学习和高通量实验在优化催化剂组成和合成参数方面的应用。
6. 研究有前景的催化剂的可扩展性和长期稳定性，以应用于潜在的工业应用。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效、更稳定的N2O辅助ODHP反应催化剂，潜在地引领更可持续和经济的丙烯生产工艺。
