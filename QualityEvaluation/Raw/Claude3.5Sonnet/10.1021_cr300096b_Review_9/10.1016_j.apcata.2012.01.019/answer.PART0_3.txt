[1] "Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols has received considerable attention because of its industrial applications"

[2] "From the point of view of practical applications, the corresponding semi-hydrogenated product, cinnamyl alcohol (CML), is utilized as components in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and perfumes"

[3] "The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures."

[4] "In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on bimetallic catalysts, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been performed by adding a 3d-metal, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, to Pt(1 1 1)"

[5] "Several characterization methods, including H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were employed in order to understand the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects."
