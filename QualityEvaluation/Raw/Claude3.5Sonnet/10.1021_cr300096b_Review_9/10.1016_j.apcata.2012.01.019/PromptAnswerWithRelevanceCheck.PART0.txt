The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. This process has received considerable attention due to its industrial importance, particularly in the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as 3d-Pt combinations, often exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. This synergistic effect allows for the development of novel catalysts with improved performance. For example, Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 have shown significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation in probe molecules like acetone and acetaldehyde.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ both theoretical and experimental methodologies. Theoretical approaches include Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict catalyst behavior. Experimentally, surface science techniques are used to investigate model systems, which are then extended to supported catalysts for practical applications.

The selectivity towards C=O bond hydrogenation is often attributed to specific adsorption configurations of the reactant molecules on the catalyst surface. For instance, weakly adsorbed species through a diσCO configuration have been suggested to be responsible for the desired hydrogenation pathway in some cases.

By combining these theoretical and experimental approaches, researchers can design and optimize bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation, potentially improving processes in fine chemical synthesis and other industrial applications.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，包括精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化。由于其工业重要性，特别是在α,β-不饱和醛选择性氢化为烯丙醇方面，这一过程受到了广泛关注。

双金属催化剂，如3d-Pt组合，通常比其单金属对应物表现出更高的活性和选择性。这种协同效应允许开发具有更好性能的新型催化剂。例如，在γ-Al2O3上负载的Co-Pt双金属催化剂在探针分子（如丙酮和乙醛）的C=O键氢化中表现出比单金属Co和Pt催化剂显著更高的活性。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了理论和实验方法。理论方法包括密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，以理解潜在机制并预测催化剂行为。在实验方面，使用表面科学技术研究模型系统，然后将其扩展到实际应用中的负载催化剂。

C=O键氢化的选择性通常归因于反应分子在催化剂表面的特定吸附构型。例如，在某些情况下，通过diσCO构型弱吸附的物种被认为是所需氢化途径的原因。

通过结合这些理论和实验方法，研究人员可以设计和优化用于选择性氢化的双金属催化剂，潜在地改进精细化学品合成和其他工业应用中的过程。
