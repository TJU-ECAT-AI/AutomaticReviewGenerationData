The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications in several ways:

1. It enables selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to produce allylic alcohols, which have important industrial applications.

2. Bimetallic catalysts offer synergistic effects that can promote selective hydrogenation of these compounds.

3. 3d-Pt bimetallic catalysts often exhibit unique properties compared to their parent metals, allowing for the development of novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity.

4. Specifically, Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts have shown significantly higher hydrogenation activity for C=O bonds compared to monometallic catalysts.

To study, optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains, including:

- Preparation and characterization of bimetallic catalysts using techniques like H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, TEM, and EXAFS.
- Reactor studies to evaluate catalytic performance in terms of activity and selectivity.
- Comparison of bimetallic catalysts to corresponding monometallic catalysts.
- Surface science studies on model bimetallic surfaces to understand fundamental reaction mechanisms.
- Theoretical calculations like DFT to investigate electronic effects in bimetallic systems.

These approaches allow researchers to design improved catalysts for selective hydrogenation by understanding structure-property relationships and reaction mechanisms at a fundamental level.
