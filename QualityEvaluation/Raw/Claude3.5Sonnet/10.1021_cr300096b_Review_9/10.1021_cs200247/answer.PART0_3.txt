[1] "Supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation reaction potential for advanced and greener syntheses of many special and fine chemicals in organic chemistry"

[2] "Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to their semihydrogenated products, that is, saturated aldehydes from hydrogenation at the CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group or unsaturated alcohols from hydrogenation at the CO bond, is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others."

[3] "PtmAu immobilized on a noninteracting SiO2 support (PtmAu/SiO2) showed activity 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic Pt/SiO2 and Au/SiO2 catalysts."

The literature does not specifically discuss Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide relevant information on bimetallic Pt-Au catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

Bimetallic Pt-Au catalysts show greatly enhanced activity compared to monometallic Pt or Au catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. This reaction is important for synthesizing fine chemicals, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals. The Pt-Au system demonstrates synergistic effects, with Pt promoting H2 activation while Au provides selectivity. 

The study employed various experimental techniques to optimize and understand the catalysts, including:
- Controlled synthesis of Pt-on-Au nanostructures 
- Characterization by TEM, electrochemistry, etc.
- Catalytic testing under different conditions (temperature, pressure)
- Kinetic modeling to elucidate the reaction mechanism

While not identical, these approaches for studying Pt-Au catalysts could likely be adapted to investigate other bimetallic systems like Pt-Ni for various hydrogenation applications. The emphasis on understanding reaction mechanisms and structure-activity relationships is broadly applicable to catalyst development for both fine chemicals and biomass conversion.

这篇文献并未具体讨论Pt-Ni双金属催化剂或纤维素生物质转化。然而,它确实提供了关于双金属Pt-Au催化剂用于选择性氢化的相关信息:

与单金属Pt或Au催化剂相比,双金属Pt-Au催化剂在α,β-不饱和醛的选择性氢化方面表现出大大提高的活性。这种反应对于合成精细化学品、香料和药物很重要。Pt-Au体系展现出协同效应,Pt促进H2活化,而Au提供选择性。

该研究采用了各种实验技术来优化和理解催化剂,包括:
- 控制合成Pt-on-Au纳米结构
- 通过TEM、电化学等方法进行表征
- 在不同条件下(温度、压力)进行催化测试
- 动力学建模以阐明反应机理

虽然不完全相同,但这些研究Pt-Au催化剂的方法很可能可以用来研究其他双金属体系(如Pt-Ni)在各种氢化应用中的表现。对反应机理和结构-活性关系的理解,对于精细化学品和生物质转化的催化剂开发都具有广泛的适用性。
