[1] "Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to their semihydrogenated products, that is, saturated aldehydes from hydrogenation at the CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group or unsaturated alcohols from hydrogenation at the CO bond, is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others."

[2] "Supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation reaction potential for advanced and greener syntheses of many special and fine chemicals in organic chemistry, but their potential for applications has been hampered by their generally observed low activity arising from the intrinsic nobleness of gold to H2 activation."

[3] "This work deals with a synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt entities in Pt-on-Au nanostructures (coded as PtmAu, m denoting the atomic Pt/Au ratio) for hydrocinnamaldehyde production in the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde."

The literature does not specifically discuss Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O hydrogenation or their applications in cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide relevant information on bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

The study focuses on Pt-Au bimetallic catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which is important for synthesizing fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and other fine chemicals. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are highly selective for this reaction but suffer from low activity due to poor H2 activation. The researchers found that adding small amounts of platinum to create Pt-on-Au nanostructures dramatically improved catalytic activity while maintaining gold's high selectivity.

The methodologies employed in this study included:

1. Synthesis and characterization of bimetallic Pt-Au catalysts with varying Pt/Au ratios
2. Testing catalytic performance under different reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)
3. Kinetic modeling to understand the reaction mechanism
4. Comparing performance across different support materials

While this study doesn't directly address C=O hydrogenation or cellulosic biomass conversion, it demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can be designed and optimized to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in hydrogenation reactions relevant to fine chemical synthesis.

该文献并未具体讨论Pt-Ni双金属催化剂用于C=O氢化或其在纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实提供了有关选择性氢化双金属催化剂的相关信息：

该研究主要关注Pt-Au双金属催化剂在α,β-不饱和醛的化学选择性氢化反应中的应用，这对于合成香料、制药和其他精细化学品很重要。金纳米粒子(Au NPs)对这种反应具有高度选择性，但由于H2活化能力差而活性低。研究人员发现，添加少量铂来创建Pt-on-Au纳米结构可以显著提高催化活性，同时保持金的高选择性。

这项研究采用的方法包括：

1. 合成和表征不同Pt/Au比例的双金属Pt-Au催化剂
2. 在不同反应条件(温度、压力)下测试催化性能
3. 动力学建模以理解反应机理
4. 比较不同载体材料上的性能

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及C=O氢化或纤维素生物质转化，但它展示了如何设计和优化双金属催化剂，以提高与精细化学品合成相关的氢化反应的选择性和效率。
