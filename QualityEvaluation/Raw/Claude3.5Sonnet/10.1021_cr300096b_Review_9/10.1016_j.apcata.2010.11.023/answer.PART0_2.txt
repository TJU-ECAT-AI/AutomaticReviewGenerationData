Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels and chemicals. This process is crucial for the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass, serving as an important initial step.

The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains. On the theoretical side, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to estimate binding energies on various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. This helps predict the effectiveness of different catalyst compositions.

Experimentally, probe reactions such as low-temperature hydrogenation of acetone are used to investigate the effects of different supports (e.g., TiO2, SiO2, and γ-Al2O3) on the hydrogenation activity of bimetallic catalysts. These studies help optimize catalyst performance by understanding how different supports affect catalytic activity.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni systems, are particularly interesting due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. They are utilized in various reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. The synergistic effects between the two metals can lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making them valuable for fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion applications.

The research in this field aims to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, which is essential for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources like biomass.
