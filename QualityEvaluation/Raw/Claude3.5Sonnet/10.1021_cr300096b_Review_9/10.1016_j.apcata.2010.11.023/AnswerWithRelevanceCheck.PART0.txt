          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is crucial for converting biomass derivatives into fuels and chemicals, as it facilitates the hydrogenation of CO functional groups commonly found in biomass-derived compounds.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni systems, are extensively utilized in hydrogenation reactions due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. These catalysts often exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. For instance, Pt-terminated Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 have shown higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt or Ni alone.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical studies: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to estimate binding energies of reactants on different monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. This helps in predicting catalyst performance and understanding the fundamental principles behind enhanced activity.

2. Surface science studies: Experiments on well-defined single crystal surfaces provide insights into the effects of bimetallic structures on catalytic performance and stability.

3. Experimental evaluations: Catalysts are tested in reactor systems to measure their activity and selectivity. For example, low-temperature acetone hydrogenation is often used as a probe reaction to compare the catalytic properties of different bimetallic catalysts and investigate support effects.

4. Support effect studies: The influence of different oxide supports (e.g., SiO2, γ-Al2O3, TiO2) on the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts is investigated to optimize catalyst performance.

By combining these theoretical and experimental approaches, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, ultimately improving processes in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

          使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化方面。这个过程对于将生物质衍生物转化为燃料和化学品至关重要，因为它促进了生物质衍生化合物中常见的CO官能团的加氢。

双金属催化剂，如Pt-Ni系统，由于其独特的性质不同于单金属催化剂，在加氢反应中被广泛使用。这些催化剂通常表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性和选择性。例如，以γ-Al2O3为载体的Pt末端Pt/Ni双金属催化剂显示出比单独的Pt或Ni更高的加氢活性。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法：

1. 理论研究：使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来估算反应物在不同单金属和双金属表面上的结合能。这有助于预测催化剂性能并理解增强活性背后的基本原理。

2. 表面科学研究：在定义明确的单晶表面上进行实验，以深入了解双金属结构对催化性能和稳定性的影响。

3. 实验评估：在反应器系统中测试催化剂，以测量其活性和选择性。例如，常用低温丙酮加氢作为探针反应来比较不同双金属催化剂的催化性能和研究载体效应。

4. 载体效应研究：研究不同氧化物载体（如SiO2、γ-Al2O3、TiO2）对双金属催化剂催化性能的影响，以优化催化剂性能。

通过结合这些理论和实验方法，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更有选择性的C=O键加氢催化剂，最终改进精细化学品合成和生物质转化过程。
