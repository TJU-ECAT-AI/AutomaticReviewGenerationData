Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels and chemicals, as well as in the initial steps of cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is crucial for transforming biomass-derived compounds containing CO functional groups into valuable products.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies:

1. Theoretical approaches:
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to estimate binding energies of molecules like acetone on various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.
- Modeling of different surface structures, such as the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, to predict novel hydrogenation pathways.

2. Experimental methods:
- Using probe reactions like acetone hydrogenation to compare catalytic properties of different catalysts.
- Employing advanced characterization techniques such as TEM, EXAFS, and XANES to analyze particle size distribution, bimetallic bond formation, and oxidation states of the catalysts.
- Conducting reactor evaluations to measure hydrogenation activity and correlate it with catalyst properties.

3. Catalyst design and optimization:
- Exploring different support materials (e.g., SiO2, γ-Al2O3, TiO2) to enhance catalyst performance and stability.
- Investigating the effects of metal ratios and preparation methods on bimetallic catalyst formation and activity.

By combining these approaches, researchers aim to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, ultimately improving processes in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.
