[1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[3] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

[4] "Therefore the challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity. Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route"

[5] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."

[6] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems contributes to fine chemical synthesis applications, as demonstrated by the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol. The methodology employed in this study to optimize and enhance selectivity involved:

1. Using carbon nanofibers (CNF) as a support for platinum catalysts, which provided high hydrogenation activity.

2. Removing oxygen surface groups from the CNF support to further improve activity.

3. Adding promoter metals like tin or gallium to create bimetallic catalysts, which improved selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol product.

4. Employing reductive deposition precipitation as a synthesis technique to achieve close contact between platinum and the promoter metal, resulting in better selectivity compared to traditional impregnation methods.

5. Characterizing the bimetallic catalysts using techniques like TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS to understand the interaction between platinum and promoter metals.

6. Testing the catalysts under different reaction conditions (low and high pressure) to evaluate their performance.

While this study focused on cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, the principles and methodologies can be applied to other C=O bond hydrogenations in fine chemical synthesis. The research demonstrates the importance of catalyst design, preparation methods, and characterization techniques in optimizing selectivity and efficiency for such processes.

使用双金属催化剂(如基于铂的体系)进行C=O键的催化氢化对精细化学品合成应用有重要贡献,这在肉桂醛选择性氢化为肉桂醇的研究中得到了证实。本研究中用于优化和提高选择性的方法包括:

1. 使用碳纳米纤维(CNF)作为铂催化剂的载体,提供了高的氢化活性。

2. 去除CNF载体表面的氧基团,进一步提高活性。

3. 添加锡或镓等助催化金属形成双金属催化剂,提高了对目标产物肉桂醇的选择性。

4. 采用还原沉积法作为合成技术,实现了铂与助催化金属之间的紧密接触,与传统的浸渍法相比获得了更好的选择性。

5. 使用TEM-EDX、XPS和EXAFS等技术表征双金属催化剂,以了解铂与助催化金属之间的相互作用。

6. 在不同反应条件(低压和高压)下测试催化剂性能。

虽然这项研究主要集中在肉桂醛氢化上,但其原理和方法可以应用于精细化学品合成中的其他C=O键氢化反应。这项研究表明,催化剂设计、制备方法和表征技术对于优化此类过程的选择性和效率至关重要。
