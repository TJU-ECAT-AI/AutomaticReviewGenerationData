[1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[3] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

[4] "Therefore the challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity. Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route"

[5] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."

[6] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst"

The literature does not directly address the hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni catalysts or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts of selective hydrogenation using bimetallic catalysts.

The study focuses on the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde using platinum-based catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF). While platinum on CNF showed high activity for hydrogenation, it had low selectivity towards the desired product, cinnamyl alcohol. The challenge was to improve selectivity while maintaining high activity.

To address this, researchers prepared bimetallic catalysts by adding promoter metals (tin and gallium) to the platinum catalysts. They used methods like reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation to create these bimetallic catalysts.

The bimetallic catalysts showed improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst. This demonstrates that adding a second metal can enhance the selectivity of the catalytic process.

The study employed various methodologies to optimize and enhance selectivity, including:
1. Catalyst preparation techniques (reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation)
2. Characterization methods (TEM-EDX, XPS, EXAFS) to understand catalyst structure and metal interactions
3. Catalytic testing under different conditions (low and high pressure)

While this study doesn't directly address the industrial applications mentioned in the question, it provides insights into the principles and methods used to study and optimize bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to various industrial processes.

该文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni催化剂对C=O键进行氢化以及在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了使用双金属催化剂进行选择性氢化的相关概念。

这项研究主要关注使用碳纳米纤维(CNF)负载的铂基催化剂对肉桂醛进行氢化。虽然CNF负载的铂对氢化反应表现出高活性，但对目标产物肉桂醇的选择性较低。研究的挑战在于在保持高活性的同时提高选择性。

为解决这个问题，研究人员通过向铂催化剂中添加促进金属(锡和镓)制备了双金属催化剂。他们使用还原沉积沉淀和浸渍等方法来制备这些双金属催化剂。

与单金属铂催化剂相比，双金属催化剂在肉桂醛氢化反应中表现出更高的选择性。这表明添加第二种金属可以提高催化过程的选择性。

该研究采用了多种方法来优化和提高选择性，包括：
1. 催化剂制备技术（还原沉积沉淀和浸渍）
2. 表征方法（TEM-EDX、XPS、EXAFS）以了解催化剂结构和金属相互作用
3. 在不同条件下进行催化测试（低压和高压）

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及问题中提到的工业应用，但它为研究和优化用于选择性氢化反应的双金属催化剂提供了原理和方法方面的见解，这些可能与各种工业过程相关。
