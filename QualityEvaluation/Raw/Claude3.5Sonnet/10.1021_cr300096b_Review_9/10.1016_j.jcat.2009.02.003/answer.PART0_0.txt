The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems contributes significantly to fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion. The literature discusses the use of platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) as highly active catalysts for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. Adding promoter metals or metal oxides like tin, germanium, gallium, or iron to platinum catalysts on CNF is described as a promising approach to improve catalytic performance.

The study focuses on bimetallic platinum-tin and platinum-gallium catalysts supported on CNF, prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation methods. These bimetallic catalysts showed improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired product cinnamyl alcohol compared to monometallic platinum catalysts.

To optimize and enhance selectivity and efficiency, the researchers employed various methodologies including different synthesis techniques (reductive deposition precipitation vs. impregnation), characterization methods (TEM-EDX, XPS, EXAFS), and catalytic testing under different conditions (low and high pressure). The study demonstrates that the close contact between promoter and platinum achieved through reductive deposition precipitation leads to higher selectivity in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation.

While the specific industrial applications mentioned in the question (cellulosic biomass conversion) are not directly addressed in this text, the research provides insights into improving catalytic performance for C=O bond hydrogenation, which is relevant to various fine chemical synthesis processes.

C=O键的催化加氢使用双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)对精细化学品合成和生物质转化做出了重大贡献。文献讨论了使用碳纳米纤维(CNF)支撑的铂作为高活性催化剂用于肉桂醛加氢。向CNF上的铂催化剂添加促进金属或金属氧化物(如锡、锗、镓或铁)被描述为提高催化性能的有前景的方法。

研究重点关注通过还原沉积和浸渍法制备的CNF支撑的双金属铂-锡和铂-镓催化剂。与单金属铂催化剂相比,这些双金属催化剂在肉桂醛加氢反应中表现出更好的选择性,可以得到所需的肉桂醇产物。

为了优化和提高选择性和效率,研究人员采用了各种方法,包括不同的合成技术(还原沉积沉淀vs浸渍法)、表征方法(TEM-EDX、XPS、EXAFS)以及在不同条件下(低压和高压)进行催化测试。研究表明,通过还原沉积沉淀实现的促进剂与铂之间的紧密接触导致了肉桂醛加氢反应中更高的选择性。

虽然问题中提到的特定工业应用(纤维素生物质转化)在本文中没有直接涉及,但这项研究为改善C=O键加氢的催化性能提供了见解,这与各种精细化学品合成过程相关。
