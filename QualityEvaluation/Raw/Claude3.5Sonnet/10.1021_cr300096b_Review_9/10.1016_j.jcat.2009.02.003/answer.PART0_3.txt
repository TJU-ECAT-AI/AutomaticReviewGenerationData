The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts for C=O hydrogenation in industrial applications. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

The study focuses on platinum-based bimetallic catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol. Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers was found to be highly active for this reaction. Adding promoter metals like tin, germanium, gallium or iron to the platinum catalysts improved selectivity. 

The researchers prepared platinum-tin and platinum-gallium bimetallic catalysts using methods like reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation. These bimetallic catalysts showed improved selectivity for producing the desired cinnamyl alcohol product compared to monometallic platinum catalysts.

While not directly addressing industrial applications, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation, which could have relevance for fine chemical synthesis. The methods used, such as various catalyst preparation techniques and characterization by TEM, XPS, and EXAFS, exemplify experimental approaches for investigating these catalytic systems.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-Ni催化剂在工业应用中用于C=O氢化的具体问题。但是,它确实讨论了相关的双金属催化剂用于选择性氢化的概念:

这项研究着重于以碳纳米纤维为载体的铂基双金属催化剂,用于肉桂醛选择性氢化生成肉桂醇。发现以碳纳米纤维为载体的铂对这种反应具有很高的活性。向铂催化剂中添加锡、锗、镓或铁等助催化金属可以提高选择性。

研究人员使用还原沉积和浸渍等方法制备了铂-锡和铂-镓双金属催化剂。与单金属铂催化剂相比,这些双金属催化剂在生产所需的肉桂醇产品方面表现出更好的选择性。

虽然没有直接讨论工业应用,但这项研究展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性C=O氢化的方法,这可能与精细化学品合成有关。所使用的方法,如各种催化剂制备技术以及TEM、XPS和EXAFS表征,例证了研究这些催化体系的实验方法。
