[1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[3] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni systems for C=O bond hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

The study focuses on platinum-based bimetallic catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol. Platinum on CNF was found to be highly active for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, but with low selectivity towards the desired product. 

To improve selectivity, promoter metals like tin, germanium, gallium, or iron were added to the platinum catalysts. Specifically, platinum-tin and platinum-gallium bimetallic catalysts were prepared using reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation methods.

These bimetallic catalysts showed improved selectivity for cinnamyl alcohol production compared to monometallic platinum catalysts. The study employed various methodologies to optimize and characterize the catalysts, including TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS to analyze the interaction between platinum and the promoter metals.

While this research doesn't directly address Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion, it demonstrates the general approach of using bimetallic catalysts to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, which could be applicable to other systems and industrial applications.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-Ni系统在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的C=O键氢化作用。但是,它确实讨论了用于选择性氢化的双金属催化剂的相关概念:

这项研究主要关注以碳纳米纤维(CNF)为载体的铂基双金属催化剂,用于肉桂醛选择性氢化生成肉桂醇。研究发现,CNF负载的铂对肉桂醛氢化具有很高的活性,但对目标产物的选择性较低。

为了提高选择性,在铂催化剂中添加了锡、锗、镓或铁等助催化金属。具体而言,通过还原沉积沉淀和浸渍法制备了铂-锡和铂-镓双金属催化剂。

与单金属铂催化剂相比,这些双金属催化剂在肉桂醇生产中表现出更好的选择性。该研究采用了多种方法来优化和表征催化剂,包括使用TEM-EDX、XPS和EXAFS来分析铂与助催化金属之间的相互作用。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化,但它展示了使用双金属催化剂来提高氢化反应选择性的一般方法,这可能适用于其他系统和工业应用。
