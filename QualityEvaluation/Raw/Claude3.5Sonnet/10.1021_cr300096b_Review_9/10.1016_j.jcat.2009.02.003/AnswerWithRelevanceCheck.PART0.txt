          [1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route, since successful promotion of platinum based catalysts by tin, germanium, gallium or iron has been reported"

[3] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."

[4] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst"

[5] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[6] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

[7] "Therefore the challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, particularly platinum-based systems, contributes significantly to fine chemical synthesis applications. While the study doesn't specifically address Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion, it provides insights into the use of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

The research focuses on platinum catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. These catalysts showed high activity but low selectivity towards the desired product, cinnamyl alcohol. To improve selectivity while maintaining high activity, researchers added promoter metals such as tin, germanium, gallium, or iron to create bimetallic catalysts.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance selectivity and efficiency include:

1. Catalyst preparation techniques: Bimetallic platinum-tin and platinum-gallium catalysts were prepared using reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation methods.

2. Surface modification: Removing oxygen surface groups from CNF catalysts was crucial for achieving high activity.

3. Characterization methods: Techniques such as TEM-EDX, XPS, and EXAFS were used to analyze the interaction between platinum and promoter metals.

4. Catalytic testing: Experiments were conducted under different conditions (low and high pressure) to evaluate catalyst performance.

The bimetallic catalysts showed improved selectivity for cinnamyl alcohol production compared to monometallic platinum catalysts. This approach demonstrates the potential of using bimetallic catalysts to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, which could be applicable to other systems and industrial applications, including fine chemical synthesis.

          使用双金属催化剂,特别是基于铂的系统,对C=O键的催化氢化在精细化学品合成应用中起着重要作用。虽然这项研究没有具体讨论Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化,但它为使用双金属催化剂进行选择性氢化提供了见解。

研究重点关注以碳纳米纤维(CNF)为载体的铂催化剂用于肉桂醛氢化。这些催化剂表现出高活性,但对目标产物肉桂醇的选择性较低。为了在保持高活性的同时提高选择性,研究人员添加了锡、锗、镓或铁等助催化金属,制备了双金属催化剂。

用于研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法包括:

1. 催化剂制备技术:使用还原沉积沉淀和浸渍法制备了铂-锡和铂-镓双金属催化剂。

2. 表面改性:去除CNF催化剂表面的氧基团对实现高活性至关重要。

3. 表征方法:使用TEM-EDX、XPS和EXAFS等技术分析铂与助催化金属之间的相互作用。

4. 催化测试:在不同条件下(低压和高压)进行实验,评估催化剂性能。

与单金属铂催化剂相比,双金属催化剂在肉桂醇生产中表现出更好的选择性。这种方法展示了使用双金属催化剂来提高氢化反应选择性的潜力,可能适用于其他系统和工业应用,包括精细化学品合成。
