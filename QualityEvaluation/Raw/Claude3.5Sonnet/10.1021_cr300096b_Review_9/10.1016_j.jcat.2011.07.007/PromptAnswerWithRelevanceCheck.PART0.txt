The given literature does not directly discuss catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts or its applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The document focuses on the hydrogenation of amides, specifically N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, using Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts. While there are some parallels in terms of using bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, the specific systems and applications mentioned in the question are not covered in this text.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The document focuses on the hydrogenation of amides, particularly N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, using Pt-Re bimetallic catalysts. While this is related to C=O bond hydrogenation, it does not directly address the specific topics mentioned in the question. The methodologies described in the paper, such as catalyst preparation, characterization techniques, and DFT calculations, could potentially be applied to study other bimetallic catalyst systems, but the document does not provide information on how these methods are used specifically for Pt-Ni catalysts or in the mentioned applications.

所提供的文献中没有关于使用双金属Pt-Ni催化剂进行C=O键催化氢化的具体信息,也没有提到其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。该文档主要关注使用Pt-Re双金属催化剂对酰胺,特别是N-甲基吡咯烷酮的氢化。虽然这与C=O键的氢化有关,但并未直接涉及问题中提到的具体主题。文中描述的方法,如催化剂制备、表征技术和DFT计算,可能适用于研究其他双金属催化剂系统,但文档并未提供这些方法如何专门用于Pt-Ni催化剂或上述应用的信息。

While this is related to C=O bond hydrogenation, it does not address the specific topics mentioned in the question. The methodologies described in the literature include catalyst preparation, characterization techniques like TPR and XRD, kinetic studies, and DFT calculations to understand the reaction mechanism and the roles of Pt and Re in the bimetallic catalyst. However, these methods are not specifically applied to Pt-Ni systems or the applications mentioned in the question.
