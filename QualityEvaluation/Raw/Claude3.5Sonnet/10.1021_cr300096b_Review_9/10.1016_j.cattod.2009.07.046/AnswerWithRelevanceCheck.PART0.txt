          [1] "The PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidationreduction thermal treatment showed a TOF of 0.10.5 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 6590%."

[2] "The sample obtained using high concentration of Pt in initial solution (10 mg/ml) showed a very high selectivity to UA (90%) and TOF of 0.54 min1."

[3] "A higher activity was demonstrated by PtSn/TiO2 catalyst (IE-OR-33) prepared using combined impregnation of the inorganic salts as metal precursors. This sample showed a TOF of 3.3 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 85%."

[4] "The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as 90% at a citral conversion above 95%."

[5] "A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min1 was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts."

[6] "The addition of tin to the Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in TOF lowering and an increase of the selectivity to UA, which is in agreement with previously reported literature data"

[7] "This study is devoted to the development of mesoporous titania supported novel PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts derived from mixed-metal precursors with desirable stoichiometry between the metals."

          While the provided literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, it does discuss related concepts using PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of citral, which contains C=O bonds.

The study focuses on developing mesoporous titania-supported PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. These catalysts demonstrated high selectivity (up to 90%) towards unsaturated alcohols (UA) at high conversion rates (above 95%).

Various methodologies were employed to optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process:

1. Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 supports with controlled morphology and pore structure.
2. Preparation of bimetallic PtSn nanoparticles using mixed-metal cluster precursors or inorganic salts.
3. Variation of synthesis parameters such as precursor type, metal concentrations, loading methods, and thermal treatments.
4. Characterization techniques including TEM, XRD, and porosimetry to analyze catalyst structure and composition.
5. Catalytic activity testing in citral hydrogenation to evaluate performance.

Key findings include:
- PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using mixed-metal cluster precursors showed TOF values of 0.1-0.5 min^-1 and selectivity to UA of 65-90%.
- Catalysts prepared with higher Pt concentrations (10 mg/ml) demonstrated very high selectivity to UA (90%) and improved TOF (0.54 min^-1).
- A catalyst prepared using combined impregnation of inorganic salts as metal precursors showed the highest activity, with a TOF of 3.3 min^-1 and 85% selectivity to UA.
- The addition of Sn to Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in lower TOF but increased selectivity to UA.

While this research doesn't directly address the specific applications mentioned in the question, it provides insights into the development and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to fine chemical synthesis and potentially adaptable to other applications like cellulosic biomass conversion.

          虽然所提供的文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键的催化氢化或其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用，但它确实讨论了使用PtSn双金属催化剂对柠檬醛（含有C=O键）进行氢化的相关概念。

该研究重点关注开发介孔二氧化钛负载的PtSn双金属纳米结构催化剂，用于选择性氢化柠檬醛（一种α,β-不饱和醛）。这些催化剂在高转化率（95%以上）下对不饱和醇（UA）表现出高选择性（高达90%）。

研究采用了多种方法来优化和提高催化过程的选择性和效率：

1. 合成具有可控形态和孔结构的介孔TiO2载体。
2. 使用混合金属簇前驱体或无机盐制备双金属PtSn纳米颗粒。
3. 改变合成参数，如前驱体类型、金属浓度、负载方法和热处理。
4. 使用TEM、XRD和孔隙度测定等表征技术分析催化剂结构和组成。
5. 在柠檬醛氢化反应中进行催化活性测试以评估性能。

主要研究结果包括：
- 使用混合金属簇前驱体制备的PtSn/TiO2催化剂表现出0.1-0.5 min^-1的转化频率（TOF）和65-90%的UA选择性。
- 使用较高Pt浓度（10 mg/ml）制备的催化剂表现出非常高的UA选择性（90%）和改善的TOF（0.54 min^-1）。
- 使用无机盐作为金属前体的组合浸渍法制备的催化剂表现出最高的活性，TOF为3.3 min^-1，UA选择性为85%。
- 向Pt/TiO2催化剂中添加Sn导致TOF降低但增加了对UA的选择性。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及问题中提到的特定应用，但它为选择性氢化反应的双金属催化剂的开发和优化提供了见解，这可能与精细化学品合成相关，并可能适用于其他应用，如纤维素生物质转化。
