[1] "The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as 90% at a citral conversion above 95%."

[2] "A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min1 was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts."

[3] "The addition of tin to the Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in TOF lowering and an increase of the selectivity to UA, which is in agreement with previously reported literature data"

The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss bimetallic PtSn catalysts for selective hydrogenation of citral, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. These catalysts show high selectivity (up to 90%) for unsaturated alcohols at high conversion rates. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased reaction rates but increased selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The study focused on optimizing catalyst preparation methods and reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. While not directly addressing the question's specifics, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to other systems and applications.

该文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键的催化加氢及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了用于选择性加氢柠檬醛（一种α,β-不饱和醛）的双金属PtSn催化剂。这些催化剂在高转化率下对不饱和醇表现出高选择性（高达90%）。与单金属Pt催化剂相比，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了反应速率但提高了选择性。该研究侧重于优化催化剂制备方法和反应条件，以提高选择性和效率。虽然没有直接回答问题的具体内容，但这项研究展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性加氢反应的方法，这可能与其他系统和应用相关。
