The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts using PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of citral, which contains C=O bonds.

The study focuses on developing mesoporous titania-supported PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts. These catalysts were tested in the hydrogenation of citral, showing high selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols (UA). The catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors demonstrated TOF values of 0.1-0.5 min^-1 and selectivity to UA of 65-90%.

The research explored various methodologies to optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. These included:

1. Using different precursors (mixed-metal clusters vs. inorganic salts)
2. Varying metal concentrations and loading methods
3. Employing different thermal treatments

The study found that catalysts prepared with higher Pt concentrations (10 mg/ml) showed very high selectivity to UA (90%) and improved TOF (0.54 min^-1). Additionally, a catalyst prepared using combined impregnation of inorganic salts as metal precursors demonstrated even higher activity, with a TOF of 3.3 min^-1 and 85% selectivity to UA.

While this research doesn't directly address the specific applications mentioned in the question, it provides insights into the development and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to fine chemical synthesis and potentially adaptable to other applications like cellulosic biomass conversion.

该文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键的催化氢化或其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了使用PtSn双金属催化剂对柠檬醛（含有C=O键）进行氢化的相关概念。

该研究重点关注开发介孔二氧化钛负载的PtSn双金属纳米结构催化剂。这些催化剂在柠檬醛氢化反应中进行了测试，显示出对不饱和醇（UA）的高选择性。使用PtSn混合金属簇前体制备的催化剂表现出0.1-0.5 min^-1的转化频率（TOF）和65-90%的UA选择性。

研究探索了各种方法来优化和提高催化过程的选择性和效率。这些方法包括：

1. 使用不同的前体（混合金属簇 vs. 无机盐）
2. 改变金属浓度和负载方法
3. 采用不同的热处理方法

研究发现，使用较高Pt浓度（10 mg/ml）制备的催化剂表现出非常高的UA选择性（90%）和改善的TOF（0.54 min^-1）。此外，使用无机盐作为金属前体的组合浸渍法制备的催化剂表现出更高的活性，TOF为3.3 min^-1，UA选择性为85%。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及问题中提到的特定应用，但它为选择性氢化反应的双金属催化剂的开发和优化提供了见解，这可能与精细化学品合成相关，并可能适用于其他应用，如纤维素生物质转化。
