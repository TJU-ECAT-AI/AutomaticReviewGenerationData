[1] "The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as 90% at a citral conversion above 95%."

[2] "A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min1 was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts."

[3] "The PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidationreduction thermal treatment showed a TOF of 0.10.5 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 6590%."

[4] "The addition of tin to the Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in TOF lowering and an increase of the selectivity to UA, which is in agreement with previously reported literature data"

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation.

The study shows that PtSn/TiO2 catalysts can achieve high selectivity (up to 90%) for unsaturated alcohols at high citral conversion (above 95%). This demonstrates the potential of bimetallic catalysts to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

The research employed various methodologies to study and optimize the catalysts:
1. Synthesis of PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors
2. Preparation of mesoporous titania supports
3. Deposition of PtSn clusters onto the supports
4. Characterization using techniques like XRD, TEM, and BET surface area analysis
5. Catalytic activity testing in citral hydrogenation

The study found that factors such as precursor type, deposition method, thermal treatment, and metal loading affected catalyst performance. By optimizing these parameters, researchers were able to enhance selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

While this study focuses on PtSn catalysts rather than Pt-Ni systems, it illustrates the general approach to studying and improving bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be applied to other catalyst systems and industrial applications.

该文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键催化氢化及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了使用PtSn双金属催化剂选择性氢化柠檬醛，这涉及C=O键的氢化。

研究表明，PtSn/TiO2催化剂在高柠檬醛转化率（95%以上）时可以实现对不饱和醇的高选择性（高达90%）。这展示了双金属催化剂在提高氢化反应选择性方面的潜力。

研究采用了多种方法来研究和优化催化剂：
1. 合成PtSn混合金属簇前驱体
2. 制备介孔二氧化钛载体
3. 将PtSn簇沉积到载体上
4. 使用XRD、TEM和BET比表面积分析等技术进行表征
5. 在柠檬醛氢化反应中进行催化活性测试

研究发现，前驱体类型、沉积方法、热处理和金属负载等因素都会影响催化剂性能。通过优化这些参数，研究人员能够提高氢化过程的选择性和效率。

虽然这项研究集中在PtSn催化剂而不是Pt-Ni系统，但它说明了研究和改进双金属催化剂用于选择性氢化反应的一般方法，这可以应用于其他催化剂系统和工业应用。
