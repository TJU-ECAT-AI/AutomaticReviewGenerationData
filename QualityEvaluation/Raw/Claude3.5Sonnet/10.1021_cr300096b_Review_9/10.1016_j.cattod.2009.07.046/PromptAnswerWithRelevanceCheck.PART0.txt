[1] "The PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidationreduction thermal treatment showed a TOF of 0.10.5 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 6590%."

[2] "The sample obtained using high concentration of Pt in initial solution (10 mg/ml) showed a very high selectivity to UA (90%) and TOF of 0.54 min1."

[3] "A higher activity was demonstrated by PtSn/TiO2 catalyst (IE-OR-33) prepared using combined impregnation of the inorganic salts as metal precursors. This sample showed a TOF of 3.3 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 85%."

The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of citral, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation.

The study explores different preparation methods and conditions for PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, aiming to optimize their performance in citral hydrogenation. The catalysts were prepared using either mixed-metal cluster precursors or inorganic metal salts, with various thermal treatments applied.

The research methodology involved varying synthesis parameters such as precursor type, concentration, loading method, and thermal treatment. Catalyst performance was evaluated based on turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (UA).

Results showed that PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared from mixed-metal cluster precursors achieved TOF values of 0.1-0.5 min^-1 with 65-90% selectivity to UA. A catalyst prepared with a high Pt concentration (10 mg/ml) exhibited 90% selectivity to UA and a TOF of 0.54 min^-1. The most active catalyst, prepared by co-impregnation of inorganic salts, demonstrated a TOF of 3.3 min^-1 with 85% selectivity to UA.

While this study focuses on citral hydrogenation rather than cellulosic biomass conversion, it illustrates the importance of catalyst preparation methods and bimetallic systems in optimizing selectivity and efficiency for C=O bond hydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键催化氢化及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了PtSn双金属催化剂在柠檬醛氢化中的应用，这涉及C=O键的氢化。

该研究探索了PtSn/TiO2催化剂的不同制备方法和条件，旨在优化其在柠檬醛氢化中的性能。催化剂是使用混合金属簇前驱体或无机金属盐制备的，并采用了各种热处理方法。

研究方法包括改变合成参数，如前驱体类型、浓度、负载方法和热处理。催化剂性能根据转换频率（TOF）和对不饱和醇（UA）的选择性进行评估。

结果显示，由混合金属簇前驱体制备的PtSn/TiO2催化剂达到了0.1-0.5 min^-1的TOF值，对UA的选择性为65-90%。使用高浓度Pt（10 mg/ml）制备的催化剂表现出90%的UA选择性和0.54 min^-1的TOF。通过无机盐共浸渍制备的最活跃催化剂表现出3.3 min^-1的TOF和85%的UA选择性。

虽然这项研究侧重于柠檬醛氢化而非纤维素生物质转化，但它说明了催化剂制备方法和双金属系统在优化C=O键氢化反应的选择性和效率方面的重要性。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation.

The study shows that PtSn/TiO2 catalysts can achieve high selectivity (up to 90%) for unsaturated alcohols at high citral conversion (above 95%). This demonstrates the potential of bimetallic catalysts to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

The research employed various methodologies to study and optimize the catalysts:
1. Synthesis of PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors
2. Preparation of mesoporous titania supports
3. Deposition of PtSn clusters onto the supports
4. Characterization using techniques like XRD, TEM, and BET surface area analysis
5. Catalytic activity testing in citral hydrogenation

The study found that factors such as precursor type, deposition method, thermal treatment, and metal loading affected catalyst performance. By optimizing these parameters, researchers were able to enhance selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

While this study focuses on PtSn catalysts rather than Pt-Ni systems, it illustrates the general approach to studying and improving bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be applied to other catalyst systems and industrial applications.

The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss bimetallic PtSn catalysts for selective hydrogenation of citral, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. These catalysts show high selectivity (up to 90%) for unsaturated alcohols at high conversion rates. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased reaction rates but increased selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The study focused on optimizing catalyst preparation methods and reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. While not directly addressing the question's specifics, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to other systems and applications.

The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts using PtSn bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of citral, which contains C=O bonds.

The study focuses on developing mesoporous titania-supported PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts. These catalysts were tested in the hydrogenation of citral, showing high selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols (UA). The catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors demonstrated TOF values of 0.1-0.5 min^-1 and selectivity to UA of 65-90%.

The research explored various methodologies to optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. These included:

1. Using different precursors (mixed-metal clusters vs. inorganic salts)
2. Varying metal concentrations and loading methods
3. Employing different thermal treatments

The study found that catalysts prepared with higher Pt concentrations (10 mg/ml) showed very high selectivity to UA (90%) and improved TOF (0.54 min^-1). Additionally, a catalyst prepared using combined impregnation of inorganic salts as metal precursors demonstrated even higher activity, with a TOF of 3.3 min^-1 and 85% selectivity to UA.

While this research doesn't directly address the specific applications mentioned in the question, it provides insights into the development and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to fine chemical synthesis and potentially adaptable to other applications like cellulosic biomass conversion.
