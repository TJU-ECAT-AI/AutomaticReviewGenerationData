[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "The selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[4] "WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about C=O bond hydrogenation using Pt-Ni catalysts for fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information about bimetallic catalysts for related hydrogenation reactions:

1. Bimetallic catalysts incorporating noble metals (like Pt) with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) show improved activity for CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The addition of a second metal can significantly affect reaction selectivity. For example, Ni-containing bimetallic catalysts produced more C2-C3 hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation, while the monometallic catalyst mainly produced methane.

3. The selectivity in hydrogenation reactions (like crotonaldehyde hydrogenation) is influenced by the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface.

4. WPt bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity for crotyl alcohol formation compared to catalysts without W, suggesting that bimetallic systems can enhance selectivity for C=O bond hydrogenation.

While the specific Pt-Ni system is not discussed, these examples demonstrate how bimetallic catalysts can be used to improve activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Similar principles could potentially be applied to C=O bond hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, but further research would be needed to confirm this.

文献中没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni催化剂进行C=O键氢化用于精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化的具体问题。但是，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂在相关氢化反应中的相关信息：

1. 含有贵金属（如Pt）和IV族元素（Ti, Zr, Hf）的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。

2. 添加第二种金属可以显著影响反应的选择性。例如，含Ni的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中产生更多的C2-C3烃类，而单金属催化剂主要产生甲烷。

3. 氢化反应（如巯醛氢化）的选择性受反应物在催化剂表面吸附的影响。

4. WPt双金属催化剂在巯醇形成方面表现出比不含W的催化剂更高的活性，这表明双金属体系可以增强C=O键氢化的选择性。

虽然没有具体讨论Pt-Ni体系，但这些例子展示了双金属催化剂如何被用来提高氢化反应的活性和选择性。类似的原理可能适用于精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的C=O键氢化，但需要进一步的研究来确认这一点。
