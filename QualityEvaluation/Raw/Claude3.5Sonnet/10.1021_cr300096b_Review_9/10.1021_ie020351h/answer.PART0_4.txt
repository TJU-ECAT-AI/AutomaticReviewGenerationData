[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "SiO2-supported CoRu clusters (and those supported in zeolites NaY and NaX) prepared from the precursors Ru3Co3C(CO)14, RuCo2(CO)11, and HRuCo3(CO)12 showed substantially higher activities and selectivities for formation of oxygenates such as C1C5 alcohols (e.g., selectivities of up to 38% in CO hydrogenation at 149250 C) than samples incorporating only one metal, even in a highly dispersed form."

The literature does not specifically discuss the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information on bimetallic catalysts for related hydrogenation reactions:

Bimetallic catalysts incorporating noble metals like Pt with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) showed higher activity for CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic noble metal catalysts. The addition of a second metal affected both activity and selectivity. For example, Ni-containing bimetallic catalysts produced more C2-C3 hydrocarbons compared to monometallic Ni catalysts which mainly produced methane.

CoRu bimetallic clusters supported on SiO2 or in zeolites demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for forming oxygenates like C1-C5 alcohols during CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic catalysts. Selectivity for alcohols reached up to 38%.

While not directly addressing C=O hydrogenation, these examples illustrate how bimetallic catalysts can enhance activity and tune selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Similar principles may apply for optimizing C=O hydrogenation catalysts, though further research would be needed to determine the specific effects for Pt-Ni systems and C=O bond hydrogenation.

The literature does not discuss specific methodologies for studying or optimizing these catalysts. However, the use of supported bimetallic clusters prepared from organometallic precursors is presented as an approach to create highly dispersed and well-defined bimetallic catalyst structures.

该文献并未具体讨论使用Pt-Ni双金属催化剂对C=O键进行催化氢化用于精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化。但是,它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂在相关氢化反应中的相关信息:

将贵金属如Pt与IV族元素(Ti, Zr, Hf)结合的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中表现出比单一贵金属催化剂更高的活性。第二种金属的添加影响了活性和选择性。例如,含Ni的双金属催化剂产生了更多的C2-C3烃类,而单一Ni催化剂主要产生甲烷。

负载在SiO2或沸石上的CoRu双金属簇在CO氢化过程中,对形成C1-C5醇类等含氧化合物表现出显著更高的活性和选择性,相比于单金属催化剂。对醇类的选择性高达38%。

虽然没有直接讨论C=O键的氢化,但这些例子说明了双金属催化剂如何能够增强氢化反应的活性并调节选择性。类似的原理可能适用于优化C=O键氢化催化剂,尽管需要进一步研究来确定Pt-Ni体系和C=O键氢化的具体效果。

该文献没有讨论研究或优化这些催化剂的具体方法。然而,使用有机金属前体制备负载的双金属簇被提出作为一种创建高度分散和结构明确的双金属催化剂的方法。
