          [1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "The selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[4] "WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

[5] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

[6] "The selective hydrogenation of CO groups in compounds incorporating CC groups (to give unsaturated alcohols) is an important practical goal because of the importance of unsaturated alcohols in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries."

[7] "SiO2-supported CoRu clusters (and those supported in zeolites NaY and NaX) prepared from the precursors Ru3Co3C(CO)14, RuCo2(CO)11, and HRuCo3(CO)12 showed substantially higher activities and selectivities for formation of oxygenates such as C1C5 alcohols (e.g., selectivities of up to 38% in CO hydrogenation at 149250 C) than samples incorporating only one metal, even in a highly dispersed form."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts contributes to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. While the literature doesn't specifically address Pt-Ni systems, it provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts enhance activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions:

1. Bimetallic catalysts incorporating noble metals (like Pt) with other elements (e.g., group IV elements or W) show improved activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts in various hydrogenation reactions, including CO hydrogenation and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation.

2. The addition of a second metal can significantly affect reaction selectivity. For example, Ni-containing bimetallic catalysts produced more C2-C3 hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation, while monometallic catalysts mainly produced methane.

3. Bimetallic catalysts like WPt/γ-Al2O3 demonstrated higher activities for the formation of unsaturated alcohols (e.g., crotyl alcohol) compared to monometallic catalysts.

4. The enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the close association of different metal atoms on the catalyst surface, allowing for bifunctional interactions that facilitate the chemisorption and activation of C=O bonds.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include:

1. Investigating the influence of catalyst structure on reaction kinetics and selectivity.
2. Comparing the performance of bimetallic catalysts to their monometallic counterparts.
3. Studying the chemisorption of reactants on catalyst surfaces and the formation of specific adsorbed species.
4. Exploring bifunctional interactions between the two metals in the catalyst and their effects on reactant activation.
5. Preparing highly dispersed and well-defined bimetallic catalyst structures using supported bimetallic clusters from organometallic precursors.

These approaches aim to understand and optimize the catalytic process, potentially leading to more efficient and selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds in various applications, including fine chemical synthesis and possibly cellulosic biomass conversion.

          使用双金属催化剂进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用有重要贡献，包括精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化。虽然文献没有具体讨论Pt-Ni系统，但它提供了关于双金属催化剂如何提高氢化反应活性和选择性的见解：

1. 将贵金属（如Pt）与其他元素（如IV族元素或W）结合的双金属催化剂在各种氢化反应中，包括CO氢化和巯醛氢化，表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性和选择性。

2. 第二种金属的添加可以显著影响反应的选择性。例如，含Ni的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中产生更多的C2-C3烃类，而单金属催化剂主要产生甲烷。

3. 像WPt/γ-Al2O3这样的双金属催化剂在形成不饱和醇（如巯醇）方面表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。

4. 双金属催化剂性能的提高归因于催化剂表面不同金属原子的紧密结合，这允许双功能相互作用，促进C=O键的化学吸附和活化。

用于研究、优化和提高这一过程选择性和效率的方法包括：

1. 研究催化剂结构对反应动力学和选择性的影响。
2. 比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的性能。
3. 研究反应物在催化剂表面的化学吸附及特定吸附物种的形成。
4. 探索催化剂中两种金属之间的双功能相互作用及其对反应物活化的影响。
5. 使用有机金属前体制备负载的双金属簇，创建高度分散和结构明确的双金属催化剂。

这些方法旨在理解和优化催化过程，有望在各种应用中实现更高效和选择性的C=O键氢化，包括精细化学品合成和可能的纤维素生物质转化。
