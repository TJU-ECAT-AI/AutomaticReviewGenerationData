[1] "The selective hydrogenation of CO groups in compounds incorporating CC groups (to give unsaturated alcohols) is an important practical goal because of the importance of unsaturated alcohols in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries."

[2] "Selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[3] "The WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

[4] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-W systems contributes to various industrial applications, particularly in the production of unsaturated alcohols for the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. These catalysts enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

To study and optimize this process, researchers employ both theoretical and experimental methodologies. They investigate the kinetics of the reaction and how it is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst surface. The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as WPt/γ-Al2O3, has shown higher activities for the formation of desired products (e.g., crotyl alcohol) compared to monometallic catalysts.

The enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the close association of different metal atoms (e.g., W ions with Pt atoms) on the catalyst surface. This arrangement allows for bifunctional interactions, facilitating the chemisorption and activation of the C=O bond. Researchers suggest that this leads to the formation of specific chemisorbed species, such as C- and O-bonded adsorbates, which contribute to the improved selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

While the literature does not specifically mention Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion, the principles and methodologies discussed for studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts can be applied to various metal combinations and reactions, including those relevant to fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-W系统)进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业应用都有贡献,特别是在食品、化妆品和制药行业生产不饱和醇方面。这些催化剂提高了加氢过程的选择性和效率。

为了研究和优化这一过程,研究人员采用理论和实验方法。他们研究反应的动力学,以及它如何受催化剂表面吸附反应物结构的影响。使用双金属催化剂(如WPt/γ-Al2O3)与单金属催化剂相比,在形成所需产品(如巴豆醇)方面表现出更高的活性。

双金属催化剂性能的提高归因于催化剂表面不同金属原子(如W离子与Pt原子)的紧密结合。这种排列允许双功能相互作用,促进C=O键的化学吸附和活化。研究人员认为,这导致了特定化学吸附物种的形成,如C-和O-键合吸附物,从而提高了加氢过程的选择性和效率。

虽然文献没有具体提到Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化,但讨论的研究和优化双金属催化剂的原理和方法可以应用于各种金属组合和反应,包括与精细化学品合成和生物质转化相关的反应。
