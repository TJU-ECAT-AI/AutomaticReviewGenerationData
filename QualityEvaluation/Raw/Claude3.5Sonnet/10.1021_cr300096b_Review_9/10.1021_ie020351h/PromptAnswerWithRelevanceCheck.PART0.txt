[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "The selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[4] "WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about C=O bond hydrogenation using Pt-Ni catalysts for fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information about bimetallic catalysts for related hydrogenation reactions:

1. Bimetallic catalysts incorporating noble metals (like Pt) with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) show improved activity for CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The addition of a second metal can significantly affect reaction selectivity. For example, Ni-containing bimetallic catalysts produced more C2-C3 hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation, while the monometallic catalyst mainly produced methane.

3. The selectivity in hydrogenation reactions (like crotonaldehyde hydrogenation) is influenced by the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface.

4. WPt bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity for crotyl alcohol formation compared to catalysts without W, suggesting that bimetallic systems can enhance selectivity for C=O bond hydrogenation.

While the specific Pt-Ni system is not discussed, these examples demonstrate how bimetallic catalysts can be used to improve activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Similar principles could potentially be applied to C=O bond hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, but further research would be needed to confirm this.

文献中没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni催化剂进行C=O键氢化用于精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化的具体问题。但是，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂在相关氢化反应中的相关信息：

1. 含有贵金属（如Pt）和IV族元素（Ti, Zr, Hf）的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性。

2. 添加第二种金属可以显著影响反应的选择性。例如，含Ni的双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中产生更多的C2-C3烃类，而单金属催化剂主要产生甲烷。

3. 氢化反应（如巯醛氢化）的选择性受反应物在催化剂表面吸附的影响。

4. WPt双金属催化剂在巯醇形成方面表现出比不含W的催化剂更高的活性，这表明双金属体系可以增强C=O键氢化的选择性。

虽然没有具体讨论Pt-Ni体系，但这些例子展示了双金属催化剂如何被用来提高氢化反应的活性和选择性。类似的原理可能适用于精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的C=O键氢化，但需要进一步的研究来确认这一点。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating noble metals like Pt with other metals, have shown enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts in various hydrogenation reactions. For example, SiO2-supported bimetallic catalysts containing Ni, Pd, or Pt along with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) demonstrated higher activity for CO hydrogenation than single noble metal catalysts.

The addition of a second metal can significantly affect reaction selectivity. In the case of Ni-containing bimetallics, the yield of C2-C3 hydrocarbons increased to 30%, while the monometallic catalyst produced almost exclusively methane.

The literature suggests that the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts may be due to the close association of the two metals, which can create unique adsorption sites. For instance, W ions near Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of molecules like crotonaldehyde, potentially facilitating the activation of C=O bonds through bifunctional interactions.

While the specific application to fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion is not addressed, these principles of bimetallic catalysis could potentially be applied to such processes to improve selectivity and efficiency in C=O bond hydrogenation. Further research would be needed to optimize these catalysts for specific applications and to fully understand the mechanisms involved.

文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni双金属催化剂进行C=O键催化加氢用于精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化。然而，它确实讨论了双金属催化剂在加氢反应中的相关概念。

双金属催化剂，尤其是那些将Pt等贵金属与其他金属结合的催化剂，在各种加氢反应中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性和选择性。例如，含有Ni、Pd或Pt以及IV族元素（Ti、Zr、Hf）的SiO2负载双金属催化剂在CO加氢反应中表现出比单一贵金属催化剂更高的活性。

第二种金属的添加可以显著影响反应的选择性。在含Ni的双金属催化剂中，C2-C3烃的产率增加到30%，而单金属催化剂几乎只产生甲烷。

文献表明，双金属催化剂性能的提高可能是由于两种金属的紧密结合，这可以创造独特的吸附位点。例如，靠近Pt原子的W离子可以参与巴豆醛等分子的化学吸附，通过双功能相互作用可能促进C=O键的活化。

虽然没有具体提到在精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化中的应用，但这些双金属催化原理可能适用于这些过程，以提高C=O键加氢的选择性和效率。需要进一步的研究来优化这些催化剂以适应特定应用，并充分理解所涉及的机制。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-W systems contributes to various industrial applications, particularly in the production of unsaturated alcohols for the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. These catalysts enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

To study and optimize this process, researchers employ both theoretical and experimental methodologies. They investigate the kinetics of the reaction and how it is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst surface. The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as WPt/γ-Al2O3, has shown higher activities for the formation of desired products (e.g., crotyl alcohol) compared to monometallic catalysts.

The enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the close association of different metal atoms (e.g., W ions with Pt atoms) on the catalyst surface. This arrangement allows for bifunctional interactions, facilitating the chemisorption and activation of the C=O bond. Researchers suggest that this leads to the formation of specific chemisorbed species, such as C- and O-bonded adsorbates, which contribute to the improved selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

While the literature does not specifically mention Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion, the principles and methodologies discussed for studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts can be applied to various metal combinations and reactions, including those relevant to fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-W系统)进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业应用都有贡献,特别是在食品、化妆品和制药行业生产不饱和醇方面。这些催化剂提高了加氢过程的选择性和效率。

为了研究和优化这一过程,研究人员采用理论和实验方法。他们研究反应的动力学,以及它如何受催化剂表面吸附反应物结构的影响。使用双金属催化剂(如WPt/γ-Al2O3)与单金属催化剂相比,在形成所需产品(如巴豆醇)方面表现出更高的活性。

双金属催化剂性能的提高归因于催化剂表面不同金属原子(如W离子与Pt原子)的紧密结合。这种排列允许双功能相互作用,促进C=O键的化学吸附和活化。研究人员认为,这导致了特定化学吸附物种的形成,如C-和O-键合吸附物,从而提高了加氢过程的选择性和效率。

虽然文献没有具体提到Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化,但讨论的研究和优化双金属催化剂的原理和方法可以应用于各种金属组合和反应,包括与精细化学品合成和生物质转化相关的反应。

The literature does not specifically discuss the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information on bimetallic catalysts for related hydrogenation reactions:

Bimetallic catalysts incorporating noble metals like Pt with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) showed higher activity for CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic noble metal catalysts. The addition of a second metal affected both activity and selectivity. For example, Ni-containing bimetallic catalysts produced more C2-C3 hydrocarbons compared to monometallic Ni catalysts which mainly produced methane.

CoRu bimetallic clusters supported on SiO2 or in zeolites demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for forming oxygenates like C1-C5 alcohols during CO hydrogenation compared to monometallic catalysts. Selectivity for alcohols reached up to 38%.

While not directly addressing C=O hydrogenation, these examples illustrate how bimetallic catalysts can enhance activity and tune selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Similar principles may apply for optimizing C=O hydrogenation catalysts, though further research would be needed to determine the specific effects for Pt-Ni systems and C=O bond hydrogenation.

The literature does not discuss specific methodologies for studying or optimizing these catalysts. However, the use of supported bimetallic clusters prepared from organometallic precursors is presented as an approach to create highly dispersed and well-defined bimetallic catalyst structures.
