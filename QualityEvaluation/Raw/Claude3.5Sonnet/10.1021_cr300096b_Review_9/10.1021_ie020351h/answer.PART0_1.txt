[1] "Selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[2] "The WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

[3] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. The selectivity and efficiency of this process are studied and optimized through both theoretical and experimental approaches.

Methodologies employed to study and enhance this process include:

1. Investigating the influence of catalyst structure on reaction kinetics and selectivity.

2. Comparing the performance of bimetallic catalysts to their monometallic counterparts.

3. Examining the role of the second metal (e.g., W in WPt catalysts) in facilitating C=O bond activation.

4. Studying the chemisorption of reactants on catalyst surfaces and the formation of specific adsorbed species.

5. Exploring bifunctional interactions between the two metals in the catalyst and their effects on reactant activation.

These methods aim to understand and optimize the catalytic process, potentially leading to more efficient and selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds in various applications.
