[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating noble metals like Pt with other metals, have shown enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts in various hydrogenation reactions. For example, SiO2-supported bimetallic catalysts containing Ni, Pd, or Pt along with group IV elements (Ti, Zr, Hf) demonstrated higher activity for CO hydrogenation than single noble metal catalysts.

The addition of a second metal can significantly affect reaction selectivity. In the case of Ni-containing bimetallics, the yield of C2-C3 hydrocarbons increased to 30%, while the monometallic catalyst produced almost exclusively methane.

The literature suggests that the enhanced performance of bimetallic catalysts may be due to the close association of the two metals, which can create unique adsorption sites. For instance, W ions near Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of molecules like crotonaldehyde, potentially facilitating the activation of C=O bonds through bifunctional interactions.

While the specific application to fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion is not addressed, these principles of bimetallic catalysis could potentially be applied to such processes to improve selectivity and efficiency in C=O bond hydrogenation. Further research would be needed to optimize these catalysts for specific applications and to fully understand the mechanisms involved.

文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni双金属催化剂进行C=O键催化加氢用于精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化。然而，它确实讨论了双金属催化剂在加氢反应中的相关概念。

双金属催化剂，尤其是那些将Pt等贵金属与其他金属结合的催化剂，在各种加氢反应中表现出比单金属催化剂更高的活性和选择性。例如，含有Ni、Pd或Pt以及IV族元素（Ti、Zr、Hf）的SiO2负载双金属催化剂在CO加氢反应中表现出比单一贵金属催化剂更高的活性。

第二种金属的添加可以显著影响反应的选择性。在含Ni的双金属催化剂中，C2-C3烃的产率增加到30%，而单金属催化剂几乎只产生甲烷。

文献表明，双金属催化剂性能的提高可能是由于两种金属的紧密结合，这可以创造独特的吸附位点。例如，靠近Pt原子的W离子可以参与巴豆醛等分子的化学吸附，通过双功能相互作用可能促进C=O键的活化。

虽然没有具体提到在精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化中的应用，但这些双金属催化原理可能适用于这些过程，以提高C=O键加氢的选择性和效率。需要进一步的研究来优化这些催化剂以适应特定应用，并充分理解所涉及的机制。
