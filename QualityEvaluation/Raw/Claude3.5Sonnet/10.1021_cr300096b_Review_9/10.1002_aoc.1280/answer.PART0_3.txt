The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss a related topic - the use of a bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

The study demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can be used to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. The researchers modified Pt/NaY zeolite with tetramethyltin to create a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species. This modification altered the electronic properties of the Pt atoms, weakening their deep hydrogenation ability and enhancing selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol production.

The methodology employed in this study included:
1. Catalyst preparation using surface organometallic chemistry
2. Characterization techniques such as FTIR, ICP, XRD, XPS, and nitrogen adsorption
3. Catalytic activity tests in a custom-made reactor under atmospheric pressure

While this specific study focused on furfural hydrogenation, the principles and methods used could potentially be applied to other C=O hydrogenation reactions in fine chemical synthesis or biomass conversion. The approach of modifying catalysts to tune their electronic properties and improve selectivity is broadly applicable in catalysis research and development.

这篇文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni双金属催化剂对C=O键进行催化氢化的问题，也未涉及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了一个相关的话题 - 使用Pt-Sn双金属催化剂选择性地将糠醛氢化为糠醇。

这项研究展示了如何利用双金属催化剂来提高氢化反应的选择性。研究人员用四甲基锡对Pt/NaY分子筛进行改性，创造了一种Me3SnPt表面双金属物种。这种改性改变了Pt原子的电子性质，减弱了其深度氢化能力，增强了对糠醇生成的选择性。

该研究采用的方法包括：
1. 使用表面有机金属化学方法制备催化剂
2. 采用FTIR、ICP、XRD、XPS和氮气吸附等表征技术
3. 在自制的常压反应器中进行催化活性测试

虽然这项具体研究集中在糠醛氢化上，但所使用的原理和方法可能适用于精细化学品合成或生物质转化中的其他C=O氢化反应。通过修饰催化剂来调节其电子性质并提高选择性的方法在催化研究和开发中具有广泛的适用性。
