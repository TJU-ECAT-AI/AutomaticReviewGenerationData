          [1] "Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin."

[2] "Platinum is a known hydrogenation catalyst. However, platinum can usually catalyze deep hydrogenation and activate undesired side and consecutive reactions."

[3] "Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites."

[4] "This study will provide a theoretical basis for designing at molecular level a catalyst for highly selective hydrogenation of furfural."

[5] "The catalytic tests were performed in a home made glass reactor (i.d. 18 mm) with a thermocouple under atmosphere pressure. Catalyst was packed into the reactor and pretreated with hydrogen from room temperature to 423 K at a heating rate of 5 K min1."

[6] "As-synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY was used to catalyze the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."

[7] "The grafted product has excellent selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."

          While the provided literature does not directly address Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, it discusses related concepts of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation that can be extended to answer the question:

1. Applications: The study focuses on the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, which is an important intermediate in the polymer industry. This demonstrates the relevance of catalytic C=O hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis.

2. Catalyst Design: The researchers use a bimetallic SnPt catalyst supported on NaY zeolite to enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. This approach of modifying catalyst electronic properties through bimetallic complexes is applicable to various catalytic systems, including potential Pt-Ni catalysts.

3. Methodologies:
   a. Catalyst Preparation: The study uses surface organometallic chemistry to prepare the bimetallic catalyst.
   b. Characterization: Various techniques such as FTIR, XRD, XPS, and TPD are employed to understand the structure and properties of the catalysts.
   c. Catalytic Testing: Activity tests are performed in a custom-made reactor under specific conditions to evaluate catalyst performance.
   d. Theoretical Modeling: The study aims to provide a theoretical basis for designing catalysts at the molecular level.

4. Enhancement of Selectivity and Efficiency: The bimetallic catalyst demonstrates improved selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, which tend to catalyze deep hydrogenation and undesired side reactions.

While the specific Pt-Ni system is not mentioned, the principles and methodologies discussed could potentially be applied to similar catalyst development efforts in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion.

          虽然所提供的文献并未直接讨论Pt-Ni双金属催化剂在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的C=O氢化应用，但它讨论了相关的选择性氢化双金属催化剂概念，可以扩展回答问题：

1. 应用：研究重点是糠醛选择性氢化为糠醇，这是聚合物工业中的一个重要中间体。这显示了催化C=O氢化在精细化学品合成中的相关性。

2. 催化剂设计：研究人员使用NaY沸石负载的SnPt双金属催化剂来提高氢化反应的选择性。通过双金属络合物修改催化剂电子性质的这种方法适用于各种催化系统，包括潜在的Pt-Ni催化剂。

3. 方法：
   a. 催化剂制备：研究使用表面有机金属化学方法制备双金属催化剂。
   b. 表征：采用FTIR、XRD、XPS和TPD等多种技术来了解催化剂的结构和性质。
   c. 催化测试：在特定条件下使用自制反应器进行活性测试，以评估催化剂性能。
   d. 理论建模：研究旨在为分子水平上设计催化剂提供理论基础。

4. 选择性和效率的提高：与倾向于催化深度氢化和不良副反应的单金属Pt催化剂相比，双金属催化剂表现出更好的选择性。

虽然没有具体提到Pt-Ni系统，但所讨论的原理和方法可能适用于精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化领域的类似催化剂开发工作。
