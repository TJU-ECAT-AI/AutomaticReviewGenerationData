[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The planar CAL molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of steric repulsion from the aromatic ring. In addition, the adsorption mode to the different planes of the metallic surface depends on the substrate particle size."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, cellulosic biomass conversion, or broader industrial applications of C=O hydrogenation. However, it does provide some relevant information on bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

The study focuses on Pt-Ru bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), which contains both C=C and C=O bonds. The research aims to optimize selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol (COL) by hydrogenating the C=O bond while leaving the C=C bond intact.

The methodology employed includes:
1. Synthesis of bimetallic Pt-Ru nanoparticles using different ligands and solvents
2. Confinement of nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes
3. Evaluation of catalytic performance in CAL hydrogenation
4. Analysis of selectivity and activity based on particle size and confinement effects

The study found that bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts showed high selectivity towards COL. Factors influencing selectivity included particle size and steric effects preventing parallel adsorption of the aromatic ring on the catalyst surface.

While not directly addressing the broader scope of the question, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation, which could be relevant to other industrial applications involving similar chemistries.

虽然该文献没有直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、纤维素生物质转化或C=O氢化的更广泛工业应用的具体问题，但它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂选择性氢化的相关信息：

该研究着重于Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子催化剂，用于肉桂醛（CAL）的选择性氢化，CAL同时含有C=C和C=O键。研究旨在通过氢化C=O键而保持C=C键不变，来优化对肉桂醇（COL）的选择性。

采用的方法包括：
1. 使用不同的配体和溶剂合成Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子
2. 将纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管中
3. 评估CAL氢化中的催化性能
4. 基于粒子大小和限域效应分析选择性和活性

研究发现，双金属Pt-Ru催化剂对COL表现出高选择性。影响选择性的因素包括粒子大小和立体效应，这些效应阻止了芳香环在催化剂表面的平行吸附。

虽然没有直接涉及问题的更广泛范围，但这项研究展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性C=O氢化的方法，这可能与涉及类似化学反应的其他工业应用相关。
