[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The planar CAL molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of steric repulsion from the aromatic ring. In addition, the adsorption mode to the different planes of the metallic surface depends on the substrate particle size."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, cellulosic biomass conversion, or broader industrial applications of C=O hydrogenation. However, it does provide some relevant information on bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation:

The study focuses on Pt-Ru bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), which contains both C=C and C=O bonds. The research aims to optimize selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol (COL) by hydrogenating the C=O bond while leaving the C=C bond intact.

The methodology employed includes:
1. Synthesis of bimetallic Pt-Ru nanoparticles using different ligands and solvents
2. Confinement of nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes
3. Evaluation of catalytic performance in CAL hydrogenation
4. Analysis of selectivity and activity based on particle size and confinement effects

The study found that bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts showed high selectivity towards COL. Factors influencing selectivity included particle size and steric effects preventing parallel adsorption of the aromatic ring on the catalyst surface.

While not directly addressing the broader scope of the question, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation, which could be relevant to other industrial applications involving similar chemistries.

虽然该文献没有直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、纤维素生物质转化或C=O氢化的更广泛工业应用的具体问题，但它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂选择性氢化的相关信息：

该研究着重于Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子催化剂，用于肉桂醛（CAL）的选择性氢化，CAL同时含有C=C和C=O键。研究旨在通过氢化C=O键而保持C=C键不变，来优化对肉桂醇（COL）的选择性。

采用的方法包括：
1. 使用不同的配体和溶剂合成Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子
2. 将纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管中
3. 评估CAL氢化中的催化性能
4. 基于粒子大小和限域效应分析选择性和活性

研究发现，双金属Pt-Ru催化剂对COL表现出高选择性。影响选择性的因素包括粒子大小和立体效应，这些效应阻止了芳香环在催化剂表面的平行吸附。

虽然没有直接涉及问题的更广泛范围，但这项研究展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性C=O氢化的方法，这可能与涉及类似化学反应的其他工业应用相关。

[3] "Theoretical calculations have shown, furthermore, that aromatic rings that are chemisorbed on a metal surface must lie at a distance exceeding 0.3nm because there is an energy barrier that prevents a closer approach to the surface. As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, industrial applications, or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information about bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Ru in this case) for selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds.

The study evaluates Pt-Ru nanocatalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), which involves C=O bond hydrogenation. This serves as a benchmark reaction for studying catalyst performance. The main products observed were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL), indicating selective hydrogenation of C=O and C=C bonds.

To optimize selectivity, the researchers investigated factors like particle size, confinement in carbon nanotubes, and ligand effects. They found that larger particle sizes tended to improve selectivity towards C=O hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggested that aromatic rings cannot approach the metal surface as closely as C=O bonds due to an energy barrier, leading to preferential C=O hydrogenation on larger particles.

While not specifically addressing industrial applications, this type of fundamental research on selective hydrogenation contributes to understanding and improving catalytic processes that could be applied in fine chemical synthesis and other industries. The methodologies employed include experimental synthesis and characterization of catalysts, catalytic testing, and theoretical calculations to explain observed selectivity trends.

文献并未直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、工业应用或纤维素生物质转化的具体问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂（在这种情况下是Pt-Ru）用于C=O键选择性氢化的相关信息。

该研究评估了Pt-Ru纳米催化剂在肉桂醛（CAL）选择性氢化方面的性能，这涉及C=O键的氢化。这作为研究催化剂性能的基准反应。观察到的主要产物是肉桂醇（COL）、氢化肉桂醛（HCAL）和氢化肉桂醇（HCOL），表明C=O和C=C键的选择性氢化。

为了优化选择性，研究人员调查了粒子大小、在碳纳米管中的限域以及配体效应等因素。他们发现，较大的粒子尺寸往往可以提高对C=O氢化的选择性。理论计算表明，由于存在能量屏障，芳香环无法像C=O键那样靠近金属表面，导致在较大粒子上优先进行C=O氢化。

虽然没有具体提到工业应用，但这种关于选择性氢化的基础研究有助于理解和改进可应用于精细化学品合成和其他行业的催化过程。所采用的方法包括催化剂的实验合成和表征、催化测试以及理论计算，以解释观察到的选择性趋势。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or its applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation.

The study employs experimental methodologies to investigate and optimize the selectivity and efficiency of this process. The researchers evaluated the catalytic performance of PtRu nanoparticles, both unsupported and confined in carbon nanotubes, for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. They found that confined catalysts showed superior performance compared to unsupported ones, with higher activity and selectivity towards the desired product (cinnamyl alcohol).

The enhanced performance of confined catalysts was attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside the carbon nanotubes. The study also explored the effects of different ligands, particle sizes, and preparation methods on catalyst performance.

While this research doesn't directly address industrial applications, it demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to various fields including fine chemical synthesis.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键的催化氢化及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。但是，它确实讨论了使用双金属Pt-Ru催化剂选择性氢化肉桂醛，这涉及C=O键的氢化。

该研究采用实验方法来研究和优化这一过程的选择性和效率。研究人员评估了未支撑和限制在碳纳米管中的PtRu纳米粒子在肉桂醛氢化反应中的催化性能。他们发现，与未支撑的催化剂相比，限制在碳纳米管中的催化剂表现出更优异的性能，对目标产物（肉桂醇）具有更高的活性和选择性。

限制催化剂性能的提高被归因于碳纳米管内反应物和催化剂的局部浓度更高。该研究还探讨了不同配体、粒子尺寸和制备方法对催化剂性能的影响。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及工业应用，但它展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性氢化反应的方法，这可能与包括精细化学品合成在内的各个领域相关。

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, cellulosic biomass conversion, or industrial applications of C=O hydrogenation. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

The study focuses on Pt-Ru nanoparticles for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation. The researchers found that confining the bimetallic nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes improved both catalytic activity and selectivity compared to unsupported nanoparticles. 

They used various experimental methodologies to study and optimize the process, including:

2. Using different ligands to stabilize the nanoparticles
3. Confining nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes
4. Analyzing particle size and distribution using TEM
5. Evaluating catalytic performance through hydrogenation reactions

The study found that particle size affected selectivity, with larger particles generally providing higher selectivity towards the desired product (cinnamyl alcohol). The confinement effect in carbon nanotubes was also found to enhance catalytic performance, possibly due to higher local concentrations of reactants.

While this study doesn't directly address industrial applications, the insights gained about improving selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts could potentially be applied to other hydrogenation reactions in fine chemical synthesis or related fields.
