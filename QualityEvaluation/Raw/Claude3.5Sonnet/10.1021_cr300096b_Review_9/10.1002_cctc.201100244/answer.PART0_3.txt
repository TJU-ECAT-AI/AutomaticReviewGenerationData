The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss related concepts involving bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

The study focuses on bimetallic platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles (PtRuNPs) and their application in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. These catalysts were prepared using different methods and supports, including confinement in carbon nanotubes. The research demonstrates that confined PtRu nanoparticles exhibited higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to unsupported nanoparticles in this reaction.

While not directly addressing the specific systems mentioned in the question, this work illustrates methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of catalytic hydrogenation processes. These include:

1. Preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles using different solvents and stabilizing ligands.
2. Confinement of nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes to improve catalytic performance.
3. Evaluation of catalytic activity and selectivity in a model reaction (cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation).
4. Investigation of factors influencing selectivity, such as particle size and confinement effects.

These approaches could potentially be applied or adapted to study other bimetallic systems, including Pt-Ni, for various hydrogenation reactions in industrial and research applications.

该文献并未直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统催化加氢C=O键及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了涉及双金属Pt-Ru催化剂用于选择性加氢的相关概念。

研究重点关注双金属铂-钌纳米粒子（PtRuNPs）及其在肉桂醛选择性加氢中的应用。这些催化剂使用不同的方法和载体制备，包括在碳纳米管中的限制。研究表明，在这个反应中，限制在碳纳米管中的PtRu纳米粒子比未受支持的纳米粒子表现出更高的催化活性和选择性。

虽然没有直接涉及问题中提到的具体系统，但这项工作展示了用于研究、优化和提高催化加氢过程的选择性和效率的方法。这些方法包括：

1. 使用不同溶剂和稳定配体制备双金属纳米粒子。
2. 将纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管中以提高催化性能。
3. 在模型反应（肉桂醛加氢）中评估催化活性和选择性。
4. 研究影响选择性的因素，如粒子大小和限制效应。

这些方法可能适用于或可以改编用于研究其他双金属系统，包括Pt-Ni，以用于各种工业和研究应用中的加氢反应。
