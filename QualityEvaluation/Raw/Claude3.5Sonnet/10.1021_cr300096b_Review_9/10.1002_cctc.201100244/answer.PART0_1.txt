[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Theoretical calculations have shown, furthermore, that aromatic rings that are chemisorbed on a metal surface must lie at a distance exceeding 0.3nm because there is an energy barrier that prevents a closer approach to the surface. As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, industrial applications, or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does provide some relevant information about bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Ru in this case) for selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds.

The study evaluates Pt-Ru nanocatalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), which involves C=O bond hydrogenation. This serves as a benchmark reaction for studying catalyst performance. The main products observed were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL), indicating selective hydrogenation of C=O and C=C bonds.

To optimize selectivity, the researchers investigated factors like particle size, confinement in carbon nanotubes, and ligand effects. They found that larger particle sizes tended to improve selectivity towards C=O hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggested that aromatic rings cannot approach the metal surface as closely as C=O bonds due to an energy barrier, leading to preferential C=O hydrogenation on larger particles.

While not specifically addressing industrial applications, this type of fundamental research on selective hydrogenation contributes to understanding and improving catalytic processes that could be applied in fine chemical synthesis and other industries. The methodologies employed include experimental synthesis and characterization of catalysts, catalytic testing, and theoretical calculations to explain observed selectivity trends.

文献并未直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、工业应用或纤维素生物质转化的具体问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂（在这种情况下是Pt-Ru）用于C=O键选择性氢化的相关信息。

该研究评估了Pt-Ru纳米催化剂在肉桂醛（CAL）选择性氢化方面的性能，这涉及C=O键的氢化。这作为研究催化剂性能的基准反应。观察到的主要产物是肉桂醇（COL）、氢化肉桂醛（HCAL）和氢化肉桂醇（HCOL），表明C=O和C=C键的选择性氢化。

为了优化选择性，研究人员调查了粒子大小、在碳纳米管中的限域以及配体效应等因素。他们发现，较大的粒子尺寸往往可以提高对C=O氢化的选择性。理论计算表明，由于存在能量屏障，芳香环无法像C=O键那样靠近金属表面，导致在较大粒子上优先进行C=O氢化。

虽然没有具体提到工业应用，但这种关于选择性氢化的基础研究有助于理解和改进可应用于精细化学品合成和其他行业的催化过程。所采用的方法包括催化剂的实验合成和表征、催化测试以及理论计算，以解释观察到的选择性趋势。
