          [1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The planar CAL molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of steric repulsion from the aromatic ring. In addition, the adsorption mode to the different planes of the metallic surface depends on the substrate particle size."

[5] "Theoretical calculations have shown, furthermore, that aromatic rings that are chemisorbed on a metal surface must lie at a distance exceeding 0.3nm because there is an energy barrier that prevents a closer approach to the surface. As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially."

[6] "The catalytic study has shown the superiority of confined catalysts over unsupported PtRuNPs. The results obtained for confined catalysts regarding activity and selectivity can be attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside MWCNTs."

[7] "Bimetallic platinumruthenium nanoparticles (PtRuNPs) stabilised by pyridine- and monophosphine-based ligands were prepared either in supercritical CO2 or in THF."

[8] "These materials were applied to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."

[9] "The higher selectivity achieved with 5b@MWCNT compared to the other catalytic systems is attributable to the larger particle size observed for this confined system"

          While the provided literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, cellulosic biomass conversion, or broader industrial applications of C=O hydrogenation, it offers relevant information on bimetallic catalysts (specifically Pt-Ru) for selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds.

The study focuses on Pt-Ru bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL), which contains both C=C and C=O bonds. The research aims to optimize selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol (COL) by hydrogenating the C=O bond while leaving the C=C bond intact.

Methodologies employed in this study include:
1. Synthesis of bimetallic Pt-Ru nanoparticles using different ligands and solvents (THF and supercritical CO2)
2. Confinement of nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
3. Evaluation of catalytic performance in CAL hydrogenation
4. Analysis of selectivity and activity based on particle size and confinement effects
5. Theoretical calculations to explain observed selectivity trends

Key findings include:
1. Bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts showed high selectivity towards COL.
2. Confined catalysts in MWCNTs exhibited superior performance compared to unsupported nanoparticles, attributed to higher local concentration of reactants and catalysts.
3. Larger particle sizes generally improved selectivity towards C=O hydrogenation.
4. Theoretical calculations suggested that aromatic rings cannot approach the metal surface as closely as C=O bonds due to an energy barrier, leading to preferential C=O hydrogenation on larger particles.

While not directly addressing the broader scope of the question, this research demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation, which could be relevant to other industrial applications involving similar chemistries, including fine chemical synthesis.

          虽然所提供的文献没有直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、纤维素生物质转化或C=O氢化的更广泛工业应用的具体问题，但它确实提供了关于双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-Ru）用于C=O键选择性氢化的相关信息。

该研究集中在Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子催化剂用于肉桂醛（CAL）的选择性氢化，CAL同时含有C=C和C=O键。研究旨在通过氢化C=O键而保持C=C键不变，来优化对肉桂醇（COL）的选择性。

这项研究采用的方法包括：
1. 使用不同的配体和溶剂（THF和超临界CO2）合成Pt-Ru双金属纳米粒子
2. 将纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管（MWCNTs）中
3. 评估CAL氢化中的催化性能
4. 基于粒子大小和限域效应分析选择性和活性
5. 进行理论计算以解释观察到的选择性趋势

主要发现包括：
1. 双金属Pt-Ru催化剂对COL表现出高选择性。
2. 限制在MWCNTs中的催化剂比未支撑的纳米粒子表现出更优异的性能，这归因于反应物和催化剂的局部浓度更高。
3. 较大的粒子尺寸通常可以提高对C=O氢化的选择性。
4. 理论计算表明，由于存在能量屏障，芳香环无法像C=O键那样靠近金属表面，导致在较大粒子上优先进行C=O氢化。

虽然没有直接涉及问题的更广泛范围，但这项研究展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性C=O氢化的方法，这可能与涉及类似化学反应的其他工业应用相关，包括精细化学品合成。
