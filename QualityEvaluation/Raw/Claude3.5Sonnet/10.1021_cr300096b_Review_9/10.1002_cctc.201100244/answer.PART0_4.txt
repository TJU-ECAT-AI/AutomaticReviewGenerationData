The literature does not directly address the specific question about Pt-Ni catalysts, cellulosic biomass conversion, or industrial applications of C=O hydrogenation. However, it does discuss related concepts of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

The study focuses on Pt-Ru nanoparticles for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation. The researchers found that confining the bimetallic nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes improved both catalytic activity and selectivity compared to unsupported nanoparticles. 

They used various experimental methodologies to study and optimize the process, including:
1. Synthesizing nanoparticles in different solvents (THF and supercritical CO2)
2. Using different ligands to stabilize the nanoparticles
3. Confining nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes
4. Analyzing particle size and distribution using TEM
5. Evaluating catalytic performance through hydrogenation reactions

The study found that particle size affected selectivity, with larger particles generally providing higher selectivity towards the desired product (cinnamyl alcohol). The confinement effect in carbon nanotubes was also found to enhance catalytic performance, possibly due to higher local concentrations of reactants.

While this study doesn't directly address industrial applications, the insights gained about improving selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts could potentially be applied to other hydrogenation reactions in fine chemical synthesis or related fields.

该文献并未直接涉及Pt-Ni催化剂、纤维素生物质转化或C=O氢化的工业应用等具体问题。但是，它确实讨论了相关的双金属Pt-Ru催化剂用于选择性氢化的概念。

这项研究主要集中在Pt-Ru纳米粒子用于肉桂醛的选择性氢化，该过程涉及C=O键的氢化。研究人员发现，将双金属纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管中，与未支撑的纳米粒子相比，可以提高催化活性和选择性。

他们使用了各种实验方法来研究和优化这一过程，包括：
1. 在不同溶剂（THF和超临界CO2）中合成纳米粒子
2. 使用不同的配体来稳定纳米粒子
3. 将纳米粒子限制在碳纳米管中
4. 使用TEM分析粒子大小和分布
5. 通过氢化反应评估催化性能

研究发现，粒子大小影响选择性，较大的粒子通常对目标产物（肉桂醇）提供更高的选择性。碳纳米管中的限制效应也被发现可以增强催化性能，这可能是由于反应物的局部浓度更高。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及工业应用，但关于提高双金属催化剂选择性和活性的见解可能适用于精细化学品合成或相关领域的其他氢化反应。
