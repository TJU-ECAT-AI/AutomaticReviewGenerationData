[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The catalytic study has shown the superiority of confined catalysts over unsupported PtRuNPs. The results obtained for confined catalysts regarding activity and selectivity can be attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside MWCNTs."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems or its applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of bimetallic Pt-Ru catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, which involves C=O bond hydrogenation.

The study employs experimental methodologies to investigate and optimize the selectivity and efficiency of this process. The researchers evaluated the catalytic performance of PtRu nanoparticles, both unsupported and confined in carbon nanotubes, for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. They found that confined catalysts showed superior performance compared to unsupported ones, with higher activity and selectivity towards the desired product (cinnamyl alcohol).

The enhanced performance of confined catalysts was attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside the carbon nanotubes. The study also explored the effects of different ligands, particle sizes, and preparation methods on catalyst performance.

While this research doesn't directly address industrial applications, it demonstrates approaches to studying and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, which could be relevant to various fields including fine chemical synthesis.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统进行C=O键的催化氢化及其在精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化中的应用。但是，它确实讨论了使用双金属Pt-Ru催化剂选择性氢化肉桂醛，这涉及C=O键的氢化。

该研究采用实验方法来研究和优化这一过程的选择性和效率。研究人员评估了未支撑和限制在碳纳米管中的PtRu纳米粒子在肉桂醛氢化反应中的催化性能。他们发现，与未支撑的催化剂相比，限制在碳纳米管中的催化剂表现出更优异的性能，对目标产物（肉桂醇）具有更高的活性和选择性。

限制催化剂性能的提高被归因于碳纳米管内反应物和催化剂的局部浓度更高。该研究还探讨了不同配体、粒子尺寸和制备方法对催化剂性能的影响。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及工业应用，但它展示了研究和优化双金属催化剂用于选择性氢化反应的方法，这可能与包括精细化学品合成在内的各个领域相关。
