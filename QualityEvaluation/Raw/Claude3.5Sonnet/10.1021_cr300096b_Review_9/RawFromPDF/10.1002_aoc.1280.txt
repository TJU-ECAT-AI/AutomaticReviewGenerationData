The grafting reaction of SnMe4 on the surface of Pt/NaY zeolite was investigated in a 1.6 × 104 Pa
hydrogen atmosphere. The chemical compositions, structure and properties of the resulting solid
were characterized by in situ FTIR, ICP, XRD, XPS, temperature programmed decomposition and
nitrogen adsorption. The results show that Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite react with tetramethyltin to
form a bimetallic Me3Sn–Pt surface species in the presence of hydrogen at 353 K. The reaction does
not destroy the zeolite framework, while its surface properties are changed. The BET surface area
and the pore volume of the zeolite decrease signiﬁcantly. The CO chemisorption results and the XPS
results show that the electronic properties of the modiﬁed Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite are
altered remarkably by the inductive effect of electron between Pt and methyl groups. The grafted
product has excellent selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Copyright 2007 John

INTRODUCTION
Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer
industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan
resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin. At present, furfuryl
alcohol is prepared mainly by the catalytic hydrogenation
of furfural in gaseous or liquid phase.1–4 A commercial
process is the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural
over Cu–Cr catalyst. However, the toxicity, high energy
consumption and moderate activity of this catalyst provide a
challenge to develop a new high-efﬁciency catalyst without
chromium. Recently, a few works concerning the gaseous

phase hydrogenation of furfural over carbon-supported
copper,1,5 Raney nickel,6 nickel amorphous alloys,7–9 mixed
copper–zinc oxides doped with Al, Mn and Fe10 and
homogeneous complexes of Rh, Ru and Pt11 have been
published, but the selectivity of these catalysts still does not
reach commercial requirements. Therefore, the development
of highly selective catalysts is currently a crucial goal.
Platinum is a known hydrogenation catalyst. However,
platinum can usually catalyze deep hydrogenation and
activate undesired side and consecutive reactions. Very
recently, Kije’nski12 reported that platinum deposited on
supports (SiO2, γ -Al2O3, MgO, TiO2) covered with a
transition metal oxide monolayer (TiO2, V2O5, ZrO2) had
high selectivity for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol
at temperatures from 423 to 573 K. The difference between
the electronegativity of Pt and that of the transitional metal
resulted in a strong polarization of the catalyst surface, which
was considered to be the reason for the high selectivity.
Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of
surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation
via formation of a bimetallic Sn–Pt complex in the channel
pores of zeolites. This concept has been demonstrated by the

selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to an unsaturable
alcohol over a Pt–SiO2 catalyst modiﬁed by organotin
complex.13,14 Our previous results also indicated that the
modiﬁed HY zeolite by tetraalkyltin exhibited better size
selectivity in the absorption of hydrocarbons, and the surface
properties changed.15–17
In this study, a well-deﬁned surface Sn–Pt bimetallic
complex in NaY zeolite was prepared through surface
organometallic chemistry (SOMC). The structure of the
surface species was characterized by XRD, CO-TPD, in situ
FTIR and XPS. The selective hydrogenation of furfural as a
model reaction was used to examine the catalytic properties
of the surface complex. It was found that the catalyst showed
better performance in comparison with the parent Pt/NaY.
This study will provide a theoretical basis for designing at
molecular level a catalyst for highly selective hydrogenation
of furfural.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
NH4Y zeolite was obtained from Aldrich (Si : Al = 5.0).
Tetramethyltin (SnMe4, 99.5%) was purchased from Aldrich.
H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (AR grade) was purchased from Shanghai
Chem. Co.
Preparation of the Pt/NaY zeolite
NH4Y zeolite was calcined at 793 K under ﬂowing oxygen for
10 h to completely transform it into HY zeolite. NaY zeolite
was prepared by the treatment of HY zeolite with a dilute
solution of NaOH at 353 K for 2 h. The resulting solid was
dried in air overnight at 373 K, and calcined at 773 K for
2 h. Then the NaY zeolite was immersed in the appropriate
amount of an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (AR grade)
at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting powder was
dried in air overnight at 383 K, and then incessantly heated
in tube furnace with a ramping of 1 K min−1 to 473, 573,
623 and 673 K and maintained at each temperature for 0.5 h.
Subsequently, the temperature increased from 673 to 773 K.
After holding for 4 h, the sample was ﬂushed with N2 and
reduced under H2 for 5 h at this temperature. When the
temperature decreased to room temperature, the sample was
transferred into a desiccator ﬁlled with He. The as-prepared
Pt/NaY zeolite was used as a starting material for preparing
organotin-grafted samples.
Preparation of (Me)3Sn–Pt/NaY
The amount of Pt/NaY zeolite was enclosed in home-
made glass equipment and treated under dynamic vacuum
(0.133 Pa) at 673 K for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature,
the
reactor
was
ﬁlled
with
1.6 × 104 Pa
of
hydrogen.
Subsequently, an amount of liquid tetramethyltin was
introduced to the reaction system with a syringe via a
septum. The reactor was kept at the temperature 373 K for
24 h to ensure a complete reaction. The evolved gases were
analyzed by gas phase chromatogram (GC). Elimination of
hydrogen and unreacted SnMe4 was achieved by treatment
under vacuum at this temperature for 1 h.
The reaction was also monitored by in situ infrared
spectroscopy. A 20–30 mg aliquot of Pt/NaY zeolite was
pressed as a disk (diameter 18 mm) and used to redo the
experiment under the same conditions as above.
Physico-chemical characterization
The evolved gases were analyzed using an Agilent 6890 GC
equipped with an FID detector. The chromatography used
a HP-PLOT Al2O3 capillary column. The supporting gas
was He.
The content of tin in the resulting solid was determined
by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) after the sample was
dissolved completely using diluted hydrochloric acid and a
small amount of hydroﬂuoric acid. The ICP measurements
were carried out using a model ICPQ-100. The content of
carbon in the resulting solid was analyzed using a Vario EL
III elemental analyzer (EA).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed
with a Brucker Advance D8 X-ray power diffractometer with
Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) at a scan speed of 0.2 in
increments of 0.0–2.2θ.
In situ infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus
670 FTIR Spectrometer. The BET surface area was detected
by N2 adsorption with an OMNISORP 100CX gas adsorb
analyzer.
XPS spectra were recorded on a PHI-5300/ESCA Spec-
trometer (Al/Mg dianode, 0.8 eV energy resolution, 45◦angle
resolution and 80 kCPS sensitivity). The base pressure was
maintained at 2.0 × 10−7 Pa during XPS analysis (energy
3.0 kV, current 25 mA). Powder samples were mounted on
sample stubs with conductive carbon tape. The sputtering
was operated at 30 kV, 25 mA and 4 nm min−1, and argon ion
bombardment was used. The analyzed area was 8 × 8 mm2.
The C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as the reference to calculate
the binding energies (BE).
Experiments of temperature-programmed CO desorption
(CO-TPD) was performed on an Autochem 2910 automatic
catalyst characterization system. The loading amount of the
sample was 0.2000 g. The ﬂow rate of the supporting gas (He
for TPD) was 30 ml min−1 and the heating rate was 5 K min−1.
Catalytic activity tests
The catalytic tests were performed in a home made
glass reactor (i.d. 18 mm) with a thermocouple under
atmosphere pressure. Catalyst was packed into the reactor
and pretreated with hydrogen from room temperature to
423 K at a heating rate of 5 K min−1. The furfural liquid
was added into the hydrogen steam using a peristaltic
pump. The reactant mixture was passed through the reactor.
The reaction products were cooled and analyzed using
a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 GC) equipped with
an FID detector. The chromatograph used an HP-FFAP

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reactivity of SnMe4 on Pt/NaY zeolite
The FTIR spectra of HY zeolite in the range of 4000–2400 cm−1
is shown in Fig. 1. After treatment under dynamic vacuum
at 673 K for 3 h, zeolite showed three vibration adsorption
bands at 3744, 3669 and 3600 cm−1, which could be assigned
to external non-acidic silanol groups, supercage acidic
hydroxyl groups and inaccessible other acidic hydroxyl
groups [Fig. 1(a)],18 respectively. However, both supercage
acidic hydroxyls at 3669 cm−1 and acidic hydroxyls at
3600 cm−1 in Pt/NaY zeolite are largely decreased [Fig. 1(b)],
indicating that a majority of acidic hydroxyls are eliminated
by –OH. When SnMe4 is contacted with Pt/NaY zeolite at
353 K, and kept at this temperature for 24 h under vacuum
conditions, supercage acidic hydroxyl groups disappear
completely, and C–H stretching vibration adsorptions of
methyl and methylene appear at 2800–3000 cm−1 [Fig. 1(d)].
Gas chromatography analysis revealed that per gram Pt/NaY
zeolite (2% of Pt) reacting with excess of SnMe4 under the
same conditions as above resulted in 0.11 mmol of MeH. It
indicated that SnMe4 reacted with remanent supercage acid
hydroxyls at this temperature.15 After the unreacted SnMe4
and gaseous products are removed, 1.6 × 104 Pa of hydrogen
and excess SnMe4 are introduced into the reaction system at
353 K, and held for 24 h at this temperature in the hydrogen
atmosphere, the band intensity at 2800–3000 cm−1 clearly
increased [Fig. 1(e)], while the acidic hydroxyls at 3600 cm−1
did not change. In the meantime, 0.10 mmol of MeH was
obtained. This indicates that SnMe4 reacts with absorbed
hydrogen,19 thereby the second grafting reaction occurs on
the surface Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite.

Some evident change could be observed from the IR
spectrum of CO chemisorption at 293 K (Fig. 2). For the
parent Pt/NaY zeolite [Fig. 2(a)], its IR spectrum in the
range 1750–2200 cm−1 was composed of two IR bands,
one, which was assignable to the Pt–CO linear vibrator,
appeared at 2060 cm−1; the other, which was attributed to
bridged CO species, occurred at 1870 cm−1.20–24 However,
after the second grafting reaction, the bridged CO band
at 1870 cm−1 disappeared. This indicates indirectly that a
majority of Pt atoms react with SnMe4 to form bimetallic
Pt–Sn organometallic complexes, while those unreacted
Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite may be highly
isolated. In the meantime, the band at 2060 cm−1 shifts to
low wavenumbers due to the increasing electron feedback
from metal to CO molecules, and its absorption intensity
clearly decreases. These change suggest that the electronic
properties of Pt atoms on surface of NaY zeolite are altered
by the introduction of tetramethyltin.
Structural characterization of the modiﬁed
sample
Comparison of the XRD patterns of Pt/NaY and the modiﬁed
Pt/NaY sample (Fig. 3) shows that their structures are
essentially the same and the diffraction intensity changes
slightly, which suggests that the grafting reaction does not
destroy the framework structure and the reaction occurs only
on the surface of zeolite. The texture parameters (Table 1)
showed that the Pt/NaY zeolite retained the microporous
characteristics after modiﬁcation. BET surface area, micropore
volume and total pore volume of the modiﬁed Pt/NaY zeolite

decreased remarkably, indicating that the surface properties
of the Pt/NaY zeolite changed after the reaction.
CO-TPD and XPS characterization of the
modiﬁed sample
Figure 4 presents TPD spectra of CO on NaY, Pt/NaY and
Me3Sn–Pt/NaY. The CO-TPD proﬁles of these samples
consist of only a broad desorption peak in the 350–900 K
region. Obviously, the higher temperature of CO desorption
on Pt-modiﬁed NaY zeolite was obtained due to the strong
adsorption between CO and Pt in comparison with the
parent NaY zeolite. However, after the modiﬁcation, the CO
desorption temperature decreased because of the existence
of organotin surface complex, and even the initial desorption
temperature was lower than that of NaY. This indicates that
the grafting reaction results in reducing surface adsorption
capacity of Pt atoms, further conﬁrming that the electronic
properties of Pt atoms change after modiﬁcation. The XPS
analytic result on the Me3Sn–Pt/NaY Sample also conﬁrms
this.
As is listed in Table 2, for Pt/NaY, the binding energy of Pt
(4f7/2) equals 71.50 eV. However, after SnMe4 was grafted onto
Pt atoms in Pt/NaY zeolite, the binding energy of Pt (4f7/2)
split into 71.20 and 74.68 eV.25,26 This change in the binding
energy conﬁrms that SnMe4 reacts with Pt atoms in Pt/NaY
zeolite, and shows that two different Pt species exist in the
supercages of NaY zeolite.27 This is in agreement with the
above IR results of CO chemisorption. The binding energies of
Sn3d3/2 and Sn3d5/2 are 495.48 and 486.98 eV, respectively.28,29
The difference between these values is 8.50 eV, indicating that
tin exists in the form of Sn4+, but not in the form of Sn0.30,31
Catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of
furfural
The above experimental results show that a bimetallic
Me3Sn–Pt surface complex in NaY zeolite can be successfully
prepared by the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms
in the H2 atmosphere. It is well known that methyl is
an organic group with ample electrons. In principle, it
can transfer electrons to Pt atom by the intermediate Sn
atoms so as to increase the electron density around Pt
atom, consequently weakening the absorption of Pt atom
to hydrogen. Theoretically, the inductive effect of electrons
between methyl and Pt inevitably impairs the hydrogenation
ability of Pt to unsaturate hydrocarbons. Enhancement of the
selectivity of hydrogenation of Pt may be realized.
In order to validate above theoretical deduction, as-
synthesized bimetallic Me3Sn–Pt/NaY was used to catalyze
the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The primary
experiment results are listed in Table 3. Despite there being
no signiﬁcant change in the conversion ratio of Furfural,
it is worth noting that the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol
was enhanced prominently in comparison with that of
Pt/NaY zeolite. It can be seen from the above experimental
results that, for as-synthesized bimetallic Me3Sn–Pt/NaY,
notwithstanding that some unreacted Pt atoms and Me3Sn–O
complexes exist in the supercage of NaY zeolite, surely the
Me3Sn–O complexes is not responsible for the reaction,
and those unreacted Pt atoms also do not play a role

in enhancing the selectivity since Pt atoms can catalyze
deep furfural hydrogenation.32 Indeed, a key factor is the
surface Me3Sn–Pt complexes. In addition, the stereo effect of
methyl may be propitious to producing unsaturated alcohol
(UOL).33 Comprehensive evaluation of catalysis activity and
optimization of the synthesis conditions will be further
investigated in later work.
CONCLUSION
Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite can react with tetramethyltin to
form a bimetallic Me3Sn–Pt surface species in the presence of
hydrogen at 353 K. Per-gram Pt/NaY (2% of Pt) reacting with
excessive of SnMe4 at 353 K for 24 h results in 0.085 mmol
Sn grafted on the surface of Pt atoms. After modiﬁcation,
the crystal structure of Pt/NaY zeolite is not destroyed, but
the surface properties are changed. The BET surface area and
the pore volume of zeolite decrease, while the microporous
structure is retained. The CO chemisorption results and the
XPS results show that the electronic properties of the modiﬁed
Pt atoms on surface of NaY zeolite are altered remarkably
by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl
groups, consequently weakening the deep hydrogenation
ability of Pt to furfural, and enhancing the selectivity of
furfuryl alcohol. The bimetallic Me3Sn–Pt surface species is
responsible for the enhancement of the selectivity.
