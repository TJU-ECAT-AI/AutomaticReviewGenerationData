[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries"

[2] "Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of such reactions."

[3] "Research efforts have been devoted to improve the selectivity toward the desired unsaturated alcohol CALC. Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD"

[4] "Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts. It has been reported that metal promoters, such as Ga, Co and Ru, play a vital role in CALD hydrogenation in the presence of supported Pt nanoparticles due to the synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems is important for various industrial and research applications, particularly in the pharmaceutical and fragrance industries. It contributes to fine chemical synthesis through selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds, with the conversion of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) being a representative example.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains. These include:

1. Investigating different support materials and modifying surface chemistry of supports to enhance catalytic performance.

2. Introducing a second metal to form bimetallic catalysts, which can drastically change the catalytic properties due to synergetic interactions between active sites and promoters.

3. Exploring various preparation methods, such as microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), which can lead to superior catalytic properties compared to conventional methods like impregnation.

4. Utilizing characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain insights into the physicochemical properties of catalysts.

5. Employing electrochemistry measurements and competitive hydrogenation reactions to probe the electron density and nature of the catalytic nanoparticles.

These methodologies aim to improve the activity and selectivity of catalysts for the desired product, addressing challenges such as the formation of unwanted by-products and the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of C=C bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.
