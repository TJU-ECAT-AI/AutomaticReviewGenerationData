[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries"

[2] "Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of such reactions."

[3] "Research efforts have been devoted to improve the selectivity toward the desired unsaturated alcohol CALC. Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD"

[4] "Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts. It has been reported that metal promoters, such as Ga, Co and Ru, play a vital role in CALD hydrogenation in the presence of supported Pt nanoparticles due to the synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters."

[5] "We apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in the pharmaceutical and fragrance industries. It is crucial for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds, with the conversion of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) being a representative example.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains. These include:

1. Investigating supported platinum nanoparticles, which have been found to be the most effective catalysts for selective hydrogenation of CALD.

2. Introducing a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts, which enhances the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles. Metal promoters such as Ga, Co, and Ru have been reported to play a vital role in CALD hydrogenation due to synergetic interactions with Pt active sites.

3. Employing novel preparation methods, such as the microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) technique, to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation. This method has been shown to be superior to conventional impregnation (IMP) methods.

These approaches aim to improve the selectivity towards desired products (like unsaturated alcohols) and enhance the overall efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process for various industrial applications.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在制药和香料行业。它对不饱和羰基化合物的选择性加氢至关重要，其中肉桂醛（CALD）转化为肉桂醇（CALC）是一个代表性例子。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法。这些包括：

1. 研究负载型铂纳米粒子，它们被发现是CALD选择性加氢最有效的催化剂。

2. 引入第二种金属（或金属氧化物）形成双金属催化剂，这可以增强Pt纳米粒子的催化性能。据报道，Ga、Co和Ru等金属助剂由于与Pt活性位点的协同作用，在CALD加氢中起着至关重要的作用。

3. 采用新型制备方法，如微波辅助多元醇还原（MAPR）技术，合成具有高活性和选择性的Pt基双金属催化剂用于CALD加氢。这种方法已被证明优于传统的浸渍（IMP）方法。

这些方法旨在提高对所需产物（如不饱和醇）的选择性，并提高催化加氢过程在各种工业应用中的整体效率。
