The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis for the pharmaceutical and fragrance industries. The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of this process.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains. These include:

1. Using supported platinum nanoparticles as effective catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

2. Introducing a second metal or metal oxide to form bimetallic catalysts, which enhances the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles.

3. Exploring the effects of different metal promoters (such as Ga, Co, and Ru) on the catalytic performance due to synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters.

4. Investigating various preparation methods, such as microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with improved activity and selectivity compared to conventional methods.

5. Employing characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain insights into the physicochemical properties of catalysts.

6. Utilizing electrochemistry measurements, including cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping, to identify the nature of bimetallic catalysts.

7. Conducting competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene to chemically probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles.

These methodologies aim to improve the catalytic performance, selectivity, and efficiency of bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of C=O bonds for various industrial applications.
