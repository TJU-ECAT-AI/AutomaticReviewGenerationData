          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis for the pharmaceutical and fragrance industries. The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of this process.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains. These include:

1. Using supported platinum nanoparticles as effective catalysts for selective hydrogenation.

2. Introducing a second metal or metal oxide to form bimetallic catalysts, which enhances the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles.

3. Exploring the effects of different metal promoters (such as Ga, Co, and Ru) on the catalytic performance due to synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters.

4. Developing and comparing different catalyst preparation methods, such as microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) and conventional impregnation methods.

5. Utilizing various characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain insights into the physicochemical properties of catalysts.

6. Employing electrochemistry measurements, including cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping, to identify the nature of bimetallic catalysts.

7. Conducting competitive hydrogenations of different compounds (e.g., toluene and benzene) to chemically probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles.

These methodologies aim to improve the selectivity, efficiency, and overall performance of bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of C=O bonds for various industrial applications.

          使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在制药和香料行业的精细化学品合成中。肉桂醛(CALD)到肉桂醇(CALC)的选择性氢化是这一过程的代表性例子。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法。这些包括：

1. 使用负载型铂纳米粒子作为选择性氢化的有效催化剂。

2. 引入第二种金属或金属氧化物形成双金属催化剂，以增强Pt纳米粒子的催化性能。

3. 探索不同金属促进剂（如Ga、Co和Ru）对催化性能的影响，这是由于Pt活性位点和促进剂之间的协同作用。

4. 开发和比较不同的催化剂制备方法，如微波辅助多元醇还原法（MAPR）和传统浸渍法。

5. 采用X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）等表征技术，深入了解催化剂的物理化学性质。

6. 利用电化学测量，包括循环伏安法和CO剥离法，来识别双金属催化剂的性质。

7. 进行不同化合物（如甲苯和苯）的竞争性氢化，以化学探测Pt纳米粒子的电子密度。

这些方法旨在提高双金属催化剂在C=O键氢化过程中的选择性、效率和整体性能，以用于各种工业应用。
