4.1.2 C═O Hydrogenation
Catalytic hydrogenation of the C═O bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the C═O bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, C═O bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319) In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over Pt–Ni bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation. The rest of the section will focus on using bimetallic surfaces and catalysts to promote the selective C═O bond hydrogenation in unsaturated aldehydes.
4.1.2.1 Example: Hydrogenation of Propanal
The hydrogenation of propanal is used as a probe reaction to correlate the activity of C═O bond hydrogenation over Pt–Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. (245) DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature C═O hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for C═C hydrogenation. UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct C═O hydrogenation activity, with the Pt–Ni–Pt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the Ni–Pt–Pt surface structure. The UHV results are extended to supported Pt–Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts. In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the Pt–Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher C═O hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. (245) The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced C═O hydrogenation activity.
Using similar approaches, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations were performed for C═O bond hydrogenation of acetaldehyde (246) and acetone (246, 247) over supported Pt–3d bimetallic catalysts. Pt–Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts. (246) Acetone hydrogenation was used as a probe reaction to determine the effect of oxide supports over Pt–Ni supported on SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2 at 308 K. (247) It was found that Pt–Ni/SiO2 exhibited significantly higher hydrogenation activity than the other supports. These hydrogenation results correlate well with EXAFS data showing the extent of Pt–Ni bond formation of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. (247)
4.1.2.2 Selective Hydrogenation of C═O in Unsaturated Aldehydes
The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111), H/Ni–Pt–Pt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-C–C, di-σ-C–O, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a. (17) Figure 12b shows the hydrogen and acrolein binding energies on the three surfaces. The DFT results show that the binding energies of acrolein are in the order of H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) < H/Pt(111) < H/Ni–Pt–Pt(111). (17) On the H/Pt(111) and H/Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, acrolein tends to be adsorbed through the di-σ-C–C mode, whereas on the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, the similar binding energies will lead acrolein to be adsorbed through both the C═O and C═C moieties. The direct interaction of the C═O group in the latter bonding configuration at least partially contributes to the experimentally observed hydrogenation of the C═O bond on the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. In comparison, bonding of acrolein occurs through the C═C moiety over H/Pt and H/Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, preventing the selective hydrogenation of the C═O bonds. (17, 241) The presence of the di-σ-C–O configuration has also been proposed for the adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on Pt–Fe/SiO2, responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the C═O bond for the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols. (286)
The selective hydrogenation of acrolein has been extensively investigated over many Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. On unsupported Pt–Pd catalysts, it was found that the metal ratios strongly affected the hydrogenation products. For acrolein hydrogenation at temperatures from 293 to 473 K, it was found that propanal was the primary product for all catalysts. However, for the secondary products, dipropyl ether was formed primarily over Pd, whereas propane and propanol were formed over Pt. As the surface of the bimetallic catalyst increased in Pt atoms, the catalyst behaved more like the monometallic Pt catalyst. (289)
Although Au is typically regarded as an inactive metal for hydrogenation reactions, combining Au with Pt can greatly increase its activity. (281) Au is a poor hydrogenation metal because it does not dissociatively adsorb H2. (320) UHV studies have shown that CO binds to the surface of Pt on top of Au(111) more strongly than to clean Pt because the Au substrate increases the activity of the Pt overlayer, with the change in the CO binding energy being proportional to the shift of the d-band center of the Pt metal. (320, 321) Such a modification effect on model surfaces has also been observed in supported Pt–Au catalysts. Pt–Au/SiO2 catalysts were found to be highly active for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds because of the synergism between the Pt and Au metals. (281, 322) The high hydrogenation activity of Pt–Au could be a result of the rapid H2 dissociation on Pt and Pt–Au nanoparticles supported on SiO2 and TiO2. H2 dissociation on Pt–Au and Pt is considerably faster than H2 dissociation on Au, because H2 adsorption on Pt atoms is dissociative and no activation barriers are involved. (320) In addition to greater hydrogenation activity, Pt–Au shows enhanced resistance to deactivation when compared with a monometallic Pt catalyst. (147)
In general, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes over Pt-based catalysts usually yields the saturated aldehydes as the dominant products because of defect sites present in the metallic structure. Defects on metal surfaces favor interactions with the C═C moiety, which account for the undesired aldehyde products. It is hypothesized that 100% selectivity can be achieved through careful control of the size and shape of metallic active sites. (298) Tsang et al. confirmed that, at larger crystal sizes, Pt nanoparticles were more active for selective hydrogenation of the C═O bond in cinnamaldehyde. This is because the fraction of defect sites on Pt nanoparticles decreases with increasing Pt crystal size. Hydrogenation of the C═O bond in crotonaldehyde over Pt–Sn supported on SiO2 and α-Al2O3 demonstrated that the particle-size effect was not as important on bimetallic catalysts as it was on monometallic catalysts. This was because the addition of Sn had a greater effect on the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol than the change in particle size. (299) Therefore, to increase the selectivity toward hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond with smaller metallic nanoparticles, it is necessary to add a second metal. This can be achieved by the addition of a more electropositive metal such as Co, (166, 298) Ge, (150) Fe, (150, 284) Ga, (140) Ni, (284) or Sn. (284)
For the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the addition of Co to Pt nanoparticles produces cinnamyl alcohol as the primary product with a selectivity of 99.6%. (298) Pt–Co nanoparticles were prepared within a critical size range of 4.0–6.1 nm by colloid chemistry and then were applied to carbon supports. It was found that the Pt–Co/C catalysts hydrogenated the terminal C═O bond with high activity, while the catalyst was inactive toward the C═C bond. (298) These results were confirmed by Zheng et al., who showed that Pt–Co/SiO2 was much more selective toward the hydrogenation of the C═O bond than of C═C in cinnamaldehyde. (301)
Pt–Sn catalysts have also been shown to be active for selective hydrogenation reactions, with the hydrogenation activity and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols being highly dependent on the Sn/Pt ratio. It is suggested that the carbonyl group of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is activated by a Sn species interacting with the oxygen atom, while dilution of Pt atoms by metallic Sn hinders the hydrogenation of the C═C bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol. (150, 285) Catalysts with Pt and Sn in close contact are more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as compared with catalysts with a lesser interaction. (140) The interaction of Sn and Pt in Pt–Sn nanoparticles is known to be affected by the catalyst-preparation method and impregnation sequence. Co-impregnation of the fumed Al2O3 support with Pt and small amounts of Sn facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion; however, sequential impregnation of the fumed Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion. (323)
In addition to the metal affecting selectivity, the support has been found to play a major role in Pt–Sn catalysts. A carbon nanotube (CNT) support can be useful to concentrate reactants in an area close to the active metal, (300) whereas supports that exchange oxygen with the reactants, such as TiO2, (297) ZnO, (324) or CeO2, (324) have been shown to dramatically affect reaction chemistry. The addition of Sn to a Pt catalyst on a reducible support can influence the ability of the support to remove surface carbon through oxygen exchange (324) and help to maintain Sn in a fully reduced state. (325) The removal of surface carbon is critical to prevent deactivation of the catalyst. For example, on TiO2, selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed over Pt/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 catalysts after reduction at 473 and 773 K. The bimetallic catalyst reduced at high temperature was much more active for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The C═O bond was selectively hydrogenated because partially reduced TiOx species contain oxygen vacancies that interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and participate in the hydrogenation. (283) In another example, a Pt–Ge/TiO2 catalyst hydrogenated citral into unsaturated alcohols where both oxidized Ge and TiO2 species participated in the activation of the C═O bond, indicating there was a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI), but at higher metal loadings the bimetallic effect was dominant. (152)
Pt–Sn catalysts have been found to be active for the partial hydrogenation of furfural when supported on NaY zeolites and SiO2. (142, 291) Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized with varying amounts of Sn, and all catalysts produced furfuryl alcohol from furfural with selectivities greater than 95%. Bimetallic catalysts were more active than the monometallics but exhibited some degree of deactivation. The Pt–Sn catalyst synthesized with a ratio of 1:0.3 Pt/Sn deactivated at the lowest rate. (142) High hydrogenation activity is favored in large Pt–Sn particles because of the presence of a higher amount of oxidized Sn on the surface of the particles. (284, 311)
4.1.2.3 Hydrogenation of C═O in Other Molecules
The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride can produce many different products, but only some of the products are valuable in industry. Supported Pt–Ni bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Pt–Ni catalyzed the reaction for the production of succinic acid with 100% conversion and high selectivity to succinic anhydride. (292, 293)
The Pt–Fe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility, increased activity by 10 times, lowered the apparent activation energy, and maintained the selectivity to acetaldehyde at >70%. On carbon-supported catalysts, the addition of Pt to Fe/C prevented deactivation associated with iron carbide formation. (287)
Amines are important compounds for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs. A simple method to form amines is by the reduction of amides, but amides are considered difficult to reduce. Burch et al. found that Pt–Re/TiO2 supported catalysts, synthesized by impregnation, were able to selectively hydrogenate the C═O bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine. Figure 13 shows that both Pt impregnated onto a Re/TiO2 catalyst and Re impregnated onto a Pt/TiO2 catalyst showed conversions over 80%, much greater than those of either monometallic catalyst. γ-Al2O3 and CeZrO4 supported catalysts were also effective for hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, but the TiO2-based catalysts exhibited increased activity over the other supports due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. DFT studies showed that Re sites activated the C═O bond while Pt aided in the reduction of Re–O groups. The parent monometallic catalysts were not active in this reaction, indicating that close interaction between Re and Pt was critical in providing an active catalyst. (290)
Other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have also shown increased hydrogenation activity such as Ti, (322) Zr, (322) Hf, (322) and Zn (283) for C═O and C═C hydrogenation, Ag (326) for C═C hydrogenation, and Mo (296) for CO hydrogenation. For CO hydrogenation, Pt–Mo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts were much more active than the monometallic catalysts because Pt aided in the reduction of Mo. Mo segregated to the surface of the supported nanoparticles, and the segregation was unaffected by the sequence of the metal addition. EXAFS results showed that Mo–Mo bond lengths were near that of Pt with Mo on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles. (296)
4.1.3 N═O and C≡N Hydrogenation
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is an important industrial process to manufacture the nylon monomer, hexamethylenediamine, from adiponitrile. Butyronitrile has been used as a model compound for C≡N hydrogenation because it only contains one nitrile group. In liquid-phase experiments, Siepen et al. found that Pt–Rh/AC catalysts synthesized by a colloid method were active for hydrogenation of the C≡N bond in butyronitrile. EXAFS measurements indicated that Rh atoms were concentrated at the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles. This finding was confirmed by CO FTIR, which showed a characteristic Rh-dicarbonyl species bound to the catalyst. It was hypothesized that the Pt core atoms draw electrons from the Rh surface atoms, possibly explaining the enhanced hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalyst. Enhanced activity was seen on Pt–Rh bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation and not in catalysts synthesized with coimpregnation of both metals. (282)
Huang and Sachtler (327) investigated the hydrogenation of acetonitrile and butyronitrile in the gas phase in a fixed-bed microreactor and in the liquid phase in an autoclave. They found that addition of Pt to Ni supported on NaY zeolite promotes the reduction of Ni2+ and increases the hydrogenation rate of butyronitrile in both the gas and liquid phases. Catalysts with Cu and Pt also supported on NaY zeolite show increased reduction of the metal alloyed with Pt, but the activity is lower for acetonitrile hydrogenation. Addition of Sn to Pt on SiO2 decreases the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation but increases the selectivity to secondary amines. (327)
Synthesis of aromatic haloamines is important for the production of dyes, herbicides, and pesticides. Metal catalysts are preferred for the hydrogenation of halonitroaromatics to reduce the environmental impact of traditional hydrogenation with HCl. Liu et al. found that PVP-stabilized Pt–Ru colloids, prepared by a colloid-synthesis method, selectively hydrogenated the N═O bond of o-chloronitrobenzene to form o-chloroaniline. Catalysts were characterized by TEM, XPS, and XRD, and the reaction was performed in methanol at 303 K. The hydrogenation was most effective with particles composed of 20–90% Ru, with Co2+ added to the reaction vessel. (328) Similar studies on Pt–Ru/γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of N═O in 2,5-dichloronitrobenzene also showed high activity and selectivity. (329)
Pt–Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts can be used for the reduction of nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen for the treatment of drinking water. A bimetallic catalyst is advantageous for this process because copper can reduce nitrates and nitrites but deactivates rapidly in water, whereas monometallic platinum catalysts are inactive for nitrate reduction. By alloying Pt with Cu, the Cu is maintained in a metallic state while the reaction occurs in an aqueous environment. Monometallic catalysts were prepared by impregnation, and bimetallic catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation or reductive deposition of the second metal. Catalysts were characterized with TEM to confirm nanoparticle size, and CO FTIR was used to confirm the accessibility of Pt on the catalytic support. Reactions performed in an aqueous-phase batch reactor at 283 K showed that nitrates were quickly reduced on the Pt–Cu bimetallic catalyst when both metals were in close contact. Although required for high activity, the addition of copper slightly lowered the selectivity to nitrogen and raised the selectivity to NH4+. (330) Pt–In supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2, prepared by impregnation, were also active for the reduction of nitrates in drinking water. XPS and TPR results showed that the catalytic surfaces were enriched in In, but catalysts deactivated quickly due to segregation of the Pt and In. (331)
