          [1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (96-98%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group. Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst."

[5] "These ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting the attack of hydrogen to the carbonyl group of the furfural molecule and thus leading to greater activity."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic PtSn catalysts show high selectivity (96-98%) in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, which has wide applications in the chemical industry.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Catalyst preparation: Bimetallic catalysts are prepared using controlled surface reactions, allowing for precise control of metal ratios and interactions.

2. Characterization techniques: Advanced spectroscopic methods such as EXAFS, XANES, and XPS are used to thoroughly characterize the catalysts, providing insights into their structure and electronic properties.

3. Performance testing: Catalysts are evaluated in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions, measuring conversion rates and product selectivity.

4. Structure-activity relationships: Researchers analyze how different metal ratios and preparation methods affect catalyst performance, allowing for optimization.

5. Mechanistic studies: The roles of different metal species (e.g., PtSn alloys, isolated Pt atoms, ionic Sn) in the catalytic process are investigated to understand the reaction mechanism.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts due to both geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increased electron density of Pt) effects. Ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting hydrogen attack on the carbonyl group and enhancing activity. These approaches allow researchers to develop highly selective and efficient bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, with potential applications in various industrial processes.

          使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Sn系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化方面。双金属PtSn催化剂在液相糠醛加氢制备糠醇的过程中表现出高选择性（96-98%），而糠醇在化学工业中有广泛的应用。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法：

1. 催化剂制备：通过受控表面反应制备双金属催化剂，可以精确控制金属比例和相互作用。

2. 表征技术：使用先进的光谱方法，如EXAFS、XANES和XPS，对催化剂进行全面表征，提供其结构和电子性质的见解。

3. 性能测试：在液相氢化反应中评估催化剂，测量转化率和产品选择性。

4. 结构-活性关系：研究人员分析不同金属比例和制备方法如何影响催化剂性能，从而进行优化。

5. 机理研究：研究不同金属物种（如PtSn合金、孤立Pt原子、离子Sn）在催化过程中的作用，以理解反应机理。

向Pt基系统中添加Sn可以得到更高效的催化剂，这是由于几何效应（Pt位点的稀释）和电子效应（Pt的电子密度增加）的共同作用。离子态Sn物种作为Lewis酸位点，促进氢对羰基的进攻，从而提高活性。这些方法使研究人员能够开发出高选择性和高效率的双金属催化剂用于C=O键氢化，并在各种工业过程中具有潜在应用。
