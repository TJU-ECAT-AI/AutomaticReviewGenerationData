          [1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "As shown in Table 1, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of C@O bond to produce 2-propenol increases from 3% to 17% by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface"

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical production. This process is crucial for producing unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in these fields.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of experimental and theoretical methodologies:

1. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): Analyzes the desorption of reaction products from catalyst surfaces, providing insights into reaction pathways and product distributions.

2. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): Helps understand the vibrational features of adsorbed species on catalyst surfaces, offering information about reaction intermediates and surface interactions.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling: Used to calculate binding energies, predict adsorption geometries, and model reaction pathways, helping to explain experimental observations and guide catalyst design.

4. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions: Allow for precise surface science studies of model catalyst systems.

5. Bimetallic surface preparation: Researchers create model catalyst surfaces, such as PtNiPt(111), to study the effects of surface composition and structure on catalytic performance.

These methods are used to investigate the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts and optimize catalyst designs. For example, studies have shown that a PtNiPt(111) surface structure, with Ni atoms in the subsurface layer, can enhance the selective hydrogenation of acrolein to its corresponding unsaturated alcohol under UHV conditions. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on this surface further increases the selectivity for C=O bond hydrogenation, improving the yield of the desired unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) from 3% to 17%.

By combining experimental observations with theoretical predictions, researchers can develop a deeper understanding of the catalytic process and design more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, including the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors.

          使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Ni系统)进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和制药生产方面。这个过程对于生产不饱和醇至关重要，因为不饱和醇是这些领域的重要中间体。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了实验和理论方法的组合：

1. 程序升温脱附(TPD)：分析反应产物从催化剂表面的脱附，提供反应途径和产物分布的见解。

2. 高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)：有助于理解吸附在催化剂表面的物种的振动特征，提供有关反应中间体和表面相互作用的信息。

3. 密度泛函理论(DFT)建模：用于计算结合能，预测吸附几何构型，和模拟反应途径，有助于解释实验观察结果并指导催化剂设计。

4. 超高真空(UHV)条件：允许对模型催化剂系统进行精确的表面科学研究。

5. 双金属表面制备：研究人员创建模型催化剂表面，如PtNiPt(111)，以研究表面组成和结构对催化性能的影响。

这些方法被用来研究双金属催化剂的协同效应并优化催化剂设计。例如，研究表明，在超高真空条件下，具有亚表面层Ni原子的PtNiPt(111)表面结构可以增强丙烯醛向相应不饱和醇的选择性氢化。在这种表面上预吸附氢进一步增加了C=O键氢化的选择性，将所需不饱和醇(2-丙烯醇)的产率从3%提高到17%。

通过将实验观察与理论预测相结合，研究人员可以对催化过程有更深入的了解，并为工业应用设计出更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，包括精细化学品和药物前体的生产。
