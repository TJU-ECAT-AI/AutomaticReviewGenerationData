          [1] "The objective of the present study was to develop a highly efficient, more stable catalyst for hydrogenation of maleic anhydride at relatively low temperature to produce SA with high selectivity."

[2] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[3] "The PtNi bimetallic catalyst has the advantage over the conventional heterogeneous catalyst at low temperature operating for MA hydrogenation but has some drawbacks with respect to rapid deactivation."

[4] "Finally, we have shown that PtNi is able to catalyze the reaction for the production of succinic acid at 40 C with 100% conversion."

[5] "Using NiPt/Al2O3HY catalyst and performing the reaction, it was possible to carry out the lowest reaction temperature ever carried at 100% conversion."

[6] "Adding a small amount of Pt (0.5) to the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst that is effective for increasing the selectivity and activity."

[7] "We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C."

[8] "Owning to the high activity of PtNi for MA hydrogenation and the fact that MA is the main precursor for the production of succinic acid, we have also carried out the catalytic synthesis of succinic acid starting from maleic acid at 40 C, this help the viability and economics of the process."

[9] "PtNi bimetallic and Ni monometallic catalysts supported on HYAl2O3, HXAl2O3, ZSM-5Al2O3, USYAl2O3, BetaAl2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared and evaluated for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the temperature range of 40150 C."

[10] "Hydrogenation activity was found to correlate to the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation, as characterized by the analysis of XRD and TPR."

[11] "Compared to the other processes, hydrogenation of maleic anhydride is the most direct, environmentally benign, and economic way to produce succinic anhydride."

[12] "Unlike the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, the reaction is to hydrogenate the C=C bond of maleic acid, accordingly H2O is not formed."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is particularly important for the production of valuable chemicals such as succinic anhydride and succinic acid from maleic anhydride and maleic acid.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include:

1. Catalyst preparation: Various supports (HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3, USY-Al2O3, Beta-Al2O3, and Al2O3) are used to prepare Pt-Ni bimetallic and Ni monometallic catalysts.

2. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) are used to analyze the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and catalyst properties.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: Effects of reaction temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) on catalyst performance are investigated.

4. Comparative studies: Performance of bimetallic (Pt-Ni) catalysts is compared with monometallic (Ni) catalysts to understand synergistic effects.

5. Low-temperature reactions: Efforts are made to develop catalysts that can perform efficiently at lower temperatures (e.g., 40°C) to reduce energy requirements.

6. One-pot conversion: Direct conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid is achieved using Pt-Ni catalysts.

7. Stability testing: Long-term performance tests are conducted to assess catalyst stability and identify potential deactivation mechanisms.

These methodologies have led to the development of highly efficient and selective Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts that can operate at relatively low temperatures (as low as 40°C) with 100% conversion for the production of succinic acid. The research demonstrates that adding a small amount of Pt to Ni catalysts effectively increases selectivity and activity, contributing to more environmentally benign and economical processes for producing valuable chemical intermediates.

          使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，包括精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化。这一过程对于从顺丁烯二酸酐和顺丁烯二酸生产有价值的化学品（如琥珀酸酐和琥珀酸）特别重要。

用于研究、优化和提高此过程选择性和效率的方法包括：

1. 催化剂制备：使用各种载体（HY-Al2O3、HX-Al2O3、ZSM-5-Al2O3、USY-Al2O3、Beta-Al2O3和Al2O3）制备Pt-Ni双金属和Ni单金属催化剂。

2. 催化剂表征：使用X射线衍射（XRD）和程序升温还原（TPR）等技术分析PtNi双金属键形成程度和催化剂性质。

3. 反应参数优化：研究反应温度、压力和重量小时空速（WHSV）对催化剂性能的影响。

4. 对比研究：将双金属（Pt-Ni）催化剂的性能与单金属（Ni）催化剂进行比较，以了解协同效应。

5. 低温反应：努力开发能在较低温度（如40°C）下高效工作的催化剂，以减少能源需求。

6. 一锅法转化：使用Pt-Ni催化剂实现顺丁烯二酸直接转化为琥珀酸。

7. 稳定性测试：进行长期性能测试，以评估催化剂的稳定性并识别潜在的失活机制。

这些方法导致了高效和高选择性Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的开发，可以在相对较低的温度（低至40°C）下运行，实现100%的转化率生产琥珀酸。研究表明，向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可有效提高选择性和活性，有助于开发更环保、更经济的valuable化学中间体生产工艺。
