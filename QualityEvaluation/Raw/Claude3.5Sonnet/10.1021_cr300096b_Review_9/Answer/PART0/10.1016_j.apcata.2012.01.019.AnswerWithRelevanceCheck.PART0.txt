          [1] "Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols has received considerable attention because of its industrial applications"

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts"

[3] "The 3d-Pt bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of their parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity"

[4] "The combined experimental and DFT results suggested that the presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a diσCO configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydrogenation pathway"

[5] "More recently, these surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO bonds in two probe molecules, acetone and acetaldehyde"

[6] "The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures."

[7] "The corresponding semi-hydrogenated product, cinnamyl alcohol (CML), is utilized as components in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and perfumes"

[8] "In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on bimetallic catalysts, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been performed by adding a 3d-metal, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, to Pt(1 1 1)"

[9] "Several characterization methods, including H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were employed in order to understand the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications in several ways:

1. It enables selective production of allylic alcohols from α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which has important industrial applications in fine chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and perfumes.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly 3d-Pt combinations, offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts due to synergistic effects between the metals.

3. The properties of 3d-Pt bimetallic catalysts often differ significantly from their parent metals, allowing for the development of novel catalysts with improved performance.

4. Specific bimetallic combinations like Co-Pt show higher selectivity toward C=O bond hydrogenation compared to monometallic catalysts, enabling more targeted synthesis.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Preparation and characterization of supported bimetallic catalysts using techniques like H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, TEM, and EXAFS to understand catalyst properties and bimetallic effects.

2. Reactor studies to evaluate catalytic activity and selectivity under different conditions and operation modes (e.g., gas or liquid phase hydrogenation).

3. Fundamental studies on model surfaces like Pt single crystals and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces to understand reaction pathways and mechanisms.

4. Investigation of electronic and geometric effects in bimetallic catalysts to understand the mechanisms behind enhanced performance.

5. Theoretical approaches like DFT calculations to further understand reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior at the molecular level.

6. Systematic investigation of factors like catalyst composition, support type, preparation method, and reaction conditions to optimize performance.

7. Comparison of model surfaces with supported catalysts to translate fundamental knowledge to practical systems.

By combining these approaches, researchers can rationally design and optimize bimetallic catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation in various applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion.

          使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化在多个工业和研究应用中做出了贡献:

1. 它能够从α,β-不饱和醛中选择性地生产烯丙醇，这在精细化学品合成、制药、香料和香水等工业应用中具有重要意义。

2. 双金属催化剂，特别是3d-Pt组合，由于金属之间的协同效应，与单金属催化剂相比具有更高的活性和选择性。

3. 3d-Pt双金属催化剂的性质通常与其父金属有显著不同，允许开发具有改进性能的新型催化剂。

4. 像Co-Pt这样的特定双金属组合相比单金属催化剂对C=O键氢化显示出更高的选择性，使更有针对性的合成成为可能。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法：
