[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The planar CAL molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of steric repulsion from the aromatic ring. In addition, the adsorption mode to the different planes of the metallic surface depends on the substrate particle size."

[5] "Theoretical calculations have shown, furthermore, that aromatic rings that are chemisorbed on a metal surface must lie at a distance exceeding 0.3nm because there is an energy barrier that prevents a closer approach to the surface. As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially."

[6] "The catalytic study has shown the superiority of confined catalysts over unsupported PtRuNPs. The results obtained for confined catalysts regarding activity and selectivity can be attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside MWCNTs."

[7] "Bimetallic platinumruthenium nanoparticles (PtRuNPs) stabilised by pyridine- and monophosphine-based ligands were prepared either in supercritical CO2 or in THF."

[8] "These materials were applied to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."

[9] "The higher selectivity achieved with 5b@MWCNT compared to the other catalytic systems is attributable to the larger particle size observed for this confined system"

[1] "The PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidationreduction thermal treatment showed a TOF of 0.10.5 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 6590%."

[2] "The sample obtained using high concentration of Pt in initial solution (10 mg/ml) showed a very high selectivity to UA (90%) and TOF of 0.54 min1."

[3] "A higher activity was demonstrated by PtSn/TiO2 catalyst (IE-OR-33) prepared using combined impregnation of the inorganic salts as metal precursors. This sample showed a TOF of 3.3 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 85%."

[4] "The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as 90% at a citral conversion above 95%."

[5] "A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min1 was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts."

[6] "The addition of tin to the Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in TOF lowering and an increase of the selectivity to UA, which is in agreement with previously reported literature data"

[7] "This study is devoted to the development of mesoporous titania supported novel PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts derived from mixed-metal precursors with desirable stoichiometry between the metals."

[1] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts, including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities."

[2] "Whereas an electronic (i.e., ligand) effect would be expected to influence both the selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "The presence of Pt in the PtNi catalysts appears to promote the reduction of nickel oxides through hydrogen spillover."

[4] "Results in Fig. 4 show that while activity of these NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of MA, measured as conversion, increases when increasing Pt content, the SA selectivity to reduce the MA decreases for Pt contents over 0.3"

[5] "The unusual activity and stability for MA conversion on the PtNi catalyst likely is related to the direct participation of neighboring Pt sites in a bifunctional mode of catalytic transformation."

[6] "The supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in MA hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation."

[7] "A small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3."

[8] "Clearly, the selectivity of the PtNi is closely linked to the surface Ni sites, whereas the much higher activity and stability of the PtNi composition can be attributed to the hydrogenation ability of the Pt sites."

[9] "Comparing the specific rates of Pd/Al2O3, RuCl2(TPP)3, and PtNi/Al2O3 reported in Table 2, PtNi/Al2O3 is still more active than Pd/Al2O3 and RuCl2(TPP)3."

[1] "Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin."

[2] "Platinum is a known hydrogenation catalyst. However, platinum can usually catalyze deep hydrogenation and activate undesired side and consecutive reactions."

[3] "Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites."

[4] "This study will provide a theoretical basis for designing at molecular level a catalyst for highly selective hydrogenation of furfural."

[5] "The catalytic tests were performed in a home made glass reactor (i.d. 18 mm) with a thermocouple under atmosphere pressure. Catalyst was packed into the reactor and pretreated with hydrogen from room temperature to 423 K at a heating rate of 5 K min1."

[6] "As-synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY was used to catalyze the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."

[7] "The grafted product has excellent selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."

[1] "As the derivatives of biomass often contain the CO functional groups, facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial to the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals"

[2] "CO bond hydrogenation has been considered an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass"

[3] "Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts"

[6] "The experimental results confirm the enhanced activity of the bimetallic catalyst toward CO bond hydrogenation, which is consistent with previous studies of low temperature hydrogenation of alkenes and cycloalkenes"

[7] "Low temperature (308 K) hydrogenation of acetone was used as a probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2, SiO2 and γ-Al2O3."

[8] "Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces"

[2] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[3] "The PtNi bimetallic catalyst has the advantage over the conventional heterogeneous catalyst at low temperature operating for MA hydrogenation but has some drawbacks with respect to rapid deactivation."

[4] "Finally, we have shown that PtNi is able to catalyze the reaction for the production of succinic acid at 40 C with 100% conversion."

[5] "Using NiPt/Al2O3HY catalyst and performing the reaction, it was possible to carry out the lowest reaction temperature ever carried at 100% conversion."

[6] "Adding a small amount of Pt (0.5) to the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst that is effective for increasing the selectivity and activity."

[7] "We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C."

[8] "Owning to the high activity of PtNi for MA hydrogenation and the fact that MA is the main precursor for the production of succinic acid, we have also carried out the catalytic synthesis of succinic acid starting from maleic acid at 40 C, this help the viability and economics of the process."

[9] "PtNi bimetallic and Ni monometallic catalysts supported on HYAl2O3, HXAl2O3, ZSM-5Al2O3, USYAl2O3, BetaAl2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared and evaluated for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the temperature range of 40150 C."

[10] "Hydrogenation activity was found to correlate to the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation, as characterized by the analysis of XRD and TPR."

[11] "Compared to the other processes, hydrogenation of maleic anhydride is the most direct, environmentally benign, and economic way to produce succinic anhydride."

[12] "Unlike the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, the reaction is to hydrogenate the C=C bond of maleic acid, accordingly H2O is not formed."

[1] "Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols has received considerable attention because of its industrial applications"

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts"

[3] "The 3d-Pt bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of their parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity"

[4] "The combined experimental and DFT results suggested that the presence of weakly adsorbed acrolein through a diσCO configuration appeared to be responsible for this desired hydrogenation pathway"

[5] "More recently, these surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO bonds in two probe molecules, acetone and acetaldehyde"

[6] "The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures."

[7] "The corresponding semi-hydrogenated product, cinnamyl alcohol (CML), is utilized as components in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and perfumes"

[9] "Several characterization methods, including H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were employed in order to understand the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects."

[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."

[2] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."

[5] "TPD results on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that the subsurface PtNiPt structure exhibits higher CO bond hydrogenation activity than the surface NiPtPt structure and the monometallic Ni and Pt surfaces."

[6] "To bridge the materials gap and pressure gap between fundamental surface science studies and real world catalysis, γ-Al2O3 supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts with a Ni/Pt molar ratio of 3:1 and 10:1 are evaluated using batch and flow reactors"

[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."

[2] "For instance, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals."

[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass."

[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."

[5] "The main objective of the present work is to extend the CC hydrogenation activity of γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low temperature hydrogenation of the carbonyl group by using batch and flow reactors."

[6] "DFT calculations were performed for the current study to determine whether such a correlation can be extended to acetone and acetaldehyde."

[7] "Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts"

[8] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

[9] "Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces."

[10] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production. That of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes generates unsaturated alcohols, which are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, flavourings and pharmaceuticals."

[2] "The platinumtin bimetallic system has been extensively studied for the selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl bond in the presence of an olefinic CC bond. Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species."

[3] "Tin enhances the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond as a result of the co-operation of two phenomena. On the one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the CC bond and suppresses the re-adsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol."

[4] "It is necessary to promote the metal to increase selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond and thus to produce the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or but-2-en-1-ol). This can be achieved by the addition of a second, more electropositive metal such as iron,24 nickel5 or tin,2,3,613 and by using a support that can interact with the metal:"

[1] "Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to their semihydrogenated products, that is, saturated aldehydes from hydrogenation at the CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group or unsaturated alcohols from hydrogenation at the CO bond, is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others."

[2] "Supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation reaction potential for advanced and greener syntheses of many special and fine chemicals in organic chemistry, but their potential for applications has been hampered by their generally observed low activity arising from the intrinsic nobleness of gold to H2 activation."

[3] "PtmAu immobilized on a noninteracting SiO2 support (PtmAu/SiO2) showed activity 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic Pt/SiO2 and Au/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "Kinetic assessments suggest that the hydrogenation reaction could occur according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, in which cinnamaldehyde adsorbed on the Au surface was attacked by hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts."

[1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route, since successful promotion of platinum based catalysts by tin, germanium, gallium or iron has been reported"

[3] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."

[4] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst"

[5] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[6] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

[7] "Therefore the challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity."

[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "The selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[4] "WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

[5] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

[6] "The selective hydrogenation of CO groups in compounds incorporating CC groups (to give unsaturated alcohols) is an important practical goal because of the importance of unsaturated alcohols in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries."

[7] "SiO2-supported CoRu clusters (and those supported in zeolites NaY and NaX) prepared from the precursors Ru3Co3C(CO)14, RuCo2(CO)11, and HRuCo3(CO)12 showed substantially higher activities and selectivities for formation of oxygenates such as C1C5 alcohols (e.g., selectivities of up to 38% in CO hydrogenation at 149250 C) than samples incorporating only one metal, even in a highly dispersed form."

[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[4] "It is known that EG and other low molecular weight polyols originate predominantly from the hydrogenolysis of glucose, while the sugar alcohols result from the hydrogenation of glucose (Scheme1)."

[5] "A remarkable advantage of the tungsten carbide over platinum and ruthenium catalysts is the high yield of EG relative to other polyols."

[6] "More importantly, with the promotion of a small amount of nickel, the yield of EG was significantly increased to 61% by a synergistic effect between nickel and W2C."

[7] "To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The idea is based on two considerations: 1)nickel is a well-known active catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol; and 2)nickel could promote the formation of tungsten carbides as indicated in Figure1, which suggests the possibility of synergy by combining nickel and W2C in catalytic reactions."

[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"

[2] "DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation."

[3] "UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure."

[4] "In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[5] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."

[6] "PtCo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts. (246)"

[7] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(111), H/NiPtPt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a. (17)"

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "As shown in Table 1, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of C@O bond to produce 2-propenol increases from 3% to 17% by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface"

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[3] "Citronellal and α,β-unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol) were the main products formed over the Pt/SiO2 and PtFe/SiO2 catalysts under our experimental conditions."

[4] "The addition of Fe improves the selectivity of the reaction toward unsaturated alcohols."

[5] "The adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on metal surfaces is believed to occur through three different modes: (1) exclusively through the CC group (i.e. di-σCC); (2) exclusively through the CO group (i.e. di-σCO); and (3) through both the CO and CC groups (i.e. η4)"

[6] "Extended Hckel calculations performed for the Pt80Fe20 surface alloy show, for example, that the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt decreases the probability of the di-σCC adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on Pt, making the di-σCO adsorption mode the predominant one"

[7] "The modification of the catalytic properties of Pt in the presence of Fe for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can be attributed to the creation of new Lewis sites (i.e., iron cations) in close proximity to Pt"

[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (96-98%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group. Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst."

[5] "These ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting the attack of hydrogen to the carbonyl group of the furfural molecule and thus leading to greater activity."

[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries"

[2] "Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of such reactions."

[3] "Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD"

[4] "Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts."

[5] "It has been reported that metal promoters, such as Ga, Co and Ru, play a vital role in CALD hydrogenation in the presence of supported Pt nanoparticles due to the synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters."

[6] "We apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method."

[1] "The catalytic performances of PtRuLx and PtRuLx@MWCNT nanocatalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL as a benchmark reaction"

[2] "Under the above-mentioned reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalysts, the only products of CAL hydrogenation were cinnamyl alcohol (COL), hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL)."

[3] "Regarding selectivity, it has already been shown that the use of bimetallic PtRu catalysts foster high selectivity towards COL."

[4] "The planar CAL molecule cannot adsorb parallel to a flat metal surface because of steric repulsion from the aromatic ring. In addition, the adsorption mode to the different planes of the metallic surface depends on the substrate particle size."

[5] "Theoretical calculations have shown, furthermore, that aromatic rings that are chemisorbed on a metal surface must lie at a distance exceeding 0.3nm because there is an energy barrier that prevents a closer approach to the surface. As a result of this energy barrier, the CC bond cannot approach the surface as closely as the CO bond and so the latter is hydrogenated preferentially."

[6] "The catalytic study has shown the superiority of confined catalysts over unsupported PtRuNPs. The results obtained for confined catalysts regarding activity and selectivity can be attributed to a higher local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside MWCNTs."

[7] "Bimetallic platinumruthenium nanoparticles (PtRuNPs) stabilised by pyridine- and monophosphine-based ligands were prepared either in supercritical CO2 or in THF."

[8] "These materials were applied to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."

[9] "The higher selectivity achieved with 5b@MWCNT compared to the other catalytic systems is attributable to the larger particle size observed for this confined system"

[1] "The PtSn/TiO2 catalysts prepared using PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursor and oxidationreduction thermal treatment showed a TOF of 0.10.5 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 6590%."

[2] "The sample obtained using high concentration of Pt in initial solution (10 mg/ml) showed a very high selectivity to UA (90%) and TOF of 0.54 min1."

[3] "A higher activity was demonstrated by PtSn/TiO2 catalyst (IE-OR-33) prepared using combined impregnation of the inorganic salts as metal precursors. This sample showed a TOF of 3.3 min1 and a selectivity to UA of 85%."

[4] "The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as 90% at a citral conversion above 95%."

[5] "A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min1 was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts."

[6] "The addition of tin to the Pt/TiO2 catalysts resulted in TOF lowering and an increase of the selectivity to UA, which is in agreement with previously reported literature data"

[7] "This study is devoted to the development of mesoporous titania supported novel PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts derived from mixed-metal precursors with desirable stoichiometry between the metals."

[1] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts, including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities."

[2] "Whereas an electronic (i.e., ligand) effect would be expected to influence both the selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "The presence of Pt in the PtNi catalysts appears to promote the reduction of nickel oxides through hydrogen spillover."

[4] "Results in Fig. 4 show that while activity of these NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of MA, measured as conversion, increases when increasing Pt content, the SA selectivity to reduce the MA decreases for Pt contents over 0.3"

[5] "The unusual activity and stability for MA conversion on the PtNi catalyst likely is related to the direct participation of neighboring Pt sites in a bifunctional mode of catalytic transformation."

[6] "The supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in MA hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation."

[7] "A small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3."

[8] "Clearly, the selectivity of the PtNi is closely linked to the surface Ni sites, whereas the much higher activity and stability of the PtNi composition can be attributed to the hydrogenation ability of the Pt sites."

[9] "Comparing the specific rates of Pd/Al2O3, RuCl2(TPP)3, and PtNi/Al2O3 reported in Table 2, PtNi/Al2O3 is still more active than Pd/Al2O3 and RuCl2(TPP)3."

[1] "Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin."

[2] "Platinum is a known hydrogenation catalyst. However, platinum can usually catalyze deep hydrogenation and activate undesired side and consecutive reactions."

[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass."

[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."

[5] "The main objective of the present work is to extend the CC hydrogenation activity of γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low temperature hydrogenation of the carbonyl group by using batch and flow reactors."

[8] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

[9] "Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces."

[10] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production. That of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes generates unsaturated alcohols, which are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, flavourings and pharmaceuticals."

[2] "The platinumtin bimetallic system has been extensively studied for the selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl bond in the presence of an olefinic CC bond. Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species."

[3] "Tin enhances the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond as a result of the co-operation of two phenomena. On the one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the CC bond and suppresses the re-adsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol."

[4] "It is necessary to promote the metal to increase selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond and thus to produce the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or but-2-en-1-ol). This can be achieved by the addition of a second, more electropositive metal such as iron,24 nickel5 or tin,2,3,613 and by using a support that can interact with the metal:"

[1] "Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to their semihydrogenated products, that is, saturated aldehydes from hydrogenation at the CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group or unsaturated alcohols from hydrogenation at the CO bond, is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others."

[2] "Supported Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation reaction potential for advanced and greener syntheses of many special and fine chemicals in organic chemistry, but their potential for applications has been hampered by their generally observed low activity arising from the intrinsic nobleness of gold to H2 activation."

[3] "PtmAu immobilized on a noninteracting SiO2 support (PtmAu/SiO2) showed activity 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic Pt/SiO2 and Au/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "Kinetic assessments suggest that the hydrogenation reaction could occur according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, in which cinnamaldehyde adsorbed on the Au surface was attacked by hydrogen atoms activated by Pt entities in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts."

[1] "Platinum supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) turned out as one of the most active catalysts for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde"

[2] "Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route, since successful promotion of platinum based catalysts by tin, germanium, gallium or iron has been reported"

[3] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."

[4] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst"

[5] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."

[6] "In general the activity for hydrogenation was high, while the selectivity towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol was low"

[7] "Therefore the challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity."

[1] "Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal."

[2] "The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."

[3] "The selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst."

[4] "WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W."

[5] "It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W."

[6] "The selective hydrogenation of CO groups in compounds incorporating CC groups (to give unsaturated alcohols) is an important practical goal because of the importance of unsaturated alcohols in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries."

[7] "SiO2-supported CoRu clusters (and those supported in zeolites NaY and NaX) prepared from the precursors Ru3Co3C(CO)14, RuCo2(CO)11, and HRuCo3(CO)12 showed substantially higher activities and selectivities for formation of oxygenates such as C1C5 alcohols (e.g., selectivities of up to 38% in CO hydrogenation at 149250 C) than samples incorporating only one metal, even in a highly dispersed form."

[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[4] "It is known that EG and other low molecular weight polyols originate predominantly from the hydrogenolysis of glucose, while the sugar alcohols result from the hydrogenation of glucose (Scheme1)."

[5] "A remarkable advantage of the tungsten carbide over platinum and ruthenium catalysts is the high yield of EG relative to other polyols."

[6] "More importantly, with the promotion of a small amount of nickel, the yield of EG was significantly increased to 61% by a synergistic effect between nickel and W2C."

[7] "To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The idea is based on two considerations: 1)nickel is a well-known active catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol; and 2)nickel could promote the formation of tungsten carbides as indicated in Figure1, which suggests the possibility of synergy by combining nickel and W2C in catalytic reactions."

[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"

[2] "DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation."

[3] "UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure."

[4] "In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[5] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."

[7] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(111), H/NiPtPt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a. (17)"

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "As shown in Table 1, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of C@O bond to produce 2-propenol increases from 3% to 17% by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface"

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[4] "The addition of Fe improves the selectivity of the reaction toward unsaturated alcohols."

[5] "The adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on metal surfaces is believed to occur through three different modes: (1) exclusively through the CC group (i.e. di-σCC); (2) exclusively through the CO group (i.e. di-σCO); and (3) through both the CO and CC groups (i.e. η4)"

[6] "Extended Hckel calculations performed for the Pt80Fe20 surface alloy show, for example, that the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt decreases the probability of the di-σCC adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on Pt, making the di-σCO adsorption mode the predominant one"

[7] "The modification of the catalytic properties of Pt in the presence of Fe for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can be attributed to the creation of new Lewis sites (i.e., iron cations) in close proximity to Pt"

[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (96-98%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group. Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst."

[5] "These ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting the attack of hydrogen to the carbonyl group of the furfural molecule and thus leading to greater activity."

[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries"

[2] "Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of such reactions."

[3] "Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD"
