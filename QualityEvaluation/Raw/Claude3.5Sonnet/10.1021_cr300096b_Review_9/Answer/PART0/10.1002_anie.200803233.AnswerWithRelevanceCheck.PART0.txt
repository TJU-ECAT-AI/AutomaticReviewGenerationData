          [1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[4] "It is known that EG and other low molecular weight polyols originate predominantly from the hydrogenolysis of glucose, while the sugar alcohols result from the hydrogenation of glucose (Scheme1)."

[5] "A remarkable advantage of the tungsten carbide over platinum and ruthenium catalysts is the high yield of EG relative to other polyols."

[6] "More importantly, with the promotion of a small amount of nickel, the yield of EG was significantly increased to 61% by a synergistic effect between nickel and W2C."

[7] "To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The idea is based on two considerations: 1)nickel is a well-known active catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol; and 2)nickel could promote the formation of tungsten carbides as indicated in Figure1, which suggests the possibility of synergy by combining nickel and W2C in catalytic reactions."

          The literature primarily focuses on the catalytic conversion of cellulose into polyols, particularly ethylene glycol (EG), using nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts (Ni-W2C/AC). While it doesn't directly address Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, it provides valuable insights into bimetallic catalysis for biomass conversion.

Key findings and methodologies include:

1. Bimetallic catalyst system: The Ni-W2C/AC catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect in cellulose conversion, significantly improving the yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts.

2. Optimization: The synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) temperature of 973K.

3. Reaction mechanisms: EG and low molecular weight polyols are produced through hydrogenolysis of glucose, while sugar alcohols result from glucose hydrogenation.

4. Comparative performance: The Ni-W2C/AC catalyst outperforms traditional precious metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3 in EG production, achieving yields up to 61%.

5. Catalyst design rationale: Nickel was added to tungsten carbide based on its known activity for glucose hydrogenation to sorbitol and its ability to promote tungsten carbide formation.

The research methodology involved catalyst preparation through carbothermal hydrogen reduction, characterization using techniques like XRD and TEM, and performance evaluation in a high-pressure autoclave reactor. The study demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can be designed and optimized to enhance selectivity and efficiency in cellulosic biomass conversion.

While not directly addressing C=O bond hydrogenation or Pt-Ni systems, this work contributes to the broader field of catalytic biomass conversion and illustrates the potential of bimetallic catalysts in industrial and research applications for producing valuable chemicals from renewable resources.

          这篇文献主要关注使用镍促进的碳化钨催化剂（Ni-W2C/AC）将纤维素催化转化为多元醇，特别是乙二醇（EG）。虽然它没有直接讨论Pt-Ni双金属催化剂用于C=O键氢化，但它为生物质转化的双金属催化提供了有价值的见解。

主要发现和方法包括：

1. 双金属催化剂系统：Ni-W2C/AC催化剂在纤维素转化中表现出协同效应，显著提高了EG和糖醇的产率，相比未促进的催化剂。

2. 优化：在2 wt%的名义镍负载量和973K的碳热氢还原（CHR）温度下，协同效应达到最大。

3. 反应机理：EG和低分子量多元醇主要通过葡萄糖的氢解产生，而糖醇则来自葡萄糖的氢化。

4. 性能比较：Ni-W2C/AC催化剂在EG生产方面优于传统的贵金属催化剂如Pt/Al2O3，产率高达61%。

5. 催化剂设计理念：基于镍对葡萄糖氢化生成山梨醇的已知活性，以及其促进碳化钨形成的能力，将镍添加到碳化钨中。

研究方法包括通过碳热氢还原法制备催化剂，使用XRD和TEM等技术进行表征，以及在高压釜反应器中评估性能。该研究展示了如何设计和优化双金属催化剂，以提高纤维素生物质转化的选择性和效率。

尽管没有直接涉及C=O键氢化或Pt-Ni系统，但这项工作对广泛的催化生物质转化领域做出了贡献，并说明了双金属催化剂在工业和研究应用中从可再生资源生产有价值化学品的潜力。
