Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems or their applications in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The document focuses on AgPt bimetallic catalysts for C=C hydrogenation, particularly of 1-epoxy-3-butene. It does not discuss C=O hydrogenation or Pt-Ni catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

The given literature does not contain information about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds or Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. The document focuses on AgPt bimetallic catalysts prepared by electroless deposition and their characterization using XPS and DFT studies. It does not discuss C=O hydrogenation, Pt-Ni systems, or applications in fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies described (XPS, DFT) are used to study the electronic structure and surface properties of AgPt catalysts, not to optimize C=O hydrogenation reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.
