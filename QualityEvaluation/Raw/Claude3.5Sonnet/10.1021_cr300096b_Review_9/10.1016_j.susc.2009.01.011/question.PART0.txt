The electronic structure and chemical properties of catalysts prepared by the electroless deposition (ED)
of Ag onto Pt/SiO2 were studied using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and den-
sity functional theory (DFT) calculations. XPS studies revealed a negative shift (up to 0.75 eV) in the Ag
3d binding energy (BE) relative to bulk Ag. Both the magnitude and direction of the shift are consistent
with DFT calculations of model Ag/Pt(111) surfaces. DFT calculations have also been employed to study
the adsorption of two probe molecules, carbon monoxide and 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB), on the model sur-
faces. Combined with previously published reports, the results presented here suggest that (1) the AgPt/
SiO2 catalysts that are most active for hydrogenation of the EpB olefin function consist of an adlayer of Ag
on Pt rather than a surface or bulk alloy and that (2) the higher activity and selectivity of ED-prepared
AgPt/SiO2 catalysts for C@C hydrogenation of EpB to 1-epoxybutane are consistent with computed elec-
tronic (ligand) and bifunctional effects.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts have become increas-
ingly important in industrial processes [13]. The efficient devel-
opment
of
these
complex,
multimetallic
catalysts
requires
collaboration between modeling, preparation, and characterization
techniques to provide a priori determination of optimal composi-
tions, accurate and reproducible formulations, and surface sensi-
tive evaluation.
Impregnation techniques are generally utilized for the prepara-
tion of large-volume bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts [4].
However, these traditional techniques provide inadequate control
over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing
both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with
varying compositions [57]. Therefore, improved, industrially via-
ble preparation techniques are necessary to more precisely formu-
late
multicomponent
catalysts.
One
alternative
preparation
method that provides more control over metal placement is elec-
troless deposition (ED). With this technique, a metallic salt is re-
duced
onto
a
pre-existing
catalytic
surface
that
has
been
activated by a chemical reducing agent (formaldehyde, borohy-
dride, amine boranes, hydrazine, etc.) [8]. Thus, electroless deposi-
tion effectively targets deposition of a secondary metal onto the
primary metal and not on the support [9,10]. Furthermore, this
technique should be economically feasible since it has been used
industrially since the 1950s in the preparation of thin, continuous
metal films [11].
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is particularly useful
for the evaluation of different preparation techniques since it pro-
vides information regarding the elements present at the surface (or
near the surface) as well as their chemical environment. Such data
lend valuable insight to surface segregation and electronic effects
in bimetallic catalysts. For example, a direct correlation has been
reported between XPS BE shifts and temperature programmed
desorption data for model systems in which one metal was vapor
deposited onto another, dissimilar metal resulting in an electronic
perturbation [12]. The capability to tune the adsorption/desorption
properties of a material through electronic interactions with a sec-
ondary metal suggests the ability to rationally tailor catalytic
properties.
Modifications in electronic properties may be predicted using
theoretical calculations. For example, Hrtel et al. established a
model which predicts that deposition of Ag onto Pt will yield a neg-
ative shift in the Ag 3d binding energy (XPS) based on the density

of states (DOS) of the substrate (Pt) and secondary metal (Ag) [13].
Rodriguez and Hrtel et al. investigated Ag vapor deposited onto
Pt(111) and reported a 0.40.5 eV Ag 3d shift to lower BE for
sub-monolayer (ML) coverages of Ag on Pt compared to bulk
(>10 ML) Ag [13,14]. Similar negative shifts were observed for Ag
vapor deposited onto Pt(110) (0.6 eV) [15] and for AgPt alloys
(0.8 eV) [16]. Although the magnitude of the BE shift varies
(likely due to different Ag loadings), the direction of the shift is
consistent, and in all cases agrees with Hrtel et al.s DOS model
[13]. The shift in the Ag 3d BE indicates modification of the Ag d-
band structure by Pt [15]. Rodriguez and Kuhn [14] have shown
that the apparent donation of d-electrons from Pt to Ag is balanced
by a corresponding donation of s and p electrons from Ag to Pt.
Regardless, this modification in Ag d-electrons results in an in-
crease in the AgCO bond strength (70 K increase in the desorp-
tion temperature) for AgPt compared to that of pure Ag [14,17],
consistent with the reported correlation between XPS BE shifts
and adsorption/desorption properties [12].
While the AgPt bimetallic system has been methodically stud-
ied using model systems, little XPS data has been reported for sup-
ported AgPt catalysts. In this study, we examine AgPt/SiO2
catalysts prepared by ED that show greatly enhanced activity and
selectivity for C@C hydrogenation of the unsaturated epoxide
1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB) [10]. XPS characterization is incorporated
in concert with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to pro-
vide insights into the physical and electronic structure of the metal
surface, and to facilitate identification of possible mechanisms that
control the observed selectivity patterns. Of particular interest is
the identification of the bimetallic structure responsible for the
activity and selectivity enhancement; i.e., is the active AgPt surface
an alloy (in which Ag is incorporated into the metal lattice), or an
adlayer of Ag on Pt? While it is expected that Ag is initially depos-
ited as an adlayer on the Pt surface, exposure to pretreatment and
reaction conditions may result in the formation of a thermodynam-
ically favored alloy [1820].
This paper is organized as follows. After explaining the experi-
mental and theoretical methodology used in the study, we present
experimental XPS results showing that Ag is electronically modi-
fied through an interaction with Pt, thus confirming the preferen-
tial deposition of Ag onto Pt sites rather than on the support. These
results are compared to theoretical studies of various surface mod-
els to provide insights into the observed electronic effects. This
presentation is followed by a discussion of further theoretical cal-
culations of the adsorption of CO and EpB on model bimetallic sur-
faces, which further elucidate the nature of the active catalytic
surface.
2. Experimental
A series of AgPt/SiO2 catalysts with varying Ag weight loadings
was prepared using electroless deposition. The details of this prep-
aration have been described in a previous report [10]. Briefly, all
catalysts were prepared using 1.67 wt% Pt/SiO2 (supplied by BASF)
with a Pt dispersion of 3.7% (as determined by H2 chemisorption)
as the base monometallic catalyst. The low dispersion indicates a
large average Pt particle size on the support. The bimetallic ED cat-
alysts were prepared by exposing Pt/SiO2 to an ED solution at pH 9
containing formaldehyde as the reducing agent, and silver nitrate
as the Ag+ source. The Ag deposition levels were controlled by lim-
iting the amount of AgNO3 placed in the solution, since it was pos-
sible to deposit all the Ag+ in the ED solution. Additionally, a 2 wt%
Ag/SiO2 catalyst was prepared as a reference catalyst using tradi-
tional incipient wetness methodologies [10].
Hydrogen chemisorption results for these samples have been
reported previously [10], and are only repeated here in order to
provide a more complete interpretation of the XPS results. Briefly,
catalysts were reduced in situ at 200 C in flowing H2 for four hours
followed by evacuation at 200 C for 6 h. After cooling to 40 C in
vacuum, H2 uptake was measured using a Quantachrom Autosorb
I analyzer. Since Ag does not chemisorb hydrogen at 40 C, the frac-
tion of surface Pt sites covered by Ag (hAg) was determined using
the following equation:
hAg  Pt=SiO2 dispersion  AgPt=SiO2 apparent dispersion
Pt=SiO2 dispersion
1
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
collected using a hemispherical analyzer on a Kratos Axis Ultra
DLD XPS with a monochromated Al Ka X-ray source. The system
provides an energy resolution of 0.5 eV. Due to the insulating nat-
ure of the catalyst support (SiO2), charge neutralization was re-
quired,
and
was
achieved
using
standard
techniques
[21].
Catalysts were pretreated in situ in a pretreatment cell directly at-
tached to the XPS chamber. The monometallic Pt and bimetallic
AgPt catalysts were pretreated in a hydrogen atmosphere at
200 C and the Ag/SiO2 catalyst were pretreated at 300 C for 2 h
to ensure complete reduction. The samples were then cooled to
room temperature and moved into the UHV chamber (without
exposure to air) to conduct the XPS measurements at an average
vacuum of 6.7  107 Pa (5  109 mm Hg).
Peak fitting was achieved using XPSPeak 4.1 software [22]. The
Si 2p region was modeled using a single peak since the change in
energy between the peaks in the spin orbit splitting pair is charac-
teristically small and the data resolution was too low to distinguish
two individual peaks. All Pt and Ag binding energies were cor-
rected using the 103.3 eV Si 2p peak as a reference and were then
modeled using a mixed ShirleyLinear background. Splitting pairs
for Pt 4f and Ag 3d were constrained such that the appropriate area
ratios were attained while maintaining equal values for both the
FWHM and % GaussianLorentzian character.
All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-Initio
Simulation Package [23,24]. The surfaces examined included
Pt(111), Ag(111), and the following Ag coverages on Pt(111):
0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 ML. Additionally, Pt3Ag was examined both as
a bulk alloy and as a single layer surface alloy on top of a
Pt(111) substrate. Modeling methods were varied depending on
whether the objective of the calculation was to compute core level
energies (for determining BE shifts) or adsorption energies and
configurations of probe molecules. For the BE calculations, the
semi-infinite slabs consisted of a minimum of four metal layers.
The total cell height was fixed at ten equivalent metal layers. The
epitaxial Ag layers were deposited on one side of the Pt bulk such
that the 2 ML Ag slab consisted of four Pt layers with two layers of
Ag and four equivalent layers of vacuum. Ag adsorbs on Pt(111) in
the threefold hollow sites, with a slight computed preference for
the fcc site. Relaxation calculations were performed with plane
waves generated using the PAW method and made finite with a
400 eV cutoff energy [25]. The PW91 GGA functional was used
[26] and Brillouin zone sampling was performed with a 5  5  1
Monkhorst Pack k-point mesh [27]. Lattice constants were calcu-
lated as 3.99 and 4.02 Å for Pt(111) and Pt3Ag(111), respectively.
In all calculations, the top two layers were allowed to relax. Once
optimized geometries were obtained, total energy calculations
were performed with an 11  11  1 Monkhorst Pack k-point
mesh. The denser k-point mesh was required to achieve conver-
gence of the core binding energies.
Core level shifts (Pt 4f, Ag 3d) were approximated using initial
state effects only; in other words, BE shifts were computed as a dif-
ference between core electron energies in the initial state. The fol-
lowing equations describe the standard method for calculating BE
shifts for various surfaces:

where DBEPt is the binding energy shift for a surface Pt atom in a
bimetallic system with respect to Pt(111); DBEAg is the BE shift
for a surface Ag atom with respect to a surface Ag atom for a
Pt(111) surface covered by 2 ML of Ag; ePt and eAg are the Pt 4f
and Ag 3d electron energies for the given bimetallic surface atoms,
and ePt(1 1 1) and eAgAgPt(1 1 1) are the Pt 4f and Ag 3d electron energies
for the reference surfaces, respectively. Calculation of the core elec-
tron energies from the KohnSham eigenstates is made possible by
the frozen core implementation of the all-electron PAW method
[28]. While more accurate calculations (including final state effects)
may be obtained by treating the core electrons self-consistently, the
frozen core approximation is expected to minimally influence initial
state calculations of the core electron energies [28]. Moreover,
although the calculations reported here lack final state contribu-
tions, prior studies indicate accurate shifts can generally be ob-
tained with just initial state contributions. For example, Andersen
et al. explored the importance of including final state effects in
the surface core level shifts of numerous 4d metals, and found that
while final state effects are often needed to compute shifts to an
accuracy of 0.050 eV, the main trends in BE shifts were well-de-
scribed by initial state effects [29]. Kohler and Kresse have studied
surface core level shifts on Rh(111) incorporating both initial and
final state effects, and have found only small final state effects for
uncovered metal atoms, while relaxation effects become more sig-
nificant for CO-covered Rh atoms [30]. Finally, Linic et al. have used
initial state effects only to accurately predict the shift in C 1s bind-
ing energy (with a frozen core) in the reaction of ethylene oxide to a
surface oxametallacycle [31]. As indicated by the cited studies,
while methods of including final state effects and fully relaxed core
electrons would likely enhance the accuracy of the calculations
[32], binding energy shifts are often calculated with sufficient accu-
racy to evaluate trends using initial state effects alone. This appears
to be borne out by comparisons between experiment and theory de-
scribed below.
Spin orbit coupling was neglected in the calculations; although
this will result in some error, previous calculations have indicated
that accurate BE shifts (rather than the absolute BE) can be deter-
mined without including spin orbit coupling [2931]. When com-
paring between surfaces, a common energy reference must be
established for determination of the core electron energies used
in computing shifts according to Eqs. (2) and (3). In this case, we
used the vacuum level of the Pt(111) slab, since all surfaces except
Pt3Ag and Ag(111) are built on Pt(111). Additional calculations
were performed with a single atom placed in the middle of the vac-
uum space to provide a common reference between surfaces (Pt or
Ag, depending on core level of interest). This enabled the compar-
isons of Pt3Ag(111) and Ag(111) to be made with the other sur-
faces. For the Pt(111) based calculations, very good agreement
between the two methods was achieved. The data presented in-
clude binding energy shifts for Pt3Ag and Ag(111) based on the
second method described. Using this second method, the Ag(3d)
binding energy of Ag(111) was found to be only 0.01 eV more po-
sitive than that of 2 ML Ag/Pt(111).
For investigations of CO adsorption, a four-layer slab of 2  2
periodicity was employed, and the top two layers of the slab were
allowed to relax. For studies of the adsorption of EpB on Pt(111)
and Ag-modified Pt(111) surfaces, a larger surface unit cell
(3  3) was employed to accommodate the larger EpB molecule;
to keep computations tractable, a three-layer fixed metal slab
was employed. The modifying Ag and/or probe molecules in such
cases were deposited only on the top side of the slab, and the slab
was held fixed in the optimized bulk lattice positions.
d-Band data were obtained from atom projected density of
states for the surface atoms. The d-band centers were calculated as
ed  l1
l0  eF
4
where ed is the d-band center, l1 is the first moment of the d-band,
l0 is the zeroth moment, and eF is the Fermi energy. The DOS at the
Fermi level is the raw value normalized to the total number of
states. These values are only applicable to the surface atoms.
3. Results
3.1. Experimental XPS results
Fig. 1 shows the XPS Ag 3d5/2 region for various loadings of Ag
that have been electrolessly deposited on 1.7 wt% Pt/SiO2. As ex-
pected, the Ag peak intensity increases with increasing Ag loading.
Further, there is a shift in the Ag 3d peak position indicating the
presence of an electronic interaction between Ag and Pt. The bind-
ing energy of the bimetallic sample with the lowest Ag loading
(0.007 wt% Ag) is 0.75 eV less than that of bulk Ag (2 wt% Ag/
SiO2), indicating a transfer of electrons from Pt to Ag. However,
the Pt 4f BE only shifted 0.14 eV over the entire range of bimetal-
lic catalysts. This relatively small shift in the Pt binding energy is
expected since electronic interactions are restricted to the PtAg
interface, and only a small fraction of the Pt sites probed by XPS
are surface sites that can interact with Ag adlayers [13]. For exam-
ple, approximately 86% of the electrons detected by XPS are located
within the depth defined as twice the inelastic mean free path
(IMFP) [33], which, based on the models proposed by Seah and
Dench [34], is roughly equivalent to 20 ML of Pt. Thus, for all Ag
loadings, the AgPt interface was sampled, along with a relatively
large portion of the sub-surface Pt.
Previous chemisorption results and FTIR of adsorbed CO [10]
demonstrated that Ag deposition does not occur in a layer by layer
fashion in these electroless deposition-derived AgPt/SiO2 cata-
lysts. Rather, there was a substantial contribution from the auto-
catalytic deposition of Ag onto Ag, particularly at loadings
>0.015 wt% Ag [10]. This is apparent from Fig. 2, which shows

the deviation of the observed Ag coverage from the theoretical,
monodisperse coverage. Since the electronic interactions occur at
the AgPt interface, the fraction of surface Pt sites covered by Ag
is a more relevant parameter for comparison than Ag weight load-
ing. Fig. 3 shows the XPS Ag 3d BE shift relative to 2 wt% Ag/SiO2
(open circles) as a function of the fraction of surface Pt sites cov-
ered by Ag.
The observed shift in the Ag 3d BE for SiO2-supported catalysts
is consistent with previous ab-initio model results and single crys-
tal studies [1315], and can be attributed to various factors, includ-
ing particle size, strain, and ligand effects [35,36]. It is important to
note that variations in metal particle size may result in a BE shift.
For example, a decrease in Pt particle size reportedly results in an
increase in the BE observed for Pt [37,38]. Likewise, small Ag par-
ticles supported on amorphous graphite were reported to result in
an increase Ag 3d BE due to the onset of the metalinsulator tran-
sition [35,39]. Thus, the observed decrease in Ag BE for the low Ag
loadings in this study is opposite to that reported for Ag particle
size effects, and must be attributed to another source. DFT calcula-
tions can provide insight into the origin of the observed BE shift
(ligand versus strain), as discussed below.
3.2. Computational results
3.2.1. Core level shifts for different surface models
Calculated results are separated into two tables: Table 1 for the
Pt atoms and Table 2 for the Ag atoms. For Table 1, the number of Ag
neighbors (NAg) in contact with each Pt atom is displayed to distin-
guish between Pt atoms with different local environments in sub-
monolayer Ag surfaces. Binding energy shifts are referenced to
the
calculated
values
of
Pt(4f) = 72.7 eV
for
Pt(111)
and
Ag(3d) = 360.0 eV for Ag(111). As mentioned previously, these ini-
tial state calculations omit spin orbit coupling. Significant shifts
were calculated for the Ag 3d BE; the largest shift was observed
for the lowest calculated Ag loading. Deposition of 2 ML of Ag re-
sulted in a calculated BE similar to that of bulk Ag. As shown in
Fig. 3, there is a clear correlation between the experimental results
reported in the previous section and the theoretical results pre-
dicted using ab-initio calculations for a Ag adlayer model (solid
squares). Interestingly, both model and experimental results show
a linear relationship between the sub-monolayer Ag coverage and
the Ag 3d binding energy. In order to confirm this observation, a
1/9 ML Ag/Pt(111) calculation was performed with a four-layer
3  3 Pt(111) slab using the atom in vacuum space method.
The resultant BE shift, displayed as an open square in Fig. 3, was
very similar to that predicted by extrapolating the data from higher
coverages.
The computed BE shifts are in reasonable agreement (in magni-
tude and direction) with the experimental results at low Ag load-
ings for both Ag adlayer and alloy models. Comparison of the
PtAg model to experiment is more difficult, since the details of al-
loy formation (how the surface/bulk Ag concentration would in-
crease with increasing Ag loading) are highly complex and have
not been probed in the current simulations. Nevertheless, the sig-
nificant shifts in Ag BE for the alloy structures are in the same
direction and of a similar magnitude to the maximum shifts ob-
served experimentally. Differences in BE, therefore, need to be sup-
plemented by other information to better identify which model is
more representative of the active catalyst surface; this is discussed
below. However, for the time being, we will assume that the adlay-
er model is appropriate: Fig. 3 shows the results of the modeling
simulations compared to experiment, demonstrating excellent
agreement.
The DFT results show that the observed BE shifts of a Ag adlayer
model may be largely attributed to ligand effects rather than strain
effects. The roughly linear trend in the BE shift at low coverages is
consistent with a ligand effect. However, the largest shifts are com-
puted for the lowest coverages of Ag on Pt(111), in which no lat-
tice mismatch effects should be observed. Further, since the Pt
lattice constant (3.92 Å) is smaller than that of Ag (4.09 Å) [40],
the Ag adlayer should undergo compressive strain, resulting in a
decrease in both the d-band center and the CO adsorption strength
[41] and a corresponding increase in the Ag BE relative to bulk sil-
ver [12]. Indeed, DFT calculations confirm that decreasing the
Ag(111) lattice constant from the relaxed value of 4.17 Å to
3.99 Å results in an increase the Ag 3d BE (0.07 eV). Since the
experimental results show a decrease, rather than an increase, in
the Ag 3d BE, it is clear that strain effects are not dominant in

the AgPt system. Calculation of the population of the Ag 4d orbital
suggests relatively little charge transfer between Ag and Pt for all
bimetallic surface models; the electron population varies by less
than 0.1 from the value for a surface Ag atom in Ag(111) for all
PtAg surface models considered.
3.2.2. Adsorption of CO and EpB on Ag/Pt surface models
Unambiguously identifying the atomic configuration of the ac-
tive catalyst surface cannot be readily accomplished using XPS
alone since the results may be consistent with Ag existing as an
adlayer, a surface alloy, or a bulk alloy. Fortunately, the valence
states are easily distinguishable in the homogeneous alloy and
adlayer models. Two valence band metrics provide the most signif-
icant measure for adsorption affinity: the d-band center (ed) and
the concentration of states at the Fermi level (q at eF) [42,43]
which are included in Tables 1 and 2. The strongest CO adsorption
will occur for the least negative d-band center and largest concen-
tration of d-states at the Fermi level. Bulk Ag, which has a very neg-
ative d-band center and few d-states at its Fermi level, has a lesser
propensity for CO adsorption than Pt. Thus, Ag sites on Ag/Pt sur-
faces are expected to be relatively inactive compared to the Pt
sites. In addition to the site-blocking effect of Ag on adsorption,
Ag adatoms shift the Pt d-band away from the Fermi level, which
should result in weaker adsorption. The key difference between
the Pt3Ag alloy models and the adlayer model is that, unlike the
adlayer, the alloy shifts the Pt d-band toward the Fermi level. From
Table 2 it is clear that the presence of Pt shifts the Ag d-band center
towards the Fermi level such that stronger CO adsorption is fa-
vored. The predicted increase in Ag adsorption strength is consis-
tent with CO desorption from Ag in a AgPt system as reported
by Rodriguez et al. [17].
The results can be further understood by examining CO adsorp-
tion in Table 3. Previous work has found that DFT incorrectly iden-
tifies the hollow sites as the most stable sites for CO adsorption on
Pt(111) [44,45]. Analysis of this work focuses on the qualitative
differences in adsorption in each of the high-symmetry sites on
Pt(111) surfaces modified by Ag. One clear difference between
the surfaces is the loss in active sites due to Ag. CO adsorption
was found to be unstable on all bridge and hollow sites involving
a Ag atom. Additionally, for 0.25 ML Ag/Pt(111), all bridge and hol-
low sites adjacent to the Ag atom were found to be unstable. On
the Pt3Ag surface, convergence was achieved on Ag atop sites,
but CO adsorption on these sites is approximately 0.2 eV below
vacuum.
The difference in CO affinity between the Pt3Ag surface and the
0.25 ML Ag/Pt(111), shown in Fig. 4, is both statistical and elec-
tronic in nature. For 0.25 ML Ag/Pt(111), only 25% of atop sites will
adsorb CO, compared with 75% of atop sites for Pt3Ag. Thus, as dis-
cussed below, incorporation of Ag as an adlayer above Pt would be
expected to result in a dramatic decrease in the amount of atop ad-
sorbed CO. In contrast, CO adsorption in hollow sites on Pt3Ag is
limited to 25% of both fcc and hcp sites, while adsorption on
0.25 ML Ag/Pt(111) may occur in up to 75% of hcp sites, but only
25% of fcc sites. Differences in electronic effects are the conse-
quence of Ag induced d-band restructuring. Adsorption on Pt3Ag,
particularly the surface alloy, is strengthened in excess of 0.1 eV
on all Pt adsorption sites relative to Pt(111). Although only small
decreases in CO adsorption energy were calculated for the twofold
and threefold coordinated adsorption sites on 0.25 ML Ag/Pt(111),
atop adsorbed CO decreased in energy by nearly 0.3 eV relative to
Pt(111). This suggests that atop CO adsorption in sites adjacent to
adsorbed Ag adatoms will be less favorable.
Given that CO saturates Pt(111) at about 2/3 ML [4648], poi-
soning of Pt sites by depositing small quantities of Ag (less than
0.25 ML) is not likely to occur if the Ag atoms are incorporated into
the surface as in the Pt3Ag surface alloy model. In fact, the alloy-in-
duced increase in CO adsorption energy could potentially over-
come adsorbate repulsions to increase CO coverage. On the other
hand, if Ag is deposited on the surface and is never incorporated
into the surface or bulk, each Ag atom would completely inhibit
CO adsorption on the three Pt atoms coordinated to Ag and weaken
adsorption on their nearest neighbor sites.
Comparison with FTIR data of CO adsorption on AgPt/SiO2
facilitates further interpretation of these results [10]. On Pt/SiO2,
CO adsorbs predominately on atop sites, with some multifold
adsorption. The inclusion of small quantities of Ag (<0.1 wt%)
markedly decreases the absorption intensity, which would not be
predicted from the Pt3Ag DFT model, but is consistent with adsorp-
tion on adlayer Ag/Pt(111). In addition to the decrease in peak area
with increasing Ag coverage, the singleton frequency of atop ad-
sorbed CO on Pt also increases slightly. This higher frequency,
indicative of a stronger CO bond, would likely result from less

filling of the 2p* orbitals. The presence of adlayer Ag, which shifts
the d-band centers negatively and reduces the concentration of
states at the Fermi level, would likely inhibit PtCO back bonding,
thereby decreasing electron occupation of the 2p* orbitals [49,50].
The adsorption of EpB was also investigated on three types of
surfaces: Pt(111), Pt(111) covered by 1/9 to 2/9 ML of Ag, and a
Pt8Ag/Pt(111) surface alloy. The intact EpB molecule was found
to bind on all surfaces with nearly equal adsorption energy (see
Table 4 and Fig. 5) though the epoxide function preferentially
interacts with Ag adatoms above Pt(111). As shown in Fig. 5, the
preferred adsorption geometry of EpB was determined to be
through di-sigma bonding on the olefin, consistent with previous
electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements on Pt(111)
[51]. On all surfaces, it was found to be thermodynamically favor-
able for EpB to ring-open to form an oxametallacycle intermediate.
Oxametallacycle formation was found to be more exothermic by
0.3 eV on the Pt8Ag/Pt(111) surface alloy compared to the pure
Pt surface (Table 4). This result is consistent with predictions above
that reactivity of Pt is enhanced in the Ag surface alloy. In the opti-
mized geometry, the EpB molecule is not directly bound to a Ag
atom, though the O atom is bound to a Pt that neighbors the Ag.
During the course of performing geometry optimizations from
multiple initial guesses, it was found that scission of a C1H bond
of the oxametallacycle was highly favorable, and in fact occurred
spontaneously during the course of many geometry optimizations
to form an adsorbed aldehyde. The C1H scission has also been ob-
served to occur upon ring-opening in experimental studies of EpB
on Pt(111), consistent with these results [51]. Interestingly, at
both 1/9 and 2/9 ML Ag coverage on Pt(111), no stable oxametal-
lacycle species was identified; the interaction of the O atom with
Ag allows rotation about the CO bond and subsequent H abstrac-
tion. Although CH scission appears to have a higher barrier on
Pt(111), the aldehyde species formed from the scission is more
stable on Pt(111) by ca. 0.2 eV compared to Ag/Pt(111), consistent
with the weakened chemisorption on the Ag adatom-covered
surface.
It has previously been postulated that Ag may promote selectiv-
ity through a bifunctional effect in which the role of Ag may be to
bind to and protect the oxygenate function of the surface so that
reaction preferentially occurs at the olefin function [51]. The re-
sults presented here are consistent with the Ag modifier interact-
ing preferentially with the oxygenate function of the molecule;
however, in the models investigated in the current work, the Ag
does not appear to protect the oxygenate function, as aldehyde
formation is observed to proceed with low barrier upon ring-open-
ing. However, it should be noted that only a few coverage scenarios
were investigated in the present work; in particular, higher Ag and
EpB coverages could lead to different adsorbate configurations. The
role of the Ag adatoms in modifying the kinetics of ring-opening
which is potentially important given the preferential interaction of
the epoxide function with Ag adatomswas not investigated in the
current work.
The adsorption energy for the oxametallacycle is approximately
0.3 eV greater on the Pt8Ag surface alloy than on the pure Pt surface.
In studies of EpB hydrogenation, it was noted [10] that the reaction
order with respect to EpB increased from near-zero to near-half or-
der when Ag was added to a Pt/SiO2 catalyst, consistent with a
weakened EpB binding state on the modified Pt surface. Although
a stable oxametallacycle was not isolated for the Ag/Pt(111) sur-
face, this result suggests that Ag is present as an adlayer above
the Pt surface, rather than being incorporated into the Pt lattice.
Finally, we note that the Ag adlayer model may be consistent in
an additional way with the experimental data presented in Fig. 2.
Note that the actual reduction in hydrogen chemisorption uptake
is slightly greater than that predicted from a simple site-blocking
model for Ag on Pt(111) at low Ag loading. Although this observa-
tion is contingent upon the error associated with the chemisorp-

tion results, the trend is consistent with Ag reducing the binding
affinity of H on sites adjacent to Ag adatoms and resulting in a
smaller H2 uptake than would result from site occupation by Ag
alone. Thus, multiple measures of adsorption strength on the cata-
lyst surface suggest that the active surface likely involves a Ag
adlayer rather than metal alloy. While this work has not explored
the possibility of Ag island formation, it is known that Ag interacts
significantly more strongly with Pt(111) than with Ag(111) [52].
Although some two-dimensional Ag clustering may be present on
the catalysts used in this work, the adlayer structure seems to
present a reasonable model of the surface at low Ag loadings based
on the good agreement between experiment and theory. As the Ag
loading is increased, more significant departures from the adlayer
model may be expected. The results above indicate that this adlay-
er may function through either a ligand effect (by weakening
adsorption on Pt sites), a bifunctional effect (by the epoxide end
of the molecule preferentially interacting with Ag), or an ensemble
effect. Further detailed surface studies are needed to elucidate the
mechanism(s) responsible for the olefin hydrogenation selectivity
enhancement. Future work should also explore reactions at the
Pt/Ag interface to model the effects of Ag clustering.
4. Conclusions
Bimetallic AgPt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by electroless deposi-
tion were studied by XPS, and various surface models for the cata-
lysts were examined using DFT. A significant shift (up to 0.75 eV)
was observed in the Ag 3d BE relative to bulk Ag. The magnitude
and direction of the shift are consistent with a surface model in
which Ag exists in an adlayer on the Pt surface, but are not incon-
sistent with PtAg alloy models. DFT studies of CO and EpB adsorp-
tion were used to refine the understanding of the surface model.
These calculations showed that CO and EpB binding are weakened
on the Ag adlayer model and strengthened on the surface alloy
model. Since previous studies of the ED-prepared AgPt catalysts
are consistent with weakened binding of CO and EpB, it is con-
cluded that the active state of the surface is most likely well-repre-
sented by a Ag adlayer on a Pt surface. Finally, in a more general
sense, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-
less deposition preparation method.
