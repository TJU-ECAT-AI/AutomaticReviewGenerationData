[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[4] "It is known that EG and other low molecular weight polyols originate predominantly from the hydrogenolysis of glucose, while the sugar alcohols result from the hydrogenation of glucose (Scheme1)."

The literature primarily focuses on the catalytic conversion of cellulose using tungsten carbide and nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts, rather than specifically addressing Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation. However, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalysis and hydrogenation processes relevant to biomass conversion.

The study demonstrates that nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts (Ni-W2C/AC) significantly enhance the conversion of cellulose into polyols, particularly ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol. This bimetallic system exhibits a synergistic effect, with optimal performance at 2 wt% nickel loading and a preparation temperature of 973K.

The process involves hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogenolysis of glucose produces EG and other low molecular weight polyols, while hydrogenation of glucose yields sugar alcohols. The Ni-W2C/AC catalyst shows a higher selectivity towards hydrogenolysis compared to traditional precious metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3, resulting in higher EG yields.

This research contributes to the field of cellulosic biomass conversion by demonstrating an efficient, non-precious metal catalyst system for producing valuable chemicals like ethylene glycol from renewable resources. The methodology employed includes catalyst preparation through carbothermal hydrogen reduction, characterization using XRD and TEM, and performance evaluation in a high-pressure autoclave reactor.

While the study doesn't directly address fine chemical synthesis or theoretical approaches, it provides experimental insights into optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions in biomass conversion. The findings suggest potential applications for similar bimetallic systems in other hydrogenation processes and highlight the importance of metal-support interactions and preparation conditions in catalyst design.

这篇文献主要关注于使用碳化钨和镍促进的碳化钨催化剂进行纤维素催化转化，而不是特别针对C=O键氢化的Pt-Ni双金属催化剂。然而，它确实提供了与生物质转化相关的双金属催化和氢化过程的见解。

研究表明，镍促进的碳化钨催化剂（Ni-W2C/AC）显著提高了纤维素向多元醇的转化，特别是乙二醇（EG）和山梨醇。这个双金属系统表现出协同效应，在2 wt%镍负载量和973K制备温度下性能最佳。

该过程涉及氢解和氢化反应。葡萄糖的氢解产生乙二醇和其他低分子量多元醇，而葡萄糖的氢化产生糖醇。与传统的贵金属催化剂如Pt/Al2O3相比，Ni-W2C/AC催化剂表现出更高的氢解选择性，从而产生更高的乙二醇产率。

这项研究通过展示一种高效的非贵金属催化剂系统，用于从可再生资源生产乙二醇等有价值的化学品，为纤维素生物质转化领域做出了贡献。所采用的方法包括通过碳热氢还原法制备催化剂，使用XRD和TEM进行表征，以及在高压釜反应器中评估性能。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及精细化学品合成或理论方法，但它为优化生物质转化中的选择性氢化和氢解反应的双金属催化剂提供了实验见解。研究结果表明，类似的双金属系统在其他氢化过程中可能有潜在应用，并强调了金属-载体相互作用和制备条件在催化剂设计中的重要性。

The literature primarily focuses on the use of nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts for cellulose conversion to ethylene glycol, rather than specifically addressing Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation. However, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalyst systems and their applications in biomass conversion:

1. Bimetallic catalysts, such as nickel-promoted tungsten carbide, can significantly enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products in cellulosic biomass conversion. In this case, the addition of nickel to tungsten carbide improved the yield of ethylene glycol and other polyols.

2. The synergistic effect between two metals in a catalyst system can be optimized by adjusting the metal loading and preparation conditions. For the Ni-W2C system, the optimal performance was achieved with 2 wt% nickel loading and a preparation temperature of 973K.

3. Bimetallic catalysts can offer advantages over single-metal precious metal catalysts. In this study, the nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalyst showed higher selectivity for ethylene glycol production compared to platinum and ruthenium catalysts.

4. The use of bimetallic catalysts in biomass conversion can lead to more efficient and cost-effective processes, as demonstrated by the high yield of ethylene glycol (61%) achieved with the Ni-W2C catalyst.

While the document doesn't directly address C=O bond hydrogenation or Pt-Ni systems, it illustrates the potential of bimetallic catalysts in related applications and the methodologies used to study and optimize their performance, such as varying metal loadings and preparation conditions.

More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "One outstanding feature of the W2C/AC catalysts in the catalytic conversion of cellulose is the surprisingly high selectivity for EG formation. The yield of EG obtained over the W2C/AC catalyst is almost twice as large as that obtained over Pt/Al2O3 (Table1, entry17)."

[3] "To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The idea is based on two considerations: 1)nickel is a well-known active catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol; and 2)nickel could promote the formation of tungsten carbides as indicated in Figure1, which suggests the possibility of synergy by combining nickel and W2C in catalytic reactions."

While it doesn't directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalysis for biomass conversion.

The study demonstrates that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC) catalysts can effectively convert cellulose into polyols. When promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially EG and sorbitol, significantly increases. This nickel-tungsten carbide system shows a synergistic effect, maximized at 2 wt% nickel loading and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction temperature of 973K.

The W2C/AC catalysts exhibit high selectivity for EG formation, outperforming traditional precious metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3. The addition of nickel to the tungsten carbide catalyst is based on nickel's known activity for glucose hydrogenation to sorbitol and its ability to promote tungsten carbide formation.

While this study doesn't cover all aspects of the question, it demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can be employed to enhance selectivity and efficiency in cellulosic biomass conversion. The research combines theoretical considerations (such as the known properties of nickel and tungsten carbide) with experimental optimization of catalyst composition and preparation conditions to achieve improved yields of desired products.

This work represents an important step in developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for biomass conversion, potentially replacing precious metal catalysts with less expensive alternatives while maintaining or improving catalytic performance.

这篇文献主要关注使用镍促进的碳化钨催化剂将纤维素转化为多元醇，特别是乙二醇（EG）。虽然它没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统催化氢化C=O键，但它确实为生物质转化的双金属催化提供了见解。

研究表明，碳载碳化钨（W2C/AC）催化剂可以有效地将纤维素转化为多元醇。当添加少量镍进行促进时，多元醇的产率，尤其是EG和山梨醇，显著增加。这种镍-碳化钨系统表现出协同效应，在镍负载量为2 wt%和碳热氢还原温度为973K时达到最佳效果。

W2C/AC催化剂对EG的形成表现出高选择性，性能优于传统的贵金属催化剂如Pt/Al2O3。向碳化钨催化剂中添加镍的想法基于镍对葡萄糖加氢生成山梨醇的已知活性，以及其促进碳化钨形成的能力。
