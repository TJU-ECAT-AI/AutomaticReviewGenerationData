[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[4] "It is known that EG and other low molecular weight polyols originate predominantly from the hydrogenolysis of glucose, while the sugar alcohols result from the hydrogenation of glucose (Scheme1)."

The literature primarily focuses on the catalytic conversion of cellulose using tungsten carbide and nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts, rather than specifically addressing Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation. However, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalysis and hydrogenation processes relevant to biomass conversion.

The study demonstrates that nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts (Ni-W2C/AC) significantly enhance the conversion of cellulose into polyols, particularly ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol. This bimetallic system exhibits a synergistic effect, with optimal performance at 2 wt% nickel loading and a preparation temperature of 973K.

The process involves hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogenolysis of glucose produces EG and other low molecular weight polyols, while hydrogenation of glucose yields sugar alcohols. The Ni-W2C/AC catalyst shows a higher selectivity towards hydrogenolysis compared to traditional precious metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3, resulting in higher EG yields.

This research contributes to the field of cellulosic biomass conversion by demonstrating an efficient, non-precious metal catalyst system for producing valuable chemicals like ethylene glycol from renewable resources. The methodology employed includes catalyst preparation through carbothermal hydrogen reduction, characterization using XRD and TEM, and performance evaluation in a high-pressure autoclave reactor.

While the study doesn't directly address fine chemical synthesis or theoretical approaches, it provides experimental insights into optimizing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions in biomass conversion. The findings suggest potential applications for similar bimetallic systems in other hydrogenation processes and highlight the importance of metal-support interactions and preparation conditions in catalyst design.

这篇文献主要关注于使用碳化钨和镍促进的碳化钨催化剂进行纤维素催化转化，而不是特别针对C=O键氢化的Pt-Ni双金属催化剂。然而，它确实提供了与生物质转化相关的双金属催化和氢化过程的见解。

研究表明，镍促进的碳化钨催化剂（Ni-W2C/AC）显著提高了纤维素向多元醇的转化，特别是乙二醇（EG）和山梨醇。这个双金属系统表现出协同效应，在2 wt%镍负载量和973K制备温度下性能最佳。

该过程涉及氢解和氢化反应。葡萄糖的氢解产生乙二醇和其他低分子量多元醇，而葡萄糖的氢化产生糖醇。与传统的贵金属催化剂如Pt/Al2O3相比，Ni-W2C/AC催化剂表现出更高的氢解选择性，从而产生更高的乙二醇产率。

这项研究通过展示一种高效的非贵金属催化剂系统，用于从可再生资源生产乙二醇等有价值的化学品，为纤维素生物质转化领域做出了贡献。所采用的方法包括通过碳热氢还原法制备催化剂，使用XRD和TEM进行表征，以及在高压釜反应器中评估性能。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及精细化学品合成或理论方法，但它为优化生物质转化中的选择性氢化和氢解反应的双金属催化剂提供了实验见解。研究结果表明，类似的双金属系统在其他氢化过程中可能有潜在应用，并强调了金属-载体相互作用和制备条件在催化剂设计中的重要性。
