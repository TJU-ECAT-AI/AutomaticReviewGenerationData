[1] "When the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

[3] "A remarkable advantage of the tungsten carbide over platinum and ruthenium catalysts is the high yield of EG relative to other polyols."

[4] "More importantly, with the promotion of a small amount of nickel, the yield of EG was significantly increased to 61% by a synergistic effect between nickel and W2C."

The literature primarily focuses on the use of nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts for cellulose conversion to ethylene glycol, rather than specifically addressing Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation. However, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalyst systems and their applications in biomass conversion:

1. Bimetallic catalysts, such as nickel-promoted tungsten carbide, can significantly enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products in cellulosic biomass conversion. In this case, the addition of nickel to tungsten carbide improved the yield of ethylene glycol and other polyols.

2. The synergistic effect between two metals in a catalyst system can be optimized by adjusting the metal loading and preparation conditions. For the Ni-W2C system, the optimal performance was achieved with 2 wt% nickel loading and a preparation temperature of 973K.

3. Bimetallic catalysts can offer advantages over single-metal precious metal catalysts. In this study, the nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalyst showed higher selectivity for ethylene glycol production compared to platinum and ruthenium catalysts.

4. The use of bimetallic catalysts in biomass conversion can lead to more efficient and cost-effective processes, as demonstrated by the high yield of ethylene glycol (61%) achieved with the Ni-W2C catalyst.

While the document doesn't directly address C=O bond hydrogenation or Pt-Ni systems, it illustrates the potential of bimetallic catalysts in related applications and the methodologies used to study and optimize their performance, such as varying metal loadings and preparation conditions.

这篇文献主要关注镍促进的碳化钨催化剂在纤维素转化为乙二醇方面的应用，而不是特别针对Pt-Ni双金属催化剂在C=O键氢化方面的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于双金属催化剂系统及其在生物质转化中应用的见解：

1. 双金属催化剂，如镍促进的碳化钨，可以显著提高纤维素生物质转化中目标产品的选择性和产率。在这个案例中，向碳化钨中添加镍提高了乙二醇和其他多元醇的产率。

2. 通过调整金属负载量和制备条件，可以优化催化剂系统中两种金属之间的协同效应。对于Ni-W2C系统，在2 wt%的镍负载量和973K的制备温度下获得了最佳性能。

3. 双金属催化剂可以比单一贵金属催化剂提供更多优势。在这项研究中，镍促进的碳化钨催化剂在乙二醇生产方面表现出比铂和钌催化剂更高的选择性。

4. 在生物质转化中使用双金属催化剂可以带来更高效和更具成本效益的过程，这通过Ni-W2C催化剂实现的高乙二醇产率（61%）得到了证明。

虽然该文档没有直接涉及C=O键氢化或Pt-Ni系统，但它展示了双金属催化剂在相关应用中的潜力，以及用于研究和优化其性能的方法，如改变金属负载量和制备条件。
