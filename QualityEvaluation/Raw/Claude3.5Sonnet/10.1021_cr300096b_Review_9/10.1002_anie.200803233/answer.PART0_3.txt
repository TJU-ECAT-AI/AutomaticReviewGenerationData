The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a significant role in cellulosic biomass conversion. The literature discusses the use of various catalysts for this purpose, including Pt/Al2O3 and nickel-promoted tungsten carbide (Ni-W2C) catalysts.

In the context of cellulose conversion, these catalysts contribute to the production of valuable chemicals such as ethylene glycol (EG) and sugar alcohols. The bimetallic Ni-W2C catalyst showed a synergistic effect, significantly improving the yield of EG compared to monometallic catalysts. This synergy was optimized at a specific nickel loading and preparation temperature.

The research methodology employed in this study involved catalyst preparation, characterization, and performance evaluation in cellulose conversion reactions. The catalysts were prepared using a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method, and their performance was assessed based on cellulose conversion rates and product yields. The effects of various parameters such as metal loading, preparation temperature, and reaction conditions were studied to optimize the catalytic process.

The efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts were enhanced through careful tuning of the catalyst composition and preparation conditions. For example, the addition of a small amount of nickel to tungsten carbide significantly improved the yield of EG, demonstrating how bimetallic systems can be optimized for specific reactions.

This research contributes to the broader field of biomass conversion, offering insights into how catalytic systems can be designed and optimized for the efficient production of valuable chemicals from renewable resources.

C=O键的催化氢化，特别是使用像Pt-Ni系统这样的双金属催化剂，在纤维素生物质转化中发挥着重要作用。文献讨论了各种催化剂在这一领域的应用，包括Pt/Al2O3和镍促进的碳化钨（Ni-W2C）催化剂。

在纤维素转化的背景下，这些催化剂有助于生产有价值的化学品，如乙二醇（EG）和糖醇。双金属Ni-W2C催化剂表现出协同效应，与单金属催化剂相比，显著提高了EG的产率。这种协同效应在特定的镍负载量和制备温度下得到了优化。

该研究采用的方法包括催化剂制备、表征和在纤维素转化反应中的性能评估。催化剂通过碳热氢还原（CHR）方法制备，其性能根据纤维素转化率和产品产率进行评估。研究了金属负载量、制备温度和反应条件等各种参数的影响，以优化催化过程。

通过仔细调整催化剂组成和制备条件，提高了催化剂的效率和选择性。例如，在碳化钨中添加少量镍显著提高了EG的产率，这表明双金属系统可以针对特定反应进行优化。

这项研究对生物质转化的广泛领域做出了贡献，为如何设计和优化催化系统以高效地从可再生资源生产有价值的化学品提供了见解。
