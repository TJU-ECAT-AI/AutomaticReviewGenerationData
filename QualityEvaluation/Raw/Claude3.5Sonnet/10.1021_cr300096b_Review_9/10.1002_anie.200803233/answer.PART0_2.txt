[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "One outstanding feature of the W2C/AC catalysts in the catalytic conversion of cellulose is the surprisingly high selectivity for EG formation. The yield of EG obtained over the W2C/AC catalyst is almost twice as large as that obtained over Pt/Al2O3 (Table1, entry17)."

[3] "To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The idea is based on two considerations: 1)nickel is a well-known active catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol; and 2)nickel could promote the formation of tungsten carbides as indicated in Figure1, which suggests the possibility of synergy by combining nickel and W2C in catalytic reactions."

[4] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

The literature primarily focuses on the catalytic conversion of cellulose into polyols, particularly ethylene glycol (EG), using tungsten carbide catalysts promoted with nickel. While it doesn't directly address the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni systems, it does provide insights into bimetallic catalysis for biomass conversion.

The study demonstrates that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC) catalysts can effectively convert cellulose into polyols. When promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially EG and sorbitol, significantly increases. This nickel-tungsten carbide system shows a synergistic effect, maximized at 2 wt% nickel loading and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction temperature of 973K.

The W2C/AC catalysts exhibit high selectivity for EG formation, outperforming traditional precious metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3. The addition of nickel to the tungsten carbide catalyst is based on nickel's known activity for glucose hydrogenation to sorbitol and its ability to promote tungsten carbide formation.

While this study doesn't cover all aspects of the question, it demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can be employed to enhance selectivity and efficiency in cellulosic biomass conversion. The research combines theoretical considerations (such as the known properties of nickel and tungsten carbide) with experimental optimization of catalyst composition and preparation conditions to achieve improved yields of desired products.

This work represents an important step in developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for biomass conversion, potentially replacing precious metal catalysts with less expensive alternatives while maintaining or improving catalytic performance.

这篇文献主要关注使用镍促进的碳化钨催化剂将纤维素转化为多元醇，特别是乙二醇（EG）。虽然它没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni系统催化氢化C=O键，但它确实为生物质转化的双金属催化提供了见解。

研究表明，碳载碳化钨（W2C/AC）催化剂可以有效地将纤维素转化为多元醇。当添加少量镍进行促进时，多元醇的产率，尤其是EG和山梨醇，显著增加。这种镍-碳化钨系统表现出协同效应，在镍负载量为2 wt%和碳热氢还原温度为973K时达到最佳效果。

W2C/AC催化剂对EG的形成表现出高选择性，性能优于传统的贵金属催化剂如Pt/Al2O3。向碳化钨催化剂中添加镍的想法基于镍对葡萄糖加氢生成山梨醇的已知活性，以及其促进碳化钨形成的能力。

虽然这项研究并未涵盖问题的所有方面，但它展示了如何利用双金属催化剂来提高纤维素生物质转化的选择性和效率。该研究结合了理论考虑（如镍和碳化钨的已知特性）和实验优化（催化剂组成和制备条件），以获得更高的目标产物产率。

这项工作代表了开发更高效、更具成本效益的生物质转化催化剂的重要一步，有可能用更便宜的替代品取代贵金属催化剂，同时保持或提高催化性能。
