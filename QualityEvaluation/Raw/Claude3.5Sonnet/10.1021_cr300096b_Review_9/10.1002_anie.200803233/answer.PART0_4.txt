[1] "Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB). More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."

[2] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1). The presence of even a very small amount of nickel (0.5wt%) in W2C/AC resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of EG from 27.4 to 39.4% (Table1, entry8)."

[3] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

The literature does not directly address catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. However, it does discuss the use of nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts for cellulose conversion, which is relevant to cellulosic biomass conversion.

The study reports that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols. When promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, significantly increases. This demonstrates a synergistic effect between nickel and W2C in cellulose degradation reactions.

The research methodology involved preparing catalysts with varying nickel content and testing their performance in cellulose conversion reactions. The researchers optimized the catalyst composition and preparation conditions, finding that the synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction temperature of 973K.

This work contributes to the field of biomass conversion by demonstrating an effective, non-precious metal catalyst system for converting cellulose into valuable chemicals like ethylene glycol. The approach of using bimetallic systems (in this case, Ni-W2C) to enhance catalytic performance and selectivity is a common strategy in catalysis research and could be applied to other reactions and catalyst systems.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论使用Pt-Ni双金属催化剂对C=O键进行催化氢化。然而，它确实讨论了使用镍促进的碳化钨催化剂进行纤维素转化，这与纤维素生物质转化相关。

研究报告称，碳载碳化钨（W2C/AC）可以有效地催化纤维素转化为多元醇。当添加少量镍进行促进时，多元醇的产率，特别是乙二醇（EG）和山梨醇，显著增加。这表明在纤维素降解反应中，镍和W2C之间存在协同效应。

研究方法包括制备不同镍含量的催化剂，并测试它们在纤维素转化反应中的性能。研究人员优化了催化剂组成和制备条件，发现当镍的名义载量为2 wt%，碳热氢还原温度为973K时，协同效应达到最大。

这项工作通过展示一种有效的非贵金属催化剂系统，用于将纤维素转化为乙二醇等有价值的化学品，为生物质转化领域做出了贡献。使用双金属系统（在这种情况下是Ni-W2C）来提高催化性能和选择性的方法是催化研究中的常用策略，可以应用于其他反应和催化剂系统。
