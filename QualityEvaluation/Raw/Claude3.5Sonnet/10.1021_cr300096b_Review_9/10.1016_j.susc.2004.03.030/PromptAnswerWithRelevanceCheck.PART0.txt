Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds or Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. The text focuses on the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. It does not discuss C=O hydrogenation, Pt-Ni systems, fine chemical synthesis, or cellulosic biomass conversion. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的科学文献不包含任何关于C=O键催化氢化或Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的信息。该文本主要讨论了NO2在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和反应。它没有涉及C=O氢化、Pt-Ni系统、精细化学品合成或纤维素生物质转化。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
