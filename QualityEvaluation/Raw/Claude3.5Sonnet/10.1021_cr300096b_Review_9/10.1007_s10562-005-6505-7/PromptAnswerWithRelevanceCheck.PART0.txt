<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds or Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. The text focuses on a different catalytic system (Pt-Re supported on Ce0.52Zr0.48O2) used for carbon dioxide reforming of methane. It does not discuss applications in fine chemical synthesis or cellulosic biomass conversion, nor does it mention methodologies for studying or optimizing C=O bond hydrogenation. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

There is no mention of C=O bond hydrogenation, Pt-Ni systems, fine chemical synthesis, or cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies described (diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction) are used to study metal segregation during the methane reforming reaction, not for optimizing C=O hydrogenation. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
