Vapor-phase acetic acid hydrogenation was studied over a family
of supported PtFe catalysts. These catalysts were characterized by
M
ossbauer spectroscopy, successive H2O2H2O2 titration cycles
at 300 K, and DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy) to
determine the Fe phases present during the titration reactions as

the bimetallic PtFe/SiO2 catalysts varied from 0.04 to 0.64, the es-
timated surface composition in the bimetallic particles ranged from
0.39 to 0.70. The addition of small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 cata-
lysts (i) increased Fe reducibility during the reduction pretreatment,
(ii) enhanced activity more than 10-fold and turnover frequencies
10- to 100-fold, (iii) eliminated the induction period, (iv) lowered
the apparent activation energy by 810 kcal/mol, and (v) still main-
tained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde of over 70%. The addition
of Pt to an Fe/C catalyst prevented the severe deactivation that has
been associated with iron carbide formation. Under reaction con-
ditions, the best bimetallic catalyst contained both Fe0 and Fe2+
phases, which is a combination that seems to be required for stable
selective acetaldehyde formation. A model consistent with our pre-
vious studies of Pt and Fe catalysts, which invokes one type of active
site on a reduced metal surface and another type on a metal oxide
phase, successfully describes this reaction on a bimetallic catalyst. It
is proposed that the reaction sequence involves a rate-determining
step between a hydrogen atom from the metallic site and an acyl
species on the FeO surface.

INTRODUCTION
Recent studies in our laboratory have provided strong
evidence that the catalytic chemistry associated with acetic
acid reduction by H2 over Pt or Fe is governed by the
presence of both metal and metal oxide phases present
under reaction conditions (1, 2). The kinetics of this reac-
tion on Pt/TiO2 and Fe/SiO2 were consistent with a mech-
anism requiring sites on the zero-valent metal to activate
H2 and different sites on an oxide phase to activate acetic
acid; regardless, different catalytic behavior was observed
between these Pt and Fe catalysts. For example, titania-

supported Pt was a very active reduction catalyst which
yielded mainly ethanol, ethane, and ethyl acetate, whereas
silica-supported Fe was highly selective for acetaldehyde
formation although much higher temperatures were re-
quired for significant activity to be achieved. In an effort
to develop more active yet highly selective catalysts for
the reduction of carboxylic acids to aldehydes, bimetallic
PtFe systems were investigated to determine if the most
favorable characteristics exhibited by each metal could be
combined in a single catalyst.
Bimetallic PtFe catalysts have been used in various ap-
plications such as CO hydrogenation (35), catalytic com-
bustion in automotive catalysts (6), and cathodic oxygen
reduction in fuel cells (7, 8). In most cases, iron was added
to a Pt catalyst to enhance activity and control selectivity, as
demonstrated by the increase in oxygenate selectivity dur-
ing CO hydrogenation over a PtFe catalyst as compared to
Pt alone (5). In the case of cathodic oxygen reduction, Pt
Fe catalysts generally show a greater activity, although the
precise reason for the enhancement is still being debated
because of uncertainty associated with the specific activity
measurements (7). In automotive exhaust catalysts, Fe was
added to a Pt catalyst to improve its thermal stability be-
cause the presence of Fe appeared to prevent Pt sintering
(6, 9).
In the present study, catalysts were impregnated with
both Pt and Fe to increase activity and improve selectivity
to acetaldehyde during acetic acid hydrogenation by utiliz-
ing the favorable properties of each metal. In accordance
with the apparent dual site nature of the proposed catalytic
cycle, metallic Pt and Fe atoms were expected to provide
sites for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation while iron
oxide phases would provide sites to adsorb and activate
acetic acid in a manner to maximize acetaldehyde forma-
tion. These two types of sites are presumed to be in contact
for the reaction to occur unless one active surface species,
such as spilled-over H atoms, is capable of migrating signifi-
cant distances. Characterizing the surface of bimetallic sys-
tems has always been a challenge, not only because surface
and bulk stoichiometries can frequently differ following a
given reduction pretreatment (3), but also because bimetal-
lic clusters of different size and composition can exist; thus,
an accurate interpretation of their catalytic behavior is

often difficult to attain. Bartholomew and Boudart utilized
an approach consisting of O2H2O2 titration cycles cou-
pled with M
ossbauer spectroscopy to estimate the surface
composition of PtFe catalysts (10); however, this method
is limited to highly dispersed catalysts because as the metal
particle size increases, the surface/volume ratio decreases
and the contribution from the surface iron atoms to the
M
ossbauer spectrum cannot be determined accurately. In
the present study, a slightly different version of this cyclic
titration technique was developed in an effort to charac-
terize the surfaces that exist in bimetallic PtFe crystallites,
and this technique was particularly useful in characteriz-
ing large, reduced PtFe particles which were commonly
obtained with the Fe/SiO2 systems. To increase activity for
selective acetic acid hydrogenation and to improve our un-
derstanding of the mechanistic details of this reaction, a
family of SiO2-supported Fe, Pt, and PtFe catalysts was
investigated. A kinetic model proposed previously (11) was
successfully applied to describe the kinetics of acetic acid
reduction with H2.
EXPERIMENTAL
SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts were prepared via a se-
quential impregnation approach. The silica gel support
(Davison, Grade 57, 70120 mesh) was calcined at 773 K
for 2 h under 100 cm3 (STP)/min of air (MG Ind., 99.5%) to
remove any organic contaminants before metal impregna-
tion. Platinum was deposited onto the silica via an ion ex-
change method using Pt(NH3)4(OH)2 (Aldrich, 99.995%)
as the metal precursor (12), and the dispersion of this
base 0.7% Pt/SiO2 was 0.83, based on total H2 adsorp-
tion, or 0.49, based on the irreversible hydrogen uptake (see
Table 1). After drying in an oven overnight at 393 K in air,
Fe was deposited via an incipient wetness technique using
Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O (Aldrich, 99.995%) dissolved in distilled,
deionized (DD) water (2.2 cm3/g SiO2), and the catalyst was
again dried overnight at 393 K in air. A carbon-supported
PtFe catalyst was also prepared by sequentially impreg-
nating carbon black with a solution of Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O
(3.4 cm3/g carbon), drying, then reimpregnating with a so-
lution of H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (Aldrich, 99.995%). The carbon
support (Black Pearls 2000, Cabot Corp.) was desulfurized
for 12 h at 1223 K under 200 cm3 (STP)/min H2 (99.999%,
MG Ind.) prior to impregnation. The exact metal loadings,
expressed in weight percent, were determined by atomic
absorption spectroscopy, and they are listed in Table 1. For
simplicity, the catalysts are identified by the nomenclature
aPtbFe/SiO2 (or/carbon) where a is the nominal weight
percent Pt and b is the nominal weight percent Fe.
Catalyst pretreatment involved reduction in flowing H2
for 1 h at 723 K after heating at 3 K/min to this temperature
and was carried out in situ to prevent exposure of the cata-
lyst to air before its use in any experiment. Chemisorption
experiments were carried out in a stainless steel adsorption
system with a base pressure of 1 × 106 Torr in the sample
cell (13). The kinetic behavior of vapor-phase acetic acid
reduction by H2 was studied using a glass microreactor op-
erated under differential conversions at atmospheric pres-
sure, as already described elsewhere (1). M
ossbauer spec-
troscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were also used to further characte-
rize the iron phases and the surface species; details regardi-
ng the experimental setup have been given elsewhere (14).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
H2O2H2O2 Titration Cycles
A method involving successive H2O2H2O2 titration
cycles was developed to help characterize these supported
bimetallic PtFe particles. The titration procedure, in
principle, is similar to a previous procedure utilized by
ACETIC ACID REDUCTION BY H2 ON BIMETALLIC PtFe CATALYSTS
89
Bartholomew and Boudart (10), but the sequence of the
H2 and O2 titrations applied here was modified according
to the following description. First, hydrogen was adsorbed
on a clean catalyst surface obtained by a high-temperature
evacuation at 673 K for 1 h following the reduction pre-
treatment at 723 K. Second, the catalyst was exposed to
O2, which first titrated the irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen
and then chemisorbed on the catalyst surface. Third, af-
ter evacuation, this catalyst surface was titrated with H2
to produce H2O and re-adsorb H atoms. Finally, this lat-
ter catalyst surface was retitrated with O2. The H2 and
O2 adsorption isotherms during these titration cycles were
recorded at room temperature, with a 30-min evacuation
period between the uptake measurements, and Table 1 lists
the H2 and O2 uptakes during these successive H2O2H2
O2 titrations on a series of SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts
and one carbon-supported PtFe catalyst.
The chemisorption behavior of H2 and O2 on individ-
ual metallic Pt and Fe surfaces is largely understood. Both
hydrogen and oxygen chemisorb atomically on a clean
Pt surface, and one adsorbate can be completely titrated
with the other at 300 K; consequently, the H2 titration of
chemisorbed oxygen on dispersed Pt has been frequently
used to calculate the number of reduced Pt atoms (15, 16).
Fe metal, on the other hand, does not exhibit the same H2
O2 titration behavior because H2 chemisorption is typically
negligible on reduced Fe surfaces at 300 K, at least on small
dispersed Fe particles, whereas O2 chemisorption can re-
sult in multilayer oxidation of Fe to subsurface levels that
cannot be titrated by hydrogen at 300 K. However, it has
been shown by Bartholomew and Boudart (10) as well as
Garten (17) that oxidized Fe can be partially reduced by
H2 at 300 K when this Fe oxide phase exists in bimetallic
particles, i.e., in direct contact with a noble metal such as Pt
or Pd. Consequently, the reducibility of Fe oxide at 300 K
is unique in that it is possible only when a noble metal ca-
pable of providing atomic hydrogen is in intimate contact
with the iron phase.
Figure 1 displays M
ossbauer spectra of the 0.7Pt5Fe/
SiO2 catalyst obtained at 300 K following each adsorption
step in the H2O2H2O2 titration sequence. Spectrum
Fig. 1a was recorded after the catalyst was reduced at 723 K
and had chemisorbed hydrogen on its surface, and it shows
that iron in the catalyst exists only as zero-valent Fe (α-
Fe), as identified by the characteristic sextuplet of peaks
for bulk metallic α-Fe. After titration with O2, a part of the
zero-valent iron was oxidized to Fe3+, as shown by the ap-
pearance of a doublet in Fig. 1b having an isomer shift (IS)
of 0.34 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting (QS) of 1.09 mm/s.
A subsequent H2 titration of this catalyst produced an ad-
ditional doublet, having an IS of 0.99 mm/s and a QS of
1.83 mm/s, as indicated in Fig. 1c, which can be attributed
to an Fe2+ phase. Finally, the last step in this sequence, i.e.,
O2 titration, reoxidized the catalyst and left α-Fe and Fe3+
as the only iron phases detected in the catalyst, as shown
FIG. 1.

by Fig. 1d, which is essentially the same as Fig. 1b. Based
on these M
ossbauer spectra, it can be seen that all the iron
is completely reduced after the initial pretreatment in the
presence of Pt, but following the first O2 titration reaction,
some of this iron is oxidized to Fe3+(Fe2O3), a portion of
which can be reduced to Fe2+ by H2 at 300 K. The complete
initial reduction of iron to Fe0 and the partial reduction of
Fe2O3 to FeO at 300 K is strong evidence that there was di-
rect contact between Fe and Pt in bimetallic PtFe particles
dispersed on the support (3, 10, 17). The term bimetallic
is used here to refer to any structure that provides direct
physical contact between Pt and Fe atoms.
More than a monolayer of chemisorbed oxygen was
formed on the Fe surface during the first O2 titration, and
subsurface oxide layers were created. It has been reported
that five to seven atomic layers of an iron oxide film can be
formed as a result of oxidation by O2 at room temperature
(1822), and this oxide layer cannot be reduced by hydro-
gen at room temperature unless it is in direct contact with
Pt (3, 10). Thus the amount of Fe that is in direct contact
with Pt, i.e., the Fe present in bimetallic crystallites, can be
quantified by determining the amount of iron oxide that is
reduced during hydrogen titration, but some assumptions
must be made to accomplish this. The first one in the devel-
opment of a model to describe the H2O2H2O2 titration
sequence is that the reduction of Fe2O3 to FeO is strictly a

surface phenomenon; consequently, although up to seven
atomiclayersofironmayhavebeenoxidizedduringthefirst
O2 titration, only the top surface layer of any Fe2O3 in con-
tact with Pt is assumed to be reducible by H2 titration. The
M
ossbauer spectrum obtained following this H2 titration
(spectrum c in Fig. 1) shows that Fe3+(Fe2O3) was reduced
to Fe2+(FeO), but further reduction to zero-valent Fe did
not occur, in agreement with earlier studies using magnetic
susceptibility measurements (23). The second assumption is
that hydrogen does not irreversibly adsorb on oxidized iron
surfaces. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that
the ratio of irreversible (irr) uptakes of H2 and O2 measured
for the last two cycles in the H2O2H2O2 titration se-
quence remained constant as the Fe loading increased, i.e.,
there was no increase in the hydrogen uptake, relative to the
subsequent O2 uptake, despite an increase in the amount of
iron oxide in the catalysts. Furthermore, no irreversible H2
uptake was measured at 300 K on oxidized iron (2), and ex-
posure of an oxidized Fe/Al2O3 catalyst to H2 at 300 K pro-
duced no change in the M
ossbauer spectrum (3). The third
assumption, based on the earlier discussion, is that minimal
or no H2 chemisorption occurs on small dispersed zero-
valent Fe particles at 300 K. These last two assumptions are
also supported by the results in Table 1 for 3% Fe/SiO2 as
well as by results reported recently for other Fe/SiO2 cata-
lysts (2), because H2 adsorption at 300 K should be similar
to or lower than that at 373 K, as verified elsewhere (2).
The mechanistic details of the successive H2O2H2O2
titrations in these bimetallic systems, therefore, can be de-
picted by the following scheme (following the initial pre-
treatment).

Independent measurements of H2 and O2 chemisorption
on the 0.7Pt/SiO2 catalyst prior to the addition of Fe showed
that the ratio of irreversible oxygen and hydrogen adsorp-
tion on Pt, i.e., the Oad/Had ratio, is not unity but rather
3/4, as shown in Table 2; thus this stoichiometry was used
in Eqs. [2] and [4]. This ratio of less than unity is not uncom-
mon, particularly for highly dispersed Pt catalysts, and it is
due to a change in the stoichiometry of oxygen chemisorp-
tion on Pt(Oad/Pts), which can vary from 1/2 on very small
crystallites to near unity on large particles (2426). Because
all of the SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts underwent the
same pretreatment as 0.7Pt/SiO2, it is assumed that this ra-
tio of Oad/Pts = 3/4 is the same for all of the catalysts and
thus it is incorporated into the model. Although the cover-
age of irreversibly adsorbed H on very small Pt crystallites
may be somewhat less than unity, a Had/Pt ratio of 1 is a
good approximation and is used here for simplicity because
Had/Pt ratios based on the total H2 uptakes can be signifi-
cantly greater than unity (24, 2628). The important aspect
is not that the Had/Pt ratio be precisely 1 but that this ratio
remain constant.
The x, y, and f parameters can be calculated from the
H2 and O2 uptakes measured during the titration cycles, as
ACETIC ACID REDUCTION BY H2 ON BIMETALLIC PtFe CATALYSTS

depicted by Eqs. [5][7]. The number of surface Pt atoms is
calculated using the irreversible H2 uptake obtained during
the first hydrogen adsorption in Step 1 and assuming an ad-
sorption stoichiometry of unity, i.e., 2Pts + H2 2PtsH.
This gives a minimum estimate of Pts because some weakly
chemisorbed hydrogen can be desorbed during the 30-min
evacuation between the two uptake measurements, and a
full H monolayer may not exist (28, 29). Regardless of how
the number of surface Pt atoms is determined, it is more
important to know the ratio of irreversible oxygen and hy-
drogen chemisorption, which was experimentally found to
be Oad/Had = 3/4. Calculation of the overall Fe dispersion
is not attempted here because the oxygen uptake by any
monometallic Fe particles involves Fe oxidation up to sev-
eral monolayers beneath the surface during the O2 titration
step. However, the total number of surface Fe atoms, Fes,
will not be an appropriate parameter in determining the
specific activity of these bimetallic PtFe catalysts anyway
because at lower temperatures monometallic Fe particles
are essentially inactive; thus, the major contribution from
Fe to the activity comes only from the surface Fe atoms in
the bimetallic crystallites, referred to as Fes,bi, which can be
calculated from the amount of FeO formed during the H2
titration reaction depicted by Eq. [3] using the following
relationship:
Fes,bi(mol/gcat) = f · y.
[8]
To provide an example of these calculations, let us ex-
amine 0.7Pt0.2Fe/SiO2, for which 8.3 mol/gcat H2 irre-
versibly adsorbs on the catalyst during the first adsorption
step. Based on this measurement, x, which is the mini-
mum number of surface Pt atoms in the catalyst, is then
16.6 mol Pts/gcat. During the first O2 titration in Step 2,
the O2 uptake is 23.5 mol/gcat, of which 4.2 mol O2/gcat
is consumed to titrate the irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen
on Pt, 6.2 mol O2/gcat is chemisorbed on the Pt, and the
remaining 13.1 mol O2/gcat is consumed in the oxidation

of Fe to Fe2O3, i.e., 2Fe + 3/2O2 Fe2O3; thus, the amount
of Fe oxidized in this step (y) is 17.5 mol/gcat. The last pa-
rameter to be calculated is f , the fraction of Fe2O3 that can
be reduced during the H2 titration reaction. Given that the
irreversible H2 uptake measured for 0.7Pt0.2Fe/SiO2 in
Step 3 is 28.0 mol H2/gcat and is equal to 1/2(5/2x + f y), f
is then 0.83; therefore, the concentration of surface bimetal-
lic Fe atoms in 0.7Pt0.2Fe/SiO2, determined from Eq. [5],
is 0.83(17.5) = 14.5 mol Fes,bi/gcat. A complete listing of
the values calculated for the other catalysts is given in
Table 3.
Reasonable values were obtained for the fraction of fer-
ric oxide reducible to FeO, denoted as f (FeO) in Table 3,
except for 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2. Clearly this f value of 2.4
for 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2 is meaningless because it cannot be
greater than 1, and it indicates that the titration model de-
veloped above does not adequately describe the titration
behavior of this catalyst. Aside from the fact that 0.7Pt
0.1Fe/SiO2 was the only catalyst having more Pt than Fe,
with a Pt/Fe ratio of 1.8, this catalyst also exhibited a H2
uptake that was much higher than that needed to convert
all the Fe2O3 into FeO, as depicted in Step 3. Two possible
explanations can be proposed to account for this unexpect-
edly high H2 uptake. First, there may have been a possible
increase in H2 uptake following the first O2 titration step
(Step 2) because the addition and oxidation of iron may
have increased the dispersion of Pt. However, a second ex-
planation is preferred; that is, ferric oxide may be reduced
beyond FeO to a substoichiometric iron oxide (FeO1x) or
even to zero-valent atoms during this H2 titration. This ex-
tent of iron reducibility is possible and has been observed,
particularly with PtFe alloys containing a low Fe content.
A M
ossbauer study of a series of carbon-supported PtFe
catalysts showed that the appearance of the Fe2+ doublet
in the spectrum following hydrogen titration became less
pronounced as the iron content of the alloy was decreased
(10), and a similar study of PtFe/SiO2 catalysts showed that
Fe3+ in the samples having Pt/Fe ratios >1 was essentially
reduced to zero-valent iron by H2 titration (30). As pointed

out by Garten in a study of PdFe catalysts, oxidized iron
atoms with only Pd nearest neighbors, a situation obtained
at high Pd/Fe ratios, can be completely reduced at 298 K
(17). Therefore, iron atoms in the 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2 cata-
lyst that have only Pt nearest neighbors may be reduced to
the zero-valent state, which would result in the f value for
this catalyst being grossly overestimated.
To consider the possibility that there are iron atoms in the
catalysts having only Pt nearest neighbors, even when the
overall Pt/Fe ratio is less than one, it is necessary to calculate
another set of f values based on the assumption that ferric
oxide in PtFe clusters is reducible to the zero-valent state,
and these are denoted as f (Fe) in Table 3. These values then
give the minimum number of Fes,bi atoms in the bimetallic
clusters, and the titration in Step 3 is modified to

[9]
Therefore, as reported in Table 3, upper and lower limits
for the number of surface Fe atoms in the PtFe clusters
can be established by assuming that the corresponding Fe3+
atoms are reduced to either the ferrous or the zero-valent
state, respectively. These calculations indicate that only a
small fraction of Fe exists in bimetallic crystallites with Pt,
except at low loadings of Fe. Increasing the Fe loading also
decreases the concentration of surface Pt(Pts), which can
be attributed to the coverage of Pt crystallites by Fe as the
Pt/Fe ratio decreases.
Carbon as a support appears to significantly affect the
behavior of the PtFe particles regarding the H2O2H2
O2 titration sequence, as exhibited by the 0.6Pt5Fe/carbon
sample. The amount of reducible Fe estimated from this
titration sequence was significantly higher than that in a
SiO2-supported PtFe catalyst with similar metal loadings,
which would suggest that there is a large fraction of Fe
atoms in intimate contact with Pt in this PtFe/carbon cata-
lyst. In addition, the O2 uptake in Step 4 of the titration
sequence was higher than that needed to titrate the ad-
sorbed hydrogen, chemisorb on Pts, and reoxidize the Fe
surface. Further oxidation of Fe during Step 4 was unlikely
because the catalyst should have been passivated during
the first O2 exposure in Step 2. One possible explanation
for this increase in O2 uptake is oxygen chemisorption on
the carbon surface, which may be facilitated by the pres-
ence of water formed during titrations in the same manner
as H2 spillover can be assisted by water (3133). This water
can accumulate in the micropores and the metalsupport
interfacial region. Thus, it is conceivable that the number
of surface Fe atoms in these carbon-supported PtFe par-
ticles was overestimated because the likelihood of hydro-
gen spillover during the H2 titration reaction in Step 3 is
greater in this catalyst. Even in the absence of water, hy-

drogen spillover occurs more significantly on carbon than
SiO2 (3235). The reason for the increase of O2 uptake in
Step 4, however, is still unknown because the influence of
wateronoxygenspilloverhasnotbeenstudied.Insummary,
the titration model developed here does not readily explain
the H2O2H2O2 titration behavior of carbon-supported
PtFe bimetallic particles.
Catalytic Behavior
The effect of Pt addition to Fe catalysts can be readily
seen by comparing the activity maintenance profiles for
monometallic Fe and bimetallic PtFe particles supported
on either SiO2 or carbon, as shown in Fig. 2. Under these
reaction conditions, Pt alone exhibited no catalytic activity
for acetic acid reduction to acetaldehyde and/or ethanol,
and only decomposition to CH4, CO, CO2, and H2O via de-
carbonylation and decarboxylation pathways was observed
(1). Dramatic changes were observed in the activity profiles
for both SiO2-supported and carbon-supported Fe catalysts
due to the addition of Pt. Before steady-state activity is
achieved, an induction period of 4 to 5 h is typically ob-
served for monometallic Fe catalysts (2), but it no longer
occurs with these PtFe catalysts. Instead, the activity of
a bimetallic catalyst begins with a higher value before it
declines somewhat to approach a steady-state activity. This
behaviorismarkedlysimilartothatofaPt/TiO2 catalyst(1).
The PtFe/C catalyst showed even greater contrasting
behavior compared to its monometallic counterpart; i.e.,
severe deactivation, which was a major problem with Fe/C
catalysts, did not occur after the addition of Pt. This de-
activation has been attributed to the formation of an iron
carbide (θ-Fe3C) under reaction conditions, which inhibits
sites important for the reaction and renders the surface of
iron inactive (14). The presence of this carbide in a Fe/C

catalyst was previously detected by M
ossbauer spec-
troscopy; however, the M
ossbauer spectrum of 0.6Pt
5Fe/carbon obtained after being on stream for 8 h at 553 K
failed to show the presence of the aforementioned carbide
phase. In addition, the absence of carbide formation in the
catalyst was coupled with an usually high concentration of
CH4 in the product stream. Based on these observations,
Pt may have prevented the formation of iron carbide by
maintaining a constant source of surface hydrogen atoms
to hydrogenate any carbon atoms deposited on the iron
surface.
Another indicator that bimetallic PtFe systems can be
excellent catalysts for acetic acid reduction by H2 is re-
flectedintheirhighselectivityforacetaldehyde,particularly
atlowPt/Feratios.AsshowninFig.3,whichcomparesprod-
uct selectivities among the SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts
obtained near 10% conversion, the selectivity was strongly
dependent on the relative amounts of Pt and Fe (Pt/Fe
atomic ratios). Acetaldehyde was favored at very low Pt/Fe
ratios and, as the amount of Pt increased, more ethanol was
formed; then, at high Pt/Fe ratios a steady increase occurred
intheformationofdecompositionproductsCH4,CO,and
CO2. Ethanol formation began to decrease around Pt/Fe =
0.5, and eventually the product composition was dominated
by CH4, CO, and CO2 at higher ratios. Except for a small
amount of ethyl acetate (<3%), no other products were de-
tected at this level of conversion (note that selectivity was
calculated based only on the carbon-containing products).
Product selectivity was also influenced by acetic acid and
hydrogen partial pressures, PHOAc and PH2, respectively.
Figure 4 shows that PHOAc and PH2 have opposite effects

on the product selectivity over 0.7Pt5Fe/SiO2, which is
represented as the mole ratio of acetaldehyde to etha-
nol, SALD/SALC, obtained at conversions below 10%.
An increase in the acetic acid partial pressure increased
SALD/SALC, whereas an increase in the hydrogen partial
pressure decreased this ratio. Furthermore, these effects
became more pronounced as the temperature increased,
and it appears that selectivity to acetaldehyde, relative to
ethanol, is enhanced at higher reaction temperatures.
One parameter that represents intrinsic kinetic behav-
ior related to the combination of Pt and Fe is the apparent
activation energy, Ea, that was measured for acetic acid re-
duction under standard reaction conditions. These values
for PtFe catalysts are consistently lower than that for a
monometallic Fe catalyst, as shown in Table 4, with values

approaching those for Pt/TiO2 catalysts, thus indicating that
the addition of Pt may indeed alter the intrinsic kinetics of
acetic acid hydrogenation over Fe catalysts. In addition, it
was also observed that the minimum temperature at which
the reaction can be detected is significantly lower for a Pt
Fe catalyst than that for an Fe-only catalyst; for example,
3Fe/SiO2 showed negligible activity below 473 K whereas
all the PtFe catalysts were active below 423 K. This signifi-
cant enhancement in activity can undoubtedly be attributed
to the addition of Pt, which is expected to actively engage
in the catalytic cycle by providing sites for dissociatively ad-
sorbing hydrogen. Again, this minimum temperature is also
strikingly similar to that typically observed for a Pt/TiO2
catalyst (1).
The fact that a PtFe catalyst has a much higher ac-
tivity for acetic acid reduction by H2 than a monometal-
lic Fe catalyst with a higher Fe loading indicates that the
addition of Pt increases activity; however, before activ-
ity enhancement truly can be verified, comparison among
these different catalyst systems must be made in terms of
their specific activities. Thus, the rate data must be nor-
malized to an appropriate basis in order to properly com-
pare the activity performance of these monometallic Fe and
bimetallic PtFe catalysts. Previously, the reduction activ-
ity of monometallic Pt and Fe catalysts was normalized to
the number of surface metal atoms determined by selec-
tive chemisorption to obtain a turnover frequency (TOF,
molecule/s/Ms). The bimetallic catalyst systems, however,
consist of surface Pt and Fe atoms that can exist in bimetallic
as well as monometallic clusters dispersed on the supports,
and this complexity presents some uncertainty in reporting
their specific activity. The hypothesis that acetic acid reduc-
tion requires two types of sitesone set comprised of Pt
(or Fe0) atoms and the other set existing on the Fe oxide
surfacefurther complicates a quantitative evaluation of
this bimetallic system. Regardless, estimates can be made.
The total number of surface Pt atoms, Pts, and the num-
ber of surface Fe atoms that are in bimetallic crystallites,
Fes,bi, can be estimated using the H2O2H2O2 titration
method described earlier; however, the number of surface
Fe atoms that are not in bimetallic crystallites, which in-
creases as Pt/Fe ratios become 1, cannot be precisely de-
termined. Nonetheless, as pointed out earlier, it is known
that the specific activity associated with these monometal-
lic Fe particles is very low (2); thus, little or no contribu-
tion to catalytic performance occurs at the lower temper-
atures used here and the measured activity is attributed
only to the bimetallic clusters. The question then becomes
how to normalize the activity with respect to Pts and Fes,bi.

H2 on 3Fe/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, the series of PtFe/SiO2 catalysts,
and 0.7Pt/TiO2. In this figure, the activity for 3Fe/SiO2 is

0.7Pt/TiO2 is normalized to Pts atoms, as determined by H2
chemisorption, whereas activities for the PtFe/SiO2 cata-
lysts are represented by TOFs based on Pts, on the surface
bimetallic Fe atoms (Fes,bi), or on the sum of Pts and Fes,bi.
In the last calculation, the median value of Fes,bi is used. The
TOF calculated based on Fes,bi is represented as a range of
values (shown by vertical bars) because the number of sur-
face Fe atoms in the bimetallic clusters was estimated using
both the upper and the lower limits determined in Table 3.
Regardless of the choice, an enhancement in TOF relative
only to Fe is clearly seen with all of the PtFe/SiO2 catalysts
except 0.7Pt0.1Fe/SiO2, and all TOF values for reduction
are higher than that on Pt/SiO2, which exhibited primarily
decomposition activity (1, 11). Catalysts with low Pt/Fe ra-
tios, i.e., 0.7Pt1.0Fe/SiO2 and 0.7Pt5Fe/SiO2, show a TOF
that is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that on
monometallic Fe/SiO2 and is even higher than that on TiO2-
supported Pt, which is a very active catalyst for acetic acid
reduction with H2.
Reaction Mechanism
The kinetic behavior of these PtFe systems has many
similarities to that of TiO2-supported Pt, as evidenced by
a comparison of specific activities, apparent activation en-
ergies, and activity maintenance behavior. Acetic acid re-
duction over monometallic Fe/SiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts
has been proposed to proceed via a dual-site mechanism,
but with different principal active surface intermediates on
each catalyst (1, 2, 11). The addition of Pt to Fe catalysts
ACETIC ACID REDUCTION BY H2 ON BIMETALLIC PtFe CATALYSTS

indicates that PtFe crystallites give rise to kinetic behavior
that differs from that usually observed with monometallic
Fe catalysts.
In the general scheme of acetic acid reduction by H2 over
Pt/TiO2 and Fe/SiO2 catalysts, acetaldehyde and ethanol
are formed by sequential reactions, i.e., acetic acid is first
reduced to acetaldehyde, which may or may not desorb,
and is then further hydrogenated to ethanol (1, 2). The in-
fluences of acetic acid and hydrogen partial pressures as
well as temperature on selectivity, as shown in Fig. 4, imply
that the same scheme can be applied to these PtFe cata-
lysts. For example, increasing the acetic acid partial pres-
sure increased acetaldehyde selectivity because the surface
coverage of acetaldehyde decreased due to greater compe-
tition by acetic acid for active sites. Conversely, a higher
hydrogen partial pressure resulted in higher hydrogen sur-
face coverages and thus favors more complete hydrogena-
tion to ethanol. The effect of temperature on selectivity will
depend on the relative heats of adsorption of the various
reactants as well as activation energies for the various reac-
tions. Increasing the Pt/Fe ratio favored ethanol formation,
which is consistent with the proposed reaction mechanism
because an increase in Pts in the catalyst would increase in
the surface concentration of hydrogen atoms.
To further investigate the role of PtFe crystallites in
acetic acid reduction, other than providing sites that facil-
itate H2 dissociation, surface species were examined using
DRIFTS, and Fig. 6 displays spectra of surface species de-
tected following acetic acid adsorption on 0.7Pt5Fe/SiO2,

3Fe/SiO2, and 0.7Pt/SiO2 at 300 K. A new infrared band at
1690 cm1 can be clearly seen on the PtFe catalyst and,
because this band was not detected on either Pt/SiO2 or
Fe/SiO2, this band is assigned to a surface species on sites
existing only on bimetallic PtFe surfaces. The IR bands
at 1748 cm1 and 1725 cm1 are attributed to the carbonyl
stretching mode, ν(C=
=O), of surface silyl ester groups and
hydrogen-bonded molecular acetic acid adsorbed on the
SiO2, respectively, and those at 1581 and 1454 cm1 are as-
signed to the νa(COO) and νs(COO) frequencies of surface
acetate species (36). The latter species can form on either Pt
or Fe surfaces. The new band at 1690 cm1 is similar to an IR
band at 1680 cm1, observed following acetic acid adsorp-
tion on Pt/TiO2, which was assigned to a surface acyl species
(CH3
O
C ),
and it has been proposed that this surface acyl species
is an active intermediate during acetic acid reduction on
this catalyst (11). Although surface acetate may also be
an active intermediate, as proposed for monometallic Fe
catalysts (2, 13), acyl species are more reactive and more
susceptible to hydrogenation at lower temperatures, as
evidenced by TPR experiments (37). The presence of this
species is concurrent with a higher activity and a lower
apparent activation energy, similar to those of a Pt/TiO2
catalyst; consequently, the band at 1690 cm1 is attributed
to the carbonyl stretch mode of an acyl surface species
on the surface of bimetallic PtFe particles. By drawing
another analogy to Pt/TiO2, the sites at which this acyl
species are formed are proposed to exist on an oxidic
Fe surface. The M
ossbauer spectrum of 0.7Pt5Fe/SiO2
obtained after it was subjected to reaction conditions
shows the presence of Fe2+, as shown in Fig. 7, so these acyl
species are presumed to form on FeO phases in the PtFe
particles. The spectral parameters are listed in Table 5.
Although both acyl and acetate species are present on
the catalyst surface and both may be active intermediates
during acetic acid reduction to acetaldehyde, the reduction
pathway involving the former is more direct and has a lower
energy barrier because it requires only the addition of a
hydrogen atom to a very reactive acyl species to form ac-
etaldehyde. Thus, the reaction mechanism on a PtFe/SiO2
catalyst is proposed to be essentially the same as that pro-
posed for Pt/TiO2 catalysts and, to substantiate this pro-
posal, the rate data obtained at various acetic acid and H2
partial pressures were fitted to the same kinetic model used
to describe the reaction over TiO2-supported Pt. This re-
action sequence is a LangmuirHinshelwood-type model
invoking two types of sites, one set on Pt, designated as
sites, where both hydrogen and acetic acid dissociatively
adsorb to produce surface hydrogen atoms and a surface ac-
etate species, and the other set involving FeO, designated
as S sites, on which acetic acid molecularly adsorbs and

and entropies of hydrogen and acetic acid adsorption ob-
tained from the temperature dependence of the equilib-
rium adsorption constants, KH2 and KAc, are reported in
Table 6. The reaction model correlates the experimental
data very satisfactorily, and the enthalpy and entropy of
adsorption for acetic acid and hydrogen on Pt obtained
from the fitted parameters are thermodynamically consis-
tent, with the entropy of adsorption satisfying additional
constraints and guidelines (38, 39). These values are very
similartothoseobtainedforaPt/TiO2 catalyst(seeTable6).
Furthermore, the enthalpy and entropy for dissociative ad-
sorption of acetic acid on the oxide sites to form an acyl
species are similar to values reported earlier for titania.
The results of this kinetic modeling are consistent with the
conclusion that the addition of Pt to an Fe catalyst can alter
the reaction pathway from one involving surface acetate
species to one having acyl surface species as the principal
active intermediate.
SUMMARY
Supported PtFe catalysts were characterized by succes-
sive H2O2H2O2 titration cycles conducted at 300 K as
well as by M
ossbauer spectroscopy and DRIFTS. The for-
mation of bimetallic PtFe crystallites in these catalysts was
verified by the reversible oxidationreduction of iron ob-
served during this titration sequence. A model was pro-
posed which described these titration results and allowed
an estimation of the number of surface Pt and Fe atoms
in the bimetallic particles dispersed on SiO2. The H2O2
H2O2 titration sequence with a carbon-supported PtFe
catalyst was different, however, and it deviated from this
model. This behavior was attributed to hydrogen spillover
coupled with irreversible oxygen adsorption on the carbon
surface.
The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles
increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-
treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction pe-
riod, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet main-
tained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with
catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios. The severe deactivation that
occurred with Fe/carbon catalysts, which has been associ-
ated with the formation of iron carbide, was also prevented
by the addition of Pt.
It is proposed that acetic acid reduction with H2 over
bimetallic PtFe catalysts occurs via a rate-determining sur-
face reaction between a hydrogen atom and surface acyl
species, and the kinetics can be described by a rate expres-
sion derived from a LangmuirHinshelwood-type model
invoking hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid
adsorption and activation on an FeO phase to create the
surface acyl species.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
