Colloidal dispersions of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP)-stabi-
lized rutheniumplatinum and rutheniumpalladium bimetallic col-
loids were prepared by NaBH4 reduction of the corresponding mixed-
metal salts at room temperature and characterized by TEM, XPS,
and XRD. The resulting bimetallic colloids were used as catalysts for
the selective hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) in
methanol at 303 K under 0.1 MPa of hydrogen. It was observed that
the catalytic performance of PVP-stabilized rutheniumplatinum col-
loids (PVPRu/Pt) and rutheniumpalladium colloids (PVPRu/Pd)
was dependent on their compositions and could be remarkably af-
fected by some added metal cations. In the presence of cobalt ion,
nearly 100% selectivity to o-chloroaniline (o-CAN) was achieved over
PVPRu/Pt colloids at 100% conversion of o-CNB, with an activity
two orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic PVPRu
colloid.

1. INTRODUCTION
Much attention has been focused on nanoscale materials due
to their peculiar physical and chemical properties (1). Metal
colloids in the range of 110 nm are very important in aca-
demia and industry (13), especially in the field of catalysis (1,
2, 4). Compared with single-metal colloids, bimetallic colloids
are of special interest for three reasons. First, they may serve as
models for studying the formation of different alloys. Second,
it is possible to save precious metal, such as Pt, by optimizing
the synthetic conditions. Third, they may have great potential
to be tailored with respect to the activity, selectivity, and
stability for their numerous possible combinations.
Some papers have reported the synthesis and characteriza-
tion of bimetallic colloids. Miner et al. (5) described the
synthesis of goldplatinum and palladiumplatinum alloys as
monodispersed sols by simultaneous reduction of the corre-
sponding salt mixtures with sodium citrate. Schmid et al. (6)
made ligand-stabilized goldplatinum and goldpalladium bi-
metallic colloids by covering a gold colloidal core with plati-
num and palladium. Others have studied the catalytic perfor-
mance of bimetallic colloids. Toshima and coworkers (710)
reported the preparation and EXAFS characterization of poly-
mer-stabilized palladiumplatinum and palladiumgold bime-
tallic colloids along with their catalytic properties in the selec-
tive hydrogenation of cis,cis-1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene.
Wang and Liu (11) reported the preparation and immobiliza-
tion of polymer-stabilized rhodiumplatinum and rhodium
gold colloids. TEM and XRD characterization was also carried
out as well as the application in catalysis for the selective
partial hydrogenation of cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene to cy-
clooctene. Liu et al. (12) reported the preparation and XPS
characterization of polymer-stabilized palladiumgold colloids
and the catalytic properties in the selective partial hydrogena-
tion of cis,cis-1,3-cyclooctadiene and the hydrogenolysis of
p-nitrotoluene. In addition to bimetallic colloids composed of
two noble metals, there are some bimetallic colloids consisting
of a light transition metal and a noble metal. Toshima et al. (13,
14) communicated the synthesis and characterization of PVP-
stabilized Pd/Cu and Pd/Ni colloids by using a modified polyol
reduction method. Yu and Liu (15) described the preparation of
PVP-stabilized Pt/Co bimetallic colloid and its catalytic per-
formance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to
cinnamyl alcohol. However, colloids of the platinum group
element ruthenium, especially ruthenium-containing bimetallic
colloids, have scarcely been studied (16).
Aromatic haloamines are important in industry for the pro-
duction of many fine chemicals, such as dyes, herbicides, and
pesticides. Because of the environmental impact associated
with the use of hydrochloric acid in Bechamps reaction,
selective hydrogenation of halonitroaromatics over a metal
catalyst is now preferred. However, the control of the selec-
tivity to aromatic haloamines is critical. Not only the dehalo-
genation to the aromatic amines occurs but also many byprod-
ucts can be formed: nitrobenzene (NB), halophenylhydroxylamine,
halonitrosobenzene, dihaloazobenzene, dihaloazoxybenzene, halo-
benzene, and so on (17). Usually, the desirable selectivity can be

achieved by the addition of some inhibitors (1822) or some
modifiers such as base or other electron-donating compounds
(2327) to the catalyst or to the solution phase. The disadvantages
of these methods are obvious for they not only cause a decrease in
activity but also require extra processing steps to remove the
additives. By alloying a second metal to platinum, Coq et al.
obtained good results in the hydrogenation of p-CNB over PtSn/
Al2O3 catalysts, with 97.5% p-CAN selectivity at .98% conver-
sion (28). Among many metallic catalysts, palladium catalyst is
the most active but it causes more dehalogenation (21). Platinum
is very effective in minimizing dehalogenation combined with a
higher activity; however, it gives a lower purity because of
formation of byproducts (29). Although the selectivity of o-
CAN over ruthenium colloids is very high (.99.9%), the
activity is low, and the reaction could not be accomplished
under hydrogen at atmospheric pressure (29, 30). High activity
and high selectivity are expected to be obtained by the selective
hydrogenation of halonitroaromatics over ruthenium
palladium or rutheniumplatinum bimetallic catalysts.
This paper describes the synthesis of polymer-stabilized
rutheniumplatinum and rutheniumpalladium colloids, the
characterization of the colloids by TEM, XPS, and XRD, their
performance in the selective hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-
CAN, and the effect of metal cations.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials and Instruments
PVP (average MW 40,000) was purchased from BASF.
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was provided by Sigma. Hydro-
gen (H2) with a purity of 99.999% was supplied by Beijing
Gases Factory. Other reagents were of analytical grade and
were supplied by Beijing Chemicals. o-CNB was recrystallized
in 95% ethanol and o-CAN was distilled before use. TEM
photographs were taken by using a Hitachi 9000NAR electron
microscope. Specimens were prepared by placing a drop of the
colloid dispersion on a copper grid covered with a perforated
carbon film and then evaporating the solvent. The particle size
distribution histograms were obtained on the basis of the mea-
surements of about 300 particles from the enlarged photo-
grams. Chemical analysis was carried out by means of induc-
tively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP).
The spectrometer was a Spex 1702 scanning ICP spectrometer.
Specimens were ultrafiltered and washed with six portions of
60 mL of distilled water; specimens so treated are designated
washed colloids.
2.2. Preparation of Polymer-Stabilized Monometallic and
Bimetallic Colloids
The method for preparation of the PVP-stabilized monome-
tallic and bimetallic colloids was similar to that reported for
ruthenium colloid (30). The procedure was as follows: RuCl3 z
nH2O (0.0289 g, 1.17 3 10
24 mol), H2PtCl6 z 6H2O (0.0606 g,
1.17 3 10
24 mol), or H2PdCl4 z nH2O (PdCl2 was converted
into H2PdCl4 by concentrated hydrochloric acid containing
1.17 3 10
24 mol of Pd) and PVP (0.520 g, 4.68 3 10
23 mol as
monomeric unit) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of CH3OH
(100 mL) and H2O (80 mL) to form a dark red-brown homo-
geneous solution. Aqueous sodium borohydride (0.0885 g,
2.34 3 10
23 mol of NaBH4 in 20 mL of H2O) was then added
quickly with vigorous stirring. The color of the solution
changed quickly from dark red-brown to gray-blue to dark
brown in a few seconds. This dark brown solution was stirred
for 6 h to give the PVP-stabilized bimetallic colloids. By
changing the molar ratio of Ru/M (M 5 Pd or Pt), a series of
catalysts were synthesized. The prepared PVPRu/M bimetal-
lic sols were redispersed in 100 mL of MeOH after being dried
by rotatory evaporation, and more PVP was added to maintain
a 50:1 molar ratio of monomeric unit of PVP to metal in the
reaction.
2.3. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS spectra were obtained with an ESCALAB 220I-XL
(VG Inc.) photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic
Mg Ka X-ray radiation (1253.6 eV). Binding energies were
referred to C 1s (285.0 eV).
The sample for XPS determination was prepared according
to the literature (11, 12) with washed colloids.
2.4. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded by a Rigaku
D/Max-2400 diffractometer at 40 kV and 100 mA employing
Cu Ka radiation. Specimens were prepared by evaporating the
solvent of the washed colloids.
2.5. Catalytic Tests
Hydrogenation of o-CNB was carried out in a 30-mL
two-necked, flat-bottom flask with a magnetic stirrer. Reac-
tion temperature was kept constant at 303 K by external
circulation of a thermostat within 60.1C. The bimetallic
catalyst (containing 0.0187 mmol of metal), a proper metal
salt (usually chloride, 0.0187 mmol), and n-C10H21OH (as an
internal standard for gas chromatography) with methanol
were fed into the flask. Hydrogen was charged several times
to replace air. After the catalyst was activated at 303 K for
60 min, a solution of the substrate (0.5 M, 2 mL) was
injected into the flask; the total volume of the catalytic
system was 15.0 mL. The reaction rate was measured by the
uptake of hydrogen. When the volume of the theoretical
uptake of H2 for the conversion of o-CNB to o-CAN (3.0
mmol of H2) was reached, the reaction was stopped and the
product was analyzed by gas chromatography.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Characterization of Polymer-Stabilized Metallic
Colloids
The prepared PVPRu/Pt and PVPRu/Pd bimetallic col-
loids were stable without any metal precipitate for months. The
PVPRu colloid obtained by the same method could only
survive for about 3 weeks, after which a small amount of
metallic ruthenium precipitated. This verified that bimetallic
colloids were more stable than monometallic ruthenium colloid
and PVP was a good stabilizer for platinum and palladium but
not for ruthenium.
TEM measurements show that all bimetallic particles are
well dispersed and no aggregation of the bimetallic particles
can be detected. Plots of the average diameter together with the
corresponding standard deviation vs the metal composition of
the bimetallic colloidal particles are illustrated in Fig. 1. The
average diameters tend to increase with increasing molar con-
tent of platinum in the PVPRu/Pt system, although the ten-
dency is not so obvious. The particles have a narrow size
distribution (s 5 0.350.74 nm), with average diameters in the
range 1.342.57 nm. In the PVPRu/Pd system, average par-
ticle diameters tend to increase with increasing Pd content;
however, the particles display a wider size distribution (s 5
0.570.82 nm) and have a larger average diameter (2.173.26
nm) than those of the PVPRu/Pt colloidal particles.
To verify the formation of metal nanoparticles, we used XPS
to determine the valent state of the obtained colloids. The
binding energies of Ru 3d 5/2, Pt 4f 7/2, and Pd 3d 5/2 for the
metals in both the mono- and bimetallic colloids were 280.0,
70.5, and 335.4 eV, respectively, and were in good agreement
with those for the corresponding pure metals (31, 32). This
demonstrated that the metal colloidal particles were in a zero
oxidation state. ICP analysis gave the chemical composition of
the catalysts. It was found that less than 0.17% of boride
associated with the metals (boride/(Ru 1 Pt) , 0.018 in atomic
ratio). The B 1s spectrum of washed PVPRu/Pt(4/1) showed
a small signal located at 188.5 eV, in addition to the one at
191.5 eV with nearly the same intensity. The former was
assigned to the boride which associated with the metals (32,
33), whereas the latter corresponds to borate (B
31) derived
from the oxidation of borohydride.
X-ray diffraction analysis is useful for investigating the
formation of the alloy phases. The solubility of Ru in Pt may
exceed 79 at.% Ru (34). This was verified for the range up to
70 at.% Ru by X-ray work (35). As mentioned in the experi-
mental section, when the mixture of the metal salts (H2PtCl6 z
6H2O and RuCl3 z nH2O) was treated via the instantaneous
NaBH4 reduction, they were reduced rapidly and the Ru/Pt
alloys were formed in accordance with the molar ratio of the
metal salts; the molar ratio of Ru to Pt in washed PVPRu/
Pt(4/1) was measured to be 3.9:1 by the ICP method. Thus, the
obtained PVPRu/Pt colloidal particles have an alloy structure.
However, metal Ru and Pd cannot form an uninterrupted series
of solid solutions since they have different crystal structures
(36, 37), and Hellawell et al. (38) reported lattice spacings of
the Ru-rich solid solutions with up to 2.61 at.% Pd. Therefore,
the PVPRu/Pd system was investigated by X-ray diffraction.
Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffractograms for the PVP-stabilized
monometallic colloids (PVPRu and PVPPd), a bimetallic
colloid (PVPRu/Pd(1/1)), and a physical mixture of monome-
tallic colloids (PVPRu and PVPPd) containing the same
absolute amounts of ruthenium and palladium as the PVP
Ru/Pd bimetallic sol used. The lines for the colloids in the
diffraction patterns are broad because of the small sizes of the
colloidal particles. The diffraction pattern of the physical mix-
ture of monometallic colloids consists of overlapping lines for
the two individual colloids and is clearly different from the
pattern of the PVPRu/Pd(1/1) bimetallic colloid. This indi-
cates that the obtained PVPRu/Pd colloid has an alloy struc-

ture and is different from a simple physical mixture of the
corresponding monometallic colloids.
With respect to the surface composition of bimetallic alloy
particles, Toshima et al. reported a structural analysis of the
PVPPd/Pt (8) and PVPPd/Au (9) bimetallic colloids by
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). XPS is also
a valuable technique for revealing the chemical composition of
the surface layer of a solid. Liu et al. (12) applied XPS to
deduce the metal distribution in the bimetallic colloid of PVP
Pd/Au from the intensities of XPS peaks and the relative
sensitivity factors of the elements. We intended to obtain
structural information on the bimetallic colloids of PVPRu/M
(M 5 Pt or Pd) via XPS investigation. Quantification of
ruthenium peaks for ruthenium-containing bimetallic colloids
could not be carried out due to poor resolution between typical
Ru 3d 5/ 2 and the reference C 1s peaks. However, the surface
composition of PVPRu/Pt(4/1) (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt
equals 4:1 in bulk) was deduced to be 2.1:1 with less accuracy
by measuring the relatively weak Ru 3p 3/2 peak area. This
datum indicated that one componentplatinumis concen-
trated on the surface layer in the PVPRu/Pt bimetallic colloid.
According to the rules of thermodynamics, segregation of
components would occur in a solid solution which is composed
of components with different surface energies. A component
with a lower surface energy tends to be concentrated on the
surface. The surface tensions of Ru, Pt, and Pd are 2250, 1865,
and 1500 mN/m, respectively (39). Thus, coreshell model
particles, with Ru cores, would be most likely formed in the
PVPRu/Pt and PVPRu/Pd colloids. The stabilities of the
bimetallic colloids and the results of selective hydrogenation of
o-CNB (see Section 3.2) are consistent with the above deduc-
tion.
3.2. Selective Hydrogenation of o-CNB
Palladium (21, 40) or platinum (17, 28, 40, 41) is known to
have a good activity for the hydrogenation of halonitroaromat-
ics. However, with respect to selectivity to haloamines, they
are inferior to ruthenium (29, 30). Our laboratory (30) reported
that PVPRu exhibited very good selectivity (;100%), but the
activity was quite low, just 0.00028 (mol of H2)/(mol of Ru) z
s. To achieve better catalytic properties, we synthesized the
PVPRu/Pt and PVPRu/Pd bimetallic colloids for the purpose
of combining the high activity of PVPPt or PVPPd with the
high selectivity of PVPRu in the hydrogenation of o-CNB.
3.2.1. Selective hydrogenation of o-CNB over PVPRu/Pt
bimetallic colloids.
Selective hydrogenation of o-CNB over
PVPRu/Pt bimetallic colloids was carried out, and the results
are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the activity decreased
with increasing content of ruthenium in the PVPRu/Pt system.
The selectivity to o-CAN changed little up to PVPRu/Pt(9/1).
As compared to the activity of PVPPt, the activity of
PVPRu/Pt(9/1) was not high, only 0.030 (mol of H2)/(mol of
M) z s. However, it was two orders of magnitude higher than

LIU ET AL.
that of PVPRu (0.00028 (mol of H2)/(mol of M) z s). Mean-
while, the selectivity decreased from 100 to 70%. In other
words, if we added a small amount of platinum to ruthenium to
obtain bimetallic colloids, an extremely high activity could be
achieved with respect to the monometallic ruthenium colloid,
but the selectivity dropped remarkably.
Several papers (4144) reported that some metal cations
introduced into the colloidal metal catalyst system can mark-
edly influence both activity and selectivity in the hydrogena-
tion of some organic substrates. For example, the addition of
metal cations can markedly increase both activity and selec-
tivity in the hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzene (41), cinna-
maldehyde (42, 43), crotonaldehyde (43), and citronellal (44)
over polymer-stabilized platinum colloid. It was observed that
some metal cations added to the PVPRu system increased the
activity while the selectivity remained constant (30). There-
fore, the metal cation effect was also investigated in the bime-
tallic colloid system, and results are summarized in Table 1.
The data for the PVPRu/Pt system showed that Zn
21 poisoned
the catalyst. The metal cations Li
1 and Sn
21 had little effect on
the selectivity of the PVPRu/Pt(4/1) catalyst but they lowered
the activity from 0.16 to 0.09 (mol of H2)/(mol of M) z s.
Group VIII metal ions, such as Fe
31, Co
21, and Ni
21, no-
ticeably enhanced the selectivity to o-CAN, although they did
cause a small decrease in activity. The most significant im-
provement was obtained upon introducing Co
21 into the reac-
tion system. When the content of Ru in PVPRu/Pt colloids
was between 20 and 90%, the selectivity to o-CAN reached
.99% on addition of Co
21 (especially in PVPRu/Pt(1/4)
Co
21, where the selectivity to o-CAN reached ;100%) and the
activity was two orders of magnitude higher than that of
PVPRu.
The activities of PVPRu/Pt(1/4), PVPRu/Pt(4/1), and
PVPRu/Pt(9/1) were 0.29, 0.16, and 0.020 (mol of H2)/(mol
of M) z s, respectively (see Table 1). After Co
21 was added, the
activities became 0.071, 0.11, and 0.018 (mol of H2)/(mol of
M) z s, respectively. With increasing content of ruthenium, the

differences of the activity between the PVPRu/Pt colloids and
the corresponding PVPRu/PtCo
21 systems became less, and
PVPRu/Pt tended to resemble PVPRu in catalytic perfor-
mance.
3.2.2. Selective hydrogenation of o-CNB over PVPRu/Pd
bimetallic colloids.
The results of the selective hydrogena-
tion of o-CNB over PVPRu/Pd bimetallic colloids are shown
in Fig. 4. The catalytic performance of PVPRu/Pd catalysts
was different from that of the PVPRu/Pt system. It is illus-
trated from the figures that the amount of aniline produced in
the PVPRu/Pd system was more than that in the PVPRu/Pt
system. This suggested that palladium caused more dehaloge-
nation (21). Figure 4 also shows that the activity decreased
rapidly with increasing percentage of ruthenium in PVPRu/
Pd; the selectivity to o-CAN maintained the same level for the
bimetallic colloids up to ;50 at.% ruthenium and then in-
creased quickly. For comparison, the activity results of the
selective hydrogenation of o-CNB over the physical mixtures
with different molar ratios of the monometallic colloids
(PVPPd and PVPRu) are also shown in Fig. 4. The results
are in agreement with the calculated value (the dashed line in
Fig. 4). The selectivity was the same as that of PVPPd (33%
to o-CAN). Figure 4 shows that both the activity and the
selectivity of the PVPRu/Pd bimetallic colloids were clearly
different from those of the mixtures of the monometallic col-
loids.
Furthermore, the metal cation effect of the group VIII metals
was surveyed for the PVPRu/Pd system (Table 1). Unlike in
PVPRu/Pt, Fe
31 increased both the activity and the selectivity
about onefold in PVPRu/Pd(1/1). Co
21 decreased the activity
from 0.078 to 0.071 (mol of H2)/(mol of M) z s whereas it
increased the selectivity to o-CAN from 29 to 45%. Ni
21
poisoned the system. It was unusual that Ni
21 was a promoter
in other colloidal systems (30, 4144).
The results presented herein show that reactions over PVP
Ru/Pt and PVPRu/Pd bimetallic catalysts have no synergetic
effect. Metal catalysis could be affected by the formation of the
bimetallic colloid or by the addition of metal cations. The
mechanism of the hydrogenation of o-CNB over the bimetallic
colloidal system is very complicated and is affected by the
electronic and conformational properties of the components as
well as the composition at the metal surface. More work should
be done to elucidate the mechanism and influencing factors.
4. CONCLUSION
1. The PVPRu/Pt and PVPRu/Pd bimetallic colloids ob-
tained by NaBH4 reduction were more stable than the PVPRu
monometallic colloid prepared by the same method.
2. TEM, XPS, and XRD characterization demonstrated the
formation of rutheniumplatinum and rutheniumpalladium
alloy colloids. XPS data along with the results of selective
hydrogenation revealed that a coreshell structure, with Ru
cores of these bimetallic colloids, was formed.
3. The catalytic performance of the PVPRu/Pt and PVP
Ru/Pd bimetallic colloids is dependent on their compositions.
The activity of the bimetallic catalysts was much higher than
that of PVPRu and the selectivity was a little higher than that
of PVPPt (or PVPPd).
4. In the presence of the cobalt ion, nearly 100% selectivity
to o-chloroaniline (o-CAN) could be achieved over PVPRu/Pt
colloids, and the activity was two orders of magnitude higher
than that of the PVPRu colloid.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
