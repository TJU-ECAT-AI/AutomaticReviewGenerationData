The bimetallic catalyst systems PdAg/SiO2, PtSn/SiO2, M
Cu/NaY (M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt), and MNi/NaY (M = Ru, Rh, Pd,
Pt) have been tested for the gas phase hydrogenation of acetoni-
trile and butyronitrile in a fixed-bed microreactor and for the liquid
phase hydrogenation of butyronitrile in an autoclave. Addition of M
(M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) to Ni promotes the reduction of Ni2+ and sig-
nificantly increases the hydrogenation rate of butyronitrile in both
the gas and the liquid phase. This enhanced activity is indicative of
the formation of mixed ensembles on the surface of the bimetallic
clusters. Addition of Sn to Pt decreases the activity for acetoni-
trile hydrogenation and improves the selectivity toward secondary
amines. Addition of M (M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) to Cu enhances the
reduction of Cu2+ and lowers the activity for acetonitrile hydro-
genation. Addition of Ag to Pd lowers the activity for acetonitrile
hydrogenation. All MCu/NaY catalysts display high selectivity to-
wardtheformationofthesecondaryamine.Theinteractionbetween
Ru and Ni depends on the Ru precursor; it is stronger with RuCl3
than with Ru(NH3)6
3+. Addition of ammonia to the reaction mix-
ture lowers the reaction rate, but increases the formation of primary
amine.

I. INTRODUCTION
Bimetallic catalysts have been a favorite subject of fun-
damental research on heterogeneous catalysis and surface
science for 7 decades. Spectacular deviations of catalytic
activity and selectivity from the linear combination of the
corresponding parameters for the monometallic counter-
parts have been found and models have been proposed to
explain these effects. In the period 19301965 most authors
assumed that the surface of an alloy had the same composi-
tion as the bulk, and long-range collective electronic ef-
fects, such as filling of the holes in the d band of a transition
metal, were believed to be at the root of catalytic activity.
In the 1960s evidence was published that even alloys such
as Cu/Ni were biphasic when at equilibrium at the temper-
ature used in numerous catalytic processes (1); moreover,
it became clear that even for monophasic alloys the compo-
sition of the surface often deviates from that of the interior
(2), and it depends strongly on the environment (3). Mere
changes in collective electronic parameters have little ef-
fect on catalysis, but short-range effects and site geometry
were found to be crucial (4). Surface science revealed that
many adsorbates on a transition metal made use of hollow
sites; for instance, at a close-packed crystal surface, three
metal surface atoms are in direct contact with an adsorbed
atom. For a binary alloy ABx, the composition of such a
triatomic adsorption site can be A3, A2B, AB2, or B3 with
distinctly different heats of adsorption. In 1973 Sachtler
coined the terms ensemble effect and ligand effect to facili-
tate the scientific discussion of these phenomena (5). Both
effects contribute to the characteristic surface science when
alloy surfaces interact chemically with their environment.
We refer here only to review papers on well-defined al-
loys (6, 7), Somorjais book (8), and an important paper by
Rodriguez and Goodman (9).
For supported bimetal catalysts additional complications
exist as different particles will have different compositions.
Some metal precursors are incompletely reduced when
present in isolation, but the presence of a second more
noble metal often affects that reducibility (10, 11). Much
attention has been focused on systems of a transition metal
with high catalytic activity in hydrocarbon reactions (Pt,
Ru, Pd, Rh, Ni,) and a second metal of low catalytic activ-
ity (Ag, Cu, Au, Sn). In this category it is meaningful to
distinguish systems for which alloy formation is exother-
mic, such as Pt/Sn, and those for which it is endothermic,
such as Pt/Au. A system that shows complete miscibility be-
cause alloy formation is neither exothermic nor endother-
mic is PdAg; it is active for NO reduction by H2 (12), di-
ene hydrogenation (1316), ethanol dehydrogenation (17),
and selective conversion of chlorinated alkanes to alkenes
(18). With exothermic alloys, intermetallic compounds of
discrete composition are formed; a widely studied catalyst
system in this category is Pt/Sn which is used in hydrocarbon
reforming (1922). Bimetallic systems for which alloy for-
mation is endothermic include RuCu, PdCu, RhCu, Pt
Cu, and NiCu; among these RuCu (2327), PtCu (28
31), and PdCu (3235) have been studied extensively as
catalysts for hydrocarbon conversions or CO hydrogena-
tion. RhCu is active for benzene hydrogenation (36). Ex-

elements have high catalytic activity include RuNi, which
is active for the methanation of CO2 with H2 (23), and Rh
Ni, which catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane with
O2 (37, 38). The alloys PdNi (11, 39) and PtNi (4043)
are active hydrogenation catalysts.
The present research uses the hydrogenation of two ni-
triles, acetonitrile and butyronitrile, as probe reactions to
investigate the effect of alloying on catalyst reducibility,
activity, and selectivity. It is known that hydrogenation of
a nitrile over a transition metal catalyst results in a vari-
ety of products: primary, secondary, and tertiary amines,
unsaturated molecules such as enamines, and Schiff bases
have been identified (4447). In recent research the present
authors found that all three amines are primary products,
i.e., formed during a single residence at the metal sur-
face (48, 49). Under conditions where the primary amine
prevails over a ruthenium catalyst, secondary and tertiary
amines abound over other transition metals, indicating that
the nature of the metal surface is crucial for this selectiv-
ity. Preliminary results on the reaction mechanism should
be faced with data on the effects of alloying on catalyst
selectivity. Among the monometallic systems, Ru has the
highest selectivity to primary amines. For hydrocarbon re-
actions the general experience is that alloying a metal such
as Ru with high selectivity for hydrogenolysis and a cata-
lytically inert metal, such as Ag, Au, or Sn, usually re-
sults in an enhanced ratio of catalytic hydrogenation to
hydrogenolysis. It might therefore be expected that also
for nitrile hydrogenation such dilution will alter the selec-
tivity to primary vs secondary amines, as only the latter
require fission of a CN bond. There is, however, no evi-
dence backing this simple speculation. Some patents exist
mentioning bimetallic catalysts for nitrile hydrogenation.
Rylander and Koch (50) used RuPt, RuPd, and RuRh
for the hydrogenation of aliphatic and aromatic nitriles,
Borninkhof et al. (51) disclose the hydrogenation of alky
nitriles over NiCu chromite and CoCu chromite cata-
lysts, and Vedage and Armor (52, 53) describe a process
for the hydrogenation of butyronitrile to butylamine and
dibutylamine over Al2O3-supported NiRu, NiRh, NiCu,
and NiPd and CoRh, CoPd, and CoNi. In the scientific
literature, Kumbhar et al. (54) report on the hydrogena-
tion of benzonitrile over NiCu and Kusaka et al. (55) on
the hydrogenation of various nitriles over RuCo. These
published data neither support nor negate the mechanistic
speculation mentioned above.
In the present work, the bimetallic systems PdAg, Pt
Sn, MCu (M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt), and MNi (M = Ru, Rh,
Pd, Pt) have been studied for the hydrogenation in the gas
or liquid phase of the two nitriles mentioned. Interest in
this stage is focused on the enhanced reducibility of some
systems and on catalyst selectivity, whereas the effects of
alloying on the reaction rate will be presented mainly as
changes of conversion at a given temperature. To minimize
the effects of alloying on particle size, most tests were car-
ried out with zeolite-supported metals or alloys, assuming
that changes in particle size during reaction are small at
the fairly low temperature used for the majority of these
tests.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
II-1. Catalysts Preparation
1. Zeolite-supported monometallic catalysts.
M/NaY
(M = Ru, Ni, Rh, Pd, Pt, Cu) catalysts were prepared by ion
exchange, as described previously (39, 5660). NaY (UOP,
Y-54) was used as received. Ru/NaY was prepared two dif-
ferent ways. Ru/NaYa was prepared by ion exchange of
RuCl3 Â· xH2O with Na/NaY at room temperature for 24 h.
Ru/NaYb was prepared by ion exchange of a Ru(NH3)6Cl3
with NaY at room temperature (RT) for 24 h. Ni/NaY was
prepared by ion exchange of Ni(NO3)2 with NaY at RT at
a pH of 6 for 24 h followed by a NaOH treatment; im-
mediately after this exchange, the pH of the zeolite/water
slurry was adjusted to a pH of 10.0 by adding 0.5 M NaOH
over 1 h with stirring. Stirring was continued for 1 h more,
followed by filtering, washing with DDI H2O, and drying in
air. Rh/NaY was prepared by ion exchange of Rh(NH3)5Cl3
with NaY at 80C for 72 h. Pd/NaY was prepared by ion
exchange of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 with NaY at RT for 24 h.
Pt/NaY was prepared by ion exchange of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2
with NaY at 80C for 12 h. Likewise, Cu/NaY was prepared
by slurrying Cu(NO3)2 and NaY at RT for 24 h. All M/NaY
catalysts have a metal loading of about 3%.
2. NaY-supported bimetallic catalysts.
All NaY-suppor-
ted bimetallic catalysts were prepared by either simultane-
ous or successive ion exchange. RuCu/NaY was prepared
by a simultaneous ion exchange of RuCl3 and Cu(NO3)2
with NaY at RT for 24 h. PdCu/NaY was prepared by a si-
multaneous ion exchange of Pd(NH3)2+
4 and Cu2+ with NaY
at RT for 24 h. RhCu/NaY was prepared by ion exchanges
of NaY with Rh(NH3)5Cl2+ at 80C for 12 h followed by
secondary exchange with Cu2+ at RT for 24 h. PtCu/NaY
was prepared by ion exchange of NaY with Pt(NH3)2+
4
at
80C for 12 h followed by secondary exchange with Cu2+ at
RT for 24 h.
RuNi/NaY samples were prepared by two methods:
With RuNi/NaYa two-step ion exchange was used. Ni/NaY
was precalcined in a flow of O2 of 100 ml/min at 300C for
2 h at a ramping rate of 0.5C/min, redispersed in water, and
exchanged with RuCl3 at RT for 24 h. With RuNi/NaYb si-
multaneous ion exchange was applied by slurrying an aque-
ous solution of Ru(NH3)3+
6
and Ni2+ ions with NaY at RT
for 24 h. This was followed by NaOH treatment as with
the preparation of Ni/NaY. A two-step method was used
for the preparation of RhNi/NaY; ion exchange of NaY
with Rh(NH3)5Cl3 at 80C for 12 h was followed by sec-
ondary ion exchange with Ni(NO3)2 at RT for 24 h and
CATALYTIC HYDROGENATION OF NITRILES
217
subsequent treatment with NaOH as with Ni/NaY. Pd
Ni/NaY was prepared by ion exchange of precalcined
Ni/NaY with Pd(NH3)2+
4
at RT for 36 h. A similar proce-
dure was used for PtNi/NaY; i.e., precalcined Ni/NaY was
redispersed in water and exchanged with Pt(NH3)2+
4 ions at
80C for 12 h.
All catalysts contain about 3% of Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt.
The actual metal loadings were determined by ICP analysis.
3. Silica-supported PdAg and PtSn catalysts.
Pd
Ag/SiO2 samples with 9% Pd loading and an Ag/Pd atomic
ratio of 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 were taken from those previously
prepared by Sheu using conventional impregnation.
PtSn/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation
of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 and SnCl2 Â· 2H2O on silica. The catalysts
have about 3 wt% Pt loading and the Sn/Pt ratios were
0.33, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively.
II-2. Catalysts Pretreatment and Reduction
After ion exchange, the Cu/NaY and MCu/NaY cata-
lysts were calcined at 300C to prevent migration of the
Cu2+ ions into smaller zeolite cages (61). For Ru-containing
catalysts calcination was carried out in He at 60 ml/min to
prevent loss of the volatile Ru oxides; all other catalysts
were calcined in an O2 flow of 100 ml/min, increasing the
temperature to 300C at 0.5C/min and holding at that tem-
perature for 2 h.
Ni/NaY, Rh/NaY, Pd/NaY, Pt/NaY, RhNi/NaY, PdNi/
NaY, and PtNi/NaY were calcined in an O2 flow of 100 ml/
min at 500C for 2 h. The ramping rate was 0.5C/min.
Ru/NaYa and RuNi/NaYa were treated in a flow of Ar of
60 ml/min, while the temperature was increased to 450C
in 2 h and held there for 20 min.
RuNi/NaYb was pretreated in three different ways. The
first followed the procedure for RuNi/NaYa, i.e., calcina-
tion in a flow of Ar of 60 ml/min at 450C for 20 min. The
second procedure started with calcination of RuNi/NaYb
in a flow of Ar of 60 ml/min at 450C for 20 min. This was
followed by exposure to air at RT for 24 h and a second
in situ calcination in a flow of Ar of 60 ml/min, while the
temperature was increased to 500C at a ramping rate of
0.5C/min and held at 500C for 2 h. The third followed the
procedure for Ni/NaY, i.e., calcination in O2 flow at 500C.
PtSn/SiO2 catalysts were calcined in flowing oxygen of
100 ml/min at 450C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5C/min.
The pretreated catalysts were subjected to TPR or reduc-
tion. Before gas phase reaction, all catalysts were reduced
in situ in a H2 flow of 30 ml/min. MCu/NaY catalysts were
reduced at 500C for 30 min with a ramping rate of 2C/min.
MNi/NaY catalysts were reduced at 500C for 10 h with
a ramping rate of 2C/min. PtSn/SiO2 catalysts were re-
duced at 450C for 8 h. PdAg/SiO2 samples were directly
subjected to reduction at 450C for 8 h. For liquid phase re-
action, the catalysts are reduced ex situ under the same con-
ditions and sealed in glass tubing under an Ar atmosphere.
II-3. TPR
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried
out in a flow of a 5%H2/Ar mixture at 30 ml/min at 8C/min.
A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) monitored the H2
consumption.
II-4. Catalytic Testing
Gas phase reaction was carried out in a microflow fixed-
bed reactor, as described in our previous papers (60).
The H2 flow rate was 30 ml/min and the H2/CH3CN (or
H2/C3H7CN) molar ratio was 39. Usually, 100 mg of cata-
lysts was used. Quartz (Fluka, <200 mesh) was used as the
diluent when less than 100 mg of catalysts was used.
Liquid phase hydrogenation was carried out in a 300-ml
autoclave (Autoclave Engineers, Inc.); 600 mg of catalyst
was used for single-metal M/NaY catalysts and 300 mg for
bimetallic MNi/NaY catalysts. The reaction mixture con-
tained 0.05 mol of butyronitrile (4.3 ml) and 100 ml of hep-
tane solvent. Before reaction, the glass tubing was cut and
the prereduced catalyst was rapidly put into the reaction
mixture. The system was purged with hydrogen for 15 min
under stirring (300 rpm). Subsequently, H2 at 24 bar was
admitted into the autoclave at a stirring rate of 1500 rpm
and the autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature
(110C). For the tests with ammonia, the reaction vessel was
cooled in a dry-ice bath while catalysts and reactants were
loaded and about 1.7 ml of liquid ammonia was added. The
temperature inside the cell was about 57C. After the au-
toclave was purged with hydrogen for about 15 min under
stirring and the H2 pressure was brought to about 24 bar in
the closed autoclave, the dry-ice bath was removed. During
heating and after the autoclave was heated to the reaction
temperature (110C), the total pressure was recorded. Sam-
ples of the reaction mixture were taken through the sam-
pling valve at certain intervals and analyzed by GC. The
reaction was stopped when the total pressure no longer
changed.
III. RESULTS
III-1. TPR
1. MCu/NaY catalysts.
TPR analysis of RuCu/NaY,
RhCu/NaY, PdCu/NaY, and PtCu/NaY shows that addi-
tion of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt promotes the reduction of Cu2+. In
Fig. 1 the TPR profiles of Cu/NaY, Pt/NaY, and PtCu/NaY
are shown. The profiles of the other systems are similar.
Cu/NaY has a TPR peak at about 300C reduction and con-
tinues to 550C. A weak negative peak at 629C is probably
due to reoxidation of Cu to Cu+ by protons (62). Ru/NaY,
Rh/NaY, Pd/NaY, and Pt/NaY display TPR peaks at 105,
93, 153, and 150C, respectively. Addition of a second metal
to Cu/NaY greatly enhances the reducibility of Cu2+. For
RuCu/NaY,thereductionpeakofCu2+shiftsdownwardto

277C, while for RhCu/NaY, PdCu/NaY, and PtCu/NaY
the reduction of Cu2+ is merged with the reduction of the
noble metal ion and the TPR peaks are below 170C.
2. RuNi/NaYa,MNi/NaY(M = Rh,Pd,Pt).
TPR ana-
lysis also indicates that addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt pro-
motes the reduction of Ni2+, in agreement with the litera-
ture (39, 41). Figure 2 shows the TPR profiles of Ni/NaY,
Pt/NaY, and PtNi/NaY. TPR profiles of other systems show
similar features.
Ni/NaY calcined O2 has a TPR peak at 474C; reduction
ceases at about 600C. The peak corresponds to a H/Ni
ratio of 1.6. It is very similar to the result found by Feeley
et al. that about 86% of the Ni2+ can be reduced if Ni/NaY,
prepared and treated under the same conditions, is reduced
below 600C (63). A small portion of Ni2+ requires a higher
reduction temperature.
Ru/NaYa has a single reduction peak at 129C. For Ru
Ni/NaYa three partially overlapping TPR peaks at 166, 201,
and 304C are observed. The peaks at 201 and 304C are
much weaker than the peak at 166C. In comparison to
Ru/NaYa, the reduction of Ru3+ in RuNi/NaYa is shifted
to higher temperature; in contrast, the reduction of Ni2+
is shifted to lower temperature. Remarkably, the Ni2+ ions
are completely reduced below 500C; i.e., the presence of
Ru in the sample greatly enhances the reduction of Ni2+.
Rh/NaY has two unresolved TPR peaks at 91 and 187C
andasmallpeakat632C.Thepatternisconsistentwiththat
published earlier (64). In the bimetallic system RhNi/NaY,
the TPR peak at 91C can still be seen while the second
peak is merged with the reduction peak of Ni2+. Reduction
of Ni2+ is clearly facilitated in the bimetallic system. The
TPR peak at 470C shifts to the much lower temperature
of 353C. However, a small portion of the Ni2+ remains
difficult to reduce, as attested by the weak reduction peak
ofRhat632C.Rhodium additionthuslowersthereduction
temperatureofthereduciblefractionoftheNiinthiszeolite
without significantly lowering the fraction of the Ni that
remains unreduced at 600C.
Pd/NaY has a TPR peak at 167C and a weak broad TPR
peak at 579C. For PdNi/NaY, the TPR peak of Pd remains
at 167C but the reduction temperature for Ni2+ was low-
ered to 345C. At the same time, a small portion of the Ni2+
ions in the bimetallic system is not reduced below 600C.
Pt/NaY has two positive TPR peaks at 95 and 300C and
a negative TPR peak at 442C. Integration of the two pos-
itive peaks leads to a H/Pt ratio of 2.72. That this value is
larger than 2 indicates the presence of some PtO2 besides
PtO after calcination in O2. The negative peak is attributed
to reoxidation of Pt by protons that were formed during
reduction at low temperature. This phenomenon was ob-
served previously in this lab (65). For PtNi/NaY, the re-
duction peak for Ni2+ merges with the peak of Pt2+ while
some Ni2+ remains unreduced below 600C.

(c) after calcination in O2 at 500C.
3. RuNi/NaYb.
The situation of RuNi/NaYb is dis-
cussed separately due to its complexity. Various pretreat-
ment conditions have been tried to promote the reducibility
of nickel by Ru. The TPR profiles of RuNi/NaYa prepared
fromRu(NH3)6Cl3andtreatedunderavarietyofconditions
are shown in Fig. 3.
No TPR peak is observed for Ru/NaY calcined in He.
This sample looks gray and becomes black after contact
with air at RT. However, if it is calcined again in He and
reduced in H2, the color returns to gray.
If RuNi/NaYb is first calcined in situ in Ar, TPR analysis
shows no reduction peak of Ru and two reduction peaks of
Ni2+at389andat557C.Thepeakat557Cismuchstronger
than that at 389C. Also, no TPR peak is observed above
600C. Compared with that of Ni/NaY, it is clear that in the
bimetallic system the reducibility of Ni2+ is increased below
600C and some of the Ni is reduced more easily, but the
majority of Ni2+ is reduced less easily.
If RuNi/NaYb is first heated in Ar, then exposed to air
for 24 h at RT, and re-heated in Ar at 500C, the reduction
of Ni2+ is found to be enhanced; i.e., the TPR peak for Ni2+
shifts to lower temperature and the peak at 554C becomes
smaller.
Upon treatment of RuNi/NaYb in O2 under the same
conditions as those used for Ni/NaY, the reducibility of Ni2+
increases. The peak at about 540C is weaker than that in
Ni/NaY.AsmallportionoftheNiremainsunreducedbelow
600C. As for the large narrow peak that appears at 112C,
its size exceeds the response limit of the TCD detector.
A rough estimate suggests that its hydrogen consumption
is larger than H/Ru = 2 based on the Ru content of the
fresh sample. Unfortunately, calcination of Ru catalysts in
O2 leads to the formation of highly volatile oxide RuO4.
It leads to a loss of Ru. RuNi/NaY has an Ru/Al ratio
of 0.418 after being heated in He, but has a ratio of 0.016
after calcination in O2 at 400C. Evidently, the majority of
Ru is lost upon calcination in O2. Based on the Ru content
of the calcined RuNi/NaY sample, the H/Ru value of the
TPR peak at 112C is much, much higher than 2, indicating
condensation of RuO4 in the exit area of the reactor and its
reduction during TPR.
The above results indicate limited reduction enhance-
ment when Ru(NH3)3+
6
was used as the precursor for the
preparation of the RuNi/NaY catalyst.
III-2. Catalytic Activity and Selectivity
1. Gas phase hydrogenation over SiO2-supported bi-
metallic catalysts.
PdAg/SiO2 catalysts were tested for
gasphasehydrogenationofacetonitrileat100C.Ag/SiO2is
totally inactive for this reaction. All active bimetallic cata-
lysts deactivate during reaction to reach a steady state in
which the activity decreases with the Ag/Pd ratio. For the
Pd/Ag ratios 0, 0.1, 1, and 2, the specific steady state conver-
sions of acetonitrile are (mol%) 26.0, 20.0, 19.0, and 11.3,
respectively. A plot of the selectivities against the Ag/Pd
ratio is shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, all catalysts of this group

are highly selective to tertiary amine. The presence of Ag
has no significant effect on the selectivity.
PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with about 3 wt% Pt loading were
tested for the same hydrogenation. The Sn/Pt ratios were
chosen to match those of the well-known intermetallic com-
pounds in the SnPt phase diagram. As expected, the ad-
dition of Sn to Pt greatly lowers the activity. To obtain a
reasonable activity with PtSn/SiO2 catalysts, the reaction
temperature had to be increased. All active catalysts deac-
tivate with time; a steady state is reached at about 5 h time
on stream. Figure 5 shows the selectivities of PtSn/SiO2 of
different compositions at comparable conversions, i.e., at
different temperatures. Whereas Pt/SiO2 is highly selective
to tertiary amine, this selectivity decreases upon increas-
ing the Sn/Pt ratio and the temperature; concomitantly, the
selectivity to primary amine increases.
To separate these variables and to demonstrate the effect
ofSnadditionontheselectivity,allcatalystswerealsotested
at 200C. For those with low Sn/Pt ratios, quartz was added
as a dilutant to obtain conversions below 15%. The selec-
tivities for acetonitrile hydrogenation at 200C are shown
in Fig. 6. The results show that Sn addition suppresses the
hydrogenolysis of acetonitrile to ethane and ammonia. Pt
Sn catalysts of low Sn content further show the signature of
Pt; i.e., the secondary amine is the preferred product except
at very high Sn content where the primary amine prevails.
However, even for the highest Sn content where conver-
sion could be measured at this temperature, the selectivity
toward ethylamine was only a little above 50%.

(M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) have been tested for gas phase hydro-
genation and compared with monometallic catalysts. The
catalysts deactivate with time. The reaction reaches steady
state at 5 h time on stream. The results at steady state are
summarized in Table 1. Whereas Cu/NaY is totally inactive
for butyronitrile hydrogenation below 125C, addition of
Cu to monometallic catalysts significantly lowers their ac-
tivity. The specific reaction rates (moles of nitrile converted
Ã103 per mole of metal per second) for the monometal-
lic catalysts Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt are 1.2, 6.8, 2.3, and 1.2
and for the bimetallic catalysts they are 0.44, 1.1, 0.23,
and 0.31, respectively. Some bimetallic catalysts are all but

group display high selectivity to either secondary or tertiary

secondary amine.
3. Bimetallic MNi/NaY catalysts for gas phase hydro-
genation
of
butyronitrile.
The
single-metal
catalysts
Ni/NaY, Ru/NaY, Rh/NaY, Pd/NaY, and Pt/NaY as well as
thebimetalliccatalystsMNi/NaYweretestedforgasphase
hydrogenation at low temperature, i.e., for the single-metal
catalyst in the kinetic regime. All catalysts deactivate with
timeuntiltheyapproachasteadystateat5h.Deactivationis
more obvious for RuNi/NaY(a) than for the others, prob-
ably due to residual chlorine in RuNi/NaY(a). The steady
state activity and selectivity data are compiled in Table 2.
The specific activities of the bimetallic catalysts are much
higher than those of the monometallic counterparts. Since
all catalysts were reduced under the same conditions, their
dispersions will be similar. Therefore, the present results
indicate a rather dramatic synergistic effect between two
metals. Over some bimetallics the conversion approaches
100%; i.e., the true rate constants could be orders of mag-
nitude higher than those over the single-metal catalysts.
The results over RuNi/NaYb are not included in Table 2
because the conversions over this catalyst depend on the
pretreatment conditions. No synergetic effect is observed
when the catalyst is pretreated in inert gas while pretreat-
ment in O2 leads to the loss of Ru due to the formation of
volatile Ru oxides.
The selectivities of the bimetallic catalysts differ mar-
kedly from those of the single-metal catalysts. In gen-
eral, Ru catalyzes preferentially the formation of primary
amines, while Ni, Rh, and Pd favor the formation of sec-
ondary amines, and Pt is selective toward the formation
of tertiary amines. These selectivities have been found in
our work and in that of other authors (44). It is remark-
able that the combination of Ni with Pd, i.e., two metals
with high selectivity for the secondary amine, results in a
catalyst with 50% selectivity to the primary amine. Also,
the other bimetallic MNi catalysts show a higher selectiv-
ity than Ni/NaY to primary amine. The selectivity toward
the primary amine of RhNi/NaY is, however, lower than
that of Rh/NaY. With M = Pt, Rh, or Pd, the selectivity to-
ward the unsaturated intermediate butylidinebutylamine
(BBA) is extremely low. If this simply meant higher hydro-
genation activity, one would expect an enhanced selectivity
for the secondary amine, which is, however, contrary to the
experimental facts.
4. Liquid phase hydrogenation of butyronitrile over mo-
nometallic and bimetallic catalyst.
Liquid phase hydro-
genation of butyronitrile has been carried out with Ru/NaY,
Rh/NaY, Pd/NaY, Pt/NaY, Ni/NaY, RuNi/NaYa, RhNi/
NaY, PdNi/NaY, and PtNi/NaY at 110C. Conversions
and selectivities are summarized in Table 3. In most cases
the run was stopped when conversion was 90% or higher;
the reaction times have been specified in the table.
In general, the bimetallic catalysts achieve high conver-
sion in significantly shorter times than the single-metal cata-
lysts,withtheexceptionoftheveryactiveRh/NaY,although
in these tests the amount of bimetallic catalysts was only
half that of the monometallic catalysts. Clearly, the bimetal-
lic catalysts are much more active than the monometallic
catalysts. This result is consistent with that obtained with
the gas phase reaction.
Significant differences in selectivity exist between the
catalysts. Ru/NaY shows highest selectivity to the primary
amine; Rh/NaY and Ni/NaY show highest selectivity to the
secondary amine, but their selectivities to primary amine
are still rather high; Pd/NaY and Pt/NaY produce almost
exclusively the secondary amine.

HUANG AND SACHTLER
Formation of the unsaturated molecule BBA is very low
over the bimetallic catalysts. RuNi/NaY and RhNi/NaY
show the highest selectivity to primary amine while Pd
Ni/NaY and PtNi/NaY preferentially form the secondary
amine.
All catalysts show a low, but detectable, activity for hy-
drogenolysis of the CN bond to produce butane and am-
monia. Butane has been detected with GC-MS. The high-
est butane selectivity of 0.8% is observed with Pt/NaY at
110C. Due to the low boiling point of butane, it is actually
possible that this molecule is somewhat underestimated by
GC. Butane formation has also been detected in the gas
phase hydrogenation of butyronitrile.
5. Liquid phase hydrogenation of butyronitrile in the
presence of ammonia over MNi/NaY catalysts.
Many au-
thors hydrogenated nitriles in the presence of a consider-
able pressure of ammonia, to shift equilibria of the type
R2NH + NH3 = 2RNH2 toward the primary amines. Ac-
cordingly, the present authors have tested MNi/NaY cata-
lysts (M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt) by carrying out liquid phase hy-
drogenation of butyronitrile in the presence of ammonia
at 110C. Table 4 shows the conversion and selectivity af-
ter a certain reaction time. Clearly, the presence of ammo-
nia lowers the rate of nitrile hydrogenation. For example,
with RuNi/NaY only 2.25 h is needed to reach complete
conversion in the absence of ammonia, but with ammonia
only 87.1% conversion is reached after 8 h. As expected,
the presence of ammonia enhances the yield of the pri-
mary amine. Over RuNi/NaY the selectivity to the pri-
mary amine is 91.5% in the presence of ammonia, but only
61.8% in its absence at 100% conversion. The same effect
was observed over RhNi/NaY and PtNi/NaY.
The situation over PdNi/NaY is different. Initially, the
concentration of primary amine in the reaction mixture is
high, exceeding that obtained without ammonia. However,
after about 4 h on stream (about 56% conversion), the con-
centration of the primary amine becomes lower than that
of the secondary amine; the composition of the final reac-
tion mixture is similar in the presence of ammonia and in
its absence at similar conversion.

V. DISCUSSION
The present findings on reducibility enhancement are in
line with general experience. The reduction of metal ions
by H2 to metal particles can be visualized as consisting of
two main steps: nucleation and then growth. In bimetallic
systems the noble metal will be reduced first; ions of the
second metal can attach themselves to the clusters of the
noble metal, where H2 will be dissociatively adsorbed. Re-
duction and formation of a bimetallic cluster are completed
when H+ ions are released to the support. As a result, the
reduction of the second metal takes place at significantly
lower temperature than that in the absence of the noble
metal. For instance, Ni2+ ions can join Pd3 clusters:
Pd0
3 + Ni2+ = [Pd3Ni]2+,
[Pd3Ni]2+ + H2 HPd3NiH]2+ [Pd3Ni]0 + 2H+.
If amminated transitions metal ions, such as Pd(NH3)2+
4 ,
are used in the ion exchange, this chemistry is compli-
cated by autoreduction of these ions. Autoreduction of
metalammine complexes in zeolites has been observed by
Gallezot (66, 67) and ourselves for all heavy Group VIII
metals and is quite a general phenomenon (6870). The
extent of autoreduction is known to depend on the rate of
calcination of the catalyst precursor after ion exchange. A
high flow rate of oxygen and low heating rate were shown
by Gallezot to minimize autoreduction of Pd. With Pt it is
impossible to suppress autoreduction. In the case of Pd, the
Pdn nuclei tend to agglomerate to larger Pd particles, and
consequently, less alloy formation will take place. During
calcination in oxygen, the autoreduced metal clusters will
be transformed to oxide clusters. With Rh it has been
shown that the oxide particles react with zeolite protons
so that Rh3+ ions are regenerated (71).
The shift of the TPR profiles to lower temperature
demonstrates that the reduction of Ni2+ is enhanced by the
presence of Rh, Pd, and Pt, indicating alloy formation. Sur-
prisingly, integration of the TPR profiles shows that the
percentage of the Ni2+ which is reduced below 600C re-
mains roughly the same in monometallic and bimetallic M
Ni/NaY samples with M = Rh, Pd, Pt. However, it should be
noted that these TPR runs were carried out in a 5%H2/Ar
mixture with a ramping rate of 8C/min, whereas the in situ
reduction of the catalysts prior to testing was carried out
in a pure H2 flow with a ramping rate of 1C/min, followed
by holding the temperature at 500C for 10 h. After such
extensive reduction treatment our data indicate that all Ni
is reduced to Ni0 in the bimetallic catalysts.
WithRuNi,alloyformationinzeolitecagesismorecom-
plicated. TPR results indicate that ruthenium has a smaller
effect than other transition metals on the enhancement of
the reducibility of nickel when Ru(NH3)3+
6
is used as the
precursor. A number of possible causes can be visualized:
CATALYTIC HYDROGENATION OF NITRILES
223
(1) Treatment with NaOH immediately after ion ex-
change will cause agglomeration of Ni2+ ions to form
Ni(OH)2 gel, while Ru(NH3)3+
6
ions do not agglomerate
but remain dispersed in the supercages. This scenario favors
phase separation: Ru0 and small NiO particles are formed
after heating in Ar or He. No strong reducibility enhance-
ment of Ni2+ or alloy formation is expected, if contact be-
tween Ru0 and NiO is limited. This phase separation model
is supported by observations with PdNi/NaY for which
TPR after calcination in He or Ar shows no reduction peak
of Pd2+. Thus, although autoreduction of Pd2+ by NH3 is
known to take place, the Pd0 has no significant effect on the
reduction of Ni2+. The TPR profile of PdNi/NaY looks
very similar to that of Ni/NaY. Calcination at higher tem-
perature leads only to a shift of the reduction peak for Ni2+
to higher temperature. This TPR profile is totally different
from that after calcination in O2. It seems that, for Pd
Ni/NaY, calcination in He leads to segregation of Pd parti-
cles and limited alloy formation. In contrast, calcination in
O2 leads to the formation of PdO and NiO, which strongly
interact with each other. Therefore, the reducibility of Ni is
greatly enhanced after this treatment.
(2) Ru0 clusters in NaY cages that are obtained by ion
exchange of Ru(NH3)3+
6 , followed either by autoreduction
or by controlled reduction with H2, have been reported
to be very sensitive to O2 to form RuO2 (56, 7274). This
neutral oxide will easily agglomerate and move out of the
zeolite upon heating. Separation of RuO2 and NiO particles
in RuNi/NaY inhibits reducibility enhancement of Ni2+.
(3) Agglomeration of RuO2 and formation of volatile
RuO4 take place when RuNi/NaY is calcined in O2. This
volatilization is documented for Ru supported on NaY or
SiO2 (72, 75). Accordingly, the Ru loading of Ru/SiO2 de-
creases by calcination in O2 at 260C from 1% to 0.62%
(76). Loss of Ru also leads to a visible change in color from
blacktogreyforRu/NaYheatedinO2at400C.Atthesame
time, some dark material, presumably condensed RuO4, is
deposited at the reactor walls and the frit. This material is
very difficult to dissolve in aqua regia; no such deposit was,
however, observed when RuNi/NaY is calcined in O2. In
this case the color of the material remains darker than the
grey monometallic Ru/NaY. Element analysis showed that
the Ru/Al ratio of Ru/NaY is 0.417 after heating in He,
but 0.002 after calcination in O2 at 400C. In contrast, the
Ru/Al ratio of RuNi/NaY is 0.418 after heating in He,
but 0.016 after calcination in O2 at 400C. The presence
of Ni2+ apparently helps to retain some Ru. The effects of
Ru on reducibility and catalysis in these samples are thus
caused by a very small amount of Ru. Possibly, a small quan-
tity of a RuNi alloy is present in the reduced bimetallic
catalysts.
Whereas the above data suggest a rather weak effect of
Ru on the reducibility of Ni, a significant enhancement of Ni
reduction by Ru is observed if RuCl3 is used as the precur-
sor of Ru. Also, a more active catalyst is obtained with this
precursor containing significant amounts of RuNi alloy
clusters. Even simple impregnation of RuCl3 with Ni/NaY
results in a good RuNi/NaY catalyst. An alternative proce-
dure will be ion exchange of Ru3+ with Ni/NaY, as described
for the preparation of RuCu/NaY. In the absence of NH3,
no autoreduction takes place; upon calcination in an inert
gas (He, Ar) the Ru3+ ions lose their H2O ligands and be-
come well dispersed on the inner surface of the zeolite or
attached to the surface of NiO clusters. After co-reduction
of Ni and Ru, RuNi alloy clusters are formed.
For MCu/NaY bimetallic systems, the present TPR re-
sults demonstrate that the reduction of Cu2+ is enhanced by
the presence of Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt, indicating, again, strong
interaction between two metals and alloy formation. The
chemistry sketched here has been used to optimize alloy
formation in zeolite-supported multimetal catalysts for the
hydrogenation of nitriles. In view of the enhanced activity
of MNi/NaY catalysts in butyronitrile hydrogenation this
could be of practical value.
Turning now to activity and selectivity, it is obvious from
the present results that the conversion over alloyed Ni cata-
lysts is much higher than over monometallic Ni; the en-
hancement exceeds the amount predicted on the basis of
additivity or enhanced reducibility of the nickel. It is also
evident from the present results that alloying has a pro-
found effect on the selectivity. Formation of the unsatu-
rated molecule BBA is very low over the bimetallic cata-
lysts, indicating the relative favorization of saturation of
the double bond. The selectivity to primary amine is high
over RuNi/NaY and RhNi/NaY, though lower than that
over Ru/NaY, whereas PdNi/NaY and PtNi/NaY prefer-
entially form the secondary amine.
In the Introduction the concept of atomic ensembles in
the surface of an alloy was mentioned. As pointed out there
and in other papers (6, 7782), a decreasing ensemble size
of atoms of the most active metal will lead to suppressed hy-
drogenolysis and enhanced hydrogenation selectivity. Ob-
viously, the simple idea that selectivity might be controlled
by the hydrogenolytic splitting required for the formation
of higher amines is not helpful to rationalize the present
results. No correlation of hydrogenolysis activity and for-
mation of higher amines is found. Diluting Pd ensembles by
an inactive metal such as Ag or Sn addition to Pt, though
suppressing the hydrogenolysis of acetonitrile to ethane,
does not strongly change the catalytic signature of Pt to
secondary amines. Only at very high Sn content does the
expected formation of primary amine become evident, but
this selectivity does not much exceed 50%.
The heat of chemisorption on mixed ensembles will be
between the values for the pure ensembles of the same size
of either metal. In terms of the Balandin theory a volcano-
shaped curve relates the catalytic activity with the heat of
224
HUANG AND SACHTLER
adsorption. A strongly enhanced activity is predicted for
bimetallic catalysts, if the values for the pure metals are lo-
cated at different sides of the volcano. This is apparently the
case for the present systems for which strong enhancement
of the catalytic activity has been found in the present work.
The position of the maximum depends, of course, on the
nature of the reactant. For the hydrogenation of benzoni-
trile over the silica-supported Ni catalysts. Kumbhar et al.
(54) found that the catalytic activity was lower when Ni was
alloyedwithcopper.Likewise,thepresentresultsshowthat,
for gas phase hydrogenation of acetonitrile, addition of Ag
to Pd, or Sn to Pt and/or Cu to Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt leads to
decreased catalytic activity.
The results on the activity changes due to alloying can
thus be rationalized in terms of mixed ensembles with inter-
mediate heat of adsorption. The catalytic reaction rate will
be higher than that of the most active alloy partner, if the
heats of chemisorption on both pure metals are located at
different sides of the volcano-shaped curve. Unfortunately,
no predictive conclusions on activity and selectivity appear
warranted at the present stage.
The present results further show not only that addition
of ammonia to the reactant mixture shifts the equilibrium
of the three amines toward the primary amine, as predicted
by thermodynamics, but also that ammonia also interferes
with the reaction mechanism. As a strong competitor for
active sites, it lowers the reaction rate significantly.
CONCLUSIONS
(1) AdditionofRu,Rh,Pd,orPttoNi/NaYenhancesthe
reduction rate of Ni and strongly increases the catalytic ac-
tivity for the hydrogenation of butyronitrile. The enhanced
activity is predominantly attributed to mixed ensembles in
the surface of bimetal clusters.
(2) Addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Cu/NaY enhances
the reduction rate of Cu2+ but lowers the activity for ace-
tonitrilehydrogenation.AllCuM/NaYcatalystsshowhigh
selectivity to secondary amine.
(3) Addition of Sn to Pt lowers the activity of Pt for
acetonitile hydrogenation and promotes the formation of
secondary amine.
(4) Strong interaction between Ru and Ni is obtained if
RuCl3 is used as the precursor for the preparation of Ru
Ni/NaY.
(5) Ammonia lowers the reaction rate but improves the
formation of primary amine.
