The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. The study focuses on developing highly efficient and stable catalysts for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to produce succinic anhydride (SA) with high selectivity at relatively low temperatures.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni, often exhibit properties distinctly different from their monometallic counterparts. In this case, the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst showed advantages over conventional heterogeneous catalysts for maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation at low temperatures. However, it also demonstrated some drawbacks related to rapid deactivation.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employed various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Catalyst preparation: Bimetallic and monometallic catalysts were prepared using different supports (HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3, USY-Al2O3, Beta-Al2O3, and Al2O3).

2. Characterization techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to analyze the catalysts.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: Effects of reaction temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) were investigated.

4. Performance evaluation: Catalysts were tested in a fixed-bed reactor, and product analysis was conducted using gas chromatography.

The research demonstrated that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst could catalyze the production of succinic acid at 40°C with 100% conversion, highlighting its potential for low-temperature applications in fine chemical synthesis.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用作出了重大贡献，包括精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化。该研究致力于开发高效稳定的催化剂，在相对较低的温度下进行顺丁烯二酸酐的氢化，以高选择性生产琥珀酸酐（SA）。

双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni）通常表现出与单金属催化剂截然不同的性质。在这种情况下，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂在低温下进行顺丁烯二酸酐（MA）氢化时，相比传统的多相催化剂显示出优势。然而，它也表现出一些与快速失活相关的缺点。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法：

1. 催化剂制备：使用不同的载体（HY-Al2O3、HX-Al2O3、ZSM-5-Al2O3、USY-Al2O3、Beta-Al2O3和Al2O3）制备双金属和单金属催化剂。

2. 表征技术：使用X射线衍射（XRD）和程序升温还原（TPR）分析催化剂。

3. 反应参数优化：研究了反应温度、压力和重量小时空速（WHSV）的影响。

4. 性能评估：在固定床反应器中测试催化剂，并使用气相色谱进行产品分析。

研究表明，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂能够在40°C下以100%的转化率催化生产琥珀酸，突显了其在精细化学品合成中低温应用的潜力。
