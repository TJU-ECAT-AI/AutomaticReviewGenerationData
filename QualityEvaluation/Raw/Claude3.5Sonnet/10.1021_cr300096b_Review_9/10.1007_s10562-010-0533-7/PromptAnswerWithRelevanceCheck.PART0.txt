The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. The study focuses on developing highly efficient and stable catalysts for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to produce succinic anhydride (SA) with high selectivity at relatively low temperatures.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni, often exhibit properties distinctly different from their monometallic counterparts. In this case, the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst showed advantages over conventional heterogeneous catalysts for maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation at low temperatures. However, it also demonstrated some drawbacks related to rapid deactivation.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employed various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Catalyst preparation: Bimetallic and monometallic catalysts were prepared using different supports (HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3, USY-Al2O3, Beta-Al2O3, and Al2O3).

2. Characterization techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to analyze the catalysts.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: Effects of reaction temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) were investigated.

4. Performance evaluation: Catalysts were tested in a fixed-bed reactor, and product analysis was conducted using gas chromatography.

The research demonstrated that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst could catalyze the production of succinic acid at 40°C with 100% conversion, highlighting its potential for low-temperature applications in fine chemical synthesis.
