The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. The literature focuses on the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to produce succinic anhydride and succinic acid, which are valuable products for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, show distinct properties compared to monometallic catalysts, often exhibiting higher activity and selectivity. The study aimed to develop a highly efficient and stable catalyst for low-temperature hydrogenation of maleic anhydride with high selectivity to succinic anhydride.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include:

1. Catalyst preparation: Using various supports (e.g., HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3) and preparation methods (e.g., kneading method).

2. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to analyze catalyst structure and properties.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: Investigating effects of temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) on catalyst performance.

4. Performance evaluation: Assessing catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability in flow reactor studies.

5. Comparative studies: Evaluating bimetallic (Pt-Ni) versus monometallic (Ni) catalysts on various supports.

The research demonstrates that adding a small amount of Pt to Ni catalysts effectively increases selectivity and activity. The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst showed high efficiency in the one-pot conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid at low temperatures (40°C), achieving 100% conversion. This approach contributes to more environmentally benign and economical processes for producing valuable chemical intermediates.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Ni系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，包括精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化。文献主要关注马来酸酐氢化生产琥珀酸酐和琥珀酸，这些是化学、制药和食品工业的重要产品。

双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-Ni系统，与单金属催化剂相比显示出独特的性能，通常表现出更高的活性和选择性。该研究旨在开发一种高效稳定的催化剂，用于低温下马来酸酐的氢化，并具有高选择性生成琥珀酸酐。

用于研究、优化和提高此过程选择性和效率的方法包括：

1. 催化剂制备：使用各种载体（如HY-Al2O3、HX-Al2O3、ZSM-5-Al2O3）和制备方法（如捏合法）。

2. 催化剂表征：使用X射线衍射（XRD）和程序升温还原（TPR）等技术分析催化剂结构和性能。

3. 反应参数优化：研究温度、压力和重量小时空速（WHSV）对催化剂性能的影响。

4. 性能评估：在流动反应器研究中评估催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

5. 对比研究：评估各种载体上的双金属（Pt-Ni）与单金属（Ni）催化剂的性能。

研究表明，向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可有效提高选择性和活性。Pt-Ni双金属催化剂在低温（40°C）下一锅法转化马来酸为琥珀酸时表现出高效率，实现了100%的转化率。这种方法有助于开发更环保、更经济的valuable化学中间体生产工艺。
