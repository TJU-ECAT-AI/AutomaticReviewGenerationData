[1] "Using NiPt/Al2O3HY catalyst and performing the reaction, it was possible to carry out the lowest reaction temperature ever carried at 100% conversion."

[2] "Adding a small amount of Pt (0.5) to the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst that is effective for increasing the selectivity and activity."

[3] "We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C."

[4] "The objective of the present study was to develop a highly efficient, more stable catalyst for hydrogenation of maleic anhydride at relatively low temperature to produce SA with high selectivity."

[5] "Owning to the high activity of PtNi for MA hydrogenation and the fact that MA is the main precursor for the production of succinic acid, we have also carried out the catalytic synthesis of succinic acid starting from maleic acid at 40 C, this help the viability and economics of the process."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. The study demonstrates that Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts are highly effective for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to produce succinic anhydride, and for the direct conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid.

The research employs several methodologies to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process:

1. Catalyst preparation: Various supports (HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3, etc.) were used to prepare Ni monometallic and Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts.

2. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to analyze the catalysts' properties.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: The effects of reaction temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) were studied to determine optimal conditions.

4. Comparative studies: Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were compared to understand the synergistic effects of Pt-Ni combination.

5. Low-temperature reactions: The ability to perform hydrogenation at temperatures as low as 40°C was explored, which is significant for energy efficiency and process economics.

6. Catalyst stability studies: Long-term performance tests were conducted to assess catalyst stability and deactivation mechanisms.

These methodologies allowed researchers to develop a highly efficient and stable Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst system that can operate at relatively low temperatures, achieving high conversion and selectivity for the production of valuable chemicals like succinic acid and its derivatives. This research demonstrates the potential for bimetallic catalysts to improve the efficiency and sustainability of industrial processes in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in biomass conversion.
