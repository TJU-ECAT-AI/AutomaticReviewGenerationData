[1] "PtNi bimetallic and Ni monometallic catalysts supported on HYAl2O3, HXAl2O3, ZSM-5Al2O3, USYAl2O3, BetaAl2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared and evaluated for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the temperature range of 40150 C."

[2] "Adding a small amount of Pt (0.5) to the Ni (5%)/Al2O3HY catalyst that is effective for increasing the selectivity and activity."

[3] "We also found that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C."

[4] "Unlike the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, the reaction is to hydrogenate the C=C bond of maleic acid, accordingly H2O is not formed."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and potentially cellulosic biomass conversion. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride and maleic acid, which are important precursors in the production of valuable chemicals like succinic anhydride and succinic acid.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employed several methodologies:

1. Catalyst preparation: Various supports (HY-Al2O3, HX-Al2O3, ZSM-5-Al2O3, USY-Al2O3, Beta-Al2O3, and Al2O3) were used to prepare Pt-Ni bimetallic and Ni monometallic catalysts.

2. Characterization techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to analyze the catalysts' structure and reduction properties.

3. Reaction parameter optimization: The effects of reaction temperature, pressure, and weighted hourly space velocity (WHSV) on catalyst performance were investigated.

4. Comparative studies: The performance of bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts was compared with monometallic Ni catalysts to demonstrate the synergistic effect of the bimetallic system.

5. Low-temperature reactions: The ability of Pt-Ni catalysts to perform hydrogenation reactions at temperatures as low as 40°C was explored, which is particularly valuable for energy-efficient processes.

6. One-pot conversion: The direct conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid was achieved using the Pt-Ni catalyst, demonstrating its versatility in different reaction systems.

These methodologies allowed researchers to develop a highly efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenation of C=O and C=C bonds, with potential applications in the production of valuable chemicals under mild conditions. The study highlights the importance of catalyst design, support selection, and reaction condition optimization in achieving high selectivity and efficiency in hydrogenation reactions.
