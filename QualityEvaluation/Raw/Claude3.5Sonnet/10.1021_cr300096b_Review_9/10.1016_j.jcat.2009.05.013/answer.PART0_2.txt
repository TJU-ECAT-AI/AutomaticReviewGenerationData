[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[3] "The addition of Fe shifts the reaction selectivity toward the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols, suggesting that the role of Fe is to facilitate the di-σCO coordination of citral and, therefore, ease the activation of the CO bond."

[4] "Extended Hckel calculations performed for the Pt80Fe20 surface alloy show, for example, that the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt decreases the probability of the di-σCC adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on Pt, making the di-σCO adsorption mode the predominant one"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to various industrial applications by enabling the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in fine chemical synthesis. The hydrogenation of citral is often used as a model reaction to study this process due to its multiple reactive sites.

To optimize and enhance selectivity, researchers employ both experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, they study how adding a second metal like Fe to Pt affects reaction selectivity. The addition of Fe was found to shift selectivity towards unsaturated alcohol formation by facilitating the di-σCO adsorption mode of the aldehyde.

Theoretically, extended Hückel calculations are used to understand how electronic effects in bimetallic alloys influence adsorption modes and reactivity. For example, calculations on Pt-Fe alloys showed that electron transfer from Fe to Pt decreases CC bond adsorption and favors CO bond adsorption, explaining the improved selectivity.

By combining experimental studies of real catalysts with theoretical modeling of electronic effects, researchers can gain insights to rationally design more selective and efficient bimetallic catalysts for C=O hydrogenation reactions relevant to fine chemical and biomass conversion applications.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Fe系统)进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业应用做出贡献,通过实现不饱和醇的选择性形成,这些不饱和醇是精细化学品合成中的重要中间体。柠檬醛的加氢反应由于其多个反应位点,经常被用作研究这一过程的模型反应。

为了优化和提高选择性,研究人员采用实验和理论相结合的方法。在实验方面,他们研究了向Pt中添加第二种金属(如Fe)如何影响反应选择性。研究发现,添加Fe通过促进醛的di-σCO吸附模式,使选择性转向不饱和醇的形成。

在理论方面,使用扩展Hückel计算来理解双金属合金中的电子效应如何影响吸附模式和反应活性。例如,对Pt-Fe合金的计算表明,从Fe到Pt的电子转移减少了C=C键的吸附,有利于C=O键的吸附,这解释了选择性的改善。

通过将实际催化剂的实验研究与电子效应的理论建模相结合,研究人员可以获得洞见,从而理性设计出更具选择性和效率的双金属催化剂,用于与精细化学品和生物质转化应用相关的C=O加氢反应。
