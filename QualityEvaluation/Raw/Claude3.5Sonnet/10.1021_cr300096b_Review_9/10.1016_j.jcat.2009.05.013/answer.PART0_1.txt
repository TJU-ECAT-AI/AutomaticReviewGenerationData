[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[3] "The addition of Fe improves the selectivity of the reaction toward unsaturated alcohols."

[4] "Extended Hckel calculations performed for the Pt80Fe20 surface alloy show, for example, that the transfer of electron density from Fe to Pt decreases the probability of the di-σCC adsorption mode for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on Pt, making the di-σCO adsorption mode the predominant one"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to industrial applications by selectively producing unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates. While the document does not specifically mention Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion, it does discuss the hydrogenation of citral as a model reaction for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

Methodologies employed to study and optimize this process include:

1. Using model reactions like citral hydrogenation to test catalyst performance
2. Varying the composition of bimetallic catalysts (e.g., different Pt/Fe ratios) 
3. Characterizing catalysts using techniques such as HRTEM, FTIR, XANES, and EXAFS
4. Measuring product selectivity and conversion rates
5. Theoretical calculations (e.g., Extended Hückel) to understand electronic effects

The efficiency and selectivity of the process are enhanced by:

1. Adding a second metal (Fe) to Pt, which improves selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols
2. Optimizing the ratio of metals in the bimetallic catalyst
3. Exploiting electronic effects, such as electron transfer from Fe to Pt
4. Creating new adsorption sites that favor the desired reaction pathway (di-σCO mode)

While the document focuses on Pt-Fe catalysts rather than Pt-Ni, the general principles and methodologies described could likely be applied to other bimetallic systems for similar hydrogenation reactions.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Fe系统)进行C=O键的催化氢化对工业应用有贡献,可以选择性地生产不饱和醇,这是重要的中间体。虽然文档没有特别提到Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化,但确实讨论了柠檬醛的氢化作为α,β-不饱和醛的模型反应。

用于研究和优化这一过程的方法包括:

1. 使用模型反应(如柠檬醛氢化)来测试催化剂性能
2. 改变双金属催化剂的组成(例如,不同的Pt/Fe比例)
3. 使用HRTEM、FTIR、XANES和EXAFS等技术表征催化剂
4. 测量产品选择性和转化率
5. 理论计算(如扩展休克尔法)以理解电子效应

通过以下方式提高过程的效率和选择性:

1. 向Pt中添加第二种金属(Fe),提高对不饱和醇的选择性
2. 优化双金属催化剂中金属的比例
3. 利用电子效应,如Fe向Pt的电子转移
4. 创造有利于所需反应途径(di-σCO模式)的新吸附位点

虽然文档主要关注Pt-Fe催化剂而非Pt-Ni,但所描述的一般原理和方法可能适用于其他双金属系统的类似氢化反应。
