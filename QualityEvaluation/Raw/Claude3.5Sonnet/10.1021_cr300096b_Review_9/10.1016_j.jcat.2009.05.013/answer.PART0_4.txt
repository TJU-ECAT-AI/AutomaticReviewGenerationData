The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to industrial applications by producing unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in various industries. While the literature doesn't specifically mention Pt-Ni systems, it discusses Pt-Fe catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes like citral.

To study and optimize this process, researchers use test reactions like citral hydrogenation, which contains both C=O and C=C bonds. They examine how adding a second metal (Fe in this case) to Pt catalysts affects selectivity and efficiency. The addition of Fe was found to improve selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols.

Methodologies employed include varying the composition of bimetallic catalysts and analyzing the resulting changes in selectivity and activity. Researchers also investigate the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts using techniques like FTIR, EXAFS, and XANES to understand how the second metal modifies the properties of Pt.

The efficiency and selectivity enhancement is attributed to factors such as the creation of new Lewis sites (Fe cations) near Pt atoms and electronic modifications of Pt by Fe. These changes are thought to favor the adsorption of C=O groups over C=C groups, leading to improved selectivity for unsaturated alcohol formation.

While the document doesn't discuss theoretical approaches or cellulosic biomass conversion, it demonstrates how experimental studies on model reactions are used to gain insights into the fundamental aspects of selective C=O hydrogenation using bimetallic catalysts.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Fe系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对工业应用有重要贡献，因为它可以生产不饱和醇，这是各种行业的重要中间体。虽然文献没有具体提到Pt-Ni系统，但它讨论了Pt-Fe催化剂在α,β-不饱和醛（如香茅醛）选择性氢化中的应用。

为了研究和优化这一过程，研究人员使用如香茅醛氢化这样的测试反应，该反应同时包含C=O和C=C键。他们考察了向Pt催化剂中添加第二种金属（在本例中为Fe）如何影响选择性和效率。研究发现，添加Fe可以提高对不饱和醇的选择性。

采用的方法包括改变双金属催化剂的组成，并分析由此产生的选择性和活性变化。研究人员还使用FTIR、EXAFS和XANES等技术研究催化剂的电子和结构性质，以了解第二种金属如何改变Pt的性质。

效率和选择性的提高归因于诸如在Pt原子附近创建新的路易斯位点（Fe阳离子）以及Fe对Pt的电子修饰等因素。这些变化被认为有利于C=O基团的吸附而不是C=C基团，从而提高了不饱和醇形成的选择性。

虽然该文档没有讨论理论方法或纤维素生物质转化，但它展示了如何通过对模型反应的实验研究来深入了解使用双金属催化剂进行选择性C=O氢化的基本方面。
