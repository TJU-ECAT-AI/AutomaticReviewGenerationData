[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[3] "Citronellal and α,β-unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol) were the main products formed over the Pt/SiO2 and PtFe/SiO2 catalysts under our experimental conditions."

[4] "The addition of Fe improves the selectivity of the reaction toward unsaturated alcohols."

[5] "The adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on metal surfaces is believed to occur through three different modes: (1) exclusively through the CC group (i.e. di-σCC); (2) exclusively through the CO group (i.e. di-σCO); and (3) through both the CO and CC groups (i.e. η4)"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes significantly to industrial applications by enabling the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in fine chemical synthesis. While the document does not specifically mention cellulosic biomass conversion, it does discuss the hydrogenation of citral as a model reaction for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

To study and optimize this process, researchers employ various methodologies:

1. Model reactions: Using citral hydrogenation as a test reaction due to its multiple functional groups.

2. Catalyst design: Developing bimetallic catalysts (e.g., PtFe/SiO2) to improve selectivity and efficiency.

3. Product analysis: Monitoring the formation of different products (e.g., citronellal, nerol, geraniol) to assess selectivity.

4. Mechanistic studies: Investigating adsorption modes (di-σCC, di-σCO, η4) to understand reaction pathways.

5. Characterization techniques: Employing HRTEM, FTIR, XANES, and EXAFS to study catalyst structure and properties.

6. Performance evaluation: Analyzing conversion rates and product selectivities as a function of catalyst composition.

These methods help researchers enhance the selectivity and efficiency of C=O bond hydrogenation by optimizing catalyst composition, understanding electronic effects between metals, and identifying favorable adsorption modes for desired products.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Fe系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对工业应用做出了重大贡献，它能选择性地形成不饱和醇，这是精细化学品合成中的重要中间体。虽然文献没有特别提到纤维素生物质转化，但确实讨论了柠檬醛的氢化作为α,β-不饱和醛的模型反应。

为了研究和优化这个过程，研究人员采用了各种方法：

1. 模型反应：使用柠檬醛氢化作为测试反应，因为它具有多个功能基团。

2. 催化剂设计：开发双金属催化剂（如PtFe/SiO2）以提高选择性和效率。

3. 产品分析：监测不同产品（如香叶醛、橙花醇、香叶醇）的形成，以评估选择性。

4. 机理研究：研究吸附模式（di-σCC、di-σCO、η4）以了解反应途径。

5. 表征技术：使用HRTEM、FTIR、XANES和EXAFS研究催化剂结构和性质。
