The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to various industrial applications by enabling the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in fine chemical synthesis. The hydrogenation of citral is often used as a model reaction to study this process due to its multiple reactive sites.

To optimize and enhance selectivity, researchers employ both experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, they study how adding a second metal like Fe to Pt affects reaction selectivity. The addition of Fe was found to shift selectivity towards unsaturated alcohol formation by facilitating the di-σCO adsorption mode of the aldehyde.

Theoretically, extended Hückel calculations are used to understand how electronic effects in bimetallic alloys influence adsorption modes and reactivity. For example, calculations on Pt-Fe alloys showed that electron transfer from Fe to Pt decreases CC bond adsorption and favors CO bond adsorption, explaining the improved selectivity.

By combining experimental studies of real catalysts with theoretical modeling of electronic effects, researchers can gain insights to rationally design more selective and efficient bimetallic catalysts for C=O hydrogenation reactions relevant to fine chemical and biomass conversion applications.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to industrial applications by producing unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in various industries. While the literature doesn't specifically mention Pt-Ni systems, it discusses Pt-Fe catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes like citral.

To study and optimize this process, researchers use test reactions like citral hydrogenation, which contains both C=O and C=C bonds. They examine how adding a second metal (Fe in this case) to Pt catalysts affects selectivity and efficiency. The addition of Fe was found to improve selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols.

Methodologies employed include varying the composition of bimetallic catalysts and analyzing the resulting changes in selectivity and activity. Researchers also investigate the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts using techniques like FTIR, EXAFS, and XANES to understand how the second metal modifies the properties of Pt.

The efficiency and selectivity enhancement is attributed to factors such as the creation of new Lewis sites (Fe cations) near Pt atoms and electronic modifications of Pt by Fe. These changes are thought to favor the adsorption of C=O groups over C=C groups, leading to improved selectivity for unsaturated alcohol formation.

While the document doesn't discuss theoretical approaches or cellulosic biomass conversion, it demonstrates how experimental studies on model reactions are used to gain insights into the fundamental aspects of selective C=O hydrogenation using bimetallic catalysts.
