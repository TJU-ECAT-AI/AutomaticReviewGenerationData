[1] "The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications"

[2] "The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule."

[3] "PtFe/SiO2 samples were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the oxidation of CO in air. This enhancement of the catalytic activity strongly depends on the degree of electronic interaction between the metals and the strength of CO adsorption."

[4] "Similarly, Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral. These promoting effects can be attributed to an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Fe systems contributes to various industrial applications by enabling the selective formation of unsaturated alcohols, which are important chemical intermediates. While the literature does not specifically mention Pt-Ni systems, it discusses Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts, which show enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The hydrogenation of citral is used as a model reaction to study the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. This reaction allows researchers to examine the selectivity towards C=O bond hydrogenation versus C=C bond hydrogenation.

To study and optimize the process, researchers employ various methodologies:

1. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as chemisorption, HRTEM, FTIR, XANES, and EXAFS are used to understand the structure and properties of the bimetallic catalysts.

2. Reaction studies: The catalysts are tested in model reactions like citral hydrogenation to evaluate their performance.

3. Electronic effects analysis: The influence of electronic interactions between metals on catalytic activity is examined.

4. Adsorption studies: The strength of reactant adsorption on catalyst surfaces is investigated to understand its impact on activity and selectivity.

The efficiency and selectivity of the process are enhanced by optimizing the bimetallic composition. For example, small concentrations of Fe are found to promote the activity of Pt for the selective hydrogenation of citral. This enhancement is attributed to electronic effects and/or the presence of bimetallic sites that favor the desired reaction pathway.

While the document does not explicitly discuss theoretical studies, the experimental approaches described provide insights into the fundamental aspects of bimetallic catalyst performance in C=O bond hydrogenation reactions.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Fe系统)进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业应用有贡献,因为它能够选择性地形成不饱和醇,这是重要的化学中间体。虽然文献没有具体提到Pt-Ni系统,但它讨论了Pt-Fe双金属催化剂,与单金属Pt催化剂相比,这些催化剂显示出增强的活性和选择性。

柠檬醛的氢化被用作研究α,β-不饱和醛选择性氢化的模型反应。这种反应允许研究人员检查C=O键氢化与C=C键氢化的选择性。

为了研究和优化这个过程,研究人员采用了各种方法:

1. 催化剂表征:使用化学吸附、HRTEM、FTIR、XANES和EXAFS等技术来理解双金属催化剂的结构和性质。

2. 反应研究:在柠檬醛氢化等模型反应中测试催化剂以评估其性能。

3. 电子效应分析:研究金属间电子相互作用对催化活性的影响。

4. 吸附研究:研究反应物在催化剂表面的吸附强度,以了解其对活性和选择性的影响。

通过优化双金属组成来提高过程的效率和选择性。例如,发现少量的Fe可以促进Pt对柠檬醛选择性氢化的活性。这种增强被归因于电子效应和/或有利于所需反应途径的双金属位点的存在。

虽然文档没有明确讨论理论研究,但所描述的实验方法为理解双金属催化剂在C=O键氢化反应中的基本性能方面提供了见解。
