Preparation of new type of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts for carbonyl activation
Abstract
The paper is aimed to demonstrate how the activity and selectivity of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst can be tailored by introduction of tin either to hydrogenate the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (UA) or oxidize carbon monoxide at room temperature. In this paper general aspects of catalyst design based on the use of tin tetraalkyls are described in detail. Results summarized in this work show that upon using new approaches for anchoring tin into platinum high Snanch/Pts can be achieved. The experimental evidences indicate also that the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and oxidation of CO requires in situ formed Sn4+Pt ensemble sites to activate either the carbonyl group or the CO molecule.
1. Introduction
1.1. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA)
The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA) is an important model reaction. In the presence of heterogeneous catalysts both the aldehyde and the olefinic double bond of UA can be hydrogenated
[1]
,
[2]
. It has been demonstrated that supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. With respect to the form of promoters in modified platinum catalysts the role of ionic species has been emphasized
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
. It has also been suggested that in supported Sn-Pt catalysts the Snn+carbonyl interaction is responsible for the increased SCO selectivity
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. This interaction, as shown in
Scheme 1
, requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface.

Scheme 1.
It should also be emphasized that in the selective hydrogenation of UA, in addition to the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, the adsorption of both the substrate and the formed crotylalcohol with their olefinic double bond should also be suppressed.
1.2. Low temperature CO oxidation
Pt/SiO2 catalysts are relatively inactive in low temperature (LT) oxidation of CO, however Pt/SnO2 or Pd/SnO2 catalysts appeared to be highly active
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
. In SnO2 supported catalysts a synergism between the oxide and the metal phases has been suggested
[9]
,
[10]
. The role of the formed SnPt alloy phase has also been proposed
[11]
. Recently, an alternative reaction mechanism has been put forward
[12]
suggesting the involvement of PtSnO2 interface in the activation of CO as shown in
Scheme 2

Scheme 2.
As emerges from
Scheme 1
,
Scheme 2
the activation of the CO molecule and the carbonyl group shows distinct similarities. In both cases the activation can be related to (i) the formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites and (ii) the perturbation of the CO molecule or the carbonyl group by Sn4+ sites formed. In Pt/SnO2 catalysts these sites can be found at the perimeter of the Pt nanocluster, while in the supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts these sites have to be formed in situ at the surface of the SnPt nanocluster.
1.3. Preparation of supported Sn-Pt catalysts
Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled.
However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained. The surface chemistry involved in the two-step tin anchoring can be written as follows
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
:
(1)
(2)
In reaction (1) hydrogen adsorbed on platinum reacts with tin tetraalkyls resulting in the formation of a primary surface complexes (PSC). The latter is decomposed in hydrogen atmosphere with the formation of stabilized bimetallic species (SBS; reaction (2)). As emerges from our earlier results this approach has a definite insufficiency, i.e. the amount of tin anchored (Snanch) is strongly hindered. It is due to (i) the limited number of surface platinum atoms (Pts) available for anchoring and (ii) steric hindrance created by the extent of the alkyl groups in PSC. Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively
[14]
,
[15]
. In summary, upon using CSRs supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters can be obtained and under optimized conditions the introduction of tin into the support can almost completely be avoided
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
.
Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. In this approach, due to the use of high initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, high Snanch/Ms ratios (M=Rh, Pt, etc.) were obtained, but a definite amount of tin was also introduced into the support.
1.4. The aim of this work
Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and modification
The dispersion of the parent Pt/SiO2 catalyst was 0.52 measured by hydrogen chemisorption. Additional properties can be found elsewhere
[17]
.
In this study our two-step tin anchoring has been applied, which consists of: (i) tin anchoring (step 1), and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (step 2). Details on the preparation can be found elsewhere

. The tin anchoring reaction was monitored for 1.57 h by determining the amount of C2H6, C2H4 or CH4 formed, respectively. In separate series of experiments in the 40th minute of tin anchoring, 20 cm3/gcat oxygen was introduced into the reactor (this amount corresponded to O/Pts=20). After step 1 the catalyst was washed four times with benzene and three times with n-hexane at 50 C followed by drying in vacuum (at 5 Torr) at 50 C for 1 h. Three different approaches were used in step 1 to control the Snanch/Pts ratio: (i) preparation in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen (catalysts type (I)), (ii) preparation in excess hydrogen (catalysts type (II)), and (iii) preparation in the presence of small amount of oxygen (catalysts type (III)).
Step 2 was carried out in hydrogen atmosphere by temperature programmed reaction (TPR) technique resulting in alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts
[16]
,
[17]
. The amount of hydrocarbons formed in steps 1 and 2, (nI and nII in mol/gcat, respectively) were determined by GC allowing to obtain full material balance of tin anchoring. Based on the overall material balance the stoichiometry of tin anchoring, i.e. the value of x(x=4nI/(nI+nII)), and the amount of tin anchored was calculated. The tin content of modified Pt/SiO2 catalysts determined by AAS was in good agreement with that of calculated from the overall material balance.
2.2. Hydrogenation reactions
2.2.1. Gas-phase reaction
The gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (CA) was studied under atmospheric pressure at 6080 C as described elsewhere
[8]
.
2.2.2. Liquid-phase hydrogenation
CA, cinnamaldehyde and methyl vinyl ketone was hydrogenated in stirred SS autoclaves in the pressure range of 240 bar and temperature range of 4080 C. The catalysts were re-reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at 300 C for 1.5 h. Special care was taken to prevent the contact of the preactivated catalysts with air. All solvents used were carefully deoxygenated. Analysis of the reaction products was similar as in the gas-phase hydrogenation
[8]
.
2.3. CO oxidation
TPR technique (heating rate=5 C/min, temperature ramp from 30 to 300 C) was used to study the oxidation of CO with oxygen. A 0.150 g catalyst was applied using a gas mixture of CO and oxygen in helium. The partial pressure of CO and O2 was in the range of 1679 Torr, and 40 Torr, respectively. The TPR curves were monitored recording the m/e=28, 32, and 44 signals of CO and oxygen consumed and CO2 formed, respectively. Prior to the reaction the catalysts were re-reduced at 340 C for 1 h in a hydrogen atmosphere and cooled down to 30 C in helium.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Monolayer formation of primary surface complex
The monolayer formation of PSC (equals to Snanch/Pts ratio=0.350.45) using Pt/Al2O3 parent catalysts has been discussed in our previous studies
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
. Selected results on this Pt/SiO2 catalyst leading to the monolayer coverage of PSC are summarized in
Table 1
. These data show that both the rate of formation of PSC and the Snanch/Pts ratio is proportional to the [Sn]0/Pts ratio, however the stoichiometry of surface reaction (1) (see x values in
Table 1
) is almost independent of the [Sn]0/Pts ratio.

The decomposition of PSCs is shown in
Fig. 1
AC. These results show that increasing the amount of tin anchored leads to a slight broadening of the TPR peak between 50 and 100 C. The deconvolution shows that under monolayer coverage the TPR curve contains three main TPR peaks. The narrow peak around 2025 C is attributed to PSC formed on kink and corner sites, while the two other peaks around 40 and 75 C were ascribed to the formation of PSC on plain Pt sites. The sample with Snanch/Pts ratio=0.39 had also a low intensity peak around 110 C, which can be assigned to the formation of new type of surface species

3.2. Preliminary catalytic test in gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde
Preliminary catalytic results in the hydrogenation of CA using Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio below the monolayer coverage are given in
Table 2
. These results show that the introduction of tin onto Pt/SiO2 resulted in a significant increase in the overall activity and a slight increase in the selectivity of crotylalcohol (UOL; SCO). Results presented in
Table 2
indicate the lack of hydrogenation of butyraldehyde (SAL) to butylalcohol (SOL) over the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. This observation indicates that under currently used mild condition the Pt sites alone cannot activate the carbonyl group. This activation requires Snn+Pt ensemble sites.

We consider that both the activation of the carbonyl groups and the suppression of the adsorption of the substrate molecule with its olefinic double bond requires more tin atoms on the Pt surface. Consequently, our further studies were aimed to increase the amount of tin anchored to the platinum.
3.3. Development of a new concept of tin anchoring
The increase of the amount of tin introduced onto the platinum required new approaches and exact answers to the following questions: (i) How to increase the amount of tin introduced onto platinum without its introduction onto the support? (ii) Is it possible to create a second or multiple layer of tin organic moieties at the top of the PSC? (iii) How to make PSC as a landing site for additional amount of SnR4?
Scheme 3
shows the view of PSCs formed over supported platinum and the possible transformation of PSCs either in excess hydrogen (route 1) or tin tetraalkyls (route 2).

Scheme 3.
The material balance of tin anchoring indicates (see
Table 1
) that under monolayer coverage of platinum by PSC the average value of x, is around 1.5. This fact indicates that Pt nanoclusters are covered by SnR3 and SnR2 moieties formed in 1:1 ratio. We suggest that all anchored surface organometallic species with general formula of SnR(4x) and x>1 can be considered as coordinatively unsaturated primary surface complex (CUPSC).
Any new approach aimed to increase the tin coverage requires creation of new sites for tin anchoring. The CUPSC has been suggested, as one of these new sites, which can be used to anchor additional amount of tin tetraalkyls. It has also been proposed that in excess hydrogen the extent of coordinative unsaturation can further be increased as under this condition the rate of the hydrogenolysis of the SnC bond in CUPSC is enhanced. This should be reflected in the increased values of x. This way in excess hydrogen all primary formed tin alkyl moieties shall lose additional alkyl groups creating new coordinatively unsaturated sites required for tin anchoring (see route 1).
As a net result, in the presence of excess tin tetraalkyls the chance to get higher Snanch/Pts ratios increases when the tin anchoring reactions are carried out in excess hydrogen. Consequently, in order to obtain Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios, route 1 seems to be more favorable than route 2.
New types of tin anchoring sites can also be created when both PSCs and CUPSCs are mildly oxidized and surface species with general formula of SnaRbOc are formed. In this case, as shown in
Scheme 4
, the lone pair electrons of oxygen atom in SnaRbOc moieties will be involved in tin anchoring. However, in this approach due to the (i) low extent of coordinative unsaturation, and (ii) relatively large amount of SnR4 anchored to oxygen atoms, the value of x should be relatively small (x<1).

3.4. Comparison of tin anchoring in excess hydrogen and in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen
Results obtained both in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen and excess hydrogen are summarized in
Table 3
. As emerges from these results in excess hydrogen both the rate of tin anchoring and the values of x are much higher than in its absence (compare W0 and x values in
Table 3
for experiments 16 and experiments 712). These facts indicate that excess hydrogen strongly influences both the rate of tin anchoring and the amount of alkyl groups reacted. Consequently, in excess hydrogen the extent of coordinative unsaturation increases. Therefore, the formation of the surface complex in the second layer (SCSL) with the involvement of CUPSC can be written as follows:
(3)
In the presence of hydrogen the loss of alkyl groups in SCSL can also take place leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated SCSL (CUSCSL, with x1,x2>x):
(4)
The formed CUSCSL reacts further with additional amount of tin tetraalkyl to form multilayered surface complex (MLSC (I)):
(5)
In reactions (3)(5) the driving force for tin anchoring is (i) the coordinative unsaturation of the surface organometallic complexes and (ii) the high initial concentration of tin tetraethyl.

Further increase of the rate of reactions (3)(5) can be achieved by replacing Sn(C2H5)4 with Sn(CH3)4. The use of Sn(CH3)4 resulted in pronounced increase in the Snanch/Pts ratio (0.82 versus 1.22, compare experiments 8 and 9 in
Table 3
). These results also show that upon using Sn(CH3)4 in excess hydrogen all amount of tin introduced has been anchored.
SCSL and MLSC formed in the presence of excess hydrogen can be decomposed in hydrogen with the formation of SBS. However, due to the increased amount of tin organometallic moieties the decomposition pattern of MLSC (I) is relatively complex as is shown in
Fig. 2
, where the decomposition pattern of MLSC (I) obtained both in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen (sample A) and excess hydrogen (sample B) are compared. In sample B the intensities of the low temperature TPR peaks, corresponding to the monolayer coverage (see TPR peaks at 25, 40, and 75 C), are relatively low, however TPR peaks around 150 C have high intensities. Contrary to that in sample A the TPR peak around 150 C has a very low intensity. This fact indicates that in sample A the formation of the MLSC is less pronounced than in sample B. The observed alterations in the TPR pattern indicate that excess hydrogen strongly enhances the formation of MLSC, resulting in high Snanch/Pts ratios. The lack of TPR peaks above 200 C, indicates also that no tin has been introduced onto the support

The comparison of the TPR pattern given in
Fig. 1
,
Fig. 2
clearly shows the build-up of the second layer for samples prepared in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen. The TPR peaks around 120 and 150 C, which were not observed under monolayer coverage, have relatively high intensities (see
Fig. 2
A), consequently these TPR peaks can be related to the formation of MLSC.
The increase of tin anchoring time can also be used to enhance the amount of tin anchored. The TPR pattern of two different samples is shown in
Fig. 3
A and B. The comparison of these two samples shows how the increase of tin anchoring time enhances the formation of MLSC. However, in sample B the intensity of TPR peaks around and above 200 C is not negligible (see
Fig. 3
B). This fact indicates that the prolonged time of tin anchoring leads to the introduction of small portion of tin into the support as well.

Conditions of tin anchoring: (A) duration of tin anchoring, 150 min (sample A, [Sn]0/Pts=9.83 (Snanch/Pts=1.15); (B) duration of tin anchoring, 420 min (sample B, [Sn]0/Pts=9.20 (Snanch/Pts=2.35)). Tin anchoring in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen at 50 C.
Summing up these results it can be concluded that in excess hydrogen and under identical experimental condition of tin anchoring both the overall rate of tin anchoring and the Snanch/Pts values are much higher than in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen.
3.5. Tin anchoring in the presence of oxygen
In the absence of oxygen, when Pt is fully reduced and Sn(C2H5)4 is used as tin precursor compound, the formation of ethylene during tin anchoring is negligible
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[17]
. However, in the presence of small amount of oxygen or slight oxidation of platinum (or incomplete reduction of platinum) formation of ethylene from Sn(C2H5)4 has been observed
[24]
. The appearance of ethylene has been attributed to the following surface reaction
[24]
:
(6)
Reaction (6), with the formation of ethylene, takes place if the oxidation of platinum precedes the addition of Sn(C2H5)4. In this reaction the hydrogen of the ethyl group is used to remove the oxygen from the Pt surface.
Similar surface reaction, i.e. the formation of ethylene can be expected if the formed PSC is mildly oxidized to form oxidized surface organotin complex (OSOC) with general formula of SnaRbOc (see
Scheme 4
). It is suggested that upon introducing oxygen during the tin anchoring reaction the formation of chemisorbed oxygen takes place over kink and corner sites of platinum not covered by PSC. The oxygen is spilled over to PSC resulting in OSOC. We suggest that the lone pair electrons of oxygen atom in OSOC are involved in the tin anchoring step (see
Scheme 4
).
As shown in
Fig. 4
A the addition of oxygen leads to the immediate formation of ethylene. The formation of ethylene indicates that the character of surface reaction has completely been altered. We propose that in the presence of oxygen the build-up of the second and subsequent layers can be written as follows:
(7)
(8)
In reaction (7) oxygen-containing multilayer surface complexes (OMLSC) are formed, which instantaneously react with the formation of ethylene and MLSC (II). Since the rate of surface reaction (6) is much less than that of surface reactions (7) and (8) it is not recommended to add oxygen prior to the introduction of Sn(C2H5)4. We prefer to add oxygen after the completion of the monolayer coverage of tin organic moieties.

Conditions of tin anchoring: Tr=50 C, [Sn]0/Pts=1.72 (Snanch/Pts=0.88), 20 cm3 O2 added in the 50th minute. The arrow indicates the moment of addition of oxygen; (B) TPR pattern of the decomposition of surface complexes formed in the absence of hydrogen: () [Sn]0/Pts=1.58 (Snanch/Pts=0.39) and in the presence of added oxygen: () [Sn]0/Pts=1.72 (Snanch/Pts=0.88).
The decomposition of MLSC formed in the absence and presence of oxygen is shown in
Fig. 4
B. The comparison of these TPR results clearly demonstrates the build-up of the multilayer. In the absence of oxygen under similar experimental condition a monolayer coverage has been obtained (Snanch/Pts=0.39), while the addition of oxygen resulted in an increase of this ratio to 0.88. In this way the efficiency of tin anchoring sufficiently increased.
3.6. Summary of new approaches of tin anchoring
Results of tin anchoring obtained (i) in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen, (ii) in excess hydrogen, and (iii) in the presence of small amount of oxygen strongly indicate (see
Table 3
) that under favorable experimental conditions the Snanch/Pts ratio strongly exceeds the monolayer coverage. In these experiments it was interesting to compare the value of x, i.e. the number related to the coordinative unsaturation of tin-containing surface organometallic moieties. These results are shown in
Fig. 5
. The highest extent of coordinative unsaturation has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen. The surface chemistry described in reactions (3)(5) indicated that the increase of the Snanch/Pts ratio should result in a decrease of the value of x. Indeed, the value of x linearly depended on the amount of tin anchored, and the highest x values were obtained at low Snanch/Pts ratio. It is suggested that these samples should contain naked tin, i.e. SnR(4x) moieties with x=4.

In the absence of gas-phase hydrogen upon increasing the Snanch/Pts ratio the value of x decreases from 1.5 to 1.0 and levels off at this value. This change also reflects the formation of multilayered surface entities.
In the presence of small amount of oxygen the value of x is nearly constant and x<1. The obtained mean value of x (xmean=0.78) roughly corresponds to the stoichiometry given in
Scheme 4
. As emerges from results summarized in
Table 3
the addition of small amount of oxygen leads to high Snanch/Pts ratios even at relatively low [Sn]0/Pts ratios.
In the presence of excess hydrogen in order to reach Snanch/Pts=2.9 the [Sn]0/Pts ratio should be 32.6, while in the presence of small amount of oxygen this ratio was reached at [Sn]0/Pts=8.5 (compare experiments 12 and 16). Consequently, in the presence of small amount of oxygen the efficiency of tin anchoring increases significantly.
Results presented in
Table 3
indicate that the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially under the following experimental conditions of tin anchoring: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) prolonged reaction time; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) addition of oxygen during tin anchoring.
With respect to these results one important fact should be further discussed. The increase of the concentration of tin tetraalkyls in the solution also leads to an increased rate of adsorption of tin tetraalkyl onto the support. The adsorbed Sn(C2H5)4 can be washed out from the support by a solvent. However, there is a certain concentration limit for the use of Sn(C2H5)4. Upon using our Pt/SiO2 catalyst the concentration limit expressed in [Sn]0/Pts ratio was around 10. Above this limit the wash out procedure was not complete. The TPR curves of modified catalysts formed under this experimental condition revealed the presence of adsorbed Sn(C2H5)4, i.e. in these samples high temperature TPR peaks around 200 C and above were always observed. Consequently, in our further studies these experimental conditions were avoided. For this reason we consider that in other approaches using tin tetraalkyls in high concentration, but without washing out of the unreacted tin precursor

the partial introduction of tin into the support is unavoidable.

shows the dependence of the UOL selectivities on the conversion. These results show the evident role of tin in the improvement of SCO selectivity. Over catalyst with Snanch/Pts=2.9 the high SCO selectivities around 60% were maintained up to 50% conversion. Consequently, in the presence of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratio not only the activation of the carbonyl group can be achieved, but the suppression of the hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated alcohol as well.

show that the introduction of tin leads to significant increase of both the rate and the SCO selectivity. At 60 C the highest selectivity of crotylalcohol was around 90%. This value is the highest one ever reported for this reaction on modified supported Pt catalysts. All Sn-Pt/SiO2 are highly active, even the activity of that one with Snanch/Pts=2.5 was slightly higher than that of the parent Pt/SiO2.
The increased activity over Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can partly be attributed to (i) the carbonyl activation by ionic forms of tin in the atomic closeness of platinum

, and (ii) the decrease of CO poisoning. Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO

. The parent Pt/SiO2 catalyst showed moderate activity and low SCO selectivity. The introduction of tin strongly increased both the rate and the SCO selectivity. In the liquid-phase notable selectivity increase has been achieved over catalyst with tin content below monolayer coverage of SnR(4x). The highest SCO selectivities were measured in the range of Snanch/Pts ratio between 1.0 and 1.4. However, further increase of the Snanch/Pts ratio led to very pronounced decrease of the overall reaction rate. Catalysts with Snanch/Pts>2 were practically inactive in the liquid-phase at 40 C. The highest SCO selectivity was slightly above 50% and it passed through a maximum with the Snanch/Pts ratio. This selectivity value could be maintained up to 50% conversion.

Characteristic behavior of this reaction is the increase in SCO selectivity as the reaction proceeds. The initial SCO selectivity was around 35%. This increase was also observed when the catalyst was reused without its contact to air. It is interesting to note that the increasing part in the SCO selectivityconversion dependence was maintained when Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst activated in the gas-phase hydrogenation was transferred into the liquid-phase reactor and used in liquid-phase hydrogenation. We attribute the increase of the SCO selectivity with conversion to the in situ formation of Sn4+ sites. We suggest that the moderate selectivity in the liquid-phase hydrogenation is due to the hindrance of the in situ formation of Sn4+ sites under conditions of liquid-phase hydrogenation.
3.7.2.2. Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde
Results obtained in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde are summarized in
Table 6
. In this reaction similar trend has been observed as in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA, i.e. the introduction of tin strongly increased the reaction rate and led to a very pronounced selectivity increase. It is interesting to note that the parent Pt/SiO2 catalyst showed relatively high selectivity, what was increased further by introduction of tin. The highest selectivity measured in this reaction was 96% at 10% conversion. Data also show that the hydrogen pressure had a positive effect on the rates, however it did not influence the high SCO selectivity at all. In this reaction the SCO selectivityconversion dependence showed also an increasing part. The initial SCO selectivity was around 8285%.

3.7.2.3. Hydrogenation of methyl vinyl ketone
The selective hydrogenation of the keto group in methyl vinyl ketone is considered to be a great challenge. The lack of positive results in this reaction can be attributed to (i) the steric hindrance of alkyl groups
[6]
,
[7]
, and (ii) the decreased reactivity of the keto carbonyl group compared to the aldehyde one.
Preliminary results obtained in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of methyl vinyl ketone over a Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Snanch/Pts=1.43) are shown in
Fig. 7
. No UOL formation was observed on the parent catalyst. As emerges from these results the SCO selectivity is very low and decreases upon increasing conversion. However, the use of catalyst treated previously with crotonaldehyde/hydrogen mixture in gas-phase resulted in a slight increase in the selectivity values. This increase was more pronounced at conversions below 10%, and it was maintained in the whole conversion range. This behavior was reproducible, however experimental conditions of the treatment (i.e. duration, crotonaldehyde concentration and temperature) had no measurable influence on the selectivity improvement.

Initial concentration of the substrate=120 mmol/gcat; reaction temperature=40 C; catalysts type (III) (Snanch/Pts=1.43), 80 mg. Pretreatment temperature in hydrogen at 300 C, pretreatment with crotonaldehyde at 80 C for 1 h, gas-phase concentration of crotonaldehyde=0.64 mmol/dm3.
Despite the modest results obtained in this reaction the slight increase of SCO selectivity strongly indicates the involvement of ionic forms of tin formed during the treatment with crotonaldehyde. However, the ionic forms of tin have no sufficient strength for the activation of the keto carbonyl group.
3.8. Catalytic tests in low temperature CO oxidation
The oxidation of CO has been investigated in the temperature range between 30 and 300 C by TPR technique. This reaction has been investigated at two carbon monoxide pressure levels, while keeping the oxygen partial pressure constant at 40 Torr. The temperature, at which 50% conversion of CO has been achieved (T50) was used to compare the activity of the catalysts. Results on CO oxidation are summarized in
Table 7
. As emerges from these results the addition of tin has a very pronounced effect on the activity of the catalysts. Consequently, these results strongly demonstrate the role of tin in the activation of carbon monoxide. Due to this activation the oxidation of CO over Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts takes place at much lower temperature than over the parent Pt/SiO2.

The behavior of catalysts shows a very pronounced dependence on the CO partial pressure. At higher CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.81.2, while at low CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.40.5 had the highest activity. At low CO partial pressure some of the bimetallic catalysts were highly active and measurable conversion was obtained even at 30 C.
The surface of the Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst appeared to be sensitive for oxygen. When a Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Snanch/Pts=0.92) was tested under time on stream condition for 1 h at room temperature followed by a TPR experiment as described, the T50 value increased from 24 to 82 C. However, the hydrogen treatment at 300 C for 1 h completely restored the original activity of the Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst (T50=24 C). Similar activity change, i.e. the increase of T50 value to 75 C has been observed when the repeated second TPR run was performed without any treatment in hydrogen. These experiments indicate that undesired surface reconstruction takes place during the catalytic reaction. Further experiments indicated that the exposure of the catalysts to oxygen, especially at temperatures above 60 C strongly enhances this surface reconstruction resulting in almost inactive Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalyst in the room temperature oxidation of CO.
4. Summary
Results presented in this study clearly show that Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by tin anchoring can be used either to hydrogenate selectively both crotonaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols or oxidize CO at low temperature. The selectivity for carbonyl hydrogenation strongly depends on the Snanch/Pts ratios and high SCO selectivities can be obtained at relatively high Snanch/Pts ratios, however for all reactions studied the Snanch/Pts ratios have an optimum value.
Similar observation has been obtained in LT CO oxidation, however in this reaction the optimum Snanch/Pts ratio showed a pronounced dependence on the CO partial pressure, too.
In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3. Tin anchored this way appears in the form of a multilayer. In our earlier study it has also been shown that the formation of organotin layers on the platinum surface takes place layer by layer
[17]
. This study provides further proofs for this build-up process.
The Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts prepared this way show a unique property: the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites. The experimental evidences indicate that these ensemble sites are involved in the activation of both the carbonyl groups of different substrates and the CO molecule. Further proof for the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites by FT-IR and Mssbauer spectroscopy can be found elsewhere
