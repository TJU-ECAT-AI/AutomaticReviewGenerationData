[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (96–98%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group. Those studies revealed that in the bimetallic systems, there is a convergence of geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increase of the electron density of Pt) effects, due to the presence of Sn, which modifies the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. 

In this study, bimetallic PtSn catalysts were used for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in the liquid phase. Furfuryl alcohol has wide applications in the chemical industry, including as an additive or solvent in resin production, and as a chemical intermediate for manufacturing various products like lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, and dispersing agents.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based systems was found to lead to more efficient catalysts for hydrogenating unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts showed high selectivity (96-98%) for furfuryl alcohol production.

To study and optimize this process, various methodologies were employed across theoretical and experimental domains. These included:

1. Controlled surface reactions to prepare bimetallic catalysts with different tin contents.
2. Characterization techniques such as EXAFS, XANES, and XPS to understand the geometric and electronic effects of adding Sn to Pt catalysts.
3. Catalyst testing in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions to evaluate activity, selectivity, and stability.
4. Investigation of solvent effects on reaction kinetics and product distribution.

The research revealed that the presence of Sn in the bimetallic systems leads to both geometric (dilution of Pt sites) and electronic (increased electron density of Pt) effects, which modify the characteristics of the base Pt catalyst. These modifications contribute to the enhanced efficiency and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts in C=O bond hydrogenation.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Sn系统）进行C=O键的催化加氢对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化方面。

在这项研究中，双金属PtSn催化剂被用于液相中糠醛到糠醇的选择性加氢。糠醇在化学工业中有广泛的应用，包括作为树脂生产中的添加剂或溶剂，以及作为制造赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂和分散剂等各种产品的化学中间体。

研究发现，向Pt基系统中添加Sn可以得到更高效的不饱和羰基化合物加氢催化剂。双金属PtSn催化剂在糠醇生产中表现出高选择性（96-98%）。

为了研究和优化这一过程，在理论和实验领域采用了各种方法。这些包括：

1. 通过受控表面反应制备不同锡含量的双金属催化剂。
2. 使用EXAFS、XANES和XPS等表征技术来理解向Pt催化剂中添加Sn的几何和电子效应。
3. 在液相加氢反应中进行催化剂测试，以评估活性、选择性和稳定性。
4. 研究溶剂对反应动力学和产物分布的影响。

研究表明，双金属系统中Sn的存在导致了几何效应（Pt位点的稀释）和电子效应（Pt的电子密度增加），这些效应改变了基础Pt催化剂的特性。这些修饰有助于提高双金属催化剂在C=O键加氢中的效率和选择性。
