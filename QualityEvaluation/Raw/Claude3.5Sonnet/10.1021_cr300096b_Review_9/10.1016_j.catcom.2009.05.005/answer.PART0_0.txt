[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity"

[4] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. 

The literature describes the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, which is an important industrial chemical used in resin production and as an intermediate for various products including lysine, vitamin C, and lubricants. This demonstrates the relevance of C=O bond hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ both experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, they prepare catalysts using controlled surface reactions to obtain well-defined bimetallic phases. They then characterize these catalysts using various techniques such as atomic absorption, temperature-programmed reduction, chemisorption, and transmission electron microscopy.

The catalytic performance is evaluated through liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions, analyzing conversion rates and product selectivity. Different reaction conditions, including various solvents, are tested to optimize the process. The stability and reusability of the catalysts are also assessed through multiple reaction cycles.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention theoretical studies, it does reference previous research that has shown the benefits of adding Sn to Pt-based systems for hydrogenating unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This suggests that theoretical understanding of bimetallic systems plays a role in guiding catalyst design.

Overall, the methodologies employed span catalyst preparation, characterization, performance testing, and optimization of reaction conditions, all aimed at improving the selectivity and efficiency of C=O bond hydrogenation for industrial applications.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Sn系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化方面。

文献描述了使用双金属PtSn催化剂选择性地将糠醛氢化为糠醇，这是一种重要的工业化学品，用于树脂生产和作为多种产品（包括赖氨酸、维生素C和润滑剂）的中间体。这证明了C=O键氢化在精细化学品合成中的相关性。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用实验和理论方法。在实验方面，他们使用受控表面反应制备催化剂，以获得明确定义的双金属相。然后，他们使用各种技术（如原子吸收、程序升温还原、化学吸附和透射电子显微镜）对这些催化剂进行表征。

通过液相氢化反应评估催化性能，分析转化率和产品选择性。测试不同的反应条件，包括各种溶剂，以优化该过程。还通过多个反应循环评估催化剂的稳定性和可重复使用性。

虽然文档没有明确提到理论研究，但它确实提到了先前的研究，这些研究表明向Pt基系统添加Sn对氢化不饱和羰基化合物有益。这表明对双金属系统的理论理解在指导催化剂设计方面发挥作用。

总的来说，所采用的方法包括催化剂制备、表征、性能测试和反应条件优化，所有这些都旨在提高C=O键氢化在工业应用中的选择性和效率。
