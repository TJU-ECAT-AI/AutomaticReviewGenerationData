[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%)."

[2] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications"

[3] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity"

[4] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. 

The literature describes the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, which is an important industrial chemical used in resin production and as an intermediate for various products including lysine, vitamin C, and lubricants. This demonstrates the relevance of C=O bond hydrogenation in fine chemical synthesis.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ both experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, they prepare catalysts using controlled surface reactions to obtain well-defined bimetallic phases. They then characterize these catalysts using various techniques such as atomic absorption, temperature-programmed reduction, chemisorption, and transmission electron microscopy.

The catalytic performance is evaluated through liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions, analyzing conversion rates and product selectivity. Different reaction conditions, including various solvents, are tested to optimize the process. The stability and reusability of the catalysts are also assessed through multiple reaction cycles.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention theoretical studies, it does reference previous research that has shown the benefits of adding Sn to Pt-based systems for hydrogenating unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This suggests that theoretical understanding of bimetallic systems plays a role in guiding catalyst design.

Overall, the methodologies employed span catalyst preparation, characterization, performance testing, and optimization of reaction conditions, all aimed at improving the selectivity and efficiency of C=O bond hydrogenation for industrial applications.

The literature does not directly address Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds in furfural, which is relevant to fine chemical synthesis. The study employs several methodologies to optimize and enhance selectivity and efficiency:

1. Controlled surface reactions are used to prepare bimetallic PtSn catalysts with varying tin content.

2. Advanced characterization techniques like EXAFS, XANES, and XPS are used to study the catalysts' structure and properties.

3. The catalysts are tested in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions, evaluating their activity, selectivity, and stability over multiple reaction cycles.

4. Different solvents are tested to assess their impact on reaction kinetics and product distribution.

5. The effects of tin content on catalyst performance are systematically studied.

These methods allow for the development of highly selective catalysts (96-98% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol) with improved efficiency compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The research demonstrates how bimetallic systems can be tailored to enhance catalytic performance in C=O hydrogenation reactions, which has broader implications for industrial applications in fine chemical synthesis.
