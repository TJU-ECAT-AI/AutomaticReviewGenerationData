[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (96-98%)."

[2] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[3] "PtSn systems were more active than the monometallic catalyst. The highest reaction rate was obtained for the lowest Sn/Pt atomic ratio studied."

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group"

[5] "These ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting the attack of hydrogen to the carbonyl group of the furfural molecule and thus leading to greater activity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. The study demonstrates that bimetallic PtSn catalysts are highly effective for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in liquid phase, achieving high selectivity (96-98%) and improved activity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ both theoretical and experimental methodologies. Experimentally, controlled surface reactions are used to prepare bimetallic catalysts with varying Sn/Pt ratios. The catalysts are then characterized using advanced techniques such as EXAFS, XANES, and XPS to understand their structure and properties.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts for hydrogenating various unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The ionic Sn species act as Lewis acid sites, promoting hydrogen attack on the carbonyl group and enhancing activity. The study found that the lowest Sn/Pt atomic ratio yielded the highest reaction rate, indicating an optimal balance between Pt site dilution and the promoting effect of ionic Sn.

These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, which has important implications for industrial processes involving fine chemical synthesis and potentially for cellulosic biomass conversion.

C=O键的催化加氢，特别是使用像Pt-Sn系统这样的双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重要贡献，尤其是在精细化学品合成和潜在的纤维素生物质转化方面。研究表明，双金属PtSn催化剂在液相中对糠醛选择性加氢制糠醇非常有效，达到了高选择性（96-98%）并且比单金属Pt催化剂活性更高。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了理论和实验相结合的方法。在实验方面，通过控制表面反应制备了不同Sn/Pt比例的双金属催化剂。然后使用先进的技术如EXAFS、XANES和XPS对催化剂进行表征，以了解其结构和性质。

向Pt基系统中添加Sn可以得到更高效的催化剂，用于各种不饱和羰基化合物的加氢。离子态Sn物种作为Lewis酸位点，促进氢对羰基的进攻，从而提高活性。研究发现，最低的Sn/Pt原子比yielded最高的反应速率，这表明Pt位点稀释和离子态Sn的促进效应之间达到了最佳平衡。

这些发现有助于开发更高效、更具选择性的C=O键加氢催化剂，这对涉及精细化学品合成的工业过程以及潜在的纤维素生物质转化具有重要意义。
