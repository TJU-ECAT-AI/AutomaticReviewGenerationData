[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%)."

[2] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds"

[3] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts were prepared by controlled surface reactions, using techniques derived from the Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M)"

[4] "PtSn-supported catalysts, similar to those employed here, have been thoroughly characterized by EXAFS, XANES and XPS in our research group"

The literature does not directly address Pt-Ni systems or cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does discuss the use of bimetallic PtSn catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds in furfural, which is relevant to fine chemical synthesis. The study employs several methodologies to optimize and enhance selectivity and efficiency:

1. Controlled surface reactions are used to prepare bimetallic PtSn catalysts with varying tin content.

2. Advanced characterization techniques like EXAFS, XANES, and XPS are used to study the catalysts' structure and properties.

3. The catalysts are tested in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions, evaluating their activity, selectivity, and stability over multiple reaction cycles.

4. Different solvents are tested to assess their impact on reaction kinetics and product distribution.

5. The effects of tin content on catalyst performance are systematically studied.

These methods allow for the development of highly selective catalysts (96-98% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol) with improved efficiency compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The research demonstrates how bimetallic systems can be tailored to enhance catalytic performance in C=O hydrogenation reactions, which has broader implications for industrial applications in fine chemical synthesis.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-Ni系统或纤维素生物质转化。然而，它确实讨论了双金属PtSn催化剂在糠醛C=O键选择性加氢中的应用，这与精细化学品合成相关。该研究采用了几种方法来优化和提高选择性和效率：

1. 使用受控表面反应制备不同锡含量的双金属PtSn催化剂。

2. 使用先进的表征技术如EXAFS、XANES和XPS来研究催化剂的结构和性质。

3. 在液相加氢反应中测试催化剂，评估其活性、选择性和多个反应周期的稳定性。

4. 测试不同溶剂以评估其对反应动力学和产物分布的影响。

5. 系统研究锡含量对催化剂性能的影响。

这些方法允许开发出高选择性催化剂（对糠醇的选择性为96-98%），比单金属Pt催化剂效率更高。该研究展示了如何定制双金属系统以增强C=O加氢反应中的催化性能，这对精细化学品合成的工业应用具有更广泛的影响。
