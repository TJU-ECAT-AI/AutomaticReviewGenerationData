<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information directly relevant to the question about catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems. The document focuses on the hydrogenation of acrolein on a Pt(111) surface, but does not discuss bimetallic catalysts or industrial applications. The study examines the competitive hydrogenation pathways of acrolein using density functional theory calculations, finding that attacks on the C=O bond are generally favored over attacks on the C=C bond. However, it does not address the specific topics mentioned in the question such as fine chemical synthesis, cellulosic biomass conversion, or methodologies for optimizing selectivity and efficiency across theoretical and experimental domains.

给定的科学文献中没有直接与问题相关的信息,该问题是关于使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Ni系统)对C=O键进行催化加氢的。该文档主要讨论了Pt(111)表面上丙烯醛的加氢,但没有涉及双金属催化剂或工业应用。这项研究使用密度泛函理论计算检查了丙烯醛的竞争性加氢途径,发现对C=O键的攻击通常比对C=C键的攻击更有利。然而,它并未涉及问题中提到的具体主题,如精细化学品合成、纤维素生物质转化,或在理论和实验领域优化选择性和效率的方法。

The document focuses on the hydrogenation of acrolein on a Pt(111) surface, discussing the competitive pathways for hydrogenation of C=C and C=O bonds. It does not cover bimetallic catalysts or industrial applications beyond mentioning that unsaturated alcohols are valuable intermediates for perfumes and flavors. The methodologies described in the paper are primarily theoretical, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the reaction mechanisms and energetics, but do not extend to the optimization or enhancement of selectivity and efficiency in industrial processes.
