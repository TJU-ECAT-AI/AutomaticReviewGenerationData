[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"

[2] "DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation."

[3] "UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure."

[4] "In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[5] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."

Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is important for organic synthesis, production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, and as an initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies:

1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies and potential hydrogenation pathways for different catalyst structures.

2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies, such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), are conducted on model surfaces to verify the hydrogenation activity of different bimetallic structures.

3. Batch and flow reactor studies are performed to evaluate the performance of supported catalysts in gas-phase hydrogenation reactions.

The integration of these methods allows researchers to correlate theoretical predictions with experimental results, enabling the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts. For example, studies on PtNi bimetallic catalysts have shown that the PtNiPt subsurface structure exhibits higher CO hydrogenation activity and lower activation barriers compared to monometallic catalysts or other bimetallic structures.

This comprehensive approach, combining DFT calculations, UHV studies, and reactor evaluations, demonstrates the feasibility of predicting and developing bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity for various industrial applications.

C=O键的催化氢化，特别是使用像Pt-Ni系统这样的双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重要贡献。它对有机合成、精细化学品和药物前体的生产，以及作为纤维素生物质催化转化的初始步骤都很重要。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了理论和实验方法的结合：

1. 使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来预测不同催化剂结构的结合能和潜在的氢化途径。

2. 在模型表面上进行超高真空（UHV）研究，如程序升温脱附（TPD），以验证不同双金属结构的氢化活性。

3. 进行批量和流动反应器研究，以评估负载型催化剂在气相氢化反应中的性能。

这些方法的整合使研究人员能够将理论预测与实验结果相关联，从而设计出更高效的双金属催化剂。例如，对PtNi双金属催化剂的研究表明，PtNiPt亚表面结构展现出比单金属催化剂或其他双金属结构更高的CO氢化活性和更低的活化能垒。

这种综合方法，结合DFT计算、UHV研究和反应器评估，证明了预测和开发具有增强CO氢化活性的双金属催化剂的可行性，可用于各种工业应用。
