[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"

[2] "DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation. UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure."

[3] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."

[4] "PtCo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts. (246)"

[5] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(111), H/NiPtPt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a.

Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is crucial for organic synthesis, production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, and serves as an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies:

1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: These are used to predict binding energies of molecules on different catalyst surfaces, helping to understand potential reaction pathways.

2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: Techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) are used to verify the activity of different bimetallic surface structures for CO hydrogenation.

3. Reactor studies: Both batch and flow reactor evaluations are conducted to assess the performance of supported catalysts under realistic conditions.

4. Surface science techniques: Methods like EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) are employed to understand the extent of bimetallic bond formation and surface structures.

5. Computational modeling: Used to calculate binding energies and adsorption configurations of reactants on various catalyst surfaces.

The integration of these methodologies allows researchers to correlate theoretical predictions with experimental results, facilitating the design of more effective bimetallic catalysts. For instance, PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts have shown enhanced CO hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts for various aldehydes and ketones.

By carefully tuning the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, researchers can achieve higher selectivity towards desired products. This approach has been particularly successful in the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, where the goal is often to selectively hydrogenate the C═O bond while preserving the C═C bond.

C═O键的催化氢化，特别是使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献。它对有机合成、精细化学品和药物前体的生产至关重要，并且是纤维素生物质催化转化的重要初始步骤。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了理论和实验方法的组合：

1. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算：用于预测分子在不同催化剂表面的结合能，有助于理解潜在的反应途径。

2. 超高真空（UHV）研究：使用温度程序脱附（TPD）等技术来验证不同双金属表面结构对CO氢化的活性。

3. 反应器研究：进行批次和流动反应器评估，以评估负载型催化剂在实际条件下的性能。

4. 表面科学技术：采用EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）等方法来理解双金属键形成和表面结构的程度。

5. 计算机模拟：用于计算反应物在各种催化剂表面上的结合能和吸附构型。

这些方法的整合使研究人员能够将理论预测与实验结果相关联，有助于设计更有效的双金属催化剂。例如，对于各种醛和酮，PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂显示出比单金属催化剂更强的CO氢化活性。

通过仔细调整双金属催化剂的组成和结构，研究人员可以实现对目标产物的更高选择性。这种方法在α,β-不饱和醛的选择性氢化中特别成功，其目标通常是选择性地氢化C═O键，同时保留C═C键。
