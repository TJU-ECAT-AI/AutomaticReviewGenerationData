The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is important for organic synthesis, production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, and has recently been considered as a crucial initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies:

1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: Used to predict binding energies and suggest possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathways.

2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: Techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) are used to verify the CO hydrogenation activity of different bimetallic surface structures.

3. Batch and flow reactor studies: Used to evaluate the performance of supported catalysts in gas-phase hydrogenation reactions.

4. Surface characterization techniques: Methods like EXAFS are used to understand the extent of bimetallic bond formation and its correlation with hydrogenation activity.

The integration of these methodologies allows researchers to predict, design, and evaluate bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity. For instance, PtNi bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a PtNiPt subsurface structure, have demonstrated higher CO hydrogenation rates and lower activation barriers compared to monometallic catalysts. This approach of combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation has proven effective in developing more efficient catalysts for C═O bond hydrogenation.

C═O键的催化氢化，特别是使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献。它对有机合成、精细化学品和药物前体的生产很重要，最近还被认为是纤维素生物质催化转化的关键初始步骤。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了理论和实验方法的结合：

1. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算：用于预测结合能并提出可能的低温CO氢化途径。

2. 超高真空（UHV）研究：使用温度程序脱附（TPD）等技术来验证不同双金属表面结构的CO氢化活性。

3. 批次和流动反应器研究：用于评估负载型催化剂在气相氢化反应中的性能。

4. 表面表征技术：使用EXAFS等方法来理解双金属键形成的程度及其与氢化活性的相关性。

这些方法的整合使研究人员能够预测、设计和评估具有增强CO氢化活性的双金属催化剂。例如，PtNi双金属催化剂，特别是具有PtNiPt亚表面结构的催化剂，与单金属催化剂相比，表现出更高的CO氢化速率和更低的活化能垒。这种将理论预测与实验验证相结合的方法已被证明在开发更高效的C═O键氢化催化剂方面非常有效。
