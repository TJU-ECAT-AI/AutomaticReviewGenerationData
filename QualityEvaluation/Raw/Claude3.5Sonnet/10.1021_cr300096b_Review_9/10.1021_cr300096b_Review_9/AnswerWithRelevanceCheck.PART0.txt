          [1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"

[2] "DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation."

[3] "UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure."

[4] "In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

[5] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."

[6] "PtCo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts. (246)"

[7] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(111), H/NiPtPt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a.

          Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as organic synthesis, production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, and catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a multi-faceted approach across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical modeling: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies, adsorption configurations, and potential reaction pathways for different catalyst structures.

2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: Techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) are conducted on model surfaces to verify theoretical predictions and examine the activity of different bimetallic surface structures.

3. Reactor studies: Both batch and flow reactor evaluations are performed to assess the performance of supported catalysts under more realistic conditions. These studies help determine reaction rates, activation barriers, and compare bimetallic catalysts with their monometallic counterparts.

4. Surface characterization: Techniques are employed to understand the extent of bimetallic bond formation and its correlation with hydrogenation activity.

5. Computational modeling: Used to calculate binding energies and adsorption configurations of reactants on various catalyst surfaces.

This comprehensive approach, combining theoretical predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts, has demonstrated the feasibility of predicting and developing bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity. For instance, PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts have shown higher CO hydrogenation rates and lower activation barriers compared to monometallic catalysts for various aldehydes and ketones.

The synergy between these methods allows researchers to gain deeper insights into reaction mechanisms, optimize catalyst compositions, and ultimately improve the efficiency and selectivity of C═O bond hydrogenation processes for various industrial applications.

          C═O键的催化氢化，特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂系统，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，如有机合成、精细化学品和药物前体的生产，以及纤维素生物质的催化转化。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用了多方面的方法：

1. 理论建模：使用密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来预测不同催化剂结构的结合能、吸附构型和潜在的反应途径。

2. 超高真空(UHV)研究：在模型表面上进行程序升温脱附(TPD)等技术，以验证理论预测并检查不同双金属表面结构的活性。

3. 反应器研究：进行批次和流动反应器评估，以评估在更实际条件下负载型催化剂的性能。这些研究有助于确定反应速率、活化能障，并比较双金属催化剂与其单金属对应物。

4. 表面表征：采用技术来理解双金属键形成的程度及其与氢化活性的相关性。

5. 计算机模拟：用于计算反应物在各种催化剂表面上的结合能和吸附构型。

这种综合方法，结合理论预测、模型表面上的UHV研究和负载型催化剂的催化评估，已经证明了预测和开发具有增强CO氢化活性的双金属催化剂的可行性。例如，对于各种醛和酮，PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂显示出比单金属催化剂更高的CO氢化速率和更低的活化能垒。

这些方法之间的协同作用使研究人员能够深入了解反应机理，优化催化剂组成，并最终提高C═O键氢化过程在各种工业应用中的效率和选择性。
