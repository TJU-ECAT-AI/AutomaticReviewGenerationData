Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is important for organic synthesis, production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, and has recently been considered as a crucial initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a multi-faceted approach across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical calculations: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used to predict binding energies and potential reaction pathways. For instance, DFT calculations have shown that propanal binds more weakly to PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures compared to monometallic surfaces, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway.

2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: These are conducted on model surfaces to verify the predictions from DFT calculations and to study the activity of different bimetallic surface structures. For example, Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) studies on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil have shown that the PtNiPt subsurface structure exhibits much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation compared to monometallic or other bimetallic structures.

3. Reactor studies: Both batch and flow reactor evaluations are performed to test the performance of supported catalysts under realistic conditions. These studies have shown that PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher CO hydrogenation rates and lower activation barriers compared to monometallic catalysts.

4. Correlation of methods: Researchers emphasize the importance of correlating results from DFT calculations, UHV studies, and reactor evaluations. This comprehensive approach allows for the prediction and development of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity.

By combining these methodologies, researchers can gain insights into the fundamental mechanisms of C═O hydrogenation, optimize catalyst compositions and structures, and ultimately develop more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

C═O键的催化加氢，特别是使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献。它对有机合成、精细化学品和药物前体的生产很重要，最近还被认为是纤维素生物质催化转化的关键初始步骤。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员在理论和实验领域采用多方面的方法：

1. 理论计算：使用密度泛函理论（DFT）来预测结合能和潜在的反应途径。例如，DFT计算表明，与单金属表面相比，丙醛在PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上的结合更弱，这表明可能存在低温CO加氢途径。

2. 超高真空（UHV）研究：这些研究在模型表面上进行，以验证DFT计算的预测，并研究不同双金属表面结构的活性。例如，在Ni修饰的多晶Pt箔上进行的程序升温脱附（TPD）研究表明，与单金属或其他双金属结构相比，PtNiPt亚表面结构表现出更高的丙醛加氢活性。

3. 反应器研究：进行批次和流动反应器评估，以在实际条件下测试负载催化剂的性能。这些研究表明，与单金属催化剂相比，PtNi/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂表现出更高的CO加氢速率和更低的活化能垒。

4. 方法相关性：研究人员强调DFT计算、UHV研究和反应器评估结果相关性的重要性。这种综合方法允许预测和开发具有增强CO加氢活性的双金属催化剂。

通过结合这些方法，研究人员可以深入了解C═O加氢的基本机制，优化催化剂组成和结构，并最终开发出更高效、更选择性的工业应用催化剂。
