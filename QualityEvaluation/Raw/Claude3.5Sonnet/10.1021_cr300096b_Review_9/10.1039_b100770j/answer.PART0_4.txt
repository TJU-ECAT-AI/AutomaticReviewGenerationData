[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production. That of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes generates unsaturated alcohols, which are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, flavourings and pharmaceuticals."

[2] "It is necessary to promote the metal to increase selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond and thus to produce the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or but-2-en-1-ol). This can be achieved by the addition of a second, more electropositive metal such as iron,24 nickel5 or tin,2,3,613 and by using a support that can interact with the metal:"

[3] "The platinumtin bimetallic system has been extensively studied for the selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl bond in the presence of an olefinic CC bond. Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis. This process is valuable for producing unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, flavorings, and pharmaceuticals.

To enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, several methodologies are employed:

1. Adding a second, more electropositive metal (such as tin, iron, or nickel) to promote the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

2. Using supports that can interact with the metal, which can influence the catalyst's performance.

3. Optimizing the atomic ratio between the two metals (e.g., Sn/Pt ratio).

4. Carefully selecting the preparation method for the catalyst.

5. Controlling the interaction between platinum and both metallic and oxidized tin species.

These approaches are studied and optimized across theoretical and experimental domains to improve the catalysts' performance in selectively hydrogenating the C=O bond while preserving other functional groups, such as C=C bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

While the given text does not specifically mention cellulosic biomass conversion, the principles and methodologies discussed for fine chemical synthesis could potentially be applied or adapted to this field as well, given the importance of selective hydrogenation in biomass processing.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Sn系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重要贡献，尤其是在精细化学品合成领域。这一过程对于生产不饱和醇很有价值，而不饱和醇是合成香水、调味剂和药品的重要中间体。

为了提高这一过程的选择性和效率，采用了以下几种方法：

1. 添加第二种更具电正性的金属（如锡、铁或镍）以促进羰基的选择性氢化。

2. 使用能与金属相互作用的载体，这可以影响催化剂的性能。

3. 优化两种金属之间的原子比（例如，Sn/Pt比）。

4. 仔细选择催化剂的制备方法。

5. 控制铂与金属锡和氧化锡物种之间的相互作用。

这些方法在理论和实验领域进行研究和优化，以提高催化剂在选择性氢化C=O键的同时保留其他官能团（如α,β-不饱和醛中的C=C键）的性能。

虽然给定的文本没有特别提到纤维素生物质转化，但用于精细化学品合成的原理和方法可能也适用于或可以适应这一领域，考虑到选择性氢化在生物质加工中的重要性。
