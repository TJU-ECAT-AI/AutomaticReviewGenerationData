Bimetallic platinum copper catalysts were prepared by deposi-
tion of copper on a parent monometallic platinum catalyst. Two
techniques were employed favoring the deposition of copper either
on the parent metal or on the support. The activity and selectiv-
ity of copper and platinum monometallic catalysts are compared
to those of their bimetallic counterparts. Copper reduces nitrates
and nitrites according to a redox process but deactivates rapidly.
Monometallic platinum catalysts are inactive for nitrate reduction,
while nitrates are totally and rapidly reduced on PtCu bimetallic
catalyst when both metals are in close contact. In the bimetallic
catalyst, the role of copper is to reduce nitrate to nitrite according
to a redox process. In this step, the interaction between copper and
platinum is of major importance to maintain copper in the metallic
state by way of hydrogen adsorbed on platinum. However, copper
has a negative influence on the selectivity toward nitrogen.

1. INTRODUCTION
Intensive agricultural activities and especially overfer-
tilization induce an increase of nitrate concentration in
groundwater. Nitrates consumed with drinking water can
be converted into nitrites in human body and may cause

effectslikehypertension.TheEuropeanCommunityhasset
the maximum permitted level of nitrate in drinking water to
50 mg · l1. To comply with the legislation, a specific treat-
ment of drinking water is necessary. Nowadays, two types
of processes are developed: (i) physico-chemical processes
using ion exchange, electrodialysis, or reversed osmosis and
(ii) biological processes, consisting of nitrate reduction by
microorganisms into gaseous nitrogen (1, 2).
The electrolytic reduction of nitrate anions has been un-
der investigation for a long time (39) and constitutes an

important part of the electrochemistry of nitrogen com-
pounds. Chemical reduction of nitrate in water has also
been studied (10, 11) in the presence of ferrous ions and
a copper catalyst, or in the presence of metallic iron as
reducing agent. More recently, catalytic denitratation has
been developed (1226) to obtain the selective reduction
of nitrate into nitrogen, with the undesired formation of
ammonia.
It was demonstrated (1216) that nitrites are reduced by
hydrogen either to nitrogen or to ammonia on various hy-
drogenation catalysts like Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/C, Ru/Al2O3,
Ir/Al2O3, and Rh/Al2O3. Among these six catalysts, those
based on palladium show the highest activity and selectiv-
ity. On alumina support, the activity ranking is 5% Pd > 5%
Rh > 2% Ir > 2% Ru and the selectivity sequence is 5%
Pd > 2% Ru > 2% Ir = 5% Rh (15). From these results,
palladium-based catalysts were used in all subsequent stud-
ies reported in the literature. Nevertheless, the activity and
selectivity of alumina-supported, platinum-based catalysts
were no longer studied.
To reduce nitrates, it is necessary to activate the pre-
cious metal-based catalysts by addition of a second metal
such as copper or silver. In the early studies, the best activ-
ity and selectivity obtained with palladium-based bimetal-
lic catalysts were found with palladiumcopper catalysts
(1216). The catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation of aque-
ous nitrate solution on these bimetallic PdCu catalysts was
the subject of kinetical studies (17, 19). More recently, other
promoting metals like Sn and In (22, 23, 25) and Zn (25, 26)
were investigated. In terms of activity, palladiumtin and
palladiumindium catalysts seem to be more suited for ni-
trate reduction than their palladiumcopper equivalents,
minimizing at the same time the formation of ammonia.
With the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the
mechanism of nitrate reduction on bimetallic platinum-
based catalysts, we have studied in this work the behav-
ior of the monometallic platinum and copper catalysts.
Palladium-based catalysts are not active for the liquid phase
nitrate reduction (14) and this was verified in the case of

monometallic platinum catalysts. Then we tested the activ-
ity of platinum catalysts for the liquid-phase nitrite hydro-
genation,whereastheactivityofmonometallicandbimetal-
lic copper-based catalysts were evaluated for both nitrate
and nitrite reduction. To determine the role of the copper
platinum interaction in the reaction, two different prepa-
ration techniques were chosen to favor the deposition of
copper on a parent platinum catalyst, either on the plat-
inum particles or on the support. The influence of Pt/Cu
atomic ratio was also studied.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Catalysts
2.1.1. Support
The support was an γ -alumina (Procatalyse) with a spe-
cific surface area (BET method) of 215 m2/g, a total pore
volume of 0.55 cm3/g, and an isoelectric point at pH 7. The
support was crushed and sieved in order to retain particles
with sizes between 0.04 and 0.08 mm.
2.1.2. Catalysts
Monometallic platinum and copper catalysts were pre-
pared by impregnation of the support with Pt(NH3)4(OH)2
or Cu(NO3)2, 3 H2O in an aqueous solution brought to
pH 11 by the addition of ammonia. This pH value was cho-
sen to ensure the cationic exchange between the precur-
sor salt and the alumina surface (27, 28), leading therefore
to a well-dispersed catalyst after activation. The mixture
was stirred for 12 h and then ammonia and water were evap-
orated by heating on a sandbath. After drying overnight at
120C, catalysts were calcined in flowing air for 4 h, at 450C
for platinum and at 300C for copper catalysts (to avoid
copper aluminate formation). Then the oxidized platinum
catalyst was reduced in flowing pure hydrogen at 500C for
8 h. For copper catalyst, this reduction step was carried out
at 320C, in situ, i.e., in the same reactor as that used for
the nitrate or nitrite reduction test. This made it possible
to avoid any contact with air, thereby maintaining copper
species into their metallic form.
To prepare PtCu bimetallic catalysts, two techniques
were chosen to deposit copper onto the monometallic par-
ent platinum catalyst either on platinum particles or on the
support:
a. Catalytic reduction.
This technique, widely used in
our laboratory (2932), was developed in order to favor the
deposition of the second metal on the prereduced parent
metal. A platinum monometallic catalyst was modified by
the surface reaction between chemisorbed hydrogen and
the second metal, according to the overall reaction
Cu2+ + 2 PtH Pt2Cu + 2H+.
[1]
A given amount of the prereduced parent platinum catalyst
was introduced in an aqueous solution previously degassed
by bubbling nitrogen and continuously stirred by a counter-
current hydrogen flow (1 h). The solution of the copper salt
(Cu(NO3)2, 3 H2O), containing a well-defined amount of
copper, was then added and maintained in contact with the
catalyst under hydrogen flow for 2 h. We verified, by atomic
absorption spectroscopy (PerkinElmer 3300), that copper
was totally absent in solution after the deposition reaction.
Bimetallic catalysts were then filtered, washed with water,
and dried at 120C overnight. In the following, this type of
catalysts is referred to as CR catalysts.
b. Successive impregnation by cationic exchange.
This
technique was used to favor the copper deposition on the
support and therefore to minimize interactions between
platinum and copper. The experimental procedure was the
same as that described above for the monometallic copper
catalyst. This type of catalyst is called SI catalysts.
Both types of bimetallic catalysts were activated by direct
reduction at 380C under flowing pure hydrogen for 2 h.
The monometallic and bimetallic catalysts contained
1 wt.% of metal (platinum and/or copper on alumina).
2.2. Characterization Methods
2.2.1. Determination of Platinum Dispersion
Platinum accessibility was determined by O2/H2 titration
(33, 34). After reduction in H2 at 500C, the catalyst was
flushed for 1 h 30 min with helium at the same temperature
to remove physically adsorbed hydrogen, and then cooled
to room temperature. Pulses of oxygen were then intro-
duced until full saturation of the catalyst was achieved. The
chimisorbed oxygen was titrated by hydrogen. The amount
of hydrogen consumed in this way corresponds to the total
hydrogen (reversibly and unreversibly bound) HT1. The
catalyst was then degassed for 20 min at room tempera-
ture, and a second hydrogen chemisorption was carried out
corresponding to the reversibly bound and/or physisorbed
hydrogen HT2. The amount of adsorbed hydrogen on the
metal surface (HT) is simply the difference between HT1
and HT2.
The gases used in this study were of ultra-high-purity
grade.
This method was effective in determining the platinum
accessibility in the monometallic catalyst, but unsuitable for
the bimetallic catalysts.
2.2.2. Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy was mostly used to characterize
bimetallic catalysts.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a bright field
mode was carried out in a Philips CM120 electron micro-
scope operating at 120 kV with a theoretical resolution of
0.35 nm. The sample was embedded in a polymeric resin

(spurr) and cut into a section as small as 40 nm with an
ultramicrotome equipped with a diamond knife. Cuts were
then deposited on an Al grid previously covered with a thin
layer of carbon. EDX analysis of elements was carried out
in the STEM mode of the microscope using a Si (Li) Super
UTW detector.
2.2.3. X-Ray Diffraction

diffractometer using CuKα1 radiation, but only peaks due
to support phases were detected, which can be explained on
the one hand by the small amount of metal loading and, on
the other hand, by the high dispersion of metallic phases.
2.2.4. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Carbon monoxide adsorption on bimetallic catalysts was
followed by a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) experi-
ment using a Nicolet Magna-750 spectrometer, on a sample
of about 20 mg compressed into a disk and placed into a
glass cell. After reduction in situ in flowing pure hydrogen
at 400C for 2 h, the pellet was outgassed for 1 h at the same
temperature and then cooled. CO was admitted in the cell
by injecting pulses at room temperature until a pressure
of 10 Torr (1 Torr = 133.3 N · m2), corresponding to the
apparent saturation of the platinum surface, was achieved.
Then the samples were evacuated at room temperature for
1 h.
2.3. Nitrate and Nitrite Reduction Reactions
The reactions were carried out in a 250-mL batch reac-
tor. In a typical experiment, the catalyst was introduced
in the reactor and degassed under N2 upflowing. Ninety
milliliters of ultrapure water with predissolved hydrogen
was then added and the temperature was lowered to 10C.
Then 10 mL of a concentrated aqueous solution of nitrate
(102 mol/L) were introduced in the reactor to start the re-
action. Ultrapure water (18.2 M) was obtained by a Milli-
pore purifying system. Operating conditions are reported in
Table 1. The catalyst dispersion in the aqueous medium was
operated by the hydrogen bubbling flow through a porous
glass located at the bottom of the reactor. It was checked
that the hydrogen flow and the resulting stirring were suffi-
cient to ensure that the reaction was not rate-limited by re-
actant diffusion. By varying experimental parameters, like
reaction temperature, catalyst amount, metal or catalyst
loading, and hydrogen flow rate, it was demonstrated that
the kinetics of the overall process is not influenced by diffu-
sion limitations. For example, Fig. 1 demonstrates that the
activity (in moles per minute) for nitrate reduction is pro-
portional to the catalyst loading up to 2 g/100 mL of catalyst.
This confirms that the nitrate disappearance rate was not in-
fluenced by diffusion phenomena with the catalyst loading
of 0.8 g/100 mL applied in the present study.

At appropriate time intervals, an aliquot of the reac-
tion mixture was sampled and filtered. Nitrate and nitrite
intermediate concentrations were determined by HPLC
analysis, on an Interchrom Inertsil ODS2 column coupled
with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Separation
Products, Spectra SERIES UV100). The mobile phase was
a mixture of acetonitrile, diamminohydrogenophosphate,
N-Octylamine (high-purity grades), and ultrapure water.
The pH was kept between 6 and 6.5 using 86% H3PO4 (35).
The use of N-octylamine in the eluent allows the separa-
tion of inorganic anions. Operating conditions consisted of
a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min and a detection wavelength of
210 nm.
The pH of the initial and final solutions were determined
by means of a digital pH meter (Consort).
The amount of ammonium ions was measured at the end
of the reaction using a selective electrode (Mettler Toledo).
In this study, the selectivity toward ammonium ions was
always lower than 30%, except for nitrate reduction on
monometallic copper catalyst. However, considering both
the pH value at the end of the reaction (near 9) and the
further possibility of cationic adsorption on alumina at this
pH value, the amount of total ammonia (basic and acidic

forms) was probably much higher. Still, by comparing the
amount of the ammonium ions produced, it was possible
to assess the performance of various catalysts in this work,
since the pH value of the solution at the end of the reaction
was nearly the same.
To identify gaseous products during nitrate reduction, a
separate experiment was conducted in a batch reactor in
the presence of a CR bimetallic catalyst, with an atomic
ratio Cu/Pt of 1. Before the addition of nitrate, the solu-
tion and the reactor volume were saturated with hydrogen
and the gas was recirculated from the top to the bottom
of the reactor to create mixing conditions equivalent to a
semi-batch setup with hydrogen bubbling. We checked that
the nitrate disappearance rate was unchanged compared to
typical experimental conditions. Gases were analyzed by
gas chromatography equipped with a catharometer, after
separation on a molecular sieve 5A column coupled with a
Porapak Q column. With hydrogen accounting for a major-
ity of the gas phase, we chose this gas as a carrier to prevent
its detection. Dinitrogen was the only gas detected by this
method, although Daum and Vorlop (26) identified dinitro-
gen oxide as an intermediate product of nitrate reduction
on PdCu bimetallic catalysts. The absence of dinitrogen
oxide in gas phase in the present case could be explained
either by the change of bimetallic catalyst or by the high
solubility of N2O in water, which is 40 to 45 times higher
than those of N2 and H2, or by the amount of dinitrogen
oxide formed below the detection limits of GC analysis.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. 1 wt.% Cu/Al2O3 Catalysts
At first 1% Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared as de-
scribed under Experimental but were reduced ex situ and
stocked several days under air before the reaction test in
the presence of nitrate or nitrite and hydrogen. Under the
same conditions, Pintar and Kajiuchi (18) observed that
the catalyst is totally inactive for nitrate reduction. If we
consider the redox potential of the principal species in-
volved in this reaction (36, 37), nitrate or nitrite should
be reduced by metallic copper. This inactivity can be ex-
plained by a surface oxidation of copper in contact with
air, leading to CuO, Cu2O, or CuCO3 · Cu(OH)2 basic cop-
per carbonate species (38), giving a green color to this
catalyst. To avoid this phenomenon, the catalyst was re-
duced in situ, i.e., in the reactor, at 320C for 150 min.
This temperature is sufficient to reduce copper, as is proved
by the TPR profile presented in Fig. 2d, where the peaks
at 260 and 320C could be respectively assigned to super-
ficial Cu2O and CuO reduction to metallic copper, respec-
tively (39). After copper reduction nitrate or nitrite solution
was added. As expected, nitrate and nitrite were reduced,
principally to ammonia, under both hydrogen and nitro-
gen atmospheres, confirming a redox mechanism between

metallic copper and nitrate or nitrite. The evolution of ni-
trate concentration in presence of 1 wt.% Cu/Al2O3 is plot-
ted as a function of time in Fig. 3. Although the amount
of copper was sufficient, nitrate was not totally converted,
copper being rapidly passivated by CuO or Cu2O forma-
tion in water, occurring even in the presence of hydrogen
(36, 39). The same result was obtained during nitrite re-
duction. At the end of the reaction, the concentration of
copper ions in aqueous solution was below the detection
limit of atomic absorption spectroscopy. According to the
pH value at the beginning of the reaction (pH 5.5) the ther-
modynamically favored reactions lead to NO(g), N2O(g),
N2(g), NO
2 (aq), and NH+
4 (aq). For example, the nitrate
and nitrite reduction leading to nitrogen could be written

3.2. 1 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 Catalyst
After preparation (fresh catalyst) the metallic accessibil-
ity of 1 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is 46%, which corresponds to
a particle diameter of approximately 18 
A. After reaction in
the presence of nitrites and hydrogen (Pt/Al2O3 is inactive
for nitrate reduction), the accessibility of platinum is note-
ably decreased to 26%. The same result is obtained after
a blank reaction, in the presence of hydrogen only. This
sintering phenomenon, occurring in water under hydrogen,
has already been observed for precious metal-based cata-
lysts (29, 40). Consequently, catalysts were aged by hydro-
gen bubbling in water before nitrite introduction to avoid
platinum accessibility modification during the reaction.
The nitrite evolution during the reaction is presented in
Fig. 4.
The initial reaction rate is approximately equal to
6 × 106 mol/min · gcat, which corresponds to a turnover fre-
quency of 7.5 × 103 s1, calculated from the observed spe-
cific reaction rate and the fraction of exposed platinum
atoms (26%). The selectivity toward NH+
4 is 2%. The ap-
parent activation energy of this reaction, calculated from
the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 5) between 10 and 26C, is equal
to 45  2.5 kJ · mol1, which is higher than the value found
for 5 wt.% Pd/γ -Al2O3 by Tacke and Vorlop (14).
3.3. 1 wt.% Pt-Cu/Al2O3 Bimetallic Catalysts
3.3.1. Characterization of CR and SI Catalysts
(Atomic Ratio Cu/Pt of 1)
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of
fresh CR and SI are presented in Fig. 2 and compared to
those of corresponding monometallic catalysts. They were
established after preparation and exposition to air at ambi-
ent temperature. In the case of the CR catalyst, one can

observe an important hydrogen uptake between 50 and
250C, with two maxima at about 115 and 205C followed
by a lower hydrogen uptake between 270 and 400C. For
the SI catalyst, two hydrogen uptakes can be identified with
maxima at 100 and 345C approximately. In this case, the
TPR profile is essentially the overlap of the individual con-
tributions of monometallic platinum and copper catalysts.
The profile of the CR catalyst is significantly different, and
the first domain, with maxima at 115 and 205C, could be
attributed to the reduction of mixed PtCu oxidized species
where both metals are mutually interacting (41). From the
TPR profiles, one can deduce that a temperature of 380C
is sufficient to reduce all species present in the SI and CR
catalysts.
The average composition of bimetallic particles in CR
and SI catalysts is presented in Fig. 6, for a global Cu/Pt
atomic ratio equal to 1, corresponding to 50 at.% of copper.
TEM pictures of these catalysts are shown in Fig. 7.

The particle size of the CR catalyst was
determined from TEM pictures (Fig. 7a) by means of a
histogram as illustrated in Fig. 8. The particle diameter, cal-
culated as dp = P nid3

ameter of the particles and ni the number of particles having
diameter in the range (di  2.5

A.

on the alumina surface.
According to the preparation method, catalytic reduc-
tion favors the deposition of copper onto platinum par-
ticles. Eighty percent of individual particles analyzed by
EDX have the average composition of the whole catalyst,
which proves the strong interaction between copper and
platinum. Given the platinum dispersion in the parent cata-
lyst (26%) and the particle composition (Cu/Pt = 1), this
indicates that the amount of copper deposited is approx-
imately four times higher than the amount of accessible
platinum surface Pts. Assuming that each adsorbed copper
atom may occupy one adsorption site of hydrogen on plat-
inum (42), and recalling the similar size of platinum and
copper atoms, this corresponds to a bulk copper deposition
on platinum under a hydrogen atmosphere. This type of de-
position on platinum can occur via the electrons generating
by the hydrogen ionization on the noble metal, according
to the following scheme:
This mechanism implies that platinum surface is not totally
coveredbycopper,evenforsuchanamountofsecondmetal
added, and that some sites of platinum remain accessible
to hydrogen. Using electrochemical methods, Furuya and
Motoo (43) studied copper deposition on a platinum elec-
trode in an acidic medium. They demonstrated that close
to the reversible hydrogen potential, the following reaction
take place before all platinum sites are occupied by copper
adatoms:
Cu2+
aq + 2e + CuPts 
CuCuPts.
[4]
For larger amounts of copper, we can assume that copper
deposition on copper leads to tridimensional structure suf-
ficiently organized to be stable.
Another possibility involves the diffusion of copper
atoms into the platinum particles during copper layer for-
mation, since copper and platinum form series of stable
intermetallic compounds (44).
To verify the accessibility of platinum in the bimetallic
CR catalyst, we studied the adsorption of CO by FTIR spec-
troscopy. The spectra of CO adsorbed onto the bimetallic
CR catalyst with a global Cu/Pt atomic ratio equal to 1 were
recorded after adsorption of CO at a pressure of 10 Torr
followed by an evacuation for 1 h at room temperature
(Fig. 9). The band at about 2055 cm1 can be attributed to

which proves that platinum surface remains accessible to
gases in the bimetallic catalyst.
b. SI catalyst.
In contrast to the CR catalyst, the parti-
cle composition of the SI catalyst is very heterogeneous, the
analyzed sample (Fig. 6) being composed of copper or plat-
inum monometallic particles and of either platinum-rich or
copper-rich bimetallic particles. TEM analysis of this type
of catalyst confirmed that samples are composed of small
particles (average size 30 
A) of pure platinum or copper, fa-
vored by the ion exchange preparation, but larger particles
were found, with a bimetallic composition. Figure 7b shows
an example of this type of bimetallic particle where copper
agglomerates surround platinum. This could be explained
by the broad distribution of platinum and copper particle
size, preferred interactions taking place between the largest
particles of each metal.

Since higher activities are obtained with the CR catalyst,
these results demonstrate that the preparation method of
the bimetallic catalyst is of major importance when using
the same impregnation sequence (platinum deposited first).
If the catalyst activity for the nitrate reduction can be di-
rectly related to the interactions between the noble metal
and copper, the difference of activity between SI and CR
catalysts may be explained only by the number of bimetallic
active sites, which are optimum on the CR catalyst. Once ni-
trates are converted into nitrites, these intermediates could
be reduced either on the bimetallic particles or on plat-
inum monometallic particles. Nitrite evolution vs nitrate

conversion is presented in Fig. 5b. Whereas the curves are
nearly similar, the maximumamountofnitritepresent inso-
lution is higher for the SI catalyst (0.53 × 103 mol/L) than
for the CR catalyst (0.43 × 103 mol/L). This maximum is
reached at about 80% nitrate conversion for both cata-
lysts. Considering the catalyst activity for nitrite reduction
(Table 2), we can deduce that the higher amount of nitrite
in solution during nitrate reduction on the SI catalyst may
be partly explained by the lower activity of this catalyst for
nitrite reduction. Alternatively, another explanation could
be the favored nitrite desorption on the SI catalyst. If we
now compare the activity of SI bimetallic and monometallic
catalysts at similar platinum content (0.75 wt.%) (Table 2),
we observe that they are quite similar. Since the SI cata-
lyst is composed of mostly small monometallic platinum
or copper particles, together with large bimetallic particles
(see above), we can conclude that the nitrite reduction oc-
curs principally on monometallic platinum sites on the SI
catalyst. The CR catalyst activity being much higher, this
indicates that bimetallic sites are more active for nitrite re-
duction.
These results are quite different from those obtained for
palladium-based catalysts by Batista et al. (46), who found
that the relative location of palladium and copper in the
catalyst has no influence on the observed activity for the ni-
trate reduction. This different behavior could be attributed
to the precious metal change or by the different preparation
procedure.
In the present study, it was shown that monometallic
platinum catalysts are inactive for nitrate reduction, while
metallic state copper is able to reduce nitrate according to
a redox reaction, although it is rapidly deactivated. There-
fore, we can deduce that the first step in the nitrate re-
duction is probably a redox reaction between Cuand
NO
3 , leading to nitrite intermediates or directly to N2 or
NH+
4 , and to an oxidized form of copper. Subsequently,
the role of the precious metal is to activate hydrogen, al-
lowing the reduction of copper according to the following
scheme:
With regards to the nitrite intermediates, they can be re-
duced either on copper, according to the same redox pro-
cess as that described above, or on the precious metal by
catalytic reduction.
Van de Moesdijk (47) proposed the same type of redox
mechanism betweenthe promoterandnitrateforthereduc-
tion of nitrate in water in the presence of Pd/C and/or Pt/C
catalystsandGeO2insolutionaspromoter.Itwassuggested
that in the presence of the noble metal and hydrogen, GeO2
rapidly disappears from the solution and an intermetallic
compound, Pd2Ge, was identified by X-ray diffraction. The
metallic state of germanium was very surprising since it is
a nonprecious metal, which is thermodynamically unstable
in the presence of water. However it was verified later by
XPS that germanium, present in submonolayer concentra-
tion on palladium, is completely reduced to the metallic
state under hydrogen atmosphere (48), validating this type
of mechanism.
Concerning the catalyst stability, the amount of metal
ions present in solution after nitrate reduction in the pres-
ence of CR and SI catalysts was below the detection limit
of the atomic absorption spectroscopy.
3.3.3. Effect of Cu/Pt Atomic Ratio
We varied the copper and the platinum amount in the cat-
alyst to obtain an Cu/Pt atomic ratio between 0.5 and 9, with
a constant metal loading equal to 1 wt.%. The influence of
copperloadingontheinitialactivityofCRandSIcatalystsis
presented in Fig. 6. Irrespective of the preparation method,
the best initial activity is obtained for the atomic ratio
Cu/Pt = 1, corresponding to 50% of copper in the metallic
phase. This result is different from that obtained by H
orold
et al. (15) on palladium-based catalysts, who presented the
better activity for the atomic ratio Cu/Pd = 0.42. This dif-
ferent behavior can be explained either by the noble metal
change or by the different experimental conditions (prepa-
ration method and/or reaction test conditions). To verify
one of these hypotheses, we prepared and tested different
palladiumcopper catalysts according to the experimental
conditions described in the present study. Results are pre-
sented in Table 3 and compared with those obtained with
PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts containing the same molar amount
of noble metal (about 1.5 × 104 mole per 100 g of alumina).

et al. for palladium-based catalysts, we can conclude that
this value depends mainly on the nature of metals present
in the bimetallic phase. The comparison with the results
obtained with platinum-based catalysts demonstrates that
the performance of different bimetallic catalysts should be
compared at the optimal composition rather than at a given
composition.
For both types of platinum-based catalysts (CR and SI),
when Cu/Pt > 1, the activity decreases as copper content
increases, to reach the activity of monometallic copper cata-
lyst when 90% of copper is present in the metal phase. This
can be explained by the low accessibility of platinum sites
when the copper amount is too important. The selectivity
toward ammonium increases with the increase of copper
content. Then, although copper is essential in the bimetallic
catalyst to reduce nitrate to nitrite, it has a negative influ-
ence on selectivity.
4. CONCLUSION
Copper can reduce nitrates and nitrites according to a
redox process but deactivates rapidly, copper being passi-
vated by CuO or Cu2O formation in water. Monometallic
platinum catalysts are inactive for nitrate reduction.
Nitrates are totally and rapidly reduced on PtCu
bimetallic catalysts when both metals are in close contact.
The catalytic reduction preparation method, consisting of
Cu2+ reduction by hydrogen adsorbed on platinum, is par-
ticularly adapted to favor this interaction.
In the bimetallic catalyst, the role of copper is to reduce
nitrate to nitrite according to a redox process. In this step,
the interaction between copper and platinum is of major im-
portance, in order to maintain copper in the metallic state
by way of hydrogen adsorbed on platinum. Although cop-
per is essential in the bimetallic catalyst to reduce nitrate to
nitrite, it has a negative influence on the selectivity toward
nitrogen.
