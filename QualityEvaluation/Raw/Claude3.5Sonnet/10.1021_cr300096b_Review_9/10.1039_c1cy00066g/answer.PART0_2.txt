Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is important for organic synthesis in fine chemical production and plays a crucial role in the initial steps of cellulosic biomass conversion. The process is also relevant for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a multi-faceted approach spanning theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical methods: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies and other properties of catalysts and reactants.

2. Surface science studies: Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiments on model surfaces like Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil are conducted to verify theoretical predictions and study reaction mechanisms.

3. Supported catalyst synthesis: Bimetallic catalysts (e.g., NiPt/γ-Al2O3) are prepared to bridge the gap between model surfaces and real-world catalysis.

4. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as CO chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Extended X-ray Absorption Structure (EXAFS) are used to analyze catalyst properties.

5. Reactor studies: Both batch and flow reactor experiments are performed to evaluate catalytic performance under realistic conditions. These studies measure reaction rates, conversions, and activation energies.

This comprehensive approach allows researchers to correlate theoretical predictions with experimental results, leading to the design of more efficient hydrogenation catalysts. The ultimate goal is to develop catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity for C=O bond hydrogenation in various applications.
