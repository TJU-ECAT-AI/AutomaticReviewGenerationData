[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."

[2] "Additionally, studies of the hydrogenation of propanal, which is a possible product of the hydrogenation of acrolein, may provide information on the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."

[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."

[4] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."

[5] "DFT calculations are performed to predict the weaker binding energies of propanal on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure. TPD results on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that the subsurface PtNiPt structure exhibits higher CO bond hydrogenation activity than the surface NiPtPt structure and the monometallic Ni and Pt surfaces."

[6] "To bridge the materials gap and pressure gap between fundamental surface science studies and real world catalysis, γ-Al2O3 supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts with a Ni/Pt molar ratio of 3:1 and 10:1 are evaluated using batch and flow reactors, which confirm that the NiPt/γ-Al2O3catalysts exhibit significantly higher propanalhydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications:

1. It is crucial for organic synthesis in the chemical industry.

2. It provides insights into the selective hydrogenation of C=O bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which is important for fine chemical synthesis.

3. It serves as an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass, potentially contributing to renewable energy and materials production.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a multi-faceted approach spanning theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical methods: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, helping to identify potentially active catalyst structures.

2. Surface science experiments: Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) studies on model surfaces (e.g., Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil) are conducted to verify theoretical predictions and investigate the activity of different surface structures.

3. Supported catalyst studies: To bridge the gap between fundamental surface science and real-world catalysis, supported catalysts (e.g., NiPt/γ-Al2O3) are synthesized and evaluated using both batch and flow reactors.

4. Characterization techniques: Methods such as CO chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Extended X-ray Absorption Structure (EXAFS) are employed to understand the structure and composition of the catalysts.

5. Kinetic studies: Reaction rates, rate constants, and activation energies are determined to quantify and compare catalyst performance.

This comprehensive approach allows researchers to correlate theoretical predictions with experimental results, leading to a better understanding of structure-activity relationships and the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation.
