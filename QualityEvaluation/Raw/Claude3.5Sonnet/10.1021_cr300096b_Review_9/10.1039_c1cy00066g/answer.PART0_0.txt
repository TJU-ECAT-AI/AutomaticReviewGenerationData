Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to industrial organic synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is studied, optimized, and enhanced through a multi-faceted approach spanning theoretical and experimental domains.

The methodologies employed include:

1. Theoretical modeling: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, providing insights into potential catalytic activity.

2. Surface science studies: Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiments on model surfaces like Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil are conducted to verify theoretical predictions and understand catalyst behavior at the atomic level.

3. Reactor studies: Both batch and flow reactor evaluations are performed on supported catalysts (e.g., γ-Al2O3 supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts) to bridge the gap between surface science studies and real-world catalysis.

4. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as CO chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Extended X-ray Absorption Structure (EXAFS) are used to understand the structure and composition of the catalysts.

This comprehensive approach allows researchers to correlate theoretical predictions with experimental results, enabling the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced hydrogenation activity. The study of Pt-Ni systems, particularly the subsurface PtNiPt structure, has shown promising results in improving C=O bond hydrogenation efficiency compared to monometallic catalysts.

By combining these methodologies, researchers can optimize catalyst formulations, understand reaction mechanisms, and ultimately enhance the selectivity and efficiency of C=O bond hydrogenation for various applications in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂进行C=O键的催化氢化对工业有机合成和纤维素生物质转化做出了重大贡献。这一过程通过跨越理论和实验领域的多方面方法进行研究、优化和改进。

采用的方法包括：

1. 理论模型：使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来预测反应物在不同催化剂表面上的结合能，从而洞察潜在的催化活性。

2. 表面科学研究：在Ni修饰的多晶Pt箔等模型表面上进行温度程序化脱附（TPD）实验，以验证理论预测并在原子水平上理解催化剂行为。

3. 反应器研究：对负载型催化剂（如γ-Al2O3负载的NiPt双金属催化剂）进行批量和流动反应器评估，以弥合表面科学研究与实际催化之间的差距。

4. 催化剂表征：使用CO化学吸附、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扩展X射线吸收结构（EXAFS）等技术来理解催化剂的结构和组成。

这种综合方法使研究人员能够将理论预测与实验结果相关联，从而实现具有增强氢化活性的双金属催化剂的合理设计。对Pt-Ni系统的研究，特别是亚表面PtNiPt结构，在提高C=O键氢化效率方面显示出比单金属催化剂更好的结果。

通过结合这些方法，研究人员可以优化催化剂配方，理解反应机理，并最终提高C=O键氢化在精细化学品合成和生物质转化等各种应用中的选择性和效率。
