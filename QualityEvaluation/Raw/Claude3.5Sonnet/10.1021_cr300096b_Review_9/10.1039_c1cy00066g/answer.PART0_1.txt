[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."

[2] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."

[3] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."

[4] "DFT calculations are performed to predict the weaker binding energies of propanal on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure. TPD results on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that the subsurface PtNiPt structure exhibits higher CO bond hydrogenation activity than the surface NiPtPt structure and the monometallic Ni and Pt surfaces."

[5] "To bridge the materials gap and pressure gap between fundamental surface science studies and real world catalysis, γ-Al2O3 supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts with a Ni/Pt molar ratio of 3:1 and 10:1 are evaluated using batch and flow reactors, which confirm that the NiPt/γ-Al2O3catalysts exhibit significantly higher propanalhydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. It is important for organic synthesis in fine chemical production and has recently gained significance as a key initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a multi-faceted approach spanning theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Theoretical methods: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies of molecules like propanal on different catalyst surfaces, helping to identify potentially active catalytic structures.

2. Surface science experiments: Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) studies on model surfaces, such as Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil, are conducted to verify theoretical predictions and compare activities of different surface structures.

3. Supported catalyst studies: To bridge the gap between fundamental surface science and real-world catalysis, supported catalysts (e.g., NiPt/γ-Al2O3) are synthesized and evaluated using batch and flow reactors. These studies help validate the enhanced activity of bimetallic catalysts predicted by theory and model surface experiments.

4. Characterization techniques: Methods like CO chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Extended X-ray Absorption Structure (EXAFS) are employed to understand the structure and composition of the catalysts.

This comprehensive approach allows researchers to design and optimize bimetallic catalysts for C═O hydrogenation, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

C═O键的催化氢化，特别是使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂，在各种工业和研究应用中发挥着关键作用。它对精细化学品生产中的有机合成很重要，最近在纤维素生物质的催化转化中作为关键的初始步骤也变得越来越重要。

为了研究、优化和增强这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了跨越理论和实验领域的多方面方法：

1. 理论方法：使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来预测丙醛等分子在不同催化剂表面的结合能，有助于识别潜在的活性催化结构。

2. 表面科学实验：在模型表面（如镍修饰的多晶铂箔）上进行程序升温脱附（TPD）研究，以验证理论预测并比较不同表面结构的活性。

3. 负载型催化剂研究：为了弥合基础表面科学和实际催化之间的差距，合成负载型催化剂（如NiPt/γ-Al2O3）并使用批次反应器和流动反应器进行评估。这些研究有助于验证理论和模型表面实验所预测的双金属催化剂的增强活性。

4. 表征技术：采用CO化学吸附、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扩展X射线吸收结构（EXAFS）等方法来了解催化剂的结构和组成。

这种综合方法使研究人员能够设计和优化用于C═O氢化的双金属催化剂，有可能在精细化学品合成和生物质转化中实现更高效和选择性的过程。
