[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."

[2] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."

[3] "Therefore, understanding the relationship between the catalyst formulation and catalytic property for propanalhydrogenation should also provide useful information on the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic conversion of cellulose."

[4] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."

[5] "DFT calculations are performed to predict the weaker binding energies of propanal on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure. TPD results on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that the subsurface PtNiPt structure exhibits higher CO bond hydrogenation activity than the surface NiPtPt structure and the monometallic Ni and Pt surfaces."

[6] "To bridge the materials gap and pressure gap between fundamental surface science studies and real world catalysis, γ-Al2O3 supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts with a Ni/Pt molar ratio of 3:1 and 10:1 are evaluated using batch and flow reactors, which confirm that the NiPt/γ-Al2O3catalysts exhibit significantly higher propanalhydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."

Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications:

1. It is crucial for organic synthesis in fine chemical production.

2. It serves as an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass, which is relevant to renewable energy and sustainable chemistry.

3. Understanding this process helps in selecting catalysts for hydrogenating unsaturated aldehydes, which has applications in the production of various chemicals.

The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to predict binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, helping to identify potentially active catalyst structures.

2. Surface science experiments, such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), are conducted on model surfaces to verify theoretical predictions and study reaction mechanisms at a fundamental level.

3. Supported catalysts are synthesized and evaluated using both batch and flow reactors to bridge the gap between surface science studies and real-world catalysis.

4. Various characterization techniques like CO chemisorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Extended X-ray Absorption Structure (EXAFS) are used to understand the structure and properties of the catalysts.

5. Kinetic studies are performed to determine reaction rates and activation energies, providing insights into the catalytic performance.

This multi-faceted approach allows researchers to design and optimize bimetallic catalysts for C=O hydrogenation, enhancing both selectivity and efficiency in various applications.
