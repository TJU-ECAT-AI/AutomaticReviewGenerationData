[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical production. Unsaturated alcohols, which are products of this selective hydrogenation process, serve as important intermediates in these fields.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of experimental and theoretical methodologies. Experimentally, techniques such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) are used to investigate the reaction mechanisms and surface interactions. On the theoretical side, Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling is utilized to understand binding energies and preferred adsorption configurations of reactants on catalyst surfaces.

The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni systems, has shown promise in promoting selective hydrogenation. For instance, studies have demonstrated that a PtNiPt(111) surface structure, with Ni atoms in the subsurface layer, can enhance the selective hydrogenation of acrolein to its corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum conditions.

These methodologies allow researchers to explore the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts, understand reaction pathways, and optimize catalyst designs for improved selectivity and efficiency in C=O bond hydrogenation processes.

使用Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和制药生产方面。不饱和醇是这种选择性氢化过程的产物，是这些领域的重要中间体。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了实验和理论方法的组合。在实验方面，采用了程序升温脱附(TPD)和高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)等技术来研究反应机理和表面相互作用。在理论方面，密度泛函理论(DFT)建模被用来理解反应物在催化剂表面上的结合能和优先吸附构型。

使用双金属催化剂，如Pt-Ni系统，在促进选择性氢化方面显示出了前景。例如，研究表明，在超高真空条件下，具有次表面层Ni原子的PtNiPt(111)表面结构可以增强丙烯醛向相应不饱和醇的选择性氢化。

这些方法使研究人员能够探索双金属催化剂的协同效应，理解反应途径，并优化催化剂设计，以提高C=O键氢化过程的选择性和效率。
