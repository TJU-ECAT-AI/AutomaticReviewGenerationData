[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[3] "As shown in Table 1, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of C@O bond to produce 2-propenol increases from 3% to 17% by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and the production of pharmaceutical precursors. The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of particular interest due to the importance of these products as intermediates.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of experimental and theoretical methodologies. These include:

1. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique is used to study the desorption of reaction products and intermediates from the catalyst surface, providing insights into reaction pathways and kinetics.

2. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): This surface-sensitive technique allows researchers to study the vibrational modes of adsorbed species on the catalyst surface, helping to identify reaction intermediates and understand surface bonding configurations.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling: This computational method is used to calculate binding energies and predict optimal adsorption geometries, helping to explain experimental observations and guide catalyst design.

These methods are used in combination to investigate the trends in hydrogenation activity and selectivity on various bimetallic surfaces. For example, studies have shown that a PtNiPt(111) surface, with Ni atoms in the subsurface layer, promotes selective hydrogenation of acrolein to the unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on this surface further increases the selectivity for C=O bond hydrogenation, increasing the yield of the desired unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) from 3% to 17%.

By understanding the fundamental surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms through these complementary techniques, researchers can develop strategies to optimize catalyst composition and structure, ultimately leading to more efficient and selective processes for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Ni系统)进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献，特别是在精细化学品合成和药物前体生产方面。α,β-不饱和醛选择性氢化生成不饱和醇尤其受到关注，因为这些产物是重要的中间体。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了实验和理论方法相结合的方式。这些方法包括：

1. 程序升温脱附(TPD)：这种技术用于研究反应产物和中间体从催化剂表面的脱附，提供反应途径和动力学的见解。

2. 高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS)：这种表面敏感技术允许研究人员研究吸附在催化剂表面的物种的振动模式，有助于识别反应中间体并理解表面键合构型。

3. 密度泛函理论(DFT)建模：这种计算方法用于计算结合能并预测最佳吸附几何构型，有助于解释实验观察结果并指导催化剂设计。

这些方法被结合使用，以研究各种双金属表面上的氢化活性和选择性趋势。例如，研究表明，在超高真空条件下，具有亚表面层Ni原子的PtNiPt(111)表面促进了丙烯醛向不饱和醇的选择性氢化。在这种表面上预吸附氢进一步增加了C=O键氢化的选择性，将所需不饱和醇(2-丙烯醇)的产率从3%提高到17%。

通过这些互补技术了解基本表面化学和反应机理，研究人员可以开发策略来优化催化剂组成和结构，最终导致更高效和选择性的精细化学品和药物前体生产过程。
