[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and potentially in cellulosic biomass conversion. These reactions are important for producing unsaturated alcohols, which serve as key intermediates in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Experimentally, techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) are used to investigate the reaction mechanisms and surface interactions. These methods provide insights into the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of molecules on catalyst surfaces.

On the theoretical side, density functional theory (DFT) modeling is utilized to understand the electronic structure of catalysts and predict their behavior. DFT calculations can provide information on binding energies, adsorption geometries, and reaction pathways, which are crucial for optimizing catalyst design.

Researchers have found that bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with specific surface structures like PtNiPt(111) where Ni atoms reside in the second layer of the Pt substrate, can promote selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. This selectivity is achieved by taking advantage of synergistic effects between the two metals.

The optimization process involves studying various bimetallic combinations, surface structures, and reaction conditions to identify the most effective catalysts for selective C=O hydrogenation. By combining experimental observations with theoretical predictions, researchers can develop a deeper understanding of the catalytic process and design more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.
