[1] "The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols has been of growing interest because unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."

[2] "Many attempts have been made to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts."

[3] "Recent results reported by our research group have suggested that the bimetallic PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, with Ni atoms residing in the second layer of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, promoted the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[4] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, particularly in fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical production. Unsaturated alcohols, which are important intermediates in these processes, can be selectively produced through the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies. These include:

1. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique is used to analyze the desorption of reaction products from catalyst surfaces, providing insights into reaction pathways and product selectivity.

2. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): This spectroscopic method helps in understanding the vibrational features of adsorbed molecules and reaction intermediates on catalyst surfaces.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling: This computational approach is used to calculate binding energies and predict adsorption geometries of reactants on catalyst surfaces, helping to explain experimental observations and guide catalyst design.

4. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions: These controlled environments allow for precise surface science studies of model catalyst systems.

By combining these methodologies, researchers can investigate the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNiPt(111) surfaces, where the arrangement of metal atoms (e.g., Ni atoms in the second layer of a Pt substrate) can significantly influence the selectivity towards desired products like unsaturated alcohols. This comprehensive approach enables the optimization of catalyst compositions and structures for improved performance in industrial applications.

使用双金属催化剂(如Pt-Ni系统)进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重大贡献,特别是在精细化学品合成和制药生产方面。通过α,β-不饱和醛的氢化可以选择性地生产不饱和醇,这是这些过程中重要的中间体。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率,研究人员采用了理论和实验方法的组合。这些方法包括:

1. 程序升温脱附(TPD):这种技术用于分析反应产物从催化剂表面的脱附,提供了反应途径和产物选择性的见解。

2. 高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS):这种光谱方法有助于理解催化剂表面吸附分子和反应中间体的振动特征。

3. 密度泛函理论(DFT)建模:这种计算方法用于计算反应物在催化剂表面的结合能和预测吸附几何构型,有助于解释实验观察结果并指导催化剂设计。

4. 超高真空(UHV)条件:这种受控环境允许对模型催化剂系统进行精确的表面科学研究。

通过结合这些方法,研究人员可以研究双金属催化剂的协同效应,例如PtNiPt(111)表面,其中金属原子的排列(如Pt基底第二层中的Ni原子)可以显著影响向所需产物(如不饱和醇)的选择性。这种综合方法能够优化催化剂成分和结构,以提高工业应用中的性能。
