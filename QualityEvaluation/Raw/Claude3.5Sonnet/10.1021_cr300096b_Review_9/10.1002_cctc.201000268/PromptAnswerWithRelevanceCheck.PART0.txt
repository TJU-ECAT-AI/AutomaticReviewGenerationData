Catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Co systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is widely used in organic synthesis and is considered an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass. The process is valuable for fine chemical synthesis and the production of chemicals like 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as CoPt, offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. These catalysts show distinctly different properties from their parent metals, making them attractive for various applications.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ both theoretical and experimental methodologies. Experimentally, batch and flow reactor studies are used to compare the performance of bimetallic catalysts with monometallic ones. These studies have shown that CoPt bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than corresponding monometallic catalysts.

On the theoretical side, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to correlate the electronic properties of the catalysts with their catalytic activity. These calculations help predict binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, which in turn correlate with hydrogenation activity. For example, DFT calculations predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure would be a better hydrogenation catalyst due to weaker binding of acetone and acetaldehyde compared to Pt(111) or Co(0001) surfaces.

The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations allows researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms of catalytic activity and guide the design of more efficient catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation.

使用双金属催化剂（如Pt-Co系统）进行C=O键的催化氢化对各种工业和研究应用做出了重要贡献。它在有机合成中广泛使用，并被认为是纤维素生物质催化转化的重要初始步骤。这个过程对精细化学品合成和生产诸如2-丙醇和甲基异丁基酮等化学品很有价值。

双金属催化剂（如CoPt）与单金属催化剂相比，提供了增强的活性和选择性。这些催化剂展现出与其母体金属截然不同的性质，使它们在各种应用中具有吸引力。

为了研究、优化和提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用理论和实验方法。在实验方面，使用批处理和流动反应器研究来比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的性能。这些研究表明，CoPt双金属催化剂表现出显著高于相应单金属催化剂的CO氢化活性。

在理论方面，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用来关联催化剂的电子性质与其催化活性。这些计算有助于预测反应物在不同催化剂表面上的结合能，进而与氢化活性相关联。例如，DFT计算预测Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面双金属结构将是更好的氢化催化剂，因为与Pt(111)或Co(0001)表面相比，丙酮和乙醛的结合更弱。

实验研究和理论计算的结合使研究人员能够理解催化活性的基本机制，并指导设计更高效的C=O键氢化催化剂。

The research combines fundamental surface science studies with theoretical calculations to correlate electronic and catalytic properties. DFT calculations help predict changes in adsorption properties of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, providing insights into the relationship between surface structure and catalytic activity.

To optimize and enhance selectivity and efficiency, researchers investigate factors such as the binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, the influence of subsurface atoms on the electronic properties of surface atoms, and the effects of different bimetallic structures (e.g., Pt-terminated vs. Co-terminated surfaces).

The study of model reactions, such as the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde, helps in understanding the fundamental aspects of C=O bond hydrogenation and in predicting the performance of catalysts for more complex reactions. This approach allows for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial applications.

This helps in understanding the correlation between the catalyst's electronic structure and its hydrogenation activity.

The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches allows researchers to identify novel bimetallic catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. For instance, the study found that CoPt bimetallic catalysts exhibit superior CO hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic Co and Pt catalysts. This improved performance is attributed to the specific surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst, which is believed to be Pt-terminated.

These methodologies aim to predict and design more efficient bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, potentially leading to improved processes in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.
