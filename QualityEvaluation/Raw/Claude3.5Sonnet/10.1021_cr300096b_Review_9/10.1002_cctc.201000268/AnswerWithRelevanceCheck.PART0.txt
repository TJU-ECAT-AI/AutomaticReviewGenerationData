          [1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."

[2] "For instance, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals."

[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass."

[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."

[5] "The main objective of the present work is to extend the CC hydrogenation activity of γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low temperature hydrogenation of the carbonyl group by using batch and flow reactors."

[6] "DFT calculations were performed for the current study to determine whether such a correlation can be extended to acetone and acetaldehyde."

[7] "Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts"

[8] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

[9] "Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces."

[10] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Co systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications:

1. Organic synthesis: It is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes, particularly for the production of fine chemicals through the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols.

2. Cellulosic biomass conversion: C=O bond hydrogenation is considered an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass.

3. Enhanced catalytic performance: Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains:

1. Experimental studies:
   - Batch and flow reactor studies to evaluate catalyst performance
   - Comparison of bimetallic catalysts (e.g., CoPt/γ-Al2O3) with monometallic counterparts
   - Investigation of low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl groups

2. Theoretical calculations:
   - Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to correlate electronic properties with catalytic activity
   - Prediction of binding energies for reactants (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde) on different catalyst surfaces
   - Analysis of electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of bimetallic surfaces

3. Correlation of experimental and theoretical results:
   - Comparison of experimental activity data with DFT-calculated binding energies
   - Identification of optimal catalyst structures (e.g., Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration)

These combined approaches allow researchers to develop more efficient and selective bimetallic catalysts for C=O bond hydrogenation, potentially improving processes in fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.
