[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass."

[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."

[5] "The main objective of the present work is to extend the CC hydrogenation activity of γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low temperature hydrogenation of the carbonyl group by using batch and flow reactors."

[6] "Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces."

[7] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like CoPt systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. It is widely used in organic synthesis, especially for the production of fine chemicals through the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in the catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass, serving as an important initial step in this process.

Bimetallic catalysts, such as CoPt, offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. These catalysts are studied and optimized using various methodologies across theoretical and experimental domains. Experimental approaches include batch and flow reactor studies to evaluate catalyst performance under different conditions. Theoretical methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, are employed to understand the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of bimetallic surfaces.

The research combines fundamental surface science studies with theoretical calculations to correlate electronic and catalytic properties. DFT calculations help predict changes in adsorption properties of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, providing insights into the relationship between surface structure and catalytic activity.

To optimize and enhance selectivity and efficiency, researchers investigate factors such as the binding energies of reactants on different catalyst surfaces, the influence of subsurface atoms on the electronic properties of surface atoms, and the effects of different bimetallic structures (e.g., Pt-terminated vs. Co-terminated surfaces).

The study of model reactions, such as the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde, helps in understanding the fundamental aspects of C=O bond hydrogenation and in predicting the performance of catalysts for more complex reactions. This approach allows for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial applications.
