[1] "The unpromoted sample Pt/SSF showed the total basic strength of 0.089 mmol/g which was significantly affected after introducing the promotors; it varied from 0.061 mmol/g for LaPt/SSF to 0.098 mmol/g for InPt/SSF."

[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene, which could be easily found from the correlations presented in Figure 13."

[3] "The introduction of promotors favored generation of more lattice oxygen which acted as the key role in activating the CH bonds in propane for the production of propylene, resulting in the improvements in initial catalytic activity and in the yield of desired product."

[4] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability. Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation."

This literature does not directly compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Instead, it focuses on Pt-based catalysts supported on Sn-doped SBA-15 with various metal promoters (Ce, In, La, and Fe).

However, some general insights can be drawn about metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 provides high surface area and uniform pore distribution, which can lead to better dispersion of active metal species.

2. Catalytic behavior: The addition of promoters to Pt/Sn-SBA-15 significantly affects catalyst performance. Different promoters influence the basicity, reducibility, and surface Pt content of the catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in activating C-H bonds in propane, leading to improved initial catalytic activity and propylene yield.

4. Catalyst performance and deactivation: The redox properties, resistance to sintering, and coke deposition resistance all contribute to catalytic stability. However, sintering of active phases and coke deposition remain the main causes of deactivation.

5. Influence of lattice oxygen species: Lattice oxygen capacity, determined by TPR measurements, correlates strongly with initial propane conversion and final propylene yield. Promoters that increase lattice oxygen content tend to improve catalyst performance.

6. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed for these catalysts, the literature mentions that samples underwent reduction before catalytic testing, suggesting that H2 pretreatment plays a role in activating the catalysts.

In conclusion, while this study doesn't directly address VOx and CrOx on MCM-41 and SBA-15, it demonstrates the importance of tuning catalyst properties through promoter addition and highlights the complex interplay of factors affecting PDH catalyst performance on ordered mesoporous supports.

这篇文献并没有直接比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。相反，它主要关注了以Sn掺杂的SBA-15为载体的Pt基催化剂，并研究了各种金属助剂(Ce、In、La和Fe)的影响。

然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于金属-有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在PDH反应中的一般性见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15的介孔结构提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔分布，这可以导致活性金属物种的更好分散。

2. 催化行为：向Pt/Sn-SBA-15中添加助剂显著影响催化剂性能。不同的助剂影响催化剂的碱性、可还原性和表面Pt含量。

3. 反应机理：晶格氧在活化丙烷的C-H键中起着关键作用，从而提高了初始催化活性和丙烯产率。

4. 催化剂性能和失活：氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳能力都有助于催化稳定性。然而，活性相的烧结和积碳仍然是失活的主要原因。

5. 晶格氧物种的影响：通过TPR测量确定的晶格氧容量与初始丙烷转化率和最终丙烯产率强相关。增加晶格氧含量的助剂往往能改善催化剂性能。

6. H2预处理：虽然文献中没有明确讨论这些催化剂的H2预处理，但提到样品在催化测试前进行了还原，这表明H2预处理在催化剂活化中起作用。

总之，尽管这项研究没有直接讨论MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx，但它展示了通过添加助剂调节催化剂性能的重要性，并强调了影响有序介孔载体上PDH催化剂性能的因素之间的复杂相互作用。
