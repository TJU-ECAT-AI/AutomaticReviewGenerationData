This literature does not specifically focus on comparing Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information on PDH catalysts and reaction mechanisms.

The study mentions that propane dehydrogenation can be performed with or without oxidants. PtSn-based catalysts are noted to be efficient for direct propane dehydrogenation, but catalyst deactivation and long-term stability remain challenges.

Various supports have been investigated for PDH catalysts, including amorphous supports (Al2O3, SiO2), molecular sieves (ZSM-5, SBA-15, MCM-41, silicalite-1), and mixed metal oxides. The nature of the support significantly affects catalytic activity and stability. Acidic supports are more prone to coke deposition compared to neutral or basic ones.

Lattice oxygen capacity, determined by hydrogen consumption in TPR measurements, plays a crucial role in the initial propane conversion and final propylene yield. The redox property, resistance to sintering, and resistance to coke deposition collectively contribute to better catalytic stability.

While the study doesn't directly compare OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH, it highlights the importance of support properties in determining catalyst performance. Factors such as acidity/basicity, redox properties, and resistance to coking and sintering are key considerations for PDH catalyst design, regardless of the specific support material.

The influence of H2 pretreatment is not explicitly discussed in the provided literature. However, the mention of TPR measurements and the role of reducibility suggests that the reduction state of the catalyst, which could be affected by H2 pretreatment, is important for PDH performance.

这篇文献并未特别关注比较金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了一些关于PDH催化剂和反应机理的相关信息。

研究提到丙烷脱氢可以在有或无氧化剂的情况下进行。PtSn基催化剂被认为对直接丙烷脱氢有效，但催化剂失活和长期稳定性仍然是挑战。

研究者调查了各种PDH催化剂载体，包括无定形载体（Al2O3，SiO2），分子筛（ZSM-5，SBA-15，MCM-41，硅铝石-1），以及混合金属氧化物。载体的性质显著影响催化活性和稳定性。与中性或碱性载体相比，酸性载体更容易产生积碳。

晶格氧容量（通过TPR测量中的氢气消耗量确定）在初始丙烷转化率和最终丙烯产率中起关键作用。催化剂的氧化还原性质、抗烧结能力和抗积碳能力共同contributes化稳定性的提高。

虽然这项研究没有直接比较OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体在PDH反应中的表现，但它强调了载体性质在决定催化剂性能方面的重要性。无论具体的载体材料如何，酸碱性、氧化还原性质以及抗积碳和抗烧结能力都是PDH催化剂设计的关键考虑因素。

文献中没有明确讨论H2预处理的影响。但是，对TPR测量和还原性作用的提及表明，催化剂的还原状态（可能受H2预处理影响）对PDH性能很重要。
