[1] "The sample InPt/SSF showed maximum initial propane conversion of 56.8%, while the InPt/SSF exhibited the best performance during the catalytic stability test."

[2] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."

[3] "Obviously, both the sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were jointly responsible for the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[5] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene"

The literature does not specifically analyze MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Instead, it focuses on Pt-based catalysts supported on Sn-doped SBA-15 with various metal promoters (Ce, In, La, and Fe).

However, some general insights can be drawn about metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: The porous structure of SBA-15 remains largely unchanged after metal loading, suggesting good dispersion of active phases.

2. Catalytic behavior: The addition of promoters significantly affects catalyst reducibility, basicity, surface Pt content, and stability of Pt particles. These factors influence PDH activity and stability.

3. Advantages: OMS supports like SBA-15 provide high surface area and uniform pore structure for good dispersion of active sites.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in determining initial propane conversion and propylene yield.

5. Factors influencing performance: Redox properties, resistance to sintering, and coke deposition resistance are key factors affecting catalyst stability.

6. Deactivation: Both sintering of active phases and coke deposition contribute to catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed, the study mentions catalyst reduction before reaction, suggesting H2 pretreatment's importance in activating the catalyst.

The study demonstrates that tailoring the composition and properties of metal-OMS catalysts can significantly improve their performance and stability in PDH reactions.

该文献并未特别分析MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。相反，它关注的是以Sn掺杂SBA-15为载体、添加各种金属助剂(Ce、In、La和Fe)的Pt基催化剂。

然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于金属-有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂在PDH反应中的一般见解：

1. 结构特性：金属负载后SBA-15的多孔结构基本保持不变，表明活性相分散良好。

2. 催化行为：助剂的添加显著影响了催化剂的可还原性、碱性、表面Pt含量和Pt粒子的稳定性。这些因素影响PDH活性和稳定性。

3. 优势：SBA-15等OMS载体提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，有利于活性位的良好分散。

4. 反应机理：晶格氧物种在决定初始丙烷转化率和丙烯产率方面起着关键作用。

5. 影响性能的因素：氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳能力是影响催化剂稳定性的关键因素。

6. 失活：活性相的烧结和积碳沉积都会导致PDH反应中催化剂的失活。

7. H2预处理：虽然没有明确讨论，但研究提到了反应前的催化剂还原，表明H2预处理对催化剂活化的重要性。

该研究表明，通过调整金属-OMS催化剂的组成和性质，可以显著提高其在PDH反应中的性能和稳定性。
