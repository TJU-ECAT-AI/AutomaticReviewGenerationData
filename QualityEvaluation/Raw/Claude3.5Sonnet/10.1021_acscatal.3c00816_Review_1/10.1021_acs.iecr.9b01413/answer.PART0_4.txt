This literature does not specifically discuss Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Instead, it focuses on Pt-based catalysts supported on Sn-doped SBA-15 with various metal promoters (Ce, In, La, Fe) for PDH reactions.

The study shows that these Pt-based catalysts on Sn-SBA-15 supports can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation. The addition of metal promoters significantly affects initial activity and catalytic stability. Lattice oxygen capacity plays a crucial role in determining initial propane conversion and final propylene yield. The redox properties, ability to resist sintering, and resistance to coke deposition all contribute to catalytic stability.

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions include:

1. Lattice oxygen: Higher lattice oxygen capacity correlates with better initial activity and propylene yield.

2. Reducibility: Promoters like In enhance the reduction of Pt species, leading to improved performance.

3. Metal-support interactions: Promoters can stabilize Pt particles and prevent sintering.

4. Coke deposition: While all catalysts experienced some coking, the extent varied based on the promoter used.

5. Particle size stability: Promoters like Ce and In helped maintain Pt particle size during reaction.

The study does not specifically address H2 pretreatment effects, but it does mention that catalysts undergo reduction before the reaction. The main deactivation mechanisms identified were sintering of active Pt particles and coke deposition.

While this study doesn't directly compare to traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that modified mesoporous silica supports like Sn-SBA-15 can be effective for PDH catalysts when combined with appropriate metal promoters.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注在Sn掺杂的SBA-15上负载的Pt基催化剂，并添加了各种金属助剂(Ce, In, La, Fe)用于PDH反应。

研究表明，这些在Sn-SBA-15载体上的Pt基催化剂能有效催化丙烷脱氢反应。金属助剂的添加显著影响了初始活性和催化稳定性。晶格氧容量在决定初始丙烷转化率和最终丙烯产率方面起着关键作用。氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳能力都对催化稳定性有所贡献。

影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的因素包括：

1. 晶格氧：更高的晶格氧容量与更好的初始活性和丙烯产率相关。

2. 可还原性：如In等助剂增强了Pt物种的还原，从而提高性能。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：助剂可以稳定Pt颗粒并防止烧结。

4. 积碳：虽然所有催化剂都出现了一定程度的积碳，但程度因使用的助剂而异。

5. 粒子尺寸稳定性：Ce和In等助剂有助于在反应过程中保持Pt粒子尺寸。

研究没有具体讨论H2预处理的影响，但提到催化剂在反应前会进行还原。确定的主要失活机制是活性Pt颗粒的烧结和积碳。

虽然这项研究没有直接与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，但它表明，当与适当的金属助剂结合时，经过改性的介孔硅载体如Sn-SBA-15可以成为有效的PDH催化剂载体。
