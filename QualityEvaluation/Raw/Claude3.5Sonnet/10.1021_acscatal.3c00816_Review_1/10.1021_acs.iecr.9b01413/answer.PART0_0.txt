This literature does not specifically discuss MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Instead, it focuses on Pt-based catalysts supported on Sn-doped SBA-15 with various metal promoters (Ce, In, La, and Fe).

The study shows that these metal-promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts exhibit improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports. The key advantages include:

1. Enhanced initial activity and catalytic stability
2. Improved propylene yield
3. Better resistance to deactivation

The reaction mechanism involves lattice oxygen species activating C-H bonds in propane. Lattice oxygen capacity, determined by TPR measurements, correlates with initial propane conversion and final propylene yield.

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation include:

1. Redox properties
2. Antisintering ability
3. Resistance to coke deposition

H2 pretreatment is mentioned as part of the catalyst preparation process, but its specific influence on performance is not detailed in this study.

The main deactivation mechanisms are identified as sintering of active phases and coke deposition. The promoters, especially In, help improve catalyst stability by enhancing redox properties, preventing sintering, and moderating coke formation.

While this study doesn't directly compare these catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates the potential of metal-promoted ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in PDH reactions.

这篇文献并未具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注了以Sn掺杂的SBA-15为载体的Pt基催化剂，并添加了各种金属助剂（Ce、In、La和Fe）。

研究表明，与传统载体相比，这些金属促进的Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂在PDH反应中表现出更好的性能。主要优势包括：

1. 提高了初始活性和催化稳定性
2. 改善了丙烯产率
3. 提高了抗失活能力

反应机理涉及晶格氧物种活化丙烷中的C-H键。通过TPR测量确定的晶格氧容量与初始丙烷转化率和最终丙烯产率相关。

影响催化剂性能和失活的因素包括：

1. 氧化还原性能
2. 抗烧结能力
3. 抗积碳能力

H2预处理被提及为催化剂制备过程的一部分，但本研究并未详细说明其对性能的具体影响。

主要的失活机制被确定为活性相的烧结和积碳沉积。助剂，尤其是In，通过增强氧化还原性能、防止烧结和调节积碳形成来帮助改善催化剂稳定性。

虽然这项研究没有直接将这些催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，但它展示了金属促进的有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在PDH反应中的潜力。
