[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

The literature does not directly discuss Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows improved performance compared to traditional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation. It exhibits higher propane conversion (40%) and better stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations.

The enhanced stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. Inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic species due to strong bonding.
2. Stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate.

While the literature doesn't directly compare Sn-HMS to VOx and CrOx catalysts or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it does highlight the advantages of using a mesoporous support for improved catalyst stability and performance in PDH reactions.

该文献没有直接讨论金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注含Sn的六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）用于丙烷脱氢。

与传统浸渍法制备的Sn/SiO2催化剂相比，Sn-HMS催化剂表现出更好的性能。它展现出更高的丙烷转化率（40%）和更好的稳定性，可持续运行长达170小时，即使经过多次再生后仍然保持良好性能。

Sn-HMS催化剂稳定性的提高归因于两个因素：
1. 由于强键合作用，抑制了Sn还原为低熔点金属物种。
2. HMS基底的介孔结构稳定了Sn物种。

虽然文献没有直接将Sn-HMS与VOx和CrOx催化剂进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理的影响，但它确实强调了使用介孔支撑材料可以提高PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性和性能。
