[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

The literature does not provide specific information about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows promising performance in propane dehydrogenation, with a 40% propane conversion and good stability for up to 170 hours. This performance is superior to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation.

The improved stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. The inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to strong bonding.
2. The stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate.

The literature does not provide information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It also does not discuss the reaction mechanisms in detail or compare the structural properties and catalytic behavior of Sn-HMS to traditional metal oxide supports beyond mentioning its superior performance to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts.

该文献没有提供关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的具体信息。相反，它主要关注含锡六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

Sn-HMS催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的性能，丙烷转化率达到40%，并在长达170小时内保持良好的稳定性。这种性能优于通过浸渍法制备的传统Sn/SiO2催化剂。

Sn-HMS催化剂稳定性的提高归因于两个因素：
1. 由于强键合作用，抑制了锡还原为低熔点金属锡物种。
2. HMS基质的介孔结构对锡物种的稳定作用。

文献中没有提供晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的信息。它也没有详细讨论反应机理，也没有比较Sn-HMS与传统金属氧化物载体的结构特性和催化行为，除了提到它优于传统Sn/SiO2催化剂的性能。
