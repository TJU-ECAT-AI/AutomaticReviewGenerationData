[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

The provided literature does not directly discuss MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows promising performance in PDH reactions, exhibiting higher propane conversion (40%) and better stability compared to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts. The enhanced stability is attributed to two factors: the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic species due to strong bonding, and the stabilization of Sn species within the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate.

The HMS support offers several advantages for PDH reactions:
1. Good thermal stability up to 1073 K due to thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm)
2. Fast diffusion of products due to short channel length
3. Weak acidity that promotes prompt desorption of olefins, reducing unwanted secondary reactions

While the literature doesn't provide information on VOx and CrOx catalysts or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it does highlight the importance of the support material's structure in enhancing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

提供的文献并未直接讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注含锡六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

Sn-HMS催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能，与传统的Sn/SiO2催化剂相比，展现出更高的丙烷转化率（40%）和更好的稳定性。这种增强的稳定性归因于两个因素：由于强键合而抑制锡还原为低熔点金属物种，以及HMS基质的介孔结构对锡物种的稳定作用。

HMS支持材料在PDH反应中提供了几个优势：
1. 由于较厚的壁（2.0-3.0 nm）而具有良好的热稳定性，可达1073 K
2. 由于短通道长度而实现产物的快速扩散
3. 弱酸性有利于烯烃的及时脱附，减少不需要的二次反应

虽然文献没有提供关于VOx和CrOx催化剂或晶格氧物种和H2预处理影响的信息，但它确实强调了支持材料结构在提高PDH反应中催化剂性能和稳定性方面的重要性。
