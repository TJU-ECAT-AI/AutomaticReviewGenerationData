          [1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

          The literature does not directly address the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows promising performance in PDH reactions, with a propane conversion of 40% and good stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations. This performance is superior to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation.

The improved stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. Strong bonding that inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic species
2. Stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate

The HMS support offers several advantages:
1. Thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) providing good thermal stability up to 1073 K
2. Short channel length allowing fast diffusion of products
3. Weak acidity promoting quick desorption of olefins, which reduces unwanted secondary reactions

While the literature doesn't discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts or traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that mesoporous silica materials can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The structural properties of HMS, such as its mesoporous nature and thick walls, play a crucial role in stabilizing the active metal species and improving catalytic behavior.

The document does not provide information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

          该文献并未直接讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。相反，它关注的是含锡六方介孔二氧化硅（Sn-HMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

Sn-HMS催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能，丙烷转化率达40%，即使经过多次再生后仍能保持长达170小时的良好稳定性。这种性能优于传统浸渍法制备的Sn/SiO2催化剂。

Sn-HMS催化剂稳定性的提高归因于两个因素：
1. 强键合作用抑制了锡还原为低熔点金属物种
2. HMS基质的介孔结构对锡物种的稳定作用

HMS载体具有以下几个优点：
1. 厚壁（2.0-3.0 nm）提供了高达1073 K的良好热稳定性
2. 短通道长度允许产物快速扩散
3. 弱酸性促进烯烃快速脱附，减少了不需要的副反应

虽然文献没有讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂或传统金属氧化物载体，但它证明了介孔二氧化硅材料可以显著提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能。HMS的结构特性，如其介孔性质和厚壁，在稳定活性金属物种和改善催化行为方面起着至关重要的作用。

该文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的信息。
