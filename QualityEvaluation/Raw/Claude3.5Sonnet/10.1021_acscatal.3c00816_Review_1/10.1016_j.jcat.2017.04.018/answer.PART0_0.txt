[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

The literature does not directly discuss Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) for propane dehydrogenation.

Sn-HMS shows promising performance in propane dehydrogenation, with 40% propane conversion and good stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations. This performance is superior to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation.

The improved stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. The inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic species due to strong bonding.
2. The stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate.

The HMS support contributes to the catalyst's performance through its structural properties:
1. Thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) provide good thermal stability up to 1073 K.
2. Short channel length allows for fast diffusion of products.
3. Weak acidity promotes quick desorption of olefins, reducing unwanted secondary reactions.

While the literature doesn't discuss lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment specifically for these catalysts, it does mention that the Sn-HMS samples were reduced in H2 flow before the reaction, indicating that H2 pretreatment plays a role in the catalyst preparation.

This study demonstrates the potential of mesoporous silica supports in improving catalyst performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation reactions, though it focuses on Sn-based catalysts rather than VOx or CrOx systems.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用。相反，它主要关注含锡的六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

Sn-HMS在丙烷脱氢中表现出promising的性能，丙烷转化率达到40%，并在长达170小时内保持良好的稳定性，即使经过多次再生也是如此。这种性能优于通过浸渍法制备的传统Sn/SiO2催化剂。

Sn-HMS的改进稳定性归因于两个因素：
1. 由于强键合作用，抑制了锡还原为低熔点金属物种。
2. HMS基底的介孔结构稳定了锡物种。

HMS支撑体通过其结构特性contributes到催化剂的性能：
1. 厚壁（2.0-3.0 nm）提供了高达1073 K的良好热稳定性。
2. 短通道长度允许产物快速扩散。
3. 弱酸性促进烯烃快速脱附，减少不必要的副反应。

虽然文献没有特别讨论这些催化剂的晶格氧物种或H2预处理，但确实提到Sn-HMS样品在反应前在H2流中还原，表明H2预处理在催化剂制备中起作用。

这项研究展示了介孔硅支撑体在改善丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂性能和稳定性方面的潜力，尽管它主要关注基于锡的催化剂，而不是VOx或CrOx系统。
