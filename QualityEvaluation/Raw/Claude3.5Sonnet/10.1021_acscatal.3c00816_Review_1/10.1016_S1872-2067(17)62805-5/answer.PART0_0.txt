[1] "Pt-based catalysts show good initial activities in propane dehydrogenation; this is because Pt activates CH bonds without promoting CC cleavage"

[2] "The introduction of Sn promoters into a Pt-based catalytic system effectively improves the catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operating lifetime of the catalyst"

[3] "The use of SBA-15 as a support for Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation may therefore be an excellent choice . The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 enables it to confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles and prevent particle agglomeration, making it a good host"

[4] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2."

[5] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

The literature focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 or SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn:

Advantages of metal-OMS catalysts in PDH:
1. High surface area and ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allow good dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles.
2. The confinement effect of mesoporous channels prevents particle agglomeration.
3. Incorporation of promoters like Sn improves catalytic activity, coke resistance, and catalyst lifetime.

Reaction mechanism and performance:
1. Pt activates C-H bonds without promoting C-C cleavage, leading to good initial PDH activity.
2. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying Pt properties and enhancing performance.
3. Optimal Pt-Sn ratio is crucial for best performance (e.g., Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 showed best results).

Factors influencing performance:
1. Catalyst pretreatment: Reduction under H2 at 500°C for 1 hour was used.
2. Metal-support interactions affect stability of active species and resistance to sintering.
3. Sn content influences the oxidation state of active species and their interactions with the support.

The literature does not directly discuss lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions.

这篇文献主要关注了以SBA-15为载体的Pt-Sn催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非MCM-41或SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们仍可得出一些见解：

金属-OMS催化剂在PDH中的优势：
1. SBA-15的高比表面积和有序介孔结构允许金属纳米粒子良好分散和稳定。
2. 介孔通道的限域效应防止粒子团聚。
3. 添加Sn等助剂可提高催化活性、抗积碳能力和催化剂寿命。

反应机理和性能：
1. Pt激活C-H键而不促进C-C键断裂，导致良好的初始PDH活性。
2. Sn作为助剂，修饰Pt性质并增强性能。
3. 最佳Pt-Sn比例对性能至关重要（如Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15显示最佳结果）。

影响性能的因素：
1. 催化剂预处理：在500°C下用H2还原1小时。
2. 金属-载体相互作用影响活性物种的稳定性和抗烧结能力。
3. Sn含量影响活性物种的氧化态及其与载体的相互作用。

文献未直接讨论晶格氧物种或将性能与传统金属氧化物载体在PDH反应中进行比较。
