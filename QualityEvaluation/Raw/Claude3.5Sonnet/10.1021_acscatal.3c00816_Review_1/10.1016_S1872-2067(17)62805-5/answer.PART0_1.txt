[1] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2. The reaction conditions were 580 C, atmospheric pressure, propane:Ar = 7:3 (molar ratio), and propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 8.25 h1."

[2] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

[3] "The catalytic activity and stability of Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 were significantly better than those of Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM because of improved metal dispersion and enhanced interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support."

[4] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites. In this case, more stable M2 active sites are present in the Sn-incorporated catalyst and a better catalytic performance is obtained."

[5] "The amounts of coke deposited followed the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 (6.6%) < Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 (6.9%) < Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM (11.2%) < Pt/2Sn-SBA-15 (11.4%)."

The literature primarily focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels.

2. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH, with 43.8% propane conversion and 98.5% propene selectivity. This performance was superior to that of the traditionally impregnated catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM).

3. Advantages: Metal-OMS catalysts demonstrate improved metal dispersion, enhanced interactions between metal species and support, and better stabilization of active sites. These factors contribute to higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests the presence of two types of active sites (M1 and M2) on the catalyst surface. M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.

5. Influence of H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 before the reaction, which likely affected the oxidation state of the metal species and their interactions with the support.

6. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation.

While the study does not directly address lattice oxygen species, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of metal species in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Sn掺杂的SBA-15负载Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，而非VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 结构性质：SBA-15载体提供高比表面积和有序的介孔结构，可以改善金属分散性并将金属颗粒限制在孔道内。

2. 催化行为：Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂在PDH反应中表现出色，丙烷转化率为43.8%，丙烯选择性为98.5%。这种性能优于传统浸渍法制备的催化剂(Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM)。

3. 优势：金属-OMS催化剂表现出更好的金属分散性、增强的金属物种与载体之间的相互作用，以及更好的活性位点稳定性。这些因素有助于提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性，相比传统载体更具优势。

4. 反应机理：研究表明催化剂表面存在两种类型的活性位点(M1和M2)。M2位点由锚定在SnOx表面的Pt颗粒形成，是PDH反应的主要活性位点，通过将Sn掺入SBA-15结构中得到促进。

5. H2预处理的影响：催化剂在反应前在H2下原位还原，这可能影响了金属物种的氧化态及其与载体的相互作用。

6. 失活：积炭是催化剂失活的主要原因。Sn掺杂的SBA-15催化剂比浸渍法制备的催化剂表现出更低的积炭沉积，表明其具有更好的抗失活能力。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及晶格氧物种，但它强调了金属-载体相互作用和金属物种氧化态在决定PDH反应中催化剂性能和稳定性方面的重要性。
