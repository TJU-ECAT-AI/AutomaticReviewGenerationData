[1] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2."

[2] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support powder was impregnated with a H2PtCl6·6H2O precursor dissolved in deionized water."

[3] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample showed the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%, and the lowest deactivation parameter (12.6%) after reaction for 6 h."

[4] "Introduction of an excessive amount of Sn decreased the catalyst stability. The stabilities of the catalysts decreased in the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM > Pt/2Sn-SBA-15."

[5] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites. In this case, more stable M2 active sites are present in the Sn-incorporated catalyst and a better catalytic performance is obtained."

The literature primarily focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn from the provided information:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports demonstrate high specific surface areas and ordered mesoporous structures, which can help improve metal dispersion and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst preparation: The one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating Sn into SBA-15 showed better performance compared to the traditional impregnation method, resulting in stronger interactions between metal species and the support.

3. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH reactions, with 98.5% propene selectivity and 43.8% propane conversion. This suggests that metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts can offer advantages over traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The study mentions M1 and M2 active sites, with M2 sites being the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support promote the development of M2 sites, leading to better catalytic performance.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Excessive Sn content decreased catalyst stability. The study also observed coke deposition as a major cause of deactivation.

6. H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 before the reaction, which likely influenced their performance.

While the document does not directly address lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports, it does provide insights into the advantages of using ordered mesoporous silica supports for PDH reactions, particularly in terms of metal dispersion, catalyst stability, and selectivity.

这篇文献主要关注了以SBA-15为载体的Pt-Sn催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非以MCM-41和SBA-15为载体的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们仍可从提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15载体表现出高比表面积和有序介孔结构，这有助于提高金属分散度和催化剂稳定性。

2. 催化剂制备：将Sn引入SBA-15的一锅水热合成法比传统浸渍法表现更好，导致金属物种与载体之间的相互作用更强。

3. 催化行为：Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂在PDH反应中表现出色，丙烯选择性达98.5%，丙烷转化率为43.8%。这表明金属-有序介孔硅催化剂可能比传统载体具有优势。

4. 反应机理：研究提到了M1和M2活性位点，其中M2位点是丙烷脱氢的主要活性位点。Sn物种与载体之间增强的相互作用促进了M2位点的发展，从而提高了催化性能。

5. 催化剂失活：过量的Sn含量降低了催化剂的稳定性。研究还观察到焦炭沉积是导致失活的主要原因。

6. H2预处理：催化剂在反应前在H2下原位还原，这可能影响了它们的性能。

虽然文档没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或与传统金属氧化物载体的性能比较，但它确实提供了关于使用有序介孔硅载体进行PDH反应的优势见解，特别是在金属分散、催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。
