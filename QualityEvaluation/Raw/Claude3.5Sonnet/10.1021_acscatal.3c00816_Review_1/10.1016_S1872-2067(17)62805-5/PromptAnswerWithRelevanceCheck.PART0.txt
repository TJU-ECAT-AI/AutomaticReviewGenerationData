[1] "Pt-based catalysts show good initial activities in propane dehydrogenation; this is because Pt activates CH bonds without promoting CC cleavage"

[2] "The introduction of Sn promoters into a Pt-based catalytic system effectively improves the catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operating lifetime of the catalyst"

[3] "The use of SBA-15 as a support for Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation may therefore be an excellent choice . The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 enables it to confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles and prevent particle agglomeration, making it a good host"

[4] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2."

[5] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

The literature focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 or SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn:

Advantages of metal-OMS catalysts in PDH:
1. High surface area and ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allow good dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles.
2. The confinement effect of mesoporous channels prevents particle agglomeration.
3. Incorporation of promoters like Sn improves catalytic activity, coke resistance, and catalyst lifetime.

Reaction mechanism and performance:
1. Pt activates C-H bonds without promoting C-C cleavage, leading to good initial PDH activity.
2. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying Pt properties and enhancing performance.
3. Optimal Pt-Sn ratio is crucial for best performance (e.g., Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 showed best results).

Factors influencing performance:
1. Catalyst pretreatment: Reduction under H2 at 500°C for 1 hour was used.
2. Metal-support interactions affect stability of active species and resistance to sintering.
3. Sn content influences the oxidation state of active species and their interactions with the support.

The literature does not directly discuss lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions.

[1] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2. The reaction conditions were 580 C, atmospheric pressure, propane:Ar = 7:3 (molar ratio), and propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 8.25 h1."

[2] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

[3] "The catalytic activity and stability of Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 were significantly better than those of Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM because of improved metal dispersion and enhanced interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support."

[4] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites. In this case, more stable M2 active sites are present in the Sn-incorporated catalyst and a better catalytic performance is obtained."

[5] "The amounts of coke deposited followed the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 (6.6%) < Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 (6.9%) < Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM (11.2%) < Pt/2Sn-SBA-15 (11.4%)."

The literature primarily focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels.

2. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH, with 43.8% propane conversion and 98.5% propene selectivity. This performance was superior to that of the traditionally impregnated catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM).

3. Advantages: Metal-OMS catalysts demonstrate improved metal dispersion, enhanced interactions between metal species and support, and better stabilization of active sites. These factors contribute to higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests the presence of two types of active sites (M1 and M2) on the catalyst surface. M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.

5. Influence of H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 before the reaction, which likely affected the oxidation state of the metal species and their interactions with the support.

6. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation.

While the study does not directly address lattice oxygen species, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of metal species in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Sn掺杂的SBA-15负载Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，而非VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 结构性质：SBA-15载体提供高比表面积和有序的介孔结构，可以改善金属分散性并将金属颗粒限制在孔道内。

2. 催化行为：Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂在PDH反应中表现出色，丙烷转化率为43.8%，丙烯选择性为98.5%。这种性能优于传统浸渍法制备的催化剂(Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM)。

3. 优势：金属-OMS催化剂表现出更好的金属分散性、增强的金属物种与载体之间的相互作用，以及更好的活性位点稳定性。这些因素有助于提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性，相比传统载体更具优势。

4. 反应机理：研究表明催化剂表面存在两种类型的活性位点(M1和M2)。M2位点由锚定在SnOx表面的Pt颗粒形成，是PDH反应的主要活性位点，通过将Sn掺入SBA-15结构中得到促进。

5. H2预处理的影响：催化剂在反应前在H2下原位还原，这可能影响了金属物种的氧化态及其与载体的相互作用。

6. 失活：积炭是催化剂失活的主要原因。Sn掺杂的SBA-15催化剂比浸渍法制备的催化剂表现出更低的积炭沉积，表明其具有更好的抗失活能力。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及晶格氧物种，但它强调了金属-载体相互作用和金属物种氧化态在决定PDH反应中催化剂性能和稳定性方面的重要性。

The literature focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn:

SBA-15 as a support offers advantages in PDH reactions due to its mesoporous structure, which helps confine and stabilize metal nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration. This structural property enhances catalyst performance compared to traditional supports.

The incorporation of Sn into SBA-15 improved catalytic activity and stability compared to impregnation methods. The best performing catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15) achieved 98.5% propene selectivity with 43.8% propane conversion.

The reaction mechanism involves different types of active sites: M1 sites responsible for side reactions and coking, and M2 sites which are the main active sites for PDH. The distribution and nature of these sites affect catalyst performance.

While not directly addressed in this study, lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment likely influence the oxidation state and dispersion of metal species, which in turn affects catalyst performance and deactivation. However, the specific effects on VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions are not discussed in this literature.

The literature primarily focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, we can extract some relevant information about metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 materials exhibit high specific surface areas and highly ordered mesoporous structures. The incorporation of metal species (in this case, Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix does not significantly alter the mesoporous characteristics of the support.

2. Advantages: 
   a) Enhanced interactions between metal species and support
   b) Improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional impregnation methods
   c) Better maintenance of metal oxidation states during reactions
   d) Confinement effect of mesoporous structure stabilizes metal particles

3. Catalytic behavior: The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts showed excellent performance in PDH reactions, with the best catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15) achieving 98.5% propene selectivity and 43.8% propane conversion.

4. Reaction mechanism: While not explicitly discussed for VOx and CrOx catalysts, the study suggests that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 helps confine and stabilize metal nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration and enhancing catalyst stability during PDH reactions.

5. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn in this case) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment effects on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. To fully address these aspects, additional research focusing on those specific catalyst systems would be necessary.
