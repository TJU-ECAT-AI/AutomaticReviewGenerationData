[1] "A series of Sn-incorporated SBA-15 materials with high specific surface areas and highly ordered mesoporous structures were synthesized by a facile one-pot method and used as catalyst supports."

[2] "The incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, and these helped to maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction."

[3] "The catalytic activities and stabilities of the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 were better than those of the impregnated sample."

[4] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst gave the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%."

[5] "The shapes of the xSn-SBA-15 isotherms were similar to that of SBA-15, indicating that the characteristics of the mesoporous material were retained."

[6] "Confinement by the mesoporous structure helped to stabilize the metal particles, which enhanced the catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation"

The literature primarily focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, we can extract some relevant information about metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 materials exhibit high specific surface areas and highly ordered mesoporous structures. The incorporation of metal species (in this case, Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix does not significantly alter the mesoporous characteristics of the support.

2. Advantages: 
   a) Enhanced interactions between metal species and support
   b) Improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional impregnation methods
   c) Better maintenance of metal oxidation states during reactions
   d) Confinement effect of mesoporous structure stabilizes metal particles

3. Catalytic behavior: The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts showed excellent performance in PDH reactions, with the best catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15) achieving 98.5% propene selectivity and 43.8% propane conversion.

4. Reaction mechanism: While not explicitly discussed for VOx and CrOx catalysts, the study suggests that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 helps confine and stabilize metal nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration and enhancing catalyst stability during PDH reactions.

5. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn in this case) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment effects on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. To fully address these aspects, additional research focusing on those specific catalyst systems would be necessary.

该文献主要关注锡掺杂的SBA-15负载铂催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，而非MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以提取一些关于金属-有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂用于PDH反应的相关信息：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15材料具有高比表面积和高度有序的介孔结构。将金属物种（在本例中为Sn）掺入SBA-15基质中并不显著改变载体的介孔特性。

2. 优势：
   a) 增强了金属物种和载体之间的相互作用
   b) 与传统浸渍方法相比，催化活性和稳定性得到改善
   c) 在反应过程中能更好地维持金属的氧化态
   d) 介孔结构的限域效应稳定了金属颗粒

3. 催化行为：锡掺杂的SBA-15负载铂催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优异的性能，最佳催化剂(Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15)达到了98.5%的丙烯选择性和43.8%的丙烷转化率。

4. 反应机理：虽然没有明确讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂，但研究表明SBA-15的介孔结构有助于限制和稳定金属纳米颗粒，防止团聚并增强催化剂在PDH反应中的稳定性。

5. 金属-载体相互作用的影响：金属物种（本例中为Sn）与载体之间的强相互作用有助于在反应过程中维持金属的氧化态，这对催化剂的性能和稳定性至关重要。

文献并未提供关于晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活影响的具体信息。要全面解决这些方面的问题，需要进行针对这些特定催化剂体系的额外研究。
