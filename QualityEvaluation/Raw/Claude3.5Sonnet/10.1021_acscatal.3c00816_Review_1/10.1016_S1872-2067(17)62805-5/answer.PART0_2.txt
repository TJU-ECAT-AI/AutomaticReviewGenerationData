The literature focuses on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn:

SBA-15 as a support offers advantages in PDH reactions due to its mesoporous structure, which helps confine and stabilize metal nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration. This structural property enhances catalyst performance compared to traditional supports.

The incorporation of Sn into SBA-15 improved catalytic activity and stability compared to impregnation methods. The best performing catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15) achieved 98.5% propene selectivity with 43.8% propane conversion.

The reaction mechanism involves different types of active sites: M1 sites responsible for side reactions and coking, and M2 sites which are the main active sites for PDH. The distribution and nature of these sites affect catalyst performance.

While not directly addressed in this study, lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment likely influence the oxidation state and dispersion of metal species, which in turn affects catalyst performance and deactivation. However, the specific effects on VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions are not discussed in this literature.

该文献主要关注Sn掺杂SBA-15负载的Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。但仍可得出一些见解：

作为载体的SBA-15在PDH反应中具有优势，其介孔结构有助于限制和稳定金属纳米粒子，防止团聚。这种结构特性提高了催化剂性能，相比传统载体更具优势。

将Sn掺入SBA-15中可以提高催化活性和稳定性，相比浸渍法效果更好。性能最佳的催化剂(Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15)实现了98.5%的丙烯选择性和43.8%的丙烷转化率。

反应机理涉及不同类型的活性位点：负责副反应和积碳的M1位点，以及PDH主要活性位点M2。这些位点的分布和性质影响催化剂性能。

虽然本研究未直接涉及，但晶格氧物种和H2预处理可能会影响金属物种的氧化态和分散度，从而影响催化剂性能和失活。然而，本文献并未讨论这些因素对VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的具体影响。
