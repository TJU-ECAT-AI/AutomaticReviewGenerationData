Short communication
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over unconventional Pb/SiO2 catalysts
Highlights
•
Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
•
PbO and metallic Pb species are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.
•
Deactivation is due to agglomeration and loss of Pb species, and coke.
•
Dehydrogenation activity can be partially recovered by regeneration with air.
Abstract
Similar to Sn-based catalysts, Pb, located at the same main group ( A), also exhibits a high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation when supported on silica. This study proves that both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species play the key role in propane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction. The dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere, while the loss of Pb species and incomplete redispersion of the agglomerated Pb species results in irreversible deactivation.

1. Introduction
In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance. However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand. Accordingly, there is a growing desire for cheap and environment-friendly catalysts. Therefore, developing an alternative to these two commercial catalysts has been stimulated in both industry and academia nowadays

In the past few years, C, the fourth group nonmetallic element, has been proved to possess catalytic activity for both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Among them, the active carbon samples not only include the artificially synthesized carbon materials

. As one of the fourth group metallic element, Sn species have also been proved to exhibit surprisingly high dehydrogenation activity and propene selectivity in our previous work, which break the common sense that Sn species are merely the effective promoter of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation

and Sn2+ species

[14]
have both been regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation. Even though the coke deposition and the loss of Sn species due to its low melting point lead to catalyst deactivation, incorporating the Sn species into zeolite framework (such as hexagonal mesoporous silica and Beta zeolite)
[12]

[15]
and improving the dispersion of isolated Sn2+ species
[14]
can efficiently inhibit the reduction and agglomeration of Sn oxides, and further result in a better stability even after oxidation regeneration. In addition, the dehydrogenation behavior of Sn/SiO2 catalyst is even comparable to that of PtSn catalyst. These above-mentioned findings provide us with new insights into research and development of alkane dehydrogenation catalyst. We wonder whether or not the other elements located in the fourth group of periodic table can catalyze propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, we explored the potential of Pb/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propene in this study.
2. Experimental
A series of Pb/SiO2 catalysts with different Pb loadings were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method with corresponding amounts of lead acetate solution. Then, these samples were dried at 140 C overnight and calcined at 600 C for 4 h. Here, the as-prepared samples are donated as xPb/SiO2, where x is the loading content of Pb by weight. The prepared catalyst calcined under N2 atmosphere is marked as 15Pb/SiO2-N2. In addition, 15Pb/SiO2-MO, 15Pb/SiO2-M, 5Pb/SiO2-M catalysts and 15Pb/HMS catalyst were also prepared in this study. The preparation details are given in the
