[1] "Pt-based catalyst has been broadly applied in alkane dehydrogenation reaction, owing to its excellent ability in activating CH bonds and conserving simultaneously the CC bonds"

[2] "SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

[3] "The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

[4] "The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized."

[5] "With the presence of Mg, the role of tin promoter could be reflected more sufficiently. As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was more active and could more easily transfer to the support"

The literature primarily focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn about the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions.

SBA-15 shows potential as a catalyst support for PDH due to its well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure. This structure is beneficial for confining and stabilizing metal nanoparticles, leading to higher dispersion and preventing agglomeration. The confinement effect of SBA-15's channels helps stabilize metallic particles and improve sintering resistance, enhancing catalytic stability during PDH reactions.

The addition of Mg to the SBA-15 support further improves catalyst performance. Mg helps restrain the reduction of Sn species and stabilize their oxidation states, promoting the formation of more active M2 sites. This leads to better catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

The presence of Sn as a promoter in Pt-Sn catalysts decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles through a geometric effect. This modification makes it more difficult for hydrocarbons to form multiple carbon-metal bonds, resulting in more active coke precursors that can easily transfer to the support. This effect is enhanced by the presence of Mg.

While the literature does not directly compare OMS supports to traditional metal oxide supports, it highlights the advantages of using SBA-15 as a support for PDH catalysts. These include improved metal dispersion, enhanced stability, and better coke resistance. The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 plays a crucial role in these improvements.

The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for OMS-supported catalysts. However, it does highlight the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of active species in determining catalyst performance and stability.

这篇文献主要关注了以SBA-15为载体的Pt-Sn催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而不是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们仍可以从中得到一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解。

SBA-15由于其良好定义的有序介孔结构，显示出作为PDH催化剂载体的潜力。这种结构有利于限制和稳定金属纳米粒子，导致更高的分散度并防止团聚。SBA-15通道的限制效应有助于稳定金属粒子并提高抗烧结性，从而增强PDH反应过程中的催化稳定性。

向SBA-15载体中添加Mg可进一步改善催化剂性能。Mg有助于抑制Sn物种的还原并稳定其氧化态，促进更多活性M2位点的形成。这导致PDH反应中更好的催化性能。

在Pt-Sn催化剂中，Sn作为助剂通过几何效应减小了表面Pt集合体的尺寸。这种修饰使碳氢化合物更难形成多重碳-金属键，结果是生成更活跃的焦炭前体，可以容易地转移到载体上。这种效应因Mg的存在而得到增强。

虽然文献没有直接比较OMS载体和传统金属氧化物载体，但它强调了使用SBA-15作为PDH催化剂载体的优势。这些优势包括改善金属分散度、增强稳定性和更好的抗焦性。SBA-15的有序介孔结构在这些改进中起着关键作用。

文献没有具体讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活的影响。然而，它确实强调了金属-载体相互作用和活性物种氧化态在决定催化剂性能和稳定性方面的重要性。

The literature primarily focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for stabilizing and dispersing metal nanoparticles like Pt. This helps prevent agglomeration and improves catalyst performance.

2. Advantages: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allows for higher dispersion of metal nanoparticles and better confinement, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional supports.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The literature suggests that PDH occurs on metallic sites (e.g., Pt), with the support playing a crucial role in metal dispersion and stability.

4. Catalyst deactivation: Carbon deposition is a major cause of deactivation. The presence of promoters like Mg can facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

5. Influence of support modification: Incorporating Mg into SBA-15 enhances the interaction between metal species (Pt, Sn) and the support, stabilizes the oxidation state of promoters (Sn), and improves overall catalytic performance.

6. Role of acidity: The acidity of the catalyst can hinder olefin desorption and promote secondary reactions, leading to carbon deposition. Modifying the support (e.g., with Mg) can help reduce acidity and improve selectivity.

While the literature does not directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates the importance of support properties and modifications in influencing metal-support interactions, metal dispersion, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for hosting and stabilizing metal nanoparticles. This structure helps achieve higher dispersion of metal particles and prevents agglomeration.

2. Catalytic behavior: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 provides a confinement effect that stabilizes metallic particles and improves sintering resistance, leading to increased catalytic stability during PDH reactions.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of promoters (e.g., Sn in PtSn catalysts) can modify the surface structure of active metal sites, affecting the reaction mechanism. For instance, Sn decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, which inhibits the formation of multiple carbon-metal bonds and facilitates the transfer of coke precursors to the support.

5. Influence of factors: The oxidation state of metal species (e.g., Sn) can significantly impact catalyst performance. Stabilizing these oxidation states through support modification (e.g., Mg addition) can lead to the formation of more active sites and improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not specifically address lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it suggests that modifying the support and stabilizing the oxidation states of metal species can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
