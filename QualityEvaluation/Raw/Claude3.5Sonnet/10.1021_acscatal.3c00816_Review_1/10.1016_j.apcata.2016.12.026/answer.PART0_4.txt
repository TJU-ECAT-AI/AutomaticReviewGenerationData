[1] "PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, the initial conversion of propane was 35.7% and then reduced to 27.2% after 6 h reaction."

[2] "The catalytic activity and stability were clearly enhanced when 14 wt.% Mg was introduced into the catalysts."

[3] "PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 prepared by one-pot method exhibited better catalytic activity than PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM."

[4] "The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a maximum initial propane conversion of 43.0% among all the samples."

[5] "The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites."

[6] "Generally, M1 sites were connected with the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and coking, whereas the M2 sites were responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane."

The literature does not directly compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Instead, it focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15. However, we can extract some relevant information about SBA-15 supported catalysts for PDH:

1. SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts show good initial activity for propane dehydrogenation, with conversions around 35-43% depending on the modification.

2. Modifying SBA-15 with magnesium (1-4 wt%) enhances the catalytic activity and stability of PtSn catalysts for PDH.

3. The one-pot synthesis method for incorporating Mg into SBA-15 results in better catalytic performance compared to the impregnation method.

4. The presence of Mg in SBA-15 helps stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, which promotes the formation of M2 active sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 helps confine and stabilize metal particles, improving sintering resistance during the reaction.

6. Modification of SBA-15 with Mg affects the acidity of the catalyst and the distribution of active sites, which influences coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

While the literature doesn't discuss lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment specifically for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it does highlight the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation state of active species in determining catalyst performance for PDH reactions.

该文献并未直接比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现。相反，它主要关注了Mg改性SBA-15负载的PtSn催化剂。然而，我们可以从中提取一些关于SBA-15负载催化剂用于PDH的相关信息：

1. SBA-15负载的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的初始活性，根据改性程度不同，转化率在35-43%左右。

2. 用镁(1-4 wt%)改性SBA-15可以提高PtSn催化剂在PDH反应中的催化活性和稳定性。

3. 采用一锅法将Mg引入SBA-15的方法比浸渍法得到的催化剂表现出更好的催化性能。

4. SBA-15中Mg的存在有助于稳定Sn的氧化态，这促进了负责丙烷脱氢的M2活性位点的形成。

5. SBA-15的有序介孔结构有助于限制和稳定金属颗粒，提高反应过程中的抗烧结能力。

6. 用Mg改性SBA-15影响了催化剂的酸度和活性位点的分布，这进而影响了积炭形成和催化剂失活。

虽然文献没有具体讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂的晶格氧物种或H2预处理，但它确实强调了金属-载体相互作用和活性物种氧化态在决定PDH反应催化剂性能方面的重要性。
