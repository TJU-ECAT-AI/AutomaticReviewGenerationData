The literature primarily focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for stabilizing and dispersing metal nanoparticles like Pt. This helps prevent agglomeration and improves catalyst performance.

2. Advantages: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allows for higher dispersion of metal nanoparticles and better confinement, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional supports.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The literature suggests that PDH occurs on metallic sites (e.g., Pt), with the support playing a crucial role in metal dispersion and stability.

4. Catalyst deactivation: Carbon deposition is a major cause of deactivation. The presence of promoters like Mg can facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

5. Influence of support modification: Incorporating Mg into SBA-15 enhances the interaction between metal species (Pt, Sn) and the support, stabilizes the oxidation state of promoters (Sn), and improves overall catalytic performance.

6. Role of acidity: The acidity of the catalyst can hinder olefin desorption and promote secondary reactions, leading to carbon deposition. Modifying the support (e.g., with Mg) can help reduce acidity and improve selectivity.

While the literature does not directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates the importance of support properties and modifications in influencing metal-support interactions, metal dispersion, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注以Mg改性SBA-15为载体的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH），而非MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂用于PDH的见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15具有良好定义的有序介孔结构，适合稳定和分散如Pt等金属纳米粒子。这有助于防止团聚并提高催化剂性能。

2. 优势：SBA-15的有序介孔结构允许更高的金属纳米粒子分散度和更好的限制，与传统载体相比，这导致了更好的催化活性和稳定性。

3. 反应机理：文献表明PDH发生在金属位点（如Pt）上，载体在金属分散和稳定性方面起着关键作用。

4. 催化剂失活：碳沉积是失活的主要原因。像Mg这样的助剂的存在可以促进碳沉积物从活性金属位点转移到载体上，可能改善催化剂寿命。

5. 载体改性的影响：将Mg引入SBA-15增强了金属物种（Pt，Sn）与载体之间的相互作用，稳定了助剂（Sn）的氧化态，并改善了整体催化性能。

6. 酸性的作用：催化剂的酸性可能阻碍烯烃脱附并促进副反应，导致碳沉积。改性载体（如用Mg）可以帮助减少酸性并提高选择性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及VOx和CrOx催化剂的晶格氧物种或H2预处理，但它证明了载体性质和改性在影响金属-载体相互作用、金属分散度和PDH反应中催化剂稳定性方面的重要性。
