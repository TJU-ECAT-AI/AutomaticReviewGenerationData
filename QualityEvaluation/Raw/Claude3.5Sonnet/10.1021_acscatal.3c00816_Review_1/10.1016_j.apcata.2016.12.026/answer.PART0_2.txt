[1] "SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

[2] "The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

[3] "The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized."

[4] "As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was more active and could more easily transfer to the support"

The literature primarily focuses on Mg-modified SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn regarding the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for hosting and stabilizing metal nanoparticles. This structure helps achieve higher dispersion of metal particles and prevents agglomeration.

2. Catalytic behavior: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 provides a confinement effect that stabilizes metallic particles and improves sintering resistance, leading to increased catalytic stability during PDH reactions.

3. Advantages: OMS supports like SBA-15 offer better metal dispersion, improved stability, and enhanced resistance to sintering compared to traditional supports. They also allow for better control of particle size and distribution.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of promoters (e.g., Sn in PtSn catalysts) can modify the surface structure of active metal sites, affecting the reaction mechanism. For instance, Sn decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, which inhibits the formation of multiple carbon-metal bonds and facilitates the transfer of coke precursors to the support.

5. Influence of factors: The oxidation state of metal species (e.g., Sn) can significantly impact catalyst performance. Stabilizing these oxidation states through support modification (e.g., Mg addition) can lead to the formation of more active sites and improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not specifically address lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it suggests that modifying the support and stabilizing the oxidation states of metal species can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Mg改性的SBA-15负载PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，而非VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15具有良好定义的有序介孔结构，使其适合作为金属纳米颗粒的载体和稳定剂。这种结构有助于获得更高的金属颗粒分散度并防止团聚。

2. 催化行为：SBA-15的有序介孔结构提供了一种限域效应，可以稳定金属颗粒并提高抗烧结能力，从而在PDH反应过程中提高催化稳定性。

3. 优势：与传统载体相比，OMS载体如SBA-15提供了更好的金属分散性、改善的稳定性和增强的抗烧结能力。它们还允许更好地控制粒子尺寸和分布。

4. 反应机理：助剂（如PtSn催化剂中的Sn）的存在可以修饰活性金属位点的表面结构，影响反应机理。例如，Sn减小了表面Pt集合体的尺寸，这抑制了多重碳-金属键的形成，并促进了焦炭前体向载体的转移。

5. 影响因素：金属物种（如Sn）的氧化态可以显著影响催化剂性能。通过载体改性（如添加Mg）来稳定这些氧化态可以导致形成更多活性位点并改善催化性能。

虽然文献没有具体讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理，但它表明，通过改性载体和稳定金属物种的氧化态可以影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活。
