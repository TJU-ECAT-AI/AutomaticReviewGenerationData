[1] "SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

[2] "PtSn catalysts supported on various materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 have been extensively studied for dehydrogenation of propane"

[3] "The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

[4] "The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support."

The literature primarily focuses on SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than MCM-41 or VOx/CrOx catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

SBA-15 shows potential in propane dehydrogenation due to its well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure. This structure allows for better confinement and stabilization of metal nanoparticles, leading to higher dispersion and prevention of agglomeration. 

Compared to traditional supports like Al2O3 and SiO2, SBA-15 offers improved catalytic stability in PDH reactions. The confinement effect of SBA-15's channels helps stabilize metallic particles and improve sintering resistance.

The study focuses on Mg-modified SBA-15 supports for PtSn catalysts. Incorporating appropriate amounts of Mg modified the metallic phase characteristics and strengthened interactions between platinum, tin species, and the support. This led to improved catalyst performance.

Mg incorporation also stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated coke migration from active metal to support, which can help mitigate deactivation.

While the literature doesn't directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment, it suggests that modifying the support (e.g., with Mg) can significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions by altering metal-support interactions and coke formation processes.

该文献主要关注SBA-15负载的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应,而非MCM-41或VOx/CrOx催化剂。然而,我们可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂在PDH反应中的见解:

由于其良好定义和有序的介孔结构,SBA-15在丙烷脱氢中显示出潜力。这种结构允许更好地限制和稳定金属纳米粒子,从而导致更高的分散度并防止团聚。

与传统的Al2O3和SiO2等载体相比,SBA-15在PDH反应中提供了更好的催化稳定性。SBA-15通道的限制效应有助于稳定金属粒子并提高抗烧结性。

该研究重点关注PtSn催化剂的Mg改性SBA-15载体。适量掺入Mg改变了金属相的特性,并增强了铂、锡物种与载体之间的相互作用。这导致了催化剂性能的改善。

Mg的掺入还稳定了Sn的氧化态,并促进了焦炭从活性金属向载体迁移,这有助于减缓失活。

虽然文献没有直接涉及晶格氧物种或H2预处理,但它暗示通过改性载体(如掺入Mg)可以显著影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活,这是通过改变金属-载体相互作用和焦炭形成过程来实现的。
