The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction significantly influences the performance of Co@MCM-41 catalysts in PDH. The prereduction process causes a multistage migration of framework Co2+ to extraframework Co0 species, which affects the catalyst's structure and activity.

Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show optimal performance, with 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. This improved performance is attributed to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM-41 channels.

However, higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. This suggests that the size and distribution of metal particles play a crucial role in catalyst performance.

The study highlights that hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and the silica support, which determines the catalyst's performance in propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation. This interaction between metal species and the support is likely a key factor in the performance of other metal-OMS catalysts as well.

While the literature does not directly compare OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports, it does demonstrate the importance of metal-support interactions and the potential for tailoring catalyst properties through pretreatment methods in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们仍可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中的见解。

研究表明，氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的性能有显著影响。预还原过程导致框架Co2+向框架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移，这影响了催化剂的结构和活性。

在650-700°C下还原的催化剂表现出最佳性能，反应速率比未还原催化剂高2-3倍。这种性能改善归因于MCM-41孔道中同时存在框架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇。

然而，更高的预还原温度（750-800°C）会导致大型Co颗粒的形成，从而降低反应速率和丙烯选择性，并引起严重的积碳问题。这表明金属颗粒的尺寸和分布对催化剂性能起着关键作用。

研究强调，氢气预还原调节了Co物种与硅支撑体之间的相互作用，这决定了催化剂在丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成方面的性能。这种金属物种与支撑体之间的相互作用可能也是其他金属-OMS催化剂性能的关键因素。

虽然文献没有直接比较OMS催化剂和传统金属氧化物支撑体，但它确实展示了金属-支撑体相互作用的重要性，以及通过预处理方法调整催化剂性能在PDH反应中的潜力。
