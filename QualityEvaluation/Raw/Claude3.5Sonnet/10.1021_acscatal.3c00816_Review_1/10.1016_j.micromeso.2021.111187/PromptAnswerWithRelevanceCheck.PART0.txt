The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support for cobalt catalysts, providing confined channels for metal species.

2. H2 pretreatment influence: Hydrogen prereduction significantly affects catalyst performance by tuning the interaction between metal species and the silica support. It causes multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species.

3. Catalyst performance: Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters in MCM-41 channels.

4. Deactivation: Higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition.

5. Reaction mechanism: The performance of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is determined by propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation, which are influenced by the metal-support interaction.

While the literature does not directly compare OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss lattice oxygen species, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the effects of prereduction on catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非VOx和CrOx负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的催化剂。然而，我们仍可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41被用作钴催化剂的载体，为金属物种提供了受限的通道。

2. H2预处理的影响：氢气预还原通过调节金属物种与硅支撑体之间的相互作用，显著影响催化剂性能。它导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移。

3. 催化剂性能：在650-700°C下还原的催化剂显示出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率，这是由于MCM-41通道中同时存在骨架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇。

4. 失活：更高的预还原温度（750-800°C）导致大颗粒Co的形成，resulting in反应速率降低、丙烯选择性降低和严重的积碳问题。

5. 反应机理：Co催化的PDH反应性能由丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成决定，这些过程受金属-载体相互作用的影响。

虽然该文献没有直接比较OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体，也没有讨论晶格氧物种，但它强调了金属-载体相互作用的重要性，以及预还原对催化剂结构和PDH反应性能的影响。

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction significantly influences the performance of Co@MCM-41 catalysts in PDH. The prereduction process causes a multistage migration of framework Co2+ to extraframework Co0 species, which affects the catalyst's structure and activity.

Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show optimal performance, with 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. This improved performance is attributed to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM-41 channels.

However, higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. This suggests that the size and distribution of metal particles play a crucial role in catalyst performance.

The study highlights that hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and the silica support, which determines the catalyst's performance in propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation. This interaction between metal species and the support is likely a key factor in the performance of other metal-OMS catalysts as well.

While the literature does not directly compare OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports, it does demonstrate the importance of metal-support interactions and the potential for tailoring catalyst properties through pretreatment methods in PDH reactions.

The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, it provides insights into the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions.

Co@MCM-41 catalysts show improved performance after hydrogen prereduction treatment. This treatment causes the migration of framework Co2+ to extraframework Co0 species, which affects the catalyst's structure and performance. Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in MCM-41 channels.

The hydrogen prereduction temperature plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. While moderate temperatures (650-700°C) improve performance, higher temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and increased coke deposition.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction can tune the interaction between metal species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in PDH reactions. This highlights the importance of optimizing pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired catalyst performance.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined structure of MCM-41 plays a role in the catalyst's performance by limiting the size of metal clusters and influencing metal-support interactions.

The literature focuses specifically on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than providing a broad comparison of various metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts. However, it offers insights into the performance of MCM-41 supported cobalt catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study investigates the effect of hydrogen pre-reduction on Co@MCM-41 catalysts. Pre-reduction causes a multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species, which influences catalyst performance. Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C contain both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters within MCM-41 channels, exhibiting 2-3 times higher reaction rates in PDH compared to unreduced catalysts.

The interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, tuned by hydrogen pre-reduction, determines the catalytic performance in terms of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation. This highlights the importance of metal-support interactions in OMS catalysts for PDH reactions.

However, excessive pre-reduction at higher temperatures (750-800°C) leads to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. This demonstrates that optimal catalyst performance depends on achieving a balance in metal particle size and metal-support interaction.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined space within MCM-41 channels can help control metal particle size and distribution, which is crucial for catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

The research does not explicitly discuss lattice oxygen species, but it does highlight the role of hydrogen pre-treatment in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation, particularly through its effect on coke formation.

这篇文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而不是对各种金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂进行广泛比较。然而，它提供了关于MCM-41负载钴催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解。

研究调查了氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂的影响。预还原导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移，这影响了催化剂的性能。在650-700°C下还原的催化剂含有骨架Co2+离子和MCM-41通道内的小尺寸Co0纳米簇，在PDH反应中表现出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率。

钴物种与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用，通过氢气预还原调节，决定了催化性能，包括丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成。这突出了金属-载体相互作用在OMS催化剂PDH反应中的重要性。

然而，在更高温度(750-800°C)下过度预还原会导致大颗粒Co的形成，resulting in反应速率降低、丙烯选择性下降和严重的积碳问题。这表明最佳催化剂性能取决于金属颗粒大小和金属-载体相互作用的平衡。

虽然研究没有直接将MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，但它表明MCM-41通道内的受限空间可以帮助控制金属颗粒大小和分布，这对PDH反应中的催化剂性能至关重要。

研究没有明确讨论晶格氧物种，但确实强调了氢气预处理在影响催化剂性能和失活方面的作用，特别是通过其对积碳形成的影响。
