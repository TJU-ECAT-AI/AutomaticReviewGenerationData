The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of various Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, it does offer insights into the performance of MCM-41 supported cobalt catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction significantly influences the performance of Co@MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions. The prereduction process causes a multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ ions to extra-framework Co0 species, which affects the catalyst's structure and activity.

Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C showed optimal performance, with 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. This improved performance is attributed to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM-41 channels.

However, higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) led to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and increased coke deposition. This suggests that the size and distribution of metal particles play a crucial role in catalyst performance.

The study highlights that hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation. This demonstrates the importance of metal-support interactions in determining catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it emphasizes the advantages of using ordered mesoporous materials like MCM-41 as catalyst supports, particularly in terms of controlling metal particle size and distribution.

The research does not explicitly discuss lattice oxygen species, but it does indicate that the chemical state of cobalt (Co2+ vs. Co0) influences catalyst performance, which may be related to the role of oxygen species in the reaction mechanism.

In summary, this study provides valuable insights into the performance of Co@MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of hydrogen prereduction, metal-support interactions, and metal particle size in determining catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.

该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现，而不是全面比较各种金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂。然而，它确实提供了MCM-41负载钴催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解。

研究表明，氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的性能有显著影响。预还原过程导致骨架Co2+离子向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移，这影响了催化剂的结构和活性。

在650-700°C下还原的催化剂表现出最佳性能，反应速率比未还原催化剂高2-3倍。这种性能提升归因于骨架Co2+离子和限制在MCM-41通道中的小尺寸Co0纳米簇的共同存在。

然而，更高的预还原温度（750-800°C）导致大型Co颗粒的形成，resulting in反应速率下降，丙烯选择性降低，以及严重的积碳问题。这表明金属粒子的尺寸和分布在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

研究强调，氢气预还原调节了Co物种与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用，进而影响丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成。这表明金属-载体相互作用在决定PDH反应中催化剂性能方面的重要性。

虽然该研究没有直接比较MCM-41和传统金属氧化物载体，但它强调了使用有序介孔材料（如MCM-41）作为催化剂载体的优势，特别是在控制金属粒子尺寸和分布方面。

研究没有明确讨论晶格氧物种，但确实指出钴的化学状态（Co2+与Co0）影响催化剂性能，这可能与氧物种在反应机理中的作用有关。

总之，这项研究为Co@MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的性能提供了有价值的见解，强调了氢气预还原、金属-载体相互作用和金属粒子尺寸在决定催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性方面的重要性。
