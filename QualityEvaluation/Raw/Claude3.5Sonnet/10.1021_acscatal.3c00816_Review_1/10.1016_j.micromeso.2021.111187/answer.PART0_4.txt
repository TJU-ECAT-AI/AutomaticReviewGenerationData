The literature focuses specifically on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than providing a broad comparison of various metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts. However, it offers insights into the performance of MCM-41 supported cobalt catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study investigates the effect of hydrogen pre-reduction on Co@MCM-41 catalysts. Pre-reduction causes a multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species, which influences catalyst performance. Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C contain both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters within MCM-41 channels, exhibiting 2-3 times higher reaction rates in PDH compared to unreduced catalysts.

The interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, tuned by hydrogen pre-reduction, determines the catalytic performance in terms of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation. This highlights the importance of metal-support interactions in OMS catalysts for PDH reactions.

However, excessive pre-reduction at higher temperatures (750-800°C) leads to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. This demonstrates that optimal catalyst performance depends on achieving a balance in metal particle size and metal-support interaction.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined space within MCM-41 channels can help control metal particle size and distribution, which is crucial for catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

The research does not explicitly discuss lattice oxygen species, but it does highlight the role of hydrogen pre-treatment in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation, particularly through its effect on coke formation.

这篇文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而不是对各种金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂进行广泛比较。然而，它提供了关于MCM-41负载钴催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解。

研究调查了氢气预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂的影响。预还原导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移，这影响了催化剂的性能。在650-700°C下还原的催化剂含有骨架Co2+离子和MCM-41通道内的小尺寸Co0纳米簇，在PDH反应中表现出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率。

钴物种与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用，通过氢气预还原调节，决定了催化性能，包括丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成。这突出了金属-载体相互作用在OMS催化剂PDH反应中的重要性。

然而，在更高温度(750-800°C)下过度预还原会导致大颗粒Co的形成，resulting in反应速率降低、丙烯选择性下降和严重的积碳问题。这表明最佳催化剂性能取决于金属颗粒大小和金属-载体相互作用的平衡。

虽然研究没有直接将MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，但它表明MCM-41通道内的受限空间可以帮助控制金属颗粒大小和分布，这对PDH反应中的催化剂性能至关重要。

研究没有明确讨论晶格氧物种，但确实强调了氢气预处理在影响催化剂性能和失活方面的作用，特别是通过其对积碳形成的影响。
