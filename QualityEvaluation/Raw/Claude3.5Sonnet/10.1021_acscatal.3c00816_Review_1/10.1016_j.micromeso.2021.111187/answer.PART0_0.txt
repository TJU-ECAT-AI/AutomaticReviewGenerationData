The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support for cobalt catalysts, providing confined channels for metal species.

2. H2 pretreatment influence: Hydrogen prereduction significantly affects catalyst performance by tuning the interaction between metal species and the silica support. It causes multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species.

3. Catalyst performance: Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters in MCM-41 channels.

4. Deactivation: Higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition.

5. Reaction mechanism: The performance of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is determined by propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation, which are influenced by the metal-support interaction.

While the literature does not directly compare OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss lattice oxygen species, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the effects of prereduction on catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非VOx和CrOx负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的催化剂。然而，我们仍可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41被用作钴催化剂的载体，为金属物种提供了受限的通道。

2. H2预处理的影响：氢气预还原通过调节金属物种与硅支撑体之间的相互作用，显著影响催化剂性能。它导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移。

3. 催化剂性能：在650-700°C下还原的催化剂显示出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率，这是由于MCM-41通道中同时存在骨架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇。

4. 失活：更高的预还原温度（750-800°C）导致大颗粒Co的形成，resulting in反应速率降低、丙烯选择性降低和严重的积碳问题。

5. 反应机理：Co催化的PDH反应性能由丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成决定，这些过程受金属-载体相互作用的影响。

虽然该文献没有直接比较OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体，也没有讨论晶格氧物种，但它强调了金属-载体相互作用的重要性，以及预还原对催化剂结构和PDH反应性能的影响。
