The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, it provides insights into the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions.

Co@MCM-41 catalysts show improved performance after hydrogen prereduction treatment. This treatment causes the migration of framework Co2+ to extraframework Co0 species, which affects the catalyst's structure and performance. Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in MCM-41 channels.

The hydrogen prereduction temperature plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. While moderate temperatures (650-700°C) improve performance, higher temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and increased coke deposition.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction can tune the interaction between metal species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in PDH reactions. This highlights the importance of optimizing pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired catalyst performance.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined structure of MCM-41 plays a role in the catalyst's performance by limiting the size of metal clusters and influencing metal-support interactions.

该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，它为我们提供了金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中的性能见解。

Co@MCM-41催化剂在氢气预还原处理后显示出性能改善。这种处理导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的迁移，从而影响催化剂的结构和性能。在650-700°C下还原的催化剂显示出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率，这是由于MCM-41通道中同时存在骨架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇。

氢气预还原温度在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。虽然适度温度（650-700°C）可以提高性能，但更高的温度（750-800°C）会导致大颗粒Co的形成，从而降低反应速率和丙烯选择性，并增加积碳沉积。

研究表明，氢气预还原可以调节金属物种与二氧化硅支撑体之间的相互作用，进而影响PDH反应中的丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成。这突出了优化预处理条件以实现所需催化剂性能的重要性。

虽然该研究没有直接比较MCM-41与传统金属氧化物支撑体，但它表明MCM-41的受限结构通过限制金属簇的大小和影响金属-支撑体相互作用，在催化剂性能中发挥了作用。
