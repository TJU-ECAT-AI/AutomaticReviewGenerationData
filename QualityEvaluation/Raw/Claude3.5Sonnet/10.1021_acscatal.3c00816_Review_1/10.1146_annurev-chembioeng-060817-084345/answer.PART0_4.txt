The provided literature does not contain specific information about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text does not discuss the structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, or reaction mechanisms of these catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide supports. There is also no mention of how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The document appears to focus more on ethane and ethylene production rather than propane dehydrogenation.

提供的文献中没有关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的具体信息。文本没有讨论这些催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体相比的结构特性、催化行为、优势、局限性或反应机理。也没有提到晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素如何影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。该文档似乎更多地关注乙烷和乙烯的生产,而不是丙烷脱氢。
