The literature does not provide sufficient information to directly compare the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information on related catalysts and reactions:

1. Vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are widely studied for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is closely related to PDH. The structure and dispersion of VOx species on the support play a crucial role in catalytic performance.

2. Single-site VOx moieties on silica supports have shown enhanced catalytic activity in ODHP, suggesting that highly dispersed metal oxide species on high surface area supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 could potentially improve PDH performance.

3. The local structure of VOx active sites significantly influences the catalytic behavior in ODHP. This implies that the ordered structure of OMS supports might provide a more uniform environment for active sites, potentially leading to improved catalytic properties.

4. Metal-organic framework (MOF) supported cobalt catalysts have demonstrated effectiveness in low-temperature ODHP. While not directly related to OMS supports, this highlights the importance of support structure in enhancing catalytic performance.

5. Lattice oxygen in VOx catalysts plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interaction between the metal oxide and the support material can influence the availability and mobility of lattice oxygen, which could be a factor in the performance of OMS-supported catalysts.

Although the literature does not specifically address the influence of H2 pretreatment on OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions, it's likely that such pretreatment could affect the oxidation state of the metal species and thus influence catalyst performance and deactivation.

In conclusion, while direct comparisons are not available, the literature suggests that the high surface area, ordered structure, and potential for uniform dispersion of active sites in OMS supports could offer advantages in PDH reactions. However, more specific research would be needed to fully understand the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions.

文献中没有足够的信息来直接比较金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。然而，从相关催化剂和反应的可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 氧化钒（VOx）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中被广泛研究，这与PDH密切相关。VOx物种在载体上的结构和分散对催化性能起着至关重要的作用。

2. 硅载体上的单点VOx物种在ODHP中表现出增强的催化活性，这表明高度分散在高比表面积载体（如MCM-41和SBA-15）上的金属氧化物物种可能会提高PDH性能。

3. VOx活性位点的局部结构显著影响ODHP中的催化行为。这意味着OMS载体的有序结构可能为活性位点提供更均匀的环境，潜在地导致改善的催化特性。

4. 金属有机框架（MOF）负载的钴催化剂在低温ODHP中表现出有效性。虽然与OMS载体不直接相关，但这突出了载体结构在提高催化性能方面的重要性。

5. VOx催化剂中的晶格氧在丙烷的氧化脱氢中起着至关重要的作用。金属氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用可以影响晶格氧的可用性和移动性，这可能是OMS负载催化剂性能的一个因素。

虽然文献没有具体提到H2预处理对OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的影响，但这种预处理可能会影响金属物种的氧化态，从而影响催化剂性能和失活。

总之，虽然没有直接的比较，但文献表明OMS载体的高比表面积、有序结构和活性位点均匀分散的潜力可能在PDH反应中提供优势。然而，需要更具体的研究来充分理解MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。
