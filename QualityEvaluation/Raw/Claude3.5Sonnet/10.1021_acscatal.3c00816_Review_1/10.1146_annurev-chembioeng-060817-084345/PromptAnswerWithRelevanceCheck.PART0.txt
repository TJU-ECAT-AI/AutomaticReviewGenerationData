Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts offer several advantages:

1. Improved dispersion: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better dispersion of active metal species, leading to increased catalytic activity.

2. Enhanced accessibility: The high surface area and uniform pore structure of OMS materials provide better accessibility to active sites for reactant molecules.

3. Tunable properties: The pore size and surface properties of OMS can be tailored to optimize catalyst performance for specific reactions.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials typically involves the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen species play a crucial role. The catalytic cycle includes:

1. Propane adsorption on the catalyst surface
2. C-H bond activation by lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propylene
4. Re-oxidation of the reduced metal site

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions include:

1. Lattice oxygen species: The availability and mobility of lattice oxygen affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Proper control of oxygen species can enhance catalyst performance.

2. H2 pretreatment: Pretreatment with hydrogen can reduce the metal oxide species, creating oxygen vacancies that can improve catalytic activity. However, excessive reduction may lead to the formation of less active metallic species.

3. Metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between metal species and the OMS support can enhance catalyst stability and prevent sintering.

4. Coke formation: Deactivation due to coke deposition is a common issue in PDH reactions. The ordered structure of OMS materials can help mitigate coke formation by providing better accessibility to active sites and facilitating coke removal.

5. Redox properties: The ability of the metal species to undergo reversible oxidation and reduction cycles affects the catalyst's long-term stability and activity.

While OMS-supported catalysts offer several advantages, they also face some limitations:

1. Thermal stability: High-temperature reactions may cause structural collapse of the mesoporous framework, leading to loss of catalytic activity.

2. Hydrothermal stability: Exposure to steam at high temperatures can cause degradation of the silica support.

3. Metal leaching: Under certain conditions, metal species may leach from the support, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

To address these limitations, researchers are exploring strategies such as incorporating heteroatoms into the OMS framework, developing hybrid organic-inorganic supports, and optimizing metal loading and dispersion techniques.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts show great potential for improving PDH reactions compared to traditional supports. However, further research is needed to overcome stability issues and optimize their performance for industrial applications.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。这些催化剂具有以下几个优点：

1. 分散性改善：MCM-41和SBA-15的有序介孔结构可以使活性金属物种更好地分散，从而提高催化活性。

2. 可及性增强：OMS材料的高比表面积和均匀的孔结构为反应物分子提供了更好的活性位点可及性。

3. 可调性能：OMS的孔径和表面性质可以进行调整，以优化催化剂在特定反应中的性能。

VOx和CrOx负载在OMS材料上的PDH反应机理通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen机制，其中晶格氧物种起着关键作用。催化循环包括：

1. 丙烷在催化剂表面吸附
2. 晶格氧活化C-H键
3. 丙烯脱附
4. 还原的金属位点再氧化

影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的因素包括：

1. 晶格氧物种：晶格氧的可用性和移动性影响催化剂的活性和选择性。适当控制氧物种可以提高催化剂性能。

2. H2预处理：用氢气预处理可以还原金属氧化物物种，产生氧空位，从而提高催化活性。但过度还原可能导致形成活性较低的金属物种。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：金属物种与OMS载体之间的强相互作用可以增强催化剂稳定性并防止烧结。

4. 积碳形成：由于积碳沉积导致的失活是PDH反应中的常见问题。OMS材料的有序结构可以通过提供更好的活性位点可及性和促进积碳去除来帮助减轻积碳形成。

5. 氧化还原性质：金属物种进行可逆氧化还原循环的能力影响催化剂的长期稳定性和活性。

虽然OMS负载催化剂具有多项优势，但也面临一些限制：

1. 热稳定性：高温反应可能导致介孔骨架结构崩塌，从而导致催化活性下降。

2. 水热稳定性：在高温下暴露于蒸汽中可能导致硅载体的降解。

3. 金属流失：在某些条件下，金属物种可能从载体上流失，导致催化剂失活。

为了解决这些限制，研究人员正在探索以下策略：将杂原子掺入OMS骨架、开发有机-无机杂化载体，以及优化金属负载和分散技术。

总之，金属有序介孔硅催化剂在改善PDH反应方面显示出巨大潜力，相比传统载体具有优势。然而，仍需进一步研究以克服稳定性问题并优化其在工业应用中的性能。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to directly compare the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information on related catalysts and reactions:

1. Vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are widely studied for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is closely related to PDH. The structure and dispersion of VOx species on the support play a crucial role in catalytic performance.

2. Single-site VOx moieties on silica supports have shown enhanced catalytic activity in ODHP, suggesting that highly dispersed metal oxide species on high surface area supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 could potentially improve PDH performance.

3. The local structure of VOx active sites significantly influences the catalytic behavior in ODHP. This implies that the ordered structure of OMS supports might provide a more uniform environment for active sites, potentially leading to improved catalytic properties.

4. Metal-organic framework (MOF) supported cobalt catalysts have demonstrated effectiveness in low-temperature ODHP. While not directly related to OMS supports, this highlights the importance of support structure in enhancing catalytic performance.

5. Lattice oxygen in VOx catalysts plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The interaction between the metal oxide and the support material can influence the availability and mobility of lattice oxygen, which could be a factor in the performance of OMS-supported catalysts.

Although the literature does not specifically address the influence of H2 pretreatment on OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions, it's likely that such pretreatment could affect the oxidation state of the metal species and thus influence catalyst performance and deactivation.

In conclusion, while direct comparisons are not available, the literature suggests that the high surface area, ordered structure, and potential for uniform dispersion of active sites in OMS supports could offer advantages in PDH reactions. However, more specific research would be needed to fully understand the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions.

文献中没有足够的信息来直接比较金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。然而，从相关催化剂和反应的可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 氧化钒（VOx）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中被广泛研究，这与PDH密切相关。VOx物种在载体上的结构和分散对催化性能起着至关重要的作用。

2. 硅载体上的单点VOx物种在ODHP中表现出增强的催化活性，这表明高度分散在高比表面积载体（如MCM-41和SBA-15）上的金属氧化物物种可能会提高PDH性能。

3. VOx活性位点的局部结构显著影响ODHP中的催化行为。这意味着OMS载体的有序结构可能为活性位点提供更均匀的环境，潜在地导致改善的催化特性。

4. 金属有机框架（MOF）负载的钴催化剂在低温ODHP中表现出有效性。虽然与OMS载体不直接相关，但这突出了载体结构在提高催化性能方面的重要性。

5. VOx催化剂中的晶格氧在丙烷的氧化脱氢中起着至关重要的作用。金属氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用可以影响晶格氧的可用性和移动性，这可能是OMS负载催化剂性能的一个因素。

虽然文献没有具体提到H2预处理对OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的影响，但这种预处理可能会影响金属物种的氧化态，从而影响催化剂性能和失活。

总之，虽然没有直接的比较，但文献表明OMS载体的高比表面积、有序结构和活性位点均匀分散的潜力可能在PDH反应中提供优势。然而，需要更具体的研究来充分理解MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。
