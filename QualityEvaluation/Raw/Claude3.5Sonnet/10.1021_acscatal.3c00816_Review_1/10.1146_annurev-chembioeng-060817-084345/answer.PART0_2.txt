The provided literature does not contain specific information about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document does not discuss the structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, or reaction mechanisms of these catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide supports. There is also no mention of the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The literature appears to focus more on ethane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation processes rather than propane dehydrogenation specifically.

所提供的文献中没有关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂(如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx)用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的具体信息。文档没有讨论这些催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体相比的结构特性、催化行为、优势、局限性或反应机理。也没有提到晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。该文献似乎更多地集中在乙烷脱氢和氧化脱氢过程上，而不是专门讨论丙烷脱氢。
