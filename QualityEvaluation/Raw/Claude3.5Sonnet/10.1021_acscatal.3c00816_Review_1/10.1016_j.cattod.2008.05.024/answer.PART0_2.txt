[1] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 (with VOx surface densities, ns, in the range of 0.091.33 V/nm2) the predominant surface V species appear to be the isolated monovanadates with one terminal VO (observed at 10381040 cm1, Fig. 1 a) and three VOSi anchoring bonds in a C3υ-like configuration with tetracoordinated vanadium"

[2] "The Raman spectra of 4V-MCF and 4V-SBA-15 catalysts (with ns of 1.83 and 0.81 V/nm2) exhibited the characteristic bands due to crystalline V2O5 (at 996 and 282 cm1, see Fig. 1 b). Nevertheless, judged from the intensity of the 1038 cm1 VO band of the isolated monovanadates for 4V-MCF and 4V-SBA-15 as compared to the intensity of the 997 cm1V2O5 band, it turns out that the isolated monovanadates are again the dominant surface species for these two catalyst samples."

[3] "The catalysts supported on non-porous SiO2 and microporous silicalite, which contain mainly bulk crystalline vanadia, showed an oxidation state of 3 indicating a full reduction of V5+ to V3+. On the other hand, the oxidation state of vanadium for the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas, which contain mostly monomeric vanadia moities, averages at about 3.53.7."

[4] "Vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silicas showed the best catalytic performance compared to other mesoporous silicas (SBA-15, MCF), mircroporous silicalite and non-porous SiO2 supported vanadia catalysts in the ODH of propane. Highly dispersed monomeric VOx species can be achieved on these high surface area silicas even for V loadings of 8 wt.% thus leading to very active catalysts."

[5] "The slightly lower activity of the catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCF mesoporous silicas was attributed to the partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation of the catalysts, thus leading to relatively lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx, show superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of these catalysts are characterized by highly dispersed monomeric VOx species on high surface area silicas, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt%). This high dispersion leads to very active catalysts. The predominant surface V species on MCM-41 and HMS are isolated monovanadates with one terminal V=O bond and three V-O-Si anchoring bonds.

The main advantage of OMS catalysts is their ability to maintain high vanadia dispersion, leading to better catalytic performance. However, SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts showed slightly lower activity due to partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation, resulting in lower vanadia dispersion and formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to active VOx sites.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the oxidation state of vanadium in mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (3.5-3.7) suggests incomplete reduction to V4+/V3+ or the presence of V4+/V3+ species before reduction. This is in contrast to non-porous SiO2 and microporous silicalite supported catalysts, which show complete reduction of V5+ to V3+.

The document does not provide specific information about the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it can be inferred that the high dispersion of VOx species and the interaction with the mesoporous silica support play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance and stability.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出优于传统金属氧化物载体的性能。

这些催化剂的结构特性是在高比表面积硅材料上高度分散的单体VOx物种，即使在高V负载量（高达8 wt%）下也是如此。这种高分散性导致了非常活跃的催化剂。MCM-41和HMS表面上的主要V物种是具有一个末端V=O键和三个V-O-Si锚定键的孤立单钒酸盐。

OMS催化剂的主要优势在于其能够保持高钒分散度，从而带来更好的催化性能。然而，SBA-15和MCF负载的催化剂由于制备过程中介孔结构的部分破坏而表现出略低的活性，导致钒分散度降低，并形成了阻碍活性VOx位点的非骨架硅相。

关于反应机理，介孔硅负载催化剂中钒的氧化态（3.5-3.7）表明V5+未完全还原为V4+/V3+，或在还原前存在V4+/V3+物种。这与非多孔SiO2和微孔硅铝石负载的催化剂形成对比，后者显示V5+完全还原为V3+。

文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的具体信息。然而，可以推断VOx物种的高分散度以及与介孔硅载体的相互作用在决定催化剂性能和稳定性方面起着关键作用。
