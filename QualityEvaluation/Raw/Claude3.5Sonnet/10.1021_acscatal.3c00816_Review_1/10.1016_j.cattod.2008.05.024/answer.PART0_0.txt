[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[4] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[5] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[6] "High propene yields about 1619% at 575600 C for low vanadium loadings (24 wt.%) were obtained, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts according to a recent review"

The study focuses on VOx catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS, SBA-15) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some insights can be drawn:

MCM-41 and HMS supported VOx catalysts showed superior performance compared to SBA-15, microporous silicalite, and non-porous SiO2 supports. They achieved high propane conversions (35-40%) with good propene selectivities (35-47%).

The main advantage of MCM-41 and HMS supports was their ability to maintain high vanadia dispersion, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt%). This resulted in isolated monomeric VOx species, which are highly active for propane ODH.

SBA-15 supported catalysts showed lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure during preparation, leading to lower vanadia dispersion. This highlights a limitation of SBA-15 as a support for this reaction.

The degree of vanadia dispersion was found to be the key factor determining catalytic activity, rather than pore size/structure or acidity/reducibility characteristics. 

HMS-supported catalysts with 2-4 wt% V loading achieved propene yields of 16-19%, ranking them among the best performing vanadia catalysts for propane ODH.

The study does not discuss CrOx catalysts, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific deactivation mechanisms in PDH reactions. The focus is on oxidative dehydrogenation, which is a different process from conventional dehydrogenation.

这项研究主要关注了以介孔二氧化硅(MCM-41、HMS、SBA-15)为载体的VOx催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的性能，而非丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。然而，我们仍可以得出一些见解：

以MCM-41和HMS为载体的VOx催化剂相比于SBA-15、微孔硅铝石和非多孔SiO2载体表现出更优异的性能。它们实现了高丙烷转化率(35-40%)和良好的丙烯选择性(35-47%)。

MCM-41和HMS载体的主要优势在于即使在高钒负载量(高达8 wt%)下也能保持高度分散的钒物种。这导致了形成单体分散的VOx物种，它们在丙烷ODH反应中具有高活性。

以SBA-15为载体的催化剂活性较低，这是由于在制备过程中孔结构部分破坏，导致钒物种分散度降低。这凸显了SBA-15作为该反应载体的局限性。

研究发现，钒物种的分散程度是决定催化活性的关键因素，而非孔径/结构或酸度/还原性特征。

以HMS为载体、钒负载量为2-4 wt%的催化剂实现了16-19%的丙烯产率，使其跻身于丙烷ODH反应中性能最佳的钒基催化剂之列。

该研究未讨论CrOx催化剂、晶格氧物种、氢气预处理或PDH反应中的具体失活机理。研究重点是氧化脱氢，这与常规脱氢是不同的过程。
