[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[3] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[4] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[5] "However, the highest propene yield (up to 19%) and stable catalytic behavior was attained for catalysts supported on HMS mesoporous silica, and especially for those combining framework mesoporosity and textural porosity (voids between primary nanoparticles)."

The study focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The performance of these catalysts is compared to those supported on microporous silicalite and non-porous silica.

MCM-41 and HMS supported vanadia catalysts showed the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) with relatively high propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 supported catalysts exhibited lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion caused by partial destruction of the pore structure during catalyst preparation.

The main factor determining catalytic activity towards propene production was found to be the degree of dispersion of vanadia species on the catalyst surface, rather than the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics.

The highest propene yield (up to 19%) and stable catalytic behavior was achieved with catalysts supported on HMS mesoporous silica, particularly those combining framework mesoporosity and textural porosity.

The study does not discuss CrOx catalysts, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or PDH reaction mechanisms. The focus is on oxidative dehydrogenation rather than dehydrogenation, so the influence of factors like lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions cannot be addressed based on the given information.

这项研究主要关注了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的各种介孔硅材料（包括MCM-41和SBA-15）负载的钒（VOx）催化剂，而非丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。这些催化剂的性能与微孔硅烷和非多孔二氧化硅负载的催化剂进行了比较。

MCM-41和HMS负载的钒催化剂表现最佳，实现了高丙烷转化率（35-40%）和相对较高的丙烯选择性（35-47%）。SBA-15负载的催化剂由于在制备过程中孔结构部分破坏导致钒分散度降低，因此活性较低。

决定丙烯生产催化活性的主要因素是钒物种在催化剂表面的分散程度，而非介孔载体的孔径和结构或酸度/可还原性特征。

最高的丙烯产率（高达19%）和稳定的催化行为是通过HMS介孔二氧化硅负载的催化剂实现的，特别是那些结合了骨架介孔和纹理孔隙（初级纳米粒子之间的空隙）的催化剂。

该研究没有讨论CrOx催化剂、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应机理。研究重点是氧化脱氢而非脱氢，因此无法根据给定信息讨论晶格氧和H2预处理等因素对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
