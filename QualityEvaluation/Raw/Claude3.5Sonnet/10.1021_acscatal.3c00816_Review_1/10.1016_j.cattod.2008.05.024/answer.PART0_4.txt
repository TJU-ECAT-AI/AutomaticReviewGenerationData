[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "Additional bands ascribed to V2O5 nanoparticles were evidenced in the case of SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts while these bands were the only ones identified on the surface of the catalysts supported on silicalite and non-porous silica."

[4] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[5] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[6] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

The study primarily focused on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 and HMS supports showed superior vanadia dispersion compared to SBA-15 and MCF, with isolated monovanadates detected for V loadings up to 8 wt%. SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts exhibited additional V2O5 nanoparticles.

2. Catalytic behavior: HMS and MCM-41 supported catalysts demonstrated the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) and propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts showed lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion.

3. Advantages of OMS: High surface area and ordered pore structure of mesoporous silicas, particularly MCM-41 and HMS, allowed for better dispersion of vanadia species, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to microporous and non-porous supports.

4. Limitations: Partial destruction of pore structure during catalyst preparation was observed for SBA-15 and MCF, leading to lower vanadia dispersion and consequently lower activity.

5. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that the degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface is the main determinant of catalytic activity towards propene production, rather than pore size, structure, acidity, or reducibility characteristics.

The study did not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, as it focused on oxidative dehydrogenation. To fully answer these aspects, additional research on PDH reactions with these catalysts would be necessary.

这项研究主要关注了负载在各种介孔硅材料（包括MCM-41和SBA-15）上的钒（VOx）催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应，而非丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。然而，我们可以从中得到一些见解：

1. 结构特性：与SBA-15和MCF相比，MCM-41和HMS载体展现出更优异的钒分散性，在钒含量高达8 wt%时仍能检测到孤立的单钒酸盐。SBA-15和MCF负载的催化剂还出现了额外的V2O5纳米颗粒。

2. 催化行为：HMS和MCM-41负载的催化剂表现最佳，实现了高丙烷转化率（35-40%）和高丙烯选择性（35-47%）。SBA-15和MCF负载的催化剂由于钒分散度较低而表现出较低的活性。

3. 有序介孔硅材料（OMS）的优势：介孔硅材料（特别是MCM-41和HMS）的高比表面积和有序孔结构允许钒物种更好地分散，与微孔和非多孔载体相比，这导致了更好的催化性能。

4. 局限性：在催化剂制备过程中观察到SBA-15和MCF的孔结构部分破坏，导致钒分散度降低，进而降低了活性。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，催化剂表面V物种的分散程度是决定丙烯生成催化活性的主要因素，而非孔径、结构、酸度或还原性特征。

该研究并未特别关注晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响，因为它主要集中在氧化脱氢反应上。要全面回答这些方面的问题，需要对这些催化剂在PDH反应中的表现进行额外的研究。
