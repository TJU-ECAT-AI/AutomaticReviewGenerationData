[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[4] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[5] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[6] "High propene yields about 1619% at 575600 C for low vanadium loadings (24 wt.%) were obtained, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts according to a recent review"

The study focuses on VOx catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS, SBA-15) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some insights can be drawn:

MCM-41 and HMS supported VOx catalysts showed superior performance compared to SBA-15, microporous silicalite, and non-porous SiO2 supports. They achieved high propane conversions (35-40%) with good propene selectivities (35-47%).

The main advantage of MCM-41 and HMS supports was their ability to maintain high vanadia dispersion, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt%). This resulted in isolated monomeric VOx species, which are highly active for propane ODH.

SBA-15 supported catalysts showed lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure during preparation, leading to lower vanadia dispersion. This highlights a limitation of SBA-15 as a support for this reaction.

The degree of vanadia dispersion was found to be the key factor determining catalytic activity, rather than pore size/structure or acidity/reducibility characteristics. 

HMS-supported catalysts with 2-4 wt% V loading achieved propene yields of 16-19%, ranking them among the best performing vanadia catalysts for propane ODH.

The study does not discuss CrOx catalysts, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific deactivation mechanisms in PDH reactions. The focus is on oxidative dehydrogenation, which is a different process from conventional dehydrogenation.

这项研究主要关注了以介孔二氧化硅(MCM-41、HMS、SBA-15)为载体的VOx催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的性能，而非丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。然而，我们仍可以得出一些见解：

以MCM-41和HMS为载体的VOx催化剂相比于SBA-15、微孔硅铝石和非多孔SiO2载体表现出更优异的性能。它们实现了高丙烷转化率(35-40%)和良好的丙烯选择性(35-47%)。

MCM-41和HMS载体的主要优势在于即使在高钒负载量(高达8 wt%)下也能保持高度分散的钒物种。这导致了形成单体分散的VOx物种，它们在丙烷ODH反应中具有高活性。

以SBA-15为载体的催化剂活性较低，这是由于在制备过程中孔结构部分破坏，导致钒物种分散度降低。这凸显了SBA-15作为该反应载体的局限性。

研究发现，钒物种的分散程度是决定催化活性的关键因素，而非孔径/结构或酸度/还原性特征。

以HMS为载体、钒负载量为2-4 wt%的催化剂实现了16-19%的丙烯产率，使其跻身于丙烷ODH反应中性能最佳的钒基催化剂之列。

该研究未讨论CrOx催化剂、晶格氧物种、氢气预处理或PDH反应中的具体失活机理。研究重点是氧化脱氢，这与常规脱氢是不同的过程。

The study focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

MCM-41 and HMS supported vanadia catalysts showed the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) with relatively high propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 supported catalysts exhibited lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion caused by partial destruction of the pore structure during catalyst preparation.

The study does not discuss CrOx catalysts, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or PDH reaction mechanisms. The focus is on oxidative dehydrogenation rather than dehydrogenation, so the influence of factors like lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions cannot be addressed based on the given information.

这项研究主要关注了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的各种介孔硅材料（包括MCM-41和SBA-15）负载的钒（VOx）催化剂，而非丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。这些催化剂的性能与微孔硅烷和非多孔二氧化硅负载的催化剂进行了比较。

MCM-41和HMS负载的钒催化剂表现最佳，实现了高丙烷转化率（35-40%）和相对较高的丙烯选择性（35-47%）。SBA-15负载的催化剂由于在制备过程中孔结构部分破坏导致钒分散度降低，因此活性较低。

决定丙烯生产催化活性的主要因素是钒物种在催化剂表面的分散程度，而非介孔载体的孔径和结构或酸度/可还原性特征。

最高的丙烯产率（高达19%）和稳定的催化行为是通过HMS介孔二氧化硅负载的催化剂实现的，特别是那些结合了骨架介孔和纹理孔隙（初级纳米粒子之间的空隙）的催化剂。

该研究没有讨论CrOx催化剂、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应机理。研究重点是氧化脱氢而非脱氢，因此无法根据给定信息讨论晶格氧和H2预处理等因素对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。

[1] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 (with VOx surface densities, ns, in the range of 0.091.33 V/nm2) the predominant surface V species appear to be the isolated monovanadates with one terminal VO (observed at 10381040 cm1, Fig. 1 a) and three VOSi anchoring bonds in a C3υ-like configuration with tetracoordinated vanadium"

[2] "The Raman spectra of 4V-MCF and 4V-SBA-15 catalysts (with ns of 1.83 and 0.81 V/nm2) exhibited the characteristic bands due to crystalline V2O5 (at 996 and 282 cm1, see Fig. 1 b). Nevertheless, judged from the intensity of the 1038 cm1 VO band of the isolated monovanadates for 4V-MCF and 4V-SBA-15 as compared to the intensity of the 997 cm1V2O5 band, it turns out that the isolated monovanadates are again the dominant surface species for these two catalyst samples."

[3] "The catalysts supported on non-porous SiO2 and microporous silicalite, which contain mainly bulk crystalline vanadia, showed an oxidation state of 3 indicating a full reduction of V5+ to V3+. On the other hand, the oxidation state of vanadium for the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas, which contain mostly monomeric vanadia moities, averages at about 3.53.7."

[4] "Vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silicas showed the best catalytic performance compared to other mesoporous silicas (SBA-15, MCF), mircroporous silicalite and non-porous SiO2 supported vanadia catalysts in the ODH of propane. Highly dispersed monomeric VOx species can be achieved on these high surface area silicas even for V loadings of 8 wt.% thus leading to very active catalysts."

[5] "The slightly lower activity of the catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCF mesoporous silicas was attributed to the partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation of the catalysts, thus leading to relatively lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx, show superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of these catalysts are characterized by highly dispersed monomeric VOx species on high surface area silicas, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt%). This high dispersion leads to very active catalysts. The predominant surface V species on MCM-41 and HMS are isolated monovanadates with one terminal V=O bond and three V-O-Si anchoring bonds.

The main advantage of OMS catalysts is their ability to maintain high vanadia dispersion, leading to better catalytic performance. However, SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts showed slightly lower activity due to partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation, resulting in lower vanadia dispersion and formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to active VOx sites.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the oxidation state of vanadium in mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (3.5-3.7) suggests incomplete reduction to V4+/V3+ or the presence of V4+/V3+ species before reduction. This is in contrast to non-porous SiO2 and microporous silicalite supported catalysts, which show complete reduction of V5+ to V3+.

The document does not provide specific information about the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it can be inferred that the high dispersion of VOx species and the interaction with the mesoporous silica support play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance and stability.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出优于传统金属氧化物载体的性能。

这些催化剂的结构特性是在高比表面积硅材料上高度分散的单体VOx物种，即使在高V负载量（高达8 wt%）下也是如此。这种高分散性导致了非常活跃的催化剂。MCM-41和HMS表面上的主要V物种是具有一个末端V=O键和三个V-O-Si锚定键的孤立单钒酸盐。

OMS催化剂的主要优势在于其能够保持高钒分散度，从而带来更好的催化性能。然而，SBA-15和MCF负载的催化剂由于制备过程中介孔结构的部分破坏而表现出略低的活性，导致钒分散度降低，并形成了阻碍活性VOx位点的非骨架硅相。

关于反应机理，介孔硅负载催化剂中钒的氧化态（3.5-3.7）表明V5+未完全还原为V4+/V3+，或在还原前存在V4+/V3+物种。这与非多孔SiO2和微孔硅铝石负载的催化剂形成对比，后者显示V5+完全还原为V3+。

文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的具体信息。然而，可以推断VOx物种的高分散度以及与介孔硅载体的相互作用在决定催化剂性能和稳定性方面起着关键作用。

The study focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various silica materials for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Performance: MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silica-supported vanadia catalysts showed the best performance in propane ODH compared to other supports.

2. Structural properties: High surface area mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS) allowed for highly dispersed monomeric VOx species, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt.%), leading to very active catalysts.

3. Advantages: Mesoporous supports enabled high vanadia dispersion and catalytic activity.

4. Limitations: SBA-15 and MCF supports showed partial destruction during catalyst preparation, leading to lower vanadia dispersion and blocked access to active sites.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study doesn't explicitly discuss reaction mechanisms for PDH.

6. Lattice oxygen species: The paper doesn't specifically address the role of lattice oxygen species in the reaction.

7. H2 pretreatment: The study doesn't mention H2 pretreatment effects.

8. Deactivation: Catalyst stability was demonstrated for HMS-supported catalysts, but detailed deactivation mechanisms were not discussed.

While the study provides valuable insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for propane ODH, it doesn't directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding PDH reactions, CrOx catalysts, and the specific effects of lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment.

3. Advantages of OMS: High surface area and ordered pore structure of mesoporous silicas, particularly MCM-41 and HMS, allowed for better dispersion of vanadia species, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to microporous and non-porous supports.

4. Limitations: Partial destruction of pore structure during catalyst preparation was observed for SBA-15 and MCF, leading to lower vanadia dispersion and consequently lower activity.

5. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that the degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface is the main determinant of catalytic activity towards propene production, rather than pore size, structure, acidity, or reducibility characteristics.

The study did not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, as it focused on oxidative dehydrogenation. To fully answer these aspects, additional research on PDH reactions with these catalysts would be necessary.

2. 催化行为：HMS和MCM-41负载的催化剂表现最佳，实现了高丙烷转化率（35-40%）和高丙烯选择性（35-47%）。SBA-15和MCF负载的催化剂由于钒分散度较低而表现出较低的活性。

3. 有序介孔硅材料（OMS）的优势：介孔硅材料（特别是MCM-41和HMS）的高比表面积和有序孔结构允许钒物种更好地分散，与微孔和非多孔载体相比，这导致了更好的催化性能。

4. 局限性：在催化剂制备过程中观察到SBA-15和MCF的孔结构部分破坏，导致钒分散度降低，进而降低了活性。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，催化剂表面V物种的分散程度是决定丙烯生成催化活性的主要因素，而非孔径、结构、酸度或还原性特征。

该研究并未特别关注晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响，因为它主要集中在氧化脱氢反应上。要全面回答这些方面的问题，需要对这些催化剂在PDH反应中的表现进行额外的研究。
