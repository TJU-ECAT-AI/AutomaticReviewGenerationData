[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "Vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silicas showed the best catalytic performance compared to other mesoporous silicas (SBA-15, MCF), mircroporous silicalite and non-porous SiO2 supported vanadia catalysts in the ODH of propane."

[3] "Highly dispersed monomeric VOx species can be achieved on these high surface area silicas even for V loadings of 8 wt.% thus leading to very active catalysts."

[4] "The slightly lower activity of the catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCF mesoporous silicas was attributed to the partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation of the catalysts, thus leading to relatively lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores."

[5] "The presence of strong acid sites on the surface of microporous zeolite silicalite induced high propane conversion with the respective supported vanadia catalysts but at the same time gave rise to direct oxidation of propane towards CO2 and cracking reactions."

The study focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various silica materials for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Performance: MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silica-supported vanadia catalysts showed the best performance in propane ODH compared to other supports.

2. Structural properties: High surface area mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS) allowed for highly dispersed monomeric VOx species, even at high V loadings (up to 8 wt.%), leading to very active catalysts.

3. Advantages: Mesoporous supports enabled high vanadia dispersion and catalytic activity.

4. Limitations: SBA-15 and MCF supports showed partial destruction during catalyst preparation, leading to lower vanadia dispersion and blocked access to active sites.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study doesn't explicitly discuss reaction mechanisms for PDH.

6. Lattice oxygen species: The paper doesn't specifically address the role of lattice oxygen species in the reaction.

7. H2 pretreatment: The study doesn't mention H2 pretreatment effects.

8. Deactivation: Catalyst stability was demonstrated for HMS-supported catalysts, but detailed deactivation mechanisms were not discussed.

While the study provides valuable insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for propane ODH, it doesn't directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding PDH reactions, CrOx catalysts, and the specific effects of lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment.

该研究主要关注各种硅材料负载的钒氧化物(VOx)催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的应用，而非丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。然而，我们可以从中得到一些见解：

1. 性能：在丙烷ODH反应中，MCM-41和HMS介孔硅负载的钒氧化物催化剂表现最佳。

2. 结构特性：高比表面积的介孔硅材料(MCM-41，HMS)即使在高钒负载量(高达8 wt.%)下也能实现高度分散的单体VOx物种，从而产生高活性催化剂。

3. 优势：介孔载体能够实现高度分散的钒氧化物和高催化活性。

4. 局限性：SBA-15和MCF载体在催化剂制备过程中出现部分结构破坏，导致钒氧化物分散度降低和活性位点被阻塞。

5. 反应机理：该研究并未明确讨论PDH反应的机理。

6. 晶格氧物种：文章没有具体讨论晶格氧物种在反应中的作用。

7. H2预处理：研究未提及H2预处理的影响。

8. 失活：研究展示了HMS负载催化剂的稳定性，但未详细讨论失活机理。

虽然该研究为金属有序介孔硅催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中的应用提供了宝贵见解，但并未直接涉及问题中的所有方面，特别是关于PDH反应、CrOx催化剂以及晶格氧和H2预处理的具体影响。
