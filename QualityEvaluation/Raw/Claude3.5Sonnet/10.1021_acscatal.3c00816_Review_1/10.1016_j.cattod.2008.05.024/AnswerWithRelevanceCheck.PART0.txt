          [1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[4] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[5] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[6] "High propene yields about 1619% at 575600 C for low vanadium loadings (24 wt.%) were obtained, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts according to a recent review"

          The study primarily focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 and HMS supports demonstrated superior vanadia dispersion compared to SBA-15, with isolated monovanadates detected for V loadings up to 8 wt%.

2. Catalytic behavior: HMS and MCM-41 supported catalysts showed the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) with relatively high propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 supported catalysts exhibited lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion.

3. Advantages: High surface area mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS) allowed for highly dispersed monomeric VOx species, even at high V loadings, leading to very active catalysts.

4. Limitations: SBA-15 supported catalysts showed lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure during preparation, resulting in lower vanadia dispersion.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface was found to be the main determinant of catalytic activity towards propene production, rather than pore size, structure, acidity, or reducibility characteristics.

6. Performance: For low vanadium loadings (2-4 wt%), high propene yields of about 16-19% were obtained at 575-600°C, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts.

The study does not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, as it focused on oxidative dehydrogenation. The performance of CrOx catalysts was also not discussed in the provided information.

          这项研究主要关注了负载在各种介孔硅材料（包括MCM-41和SBA-15）上的钒（VOx）催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应，而非丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。然而，我们可以从中得到一些见解：

1. 结构特性：与SBA-15相比，MCM-41和HMS载体展现出更优异的钒分散性，在钒含量高达8 wt%时仍能检测到孤立的单钒酸盐。

2. 催化行为：HMS和MCM-41负载的催化剂表现最佳，实现了高丙烷转化率（35-40%）和高丙烯选择性（35-47%）。SBA-15负载的催化剂由于钒分散度较低而表现出较低的活性。

3. 优势：高比表面积的介孔硅材料（MCM-41，HMS）即使在高钒负载量下也能实现高度分散的单体VOx物种，从而产生高活性催化剂。

4. 局限性：SBA-15负载的催化剂由于制备过程中孔结构的部分破坏而表现出较低的活性，导致钒分散度降低。

5. 反应机理：研究发现，催化剂表面V物种的分散程度是决定丙烯生成催化活性的主要因素，而非孔径、结构、酸度或还原性特征。

6. 性能：对于低钒负载量（2-4 wt%），在575-600°C下获得了约16-19%的高丙烯产率，使这些催化剂跻身于性能最佳的钒基催化剂之列。

该研究并未特别关注晶格氧物种或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响，因为它主要集中在氧化脱氢反应上。所提供的信息中也未讨论CrOx催化剂的性能。
