[1] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

[2] "Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

[3] "The structure of Cr species in differently prepared CrMCM-41 (Cr content varied between 0.35 and 1.7 wt%) studied by in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) showed that aggregated Cr(III) are the active sites for DHP"

[4] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (CrO4) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

[5] "At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in CrO4 coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

[6] "In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

[7] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported CrOx show higher activity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3. The structural properties of these catalysts differ significantly:

SBA-15 at low Cr loading (1 wt%) contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, while at higher loading (5 wt%), it forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles alongside some isolated species. In contrast, γ-Al2O3 forms oligomers and isolated species at low loading, and mainly oligomers of varying nuclearity at higher loading, without Cr2O3 particles.

The catalytic behavior also varies:
- For SBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are more active, selective, and stable than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals.
- For Al2O3, oligomeric Cr species outperform isolated Cr sites in activity and selectivity.

The reaction mechanism involves on-site generation of active Cr sites during the reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This highlights the dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

The study does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it's noted that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was studied as an alternative to overcome challenges with traditional PDH, suggesting oxygen species play a role in reaction pathways and potentially in deactivation mechanisms.

The advantages of OMS catalysts seem to lie in their ability to stabilize isolated Cr species at low loadings and their higher activity compared to traditional supports. Limitations may include the formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15. The study emphasizes the importance of support nature and Cr loading in determining catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中显示出比传统金属氧化物载体如Al2O3更高的活性。这些催化剂的结构特性有显著差异：

SBA-15在低Cr负载量(1 wt%)时含有四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而在高负载量(5 wt%)时形成晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒和一些孤立物种。相比之下，γ-Al2O3在低负载量时形成低聚物和孤立物种，在高负载量时主要形成不同核数的低聚物，而不形成Cr2O3颗粒。

催化行为也有所不同：
- 对于SBA-15，配位数>4的孤立Cr(III)位比Cr2O3晶体表面的Cr位具有更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
- 对于Al2O3，低聚Cr物种在活性和选择性方面优于孤立Cr位。

反应机理涉及在反应过程中原位生成活性Cr位，Cr通常处于(III)氧化态。这突显了催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性。

该研究没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，文中提到研究了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服传统PDH挑战的替代方案，这表明氧物种在反应途径和可能的失活机制中起作用。

OMS催化剂的优势似乎在于它们能够在低负载量时稳定孤立Cr物种，并且比传统载体具有更高的活性。局限性可能包括在SBA-15上高负载量时形成活性较低的Cr2O3颗粒。该研究强调了载体性质和Cr负载量在决定PDH反应中催化剂结构和性能方面的重要性。

The literature provides insights into the performance of SBA-15 supported CrOx catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, comparing them to traditional γ-Al2O3 supports. 

For SBA-15 supported catalysts, isolated Cr species (at 1 wt% loading) show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr compared to catalysts with crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (at 5 wt% loading). The isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four on SBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces.

Comparing SBA-15 to γ-Al2O3 supports, the isolated Cr species on SBA-15 show higher intrinsic activity than those on γ-Al2O3 at 1 wt% loading. However, for γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, oligomeric Cr species demonstrate the highest activity, outperforming isolated Cr sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the immediate reduction of isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination to Cr(III) upon interaction with propane, accompanied by an increase in coordination number. This transformation is evidenced by in situ XANES and EXAFS studies.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Additionally, there is no direct comparison to MCM-41 supported catalysts or discussion of VOx species in the given text.

对于SBA-15负载的催化剂，单独的Cr物种(1 wt%负载量)每摩尔Cr表现出比晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒(5 wt%负载量)更高的活性和选择性。SBA-15上配位数大于四的单独Cr(III)位点比晶态Cr2O3表面上的Cr位点更活跃、更具选择性和稳定性。

比较SBA-15和γ-Al2O3载体，在1 wt%负载量下，SBA-15上的单独Cr物种表现出比γ-Al2O3上更高的本征活性。然而，对于γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂，寡聚Cr物种表现出最高的活性，优于单独的Cr位点。

反应机理涉及四面体配位的单独Cr(VI)物种在与丙烷接触后立即还原为Cr(III)，同时配位数增加。这种转变通过原位XANES和EXAFS研究得到证实。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly SBA-15 supported CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions shows some advantages compared to traditional metal oxide supports like γ-Al2O3.

Structural properties:
SBA-15 supports allow for a more uniform distribution of isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination at low Cr loadings (1 wt%), while γ-Al2O3 supports contain a mix of isolated species and oligomers. At higher Cr loadings (5 wt%), SBA-15 supports form crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles along with some isolated species, whereas γ-Al2O3 mainly contains oligomers of varying nuclearity without forming Cr2O3 particles.

Catalytic behavior:
For SBA-15 supported catalysts, those with exclusively isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr compared to catalysts dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In contrast, for γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, those dominated by oligomeric species exhibit the highest activity.

Reaction mechanism:
In-situ XAS studies reveal that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This suggests that the initial Cr(VI) species are reduced to Cr(III) under reaction conditions to form the active sites for PDH.

Advantages of SBA-15:
- Allows for uniform distribution of isolated Cr species at low loadings
- Higher activity and selectivity for catalysts with isolated Cr species

Limitations:
- Formation of less active crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles at higher Cr loadings on SBA-15

The study does not provide specific information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for these particular catalysts.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是SBA-15负载的CrOx，与传统的金属氧化物载体如γ-Al2O3相比，表现出一些优势。

结构特性：
在低铬负载量(1 wt%)时，SBA-15载体允许四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种更均匀分布，而γ-Al2O3载体则包含孤立物种和寡聚物的混合物。在高铬负载量(5 wt%)时，SBA-15载体形成晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒和一些孤立物种，而γ-Al2O3主要包含不同核数的寡聚物，没有形成Cr2O3颗粒。

催化行为：
对于SBA-15负载的催化剂，那些仅含有孤立铬物种的催化剂(1 wt% Cr)每摩尔铬的活性和选择性高于以晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒为主的催化剂(5 wt% Cr)。相比之下，对于γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂，以寡聚物种为主的催化剂表现出最高的活性。

反应机理：
原位XAS研究表明，活性铬位点是在反应过程中生成的，铬通常处于(III)氧化态。这表明初始的Cr(VI)物种在反应条件下被还原为Cr(III)，形成PDH的活性位点。

SBA-15的优势：
- 在低负载量时允许孤立铬物种均匀分布
- 含有孤立铬物种的催化剂具有更高的活性和选择性

局限性：
- 在SBA-15上高铬负载量时形成活性较低的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒

Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show superior performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of OMS materials, including their high surface area, uniform pore structure, and ability to disperse metal species, contribute to their enhanced catalytic behavior. SBA-15 supported Cr catalysts, in particular, exhibit higher activity than γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts.

For CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts, isolated Cr species show higher activity and selectivity compared to crystalline Cr2O3 particles. The support influences the distribution and nature of Cr species, with SBA-15 favoring isolated sites at low loadings and Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings, while γ-Al2O3 mainly contains oligomeric species.

The reaction mechanism involves the in-situ generation of active Cr sites during the PDH reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This suggests that the initial oxidation state of Cr is not necessarily the active form for PDH.

While the literature does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation, it does mention that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to overcome challenges associated with PDH. However, ODHP has not achieved commercial viability.

The main advantages of OMS supported catalysts appear to be their ability to stabilize isolated and well-dispersed active metal species, leading to higher activity and selectivity. Limitations may include the formation of less active crystalline oxide particles at higher metal loadings. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of factors such as lattice oxygen and pretreatment conditions on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

OMS材料的结构特性，包括高比表面积、均匀的孔结构以及分散金属物种的能力，有助于提高其催化性能。特别是SBA-15负载的Cr催化剂表现出比γ-Al2O3负载催化剂更高的活性。

对于CrOx/SBA-15催化剂，孤立的Cr物种比晶态Cr2O3颗粒表现出更高的活性和选择性。载体影响Cr物种的分布和性质，SBA-15在低负载时倾向于形成孤立位点，高负载时形成Cr2O3颗粒，而γ-Al2O3主要含有寡聚物种。

反应机理涉及PDH反应过程中原位生成活性Cr位点，Cr通常处于(III)氧化态。这表明Cr的初始氧化态不一定是PDH的活性形式。

虽然文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响，但提到了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服PDH相关挑战的替代方案。然而，ODHP尚未实现商业可行性。

OMS负载催化剂的主要优势似乎在于其能够稳定孤立和分散良好的活性金属物种，从而导致更高的活性和选择性。局限性可能包括在高金属负载时形成活性较低的晶态氧化物颗粒。需要进一步研究以充分理解晶格氧和预处理条件等因素对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。

Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx generally show improved performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of OMS materials, particularly their high surface area and uniform pore structure, allow for better dispersion and accessibility of active metal sites. This results in higher catalytic activity and selectivity. For example, Cr supported on SBA-15 showed higher activity than Cr on Al2O3.

For CrOx catalysts, the nature of active sites depends on the support and metal loading. On SBA-15, isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are formed at low loadings (1 wt%), while crystalline Cr2O3 particles form at higher loadings (5 wt%). The isolated Cr species show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr.

The reaction mechanism involves reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during PDH, with active sites generated in-situ. Aggregated Cr(III) species have been identified as active sites on MCM-41.

While OMS-supported catalysts show advantages in activity and selectivity, challenges remain in terms of stability and deactivation. Factors like lattice oxygen species likely play a role, but are not explicitly discussed in the given literature for these systems. H2 pretreatment effects are also not mentioned.

Overall, OMS materials offer improved catalytic performance for PDH through better metal dispersion and site accessibility, but further research is needed to fully optimize these catalysts and understand deactivation mechanisms.

金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂,如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx,在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中通常表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。

OMS材料的结构特性,特别是它们的高比表面积和均匀的孔结构,使活性金属位点能够更好地分散和接触。这导致了更高的催化活性和选择性。例如,负载在SBA-15上的Cr表现出比负载在Al2O3上的Cr更高的活性。

对于CrOx催化剂,活性位点的性质取决于载体和金属负载量。在SBA-15上,低负载量(1 wt%)时形成四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种,而高负载量(5 wt%)时形成晶态Cr2O3颗粒。孤立的Cr物种表现出更高的活性和选择性(以每摩尔Cr计)。

反应机理涉及PDH过程中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III),活性位点在反应中原位生成。在MCM-41上,聚集的Cr(III)物种被认定为活性位点。

虽然OMS负载的催化剂在活性和选择性方面表现出优势,但在稳定性和失活方面仍然存在挑战。晶格氧物种等因素可能起作用,但在给定的文献中并未对这些系统进行明确讨论。也没有提到H2预处理的影响。

总的来说,OMS材料通过更好的金属分散和位点可及性为PDH提供了改进的催化性能,但仍需进一步研究以充分优化这些催化剂并理解失活机理。
