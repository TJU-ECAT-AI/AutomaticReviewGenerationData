[2] "Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

[3] "Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

[4] "Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

[5] "In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show superior performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of OMS materials, including their high surface area, uniform pore structure, and ability to disperse metal species, contribute to their enhanced catalytic behavior. SBA-15 supported Cr catalysts, in particular, exhibit higher activity than γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts.

For CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts, isolated Cr species show higher activity and selectivity compared to crystalline Cr2O3 particles. The support influences the distribution and nature of Cr species, with SBA-15 favoring isolated sites at low loadings and Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings, while γ-Al2O3 mainly contains oligomeric species.

The reaction mechanism involves the in-situ generation of active Cr sites during the PDH reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This suggests that the initial oxidation state of Cr is not necessarily the active form for PDH.

While the literature does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation, it does mention that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to overcome challenges associated with PDH. However, ODHP has not achieved commercial viability.

The main advantages of OMS supported catalysts appear to be their ability to stabilize isolated and well-dispersed active metal species, leading to higher activity and selectivity. Limitations may include the formation of less active crystalline oxide particles at higher metal loadings. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of factors such as lattice oxygen and pretreatment conditions on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优异的性能。

OMS材料的结构特性，包括高比表面积、均匀的孔结构以及分散金属物种的能力，有助于提高其催化性能。特别是SBA-15负载的Cr催化剂表现出比γ-Al2O3负载催化剂更高的活性。

对于CrOx/SBA-15催化剂，孤立的Cr物种比晶态Cr2O3颗粒表现出更高的活性和选择性。载体影响Cr物种的分布和性质，SBA-15在低负载时倾向于形成孤立位点，高负载时形成Cr2O3颗粒，而γ-Al2O3主要含有寡聚物种。

反应机理涉及PDH反应过程中原位生成活性Cr位点，Cr通常处于(III)氧化态。这表明Cr的初始氧化态不一定是PDH的活性形式。

虽然文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响，但提到了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服PDH相关挑战的替代方案。然而，ODHP尚未实现商业可行性。

OMS负载催化剂的主要优势似乎在于其能够稳定孤立和分散良好的活性金属物种，从而导致更高的活性和选择性。局限性可能包括在高金属负载时形成活性较低的晶态氧化物颗粒。需要进一步研究以充分理解晶格氧和预处理条件等因素对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
