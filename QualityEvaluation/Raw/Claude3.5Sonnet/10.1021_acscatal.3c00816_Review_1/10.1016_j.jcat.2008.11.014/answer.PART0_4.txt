[1] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

[2] "Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

[3] "The structure of Cr species in differently prepared CrMCM-41 (Cr content varied between 0.35 and 1.7 wt%) studied by in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) showed that aggregated Cr(III) are the active sites for DHP"

[4] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (
) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

[5] "Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

[6] "In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx generally show improved performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The structural properties of OMS materials, particularly their high surface area and uniform pore structure, allow for better dispersion and accessibility of active metal sites. This results in higher catalytic activity and selectivity. For example, Cr supported on SBA-15 showed higher activity than Cr on Al2O3.

For CrOx catalysts, the nature of active sites depends on the support and metal loading. On SBA-15, isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are formed at low loadings (1 wt%), while crystalline Cr2O3 particles form at higher loadings (5 wt%). The isolated Cr species show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr.

The reaction mechanism involves reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during PDH, with active sites generated in-situ. Aggregated Cr(III) species have been identified as active sites on MCM-41.

While OMS-supported catalysts show advantages in activity and selectivity, challenges remain in terms of stability and deactivation. Factors like lattice oxygen species likely play a role, but are not explicitly discussed in the given literature for these systems. H2 pretreatment effects are also not mentioned.

Overall, OMS materials offer improved catalytic performance for PDH through better metal dispersion and site accessibility, but further research is needed to fully optimize these catalysts and understand deactivation mechanisms.

金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂,如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx,在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中通常表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。

OMS材料的结构特性,特别是它们的高比表面积和均匀的孔结构,使活性金属位点能够更好地分散和接触。这导致了更高的催化活性和选择性。例如,负载在SBA-15上的Cr表现出比负载在Al2O3上的Cr更高的活性。

对于CrOx催化剂,活性位点的性质取决于载体和金属负载量。在SBA-15上,低负载量(1 wt%)时形成四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种,而高负载量(5 wt%)时形成晶态Cr2O3颗粒。孤立的Cr物种表现出更高的活性和选择性(以每摩尔Cr计)。

反应机理涉及PDH过程中Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III),活性位点在反应中原位生成。在MCM-41上,聚集的Cr(III)物种被认定为活性位点。

虽然OMS负载的催化剂在活性和选择性方面表现出优势,但在稳定性和失活方面仍然存在挑战。晶格氧物种等因素可能起作用,但在给定的文献中并未对这些系统进行明确讨论。也没有提到H2预处理的影响。

总的来说,OMS材料通过更好的金属分散和位点可及性为PDH提供了改进的催化性能,但仍需进一步研究以充分优化这些催化剂并理解失活机理。
