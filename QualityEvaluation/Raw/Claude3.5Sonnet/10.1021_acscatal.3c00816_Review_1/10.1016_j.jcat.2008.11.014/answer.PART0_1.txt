[1] "Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

[2] "The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr)."

[3] "Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction."

[4] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

[5] "In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS."

The literature provides insights into the performance of SBA-15 supported CrOx catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, comparing them to traditional γ-Al2O3 supports. 

For SBA-15 supported catalysts, isolated Cr species (at 1 wt% loading) show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr compared to catalysts with crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (at 5 wt% loading). The isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four on SBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces.

Comparing SBA-15 to γ-Al2O3 supports, the isolated Cr species on SBA-15 show higher intrinsic activity than those on γ-Al2O3 at 1 wt% loading. However, for γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, oligomeric Cr species demonstrate the highest activity, outperforming isolated Cr sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the immediate reduction of isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination to Cr(III) upon interaction with propane, accompanied by an increase in coordination number. This transformation is evidenced by in situ XANES and EXAFS studies.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Additionally, there is no direct comparison to MCM-41 supported catalysts or discussion of VOx species in the given text.

该文献提供了SBA-15负载的CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能见解，并与传统的γ-Al2O3载体进行了比较。

对于SBA-15负载的催化剂，单独的Cr物种(1 wt%负载量)每摩尔Cr表现出比晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒(5 wt%负载量)更高的活性和选择性。SBA-15上配位数大于四的单独Cr(III)位点比晶态Cr2O3表面上的Cr位点更活跃、更具选择性和稳定性。

比较SBA-15和γ-Al2O3载体，在1 wt%负载量下，SBA-15上的单独Cr物种表现出比γ-Al2O3上更高的本征活性。然而，对于γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂，寡聚Cr物种表现出最高的活性，优于单独的Cr位点。

反应机理涉及四面体配位的单独Cr(VI)物种在与丙烷接触后立即还原为Cr(III)，同时配位数增加。这种转变通过原位XANES和EXAFS研究得到证实。

文献没有提供晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的具体信息。此外，给定的文本中没有直接比较MCM-41负载的催化剂或讨论VOx物种。
