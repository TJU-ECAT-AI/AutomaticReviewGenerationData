[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function."

[2] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (Td) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

[3] "At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in Td coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

[4] "Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr)."

[5] "Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction."

[6] "In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly SBA-15 supported CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions shows some advantages compared to traditional metal oxide supports like γ-Al2O3.

Structural properties:
SBA-15 supports allow for a more uniform distribution of isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination at low Cr loadings (1 wt%), while γ-Al2O3 supports contain a mix of isolated species and oligomers. At higher Cr loadings (5 wt%), SBA-15 supports form crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles along with some isolated species, whereas γ-Al2O3 mainly contains oligomers of varying nuclearity without forming Cr2O3 particles.

Catalytic behavior:
For SBA-15 supported catalysts, those with exclusively isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) show higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr compared to catalysts dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In contrast, for γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, those dominated by oligomeric species exhibit the highest activity.

Reaction mechanism:
In-situ XAS studies reveal that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This suggests that the initial Cr(VI) species are reduced to Cr(III) under reaction conditions to form the active sites for PDH.

Advantages of SBA-15:
- Allows for uniform distribution of isolated Cr species at low loadings
- Higher activity and selectivity for catalysts with isolated Cr species

Limitations:
- Formation of less active crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles at higher Cr loadings on SBA-15

The study does not provide specific information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for these particular catalysts.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是SBA-15负载的CrOx，与传统的金属氧化物载体如γ-Al2O3相比，表现出一些优势。

结构特性：
在低铬负载量(1 wt%)时，SBA-15载体允许四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种更均匀分布，而γ-Al2O3载体则包含孤立物种和寡聚物的混合物。在高铬负载量(5 wt%)时，SBA-15载体形成晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒和一些孤立物种，而γ-Al2O3主要包含不同核数的寡聚物，没有形成Cr2O3颗粒。

催化行为：
对于SBA-15负载的催化剂，那些仅含有孤立铬物种的催化剂(1 wt% Cr)每摩尔铬的活性和选择性高于以晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒为主的催化剂(5 wt% Cr)。相比之下，对于γ-Al2O3负载的催化剂，以寡聚物种为主的催化剂表现出最高的活性。

反应机理：
原位XAS研究表明，活性铬位点是在反应过程中生成的，铬通常处于(III)氧化态。这表明初始的Cr(VI)物种在反应条件下被还原为Cr(III)，形成PDH的活性位点。

SBA-15的优势：
- 在低负载量时允许孤立铬物种均匀分布
- 含有孤立铬物种的催化剂具有更高的活性和选择性

局限性：
- 在SBA-15上高铬负载量时形成活性较低的晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒

该研究没有提供关于晶格氧物种或H2预处理对这些特定催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活影响的具体信息。
