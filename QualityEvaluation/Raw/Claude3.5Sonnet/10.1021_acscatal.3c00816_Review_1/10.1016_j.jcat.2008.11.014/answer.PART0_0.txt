[1] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

[2] "Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

[3] "The structure of Cr species in differently prepared CrMCM-41 (Cr content varied between 0.35 and 1.7 wt%) studied by in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) showed that aggregated Cr(III) are the active sites for DHP"

[4] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (CrO4) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

[5] "At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in CrO4 coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

[6] "In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

[7] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported CrOx show higher activity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3. The structural properties of these catalysts differ significantly:

SBA-15 at low Cr loading (1 wt%) contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, while at higher loading (5 wt%), it forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles alongside some isolated species. In contrast, γ-Al2O3 forms oligomers and isolated species at low loading, and mainly oligomers of varying nuclearity at higher loading, without Cr2O3 particles.

The catalytic behavior also varies:
- For SBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are more active, selective, and stable than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals.
- For Al2O3, oligomeric Cr species outperform isolated Cr sites in activity and selectivity.

The reaction mechanism involves on-site generation of active Cr sites during the reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state. This highlights the dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

The study does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it's noted that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was studied as an alternative to overcome challenges with traditional PDH, suggesting oxygen species play a role in reaction pathways and potentially in deactivation mechanisms.

The advantages of OMS catalysts seem to lie in their ability to stabilize isolated Cr species at low loadings and their higher activity compared to traditional supports. Limitations may include the formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15. The study emphasizes the importance of support nature and Cr loading in determining catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中显示出比传统金属氧化物载体如Al2O3更高的活性。这些催化剂的结构特性有显著差异：

SBA-15在低Cr负载量(1 wt%)时含有四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而在高负载量(5 wt%)时形成晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒和一些孤立物种。相比之下，γ-Al2O3在低负载量时形成低聚物和孤立物种，在高负载量时主要形成不同核数的低聚物，而不形成Cr2O3颗粒。

催化行为也有所不同：
- 对于SBA-15，配位数>4的孤立Cr(III)位比Cr2O3晶体表面的Cr位具有更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
- 对于Al2O3，低聚Cr物种在活性和选择性方面优于孤立Cr位。

反应机理涉及在反应过程中原位生成活性Cr位，Cr通常处于(III)氧化态。这突显了催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性。

该研究没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，文中提到研究了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服传统PDH挑战的替代方案，这表明氧物种在反应途径和可能的失活机制中起作用。

OMS催化剂的优势似乎在于它们能够在低负载量时稳定孤立Cr物种，并且比传统载体具有更高的活性。局限性可能包括在SBA-15上高负载量时形成活性较低的Cr2O3颗粒。该研究强调了载体性质和Cr负载量在决定PDH反应中催化剂结构和性能方面的重要性。
