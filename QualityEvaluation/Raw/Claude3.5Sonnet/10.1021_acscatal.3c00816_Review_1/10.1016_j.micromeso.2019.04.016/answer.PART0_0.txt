[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

The given literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which is a different reaction system.

However, based on the limited information provided, we can infer some relevant points:

1. The addition time of the metal (in this case, Cr) during the sol-gel synthesis process significantly affects the metal dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst.

2. The optimal catalytic activity was observed when the Cr precursor was added after the silica source (TEOS), suggesting that the metal-support interaction and metal dispersion are crucial for catalyst performance.

3. The location of the metal oxide within the mesoporous structure affects its catalytic activity. Metal oxide wrapped in the center of the mesoporous silica spheres showed weaker catalytic activity compared to well-dispersed metal oxide on the surface.

4. The study used CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which differs from traditional PDH reactions that typically use O2 or operate under non-oxidative conditions.

The literature does not provide information on lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not compare the performance of these catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions.

给出的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。该文本主要关注CrOX掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，这是一个不同的反应系统。

然而，根据提供的有限信息，我们可以推断出一些相关点：

1. 在溶胶-凝胶合成过程中，金属（在本例中为Cr）的添加时间显著影响了所得催化剂的金属分散度、表面物理化学性质和催化性能。

2. 当Cr前体在硅源（TEOS）之后添加时，观察到最佳的催化活性，这表明金属-载体相互作用和金属分散度对催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 金属氧化物在介孔结构中的位置影响其催化活性。包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中心的金属氧化物相比于表面上分散良好的金属氧化物表现出较弱的催化活性。

4. 该研究使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，这与传统的PDH反应不同，传统反应通常使用O2或在非氧化条件下进行。

文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种、H2预处理或详细反应机理的信息。它也没有将这些催化剂的性能与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，或讨论OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的优势和局限性。
