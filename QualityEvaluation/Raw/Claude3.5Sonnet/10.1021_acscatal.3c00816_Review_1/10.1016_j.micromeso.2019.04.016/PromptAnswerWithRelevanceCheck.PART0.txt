[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

The given literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which is a different reaction system.

However, based on the limited information provided, we can infer some relevant points:

1. The addition time of the metal (in this case, Cr) during the sol-gel synthesis process significantly affects the metal dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst.

2. The optimal catalytic activity was observed when the Cr precursor was added after the silica source (TEOS), suggesting that the metal-support interaction and metal dispersion are crucial for catalyst performance.

3. The location of the metal oxide within the mesoporous structure affects its catalytic activity. Metal oxide wrapped in the center of the mesoporous silica spheres showed weaker catalytic activity compared to well-dispersed metal oxide on the surface.

4. The study used CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which differs from traditional PDH reactions that typically use O2 or operate under non-oxidative conditions.

The literature does not provide information on lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not compare the performance of these catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions.

给出的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。该文本主要关注CrOX掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，这是一个不同的反应系统。

然而，根据提供的有限信息，我们可以推断出一些相关点：

1. 在溶胶-凝胶合成过程中，金属（在本例中为Cr）的添加时间显著影响了所得催化剂的金属分散度、表面物理化学性质和催化性能。

2. 当Cr前体在硅源（TEOS）之后添加时，观察到最佳的催化活性，这表明金属-载体相互作用和金属分散度对催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 金属氧化物在介孔结构中的位置影响其催化活性。包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中心的金属氧化物相比于表面上分散良好的金属氧化物表现出较弱的催化活性。

4. 该研究使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，这与传统的PDH反应不同，传统反应通常使用O2或在非氧化条件下进行。

文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种、H2预处理或详细反应机理的信息。它也没有将这些催化剂的性能与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，或讨论OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的优势和局限性。

The text focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which is related but not identical to the requested information.

From the available information, we can note that:

1. CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres were prepared using sol-gel and incipient-wetness impregnation methods.

2. The timing of Cr precursor addition during the sol-gel process significantly affects Cr dispersion, surface properties, and catalytic performance.

3. Adding the Cr precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) resulted in optimal catalytic activity (Cr/MSS-2).

4. Good CrOX dispersion doesn't always correlate with high catalytic activity, as seen in Cr/MSS-1 where some CrOX wrapped in the center of the spheres showed weaker activity.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports, VOx catalysts, traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现问题。文本主要关注CrOX掺杂的介孔硅球（Cr/MSS-X）在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢，这与所要求的信息相关但并不完全相同。

从可用信息中，我们可以注意到：

1. CrOX掺杂的介孔硅球是通过溶胶-凝胶法和浸渍法制备的。

2. 在溶胶-凝胶过程中添加Cr前驱体的时间显著影响Cr分散度、表面性质和催化性能。

3. 在正硅酸乙酯（TEOS）之后添加Cr前驱体可获得最佳催化活性（Cr/MSS-2）。

4. 良好的CrOX分散并不总是与高催化活性相关，如在Cr/MSS-1中，包裹在球体中心的部分CrOX表现出较弱的活性。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41和SBA-15载体、VOx催化剂、传统金属氧化物载体、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。

The provided literature focuses specifically on CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, rather than a broader comparison of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx.

The study highlights that the preparation method and timing of Cr precursor addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method showed that the Cr adding time affects Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance.

Cr/MSS-2, where the Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity. In contrast, Cr/MSS-1 showed good CrOx dispersion, but some CrOx wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity.

The literature does not provide information on traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms for comparison. Additionally, it does not discuss the specific advantages, limitations, or deactivation of these catalysts in PDH reactions.

The literature provides limited information specifically about MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

The study shows that the preparation method and timing of chromium addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method with different Cr addition times showed varying degrees of Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic activity.

Cr/MSS-2, where Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity. This suggests that the order of reagent addition during catalyst synthesis can significantly impact performance.

Interestingly, while Cr/MSS-1 showed good CrOx dispersion, some CrOx species wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity. This indicates that the location and accessibility of active sites within the mesoporous structure play a crucial role in determining catalyst efficiency.

The study does not provide direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation. However, the findings highlight the importance of synthesis methods and metal dispersion in mesoporous silica-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能提供了有限的信息。但是，它确实讨论了CrOx掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。

研究表明，制备方法和铬添加时间显著影响催化剂的性能和特性。通过溶胶-凝胶法制备的Cr/MSS-X催化剂，在不同的Cr添加时间下，表现出不同程度的Cr分散、表面物理化学性质和催化活性。

Cr/MSS-2，即在正硅酸四乙酯(TEOS)之后添加Cr前驱体的催化剂，表现出最佳的催化活性。这表明在催化剂合成过程中试剂添加的顺序可以显著影响性能。

有趣的是，虽然Cr/MSS-1显示出良好的CrOx分散性，但包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中心的一些CrOx物种表现出较弱的催化活性。这表明活性位点在介孔结构中的位置和可及性对决定催化剂效率起着关键作用。

该研究没有直接与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，这些发现强调了合成方法和金属分散在基于介孔二氧化硅的催化剂中对丙烷脱氢反应的重要性。
