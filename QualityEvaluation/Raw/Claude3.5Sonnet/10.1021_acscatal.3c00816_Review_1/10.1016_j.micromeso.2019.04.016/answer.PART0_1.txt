[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which is related but not identical to the requested information.

From the available information, we can note that:

1. CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres were prepared using sol-gel and incipient-wetness impregnation methods.

2. The timing of Cr precursor addition during the sol-gel process significantly affects Cr dispersion, surface properties, and catalytic performance.

3. Adding the Cr precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) resulted in optimal catalytic activity (Cr/MSS-2).

4. Good CrOX dispersion doesn't always correlate with high catalytic activity, as seen in Cr/MSS-1 where some CrOX wrapped in the center of the spheres showed weaker activity.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports, VOx catalysts, traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现问题。文本主要关注CrOX掺杂的介孔硅球（Cr/MSS-X）在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢，这与所要求的信息相关但并不完全相同。

从可用信息中，我们可以注意到：

1. CrOX掺杂的介孔硅球是通过溶胶-凝胶法和浸渍法制备的。

2. 在溶胶-凝胶过程中添加Cr前驱体的时间显著影响Cr分散度、表面性质和催化性能。

3. 在正硅酸乙酯（TEOS）之后添加Cr前驱体可获得最佳催化活性（Cr/MSS-2）。

4. 良好的CrOX分散并不总是与高催化活性相关，如在Cr/MSS-1中，包裹在球体中心的部分CrOX表现出较弱的活性。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41和SBA-15载体、VOx催化剂、传统金属氧化物载体、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。
