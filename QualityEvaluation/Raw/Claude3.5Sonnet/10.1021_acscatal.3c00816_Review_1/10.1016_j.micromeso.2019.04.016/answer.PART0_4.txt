[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

The literature provides limited information specifically about MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

The study shows that the preparation method and timing of chromium addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method with different Cr addition times showed varying degrees of Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic activity.

Cr/MSS-2, where Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity. This suggests that the order of reagent addition during catalyst synthesis can significantly impact performance.

Interestingly, while Cr/MSS-1 showed good CrOx dispersion, some CrOx species wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity. This indicates that the location and accessibility of active sites within the mesoporous structure play a crucial role in determining catalyst efficiency.

The study does not provide direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation. However, the findings highlight the importance of synthesis methods and metal dispersion in mesoporous silica-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能提供了有限的信息。但是，它确实讨论了CrOx掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。

研究表明，制备方法和铬添加时间显著影响催化剂的性能和特性。通过溶胶-凝胶法制备的Cr/MSS-X催化剂，在不同的Cr添加时间下，表现出不同程度的Cr分散、表面物理化学性质和催化活性。

Cr/MSS-2，即在正硅酸四乙酯(TEOS)之后添加Cr前驱体的催化剂，表现出最佳的催化活性。这表明在催化剂合成过程中试剂添加的顺序可以显著影响性能。

有趣的是，虽然Cr/MSS-1显示出良好的CrOx分散性，但包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中心的一些CrOx物种表现出较弱的催化活性。这表明活性位点在介孔结构中的位置和可及性对决定催化剂效率起着关键作用。

该研究没有直接与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，这些发现强调了合成方法和金属分散在基于介孔二氧化硅的催化剂中对丙烷脱氢反应的重要性。
