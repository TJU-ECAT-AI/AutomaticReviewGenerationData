[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer some insights into CrOx-doped mesoporous silica catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The study focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) prepared using sol-gel and incipient-wetness impregnation methods. The timing of Cr precursor addition during the sol-gel process significantly influences Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance.

Cr/MSS-2 catalysts, obtained by adding the Cr precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), showed optimal catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 also demonstrated good CrOX dispersion, some CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity.

The study does not directly compare these catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss reaction mechanisms, lattice oxygen species, or H2 pretreatment effects. It also does not provide information on MCM-41 or SBA-15 supported catalysts or VOx-based systems.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。但是，它确实提供了一些关于CrOx掺杂介孔二氧化硅催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢的见解。

研究重点关注使用溶胶-凝胶和浸渍法制备的CrOX掺杂介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)。在溶胶-凝胶过程中添加Cr前驱体的时间显著影响Cr分散、表面物理化学性质和催化性能。

通过在正硅酸四乙酯(TEOS)之后添加Cr前驱体获得的Cr/MSS-2催化剂显示出最佳的催化活性。虽然Cr/MSS-1也表现出良好的CrOX分散性，但包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中心的部分CrOX表现出较弱的催化活性。

该研究没有直接将这些催化剂与传统的金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论反应机理、晶格氧物种或H2预处理的影响。它也没有提供关于MCM-41或SBA-15负载催化剂或基于VOx系统的信息。
