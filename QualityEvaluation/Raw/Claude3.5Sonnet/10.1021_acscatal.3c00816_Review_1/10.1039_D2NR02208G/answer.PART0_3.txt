[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Meanwhile, the absence of the isolated state of the Cr(vi) species in this sample contributed to high activity toward the PDH process."

[3] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[4] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

[5] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction."

The literature provides some insights into the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 and SBA-15 are porous silica supports with well-defined structures and large surface areas. These properties allow for better dispersion of active metal species compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

2. Catalytic behavior: 
   - For CrOx/MCM-41: High Cr loading reduced surface hydroxyl groups, leading to inactive Cr(III) species. However, the absence of isolated Cr(VI) species contributed to high PDH activity.
   - For VOx/SiO2: Low polymeric VOx species were identified as the major active centers. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion were critical for excellent PDH performance.

3. Advantages:
   - Better metal dispersion
   - Large surface area for active sites
   - Potential for tailoring pore structures to enhance catalytic performance

4. Limitations:
   - Possible formation of inactive species at high metal loadings
   - Potential instability of the mesoporous structure under harsh reaction conditions

5. Reaction mechanisms: The literature doesn't provide detailed information on reaction mechanisms specific to OMS-supported catalysts. However, it suggests that the dispersion and polymeric state of active species play crucial roles.

6. Influence of lattice oxygen species: The literature doesn't directly address the role of lattice oxygen species in OMS-supported catalysts for PDH reactions.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not specifically mentioned for OMS catalysts, H2 pretreatment was shown to enhance the interaction between Cr species and Al2O3 supports, improving stability and anti-coking properties. This technique might also be applicable to OMS-supported catalysts.

8. Deactivation: The literature doesn't provide specific information on deactivation mechanisms for OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions. However, coking and metal sintering are common deactivation pathways in PDH catalysts that likely apply to these systems as well.

In conclusion, while OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show promise for PDH reactions due to their structural properties and potential for high metal dispersion, more research is needed to fully understand their performance, limitations, and deactivation mechanisms in comparison to traditional supports.

文献对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能提供了一些见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41和SBA-15是具有明确结构和大表面积的多孔二氧化硅载体。这些特性与传统金属氧化物载体相比，可以更好地分散活性金属物种。

2. 催化行为：
   - 对于CrOx/MCM-41：高Cr负载量减少了表面羟基，导致生成了不活性的Cr(III)物种。然而，孤立Cr(VI)物种的缺失促进了PDH的高活性。
   - 对于VOx/SiO2：低聚合度的VOx物种被认为是主要的活性中心。适当的VOx负载量和高分散度对于获得优异的PDH性能至关重要。

3. 优势：
   - 更好的金属分散性
   - 为活性位点提供大表面积
   - 可能通过调整孔结构来增强催化性能

4. 局限性：
   - 高金属负载时可能形成不活性物种
   - 在苛刻的反应条件下介孔结构可能不稳定

5. 反应机理：文献没有提供OMS负载催化剂特定的详细反应机理。但是，它表明活性物种的分散度和聚合状态起着关键作用。

6. 晶格氧物种的影响：文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种在OMS负载催化剂PDH反应中的作用。

7. H2预处理：虽然没有特别提到OMS催化剂，但H2预处理被证实可以增强Cr物种与Al2O3载体之间的相互作用，改善稳定性和抗积碳性能。这种技术可能也适用于OMS负载催化剂。

8. 失活：文献没有提供OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中特定的失活机制信息。然而，积碳和金属烧结是PDH催化剂常见的失活途径，可能也适用于这些体系。

总之，虽然OMS负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂由于其结构特性和高金属分散潜力而在PDH反应中显示出前景，但仍需要更多研究来充分理解它们与传统载体相比的性能、局限性和失活机制。
