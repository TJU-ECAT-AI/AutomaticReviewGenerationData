[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their main advantages stem from their well-defined porous structure, large surface area, and ability to highly disperse active metal species.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, high Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. This suggests that optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

VOx supported on microporous SiO2 exhibits exceptional catalytic performance, with low polymeric VOx species acting as the major active centers. The virus-like structure of porous SiO2 nanospheres supporting VOx demonstrates that adequate loading content and high dispersion of VOx species are critical for excellent PDH performance.

Compared to traditional supports, OMS materials offer better control over metal dispersion and pore structure. This allows for optimization of active site accessibility and reactant/product diffusion. However, the acidity of the support surface plays a crucial role in coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coking tendency.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of the supported metal oxide species (V or Cr), with lattice oxygen participating in the abstraction of hydrogen from propane. The regeneration of the reduced metal sites occurs through gas-phase oxygen or lattice oxygen migration.

H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between metal species (e.g., Cr) and the support, improving stability and anti-coking properties. This pretreatment likely creates oxygen vacancies and modifies the electronic state of the metal, affecting its catalytic behavior.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions over these materials is primarily due to coke formation and sintering of active metal species. The ordered porous structure of OMS supports may help mitigate sintering to some extent, but controlling surface acidity and optimizing metal-support interactions are key to minimizing coke formation and maintaining long-term catalyst stability.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。它们的主要优势源于其well-defined的多孔结构、大比表面积以及能够高度分散活性金属物种的能力。

对于负载在MCM-41上的CrOx，高Cr负载量会减少表面羟基，导致形成无活性的Cr(III)物种。这表明优化Cr负载量对于维持催化剂活性至关重要。

负载在微孔SiO2上的VOx表现出优异的催化性能，低聚合度的VOx物种作为主要活性中心。病毒状结构的多孔SiO2纳米球负载VOx的研究表明，适当的负载量和VOx物种的高分散度对于获得优异的PDH性能至关重要。

与传统载体相比，OMS材料能更好地控制金属分散度和孔结构。这允许优化活性位点的可及性和反应物/产物的扩散。然而，载体表面的酸性在积碳形成中起着关键作用，酸性越高，积碳倾向越大。

反应机理可能涉及负载的金属氧化物物种（V或Cr）的氧化还原循环，晶格氧参与从丙烷中提取氢。还原的金属位点通过气相氧或晶格氧迁移进行再生。

H2预处理可以增强金属物种（如Cr）与载体之间的相互作用，提高稳定性和抗积碳性能。这种预处理可能会创造氧空位并修改金属的电子态，从而影响其催化行为。

这些材料在PDH反应中的催化剂失活主要是由于积碳形成和活性金属物种的烧结。OMS载体的有序多孔结构可能在一定程度上有助于减轻烧结，但控制表面酸性和优化金属-载体相互作用是最小化积碳形成和维持催化剂长期稳定性的关键。
