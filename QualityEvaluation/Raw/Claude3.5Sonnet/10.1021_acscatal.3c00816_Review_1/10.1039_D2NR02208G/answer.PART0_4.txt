[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[3] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their structural properties, including high surface area, uniform pore structure, and enhanced dispersion of active species, contribute to improved catalytic behavior.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, high loadings of Cr reduce surface hydroxyl groups on SiO2, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. This suggests that optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

VOx supported on microporous SiO2 demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance, with low polymeric VOx species acting as the major active center for PDH. The virus-like structure of porous SiO2 nanospheres supporting VOx also shows excellent performance, highlighting the importance of adequate VOx loading and high dispersion of VOx species.

Compared to traditional supports, OMS materials offer advantages such as better dispersion of active species, higher surface area, and uniform pore structure. These properties contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. However, limitations may include potential pore blocking at high metal loadings and the need for careful control of metal-support interactions.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of vanadium or chromium species, with the support playing a crucial role in stabilizing the active sites and facilitating the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products.

Lattice oxygen species play a significant role in the PDH reaction, particularly for VOx catalysts. They participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen is involved in the abstraction of hydrogen from propane.

H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between metal species (e.g., Cr) and the support, improving catalyst stability and anti-coking properties. This pretreatment likely creates a more reduced state of the metal species, which can be beneficial for PDH activity and longevity of the catalyst.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions is often caused by coke formation and sintering of active species. The ordered structure of OMS supports may help mitigate these issues by providing better dispersion and stabilization of active sites, but careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition is still necessary to maintain long-term performance.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx,在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。它们的结构特性,包括高比表面积、均匀的孔结构和活性物种的高度分散,有助于改善催化行为。

对于MCM-41负载的CrOx,高浓度的Cr会减少SiO2表面的羟基基团,导致形成无活性的Cr(III)物种。这表明优化Cr负载量对维持催化剂活性至关重要。

负载在微孔SiO2上的VOx表现出优异的催化性能,其中低聚合度的VOx物种作为PDH的主要活性中心。具有病毒状结构的多孔SiO2纳米球负载VOx也表现出优异的性能,突出了适当的VOx负载量和VOx物种高度分散的重要性。

与传统载体相比,OMS材料提供了更好的活性物种分散性、更高的比表面积和均匀的孔结构等优势。这些特性有助于提高催化活性和稳定性。然而,限制可能包括高金属负载时可能出现的孔堵塞以及需要仔细控制金属-载体相互作用。

反应机理可能涉及钒或铬物种的氧化还原循环,其中载体在稳定活性位点和促进反应物和产物的吸附和脱附方面起着关键作用。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应中发挥重要作用,特别是对于VOx催化剂。它们参与Mars-van Krevelen机制,其中晶格氧参与从丙烷中提取氢。

H2预处理可以增强金属物种(如Cr)与载体之间的相互作用,改善催化剂的稳定性和抗积炭性能。这种预处理可能会使金属物种形成更还原的状态,这对PDH活性和催化剂的寿命有益。

PDH反应中催化剂失活通常由积炭和活性物种烧结引起。OMS载体的有序结构可能有助于通过提供更好的分散性和活性位点稳定性来缓解这些问题,但仍需仔细控制反应条件和催化剂组成以维持长期性能。
