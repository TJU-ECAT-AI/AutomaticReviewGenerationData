Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their main advantages stem from their well-defined porous structure, large surface area, and ability to highly disperse active metal species.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, high Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. This suggests that optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

VOx supported on microporous SiO2 exhibits exceptional catalytic performance, with low polymeric VOx species acting as the major active centers. The virus-like structure of porous SiO2 nanospheres supporting VOx demonstrates that adequate loading content and high dispersion of VOx species are critical for excellent PDH performance.

Compared to traditional supports, OMS materials offer better control over metal dispersion and pore structure. This allows for optimization of active site accessibility and reactant/product diffusion. However, the acidity of the support surface plays a crucial role in coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coking tendency.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of the supported metal oxide species (V or Cr), with lattice oxygen participating in the abstraction of hydrogen from propane. The regeneration of the reduced metal sites occurs through gas-phase oxygen or lattice oxygen migration.

H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between metal species (e.g., Cr) and the support, improving stability and anti-coking properties. This pretreatment likely creates oxygen vacancies and modifies the electronic state of the metal, affecting its catalytic behavior.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions over these materials is primarily due to coke formation and sintering of active metal species. The ordered porous structure of OMS supports may help mitigate sintering to some extent, but controlling surface acidity and optimizing metal-support interactions are key to minimizing coke formation and maintaining long-term catalyst stability.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。它们的主要优势源于其well-defined的多孔结构、大比表面积以及能够高度分散活性金属物种的能力。

对于负载在MCM-41上的CrOx，高Cr负载量会减少表面羟基，导致形成无活性的Cr(III)物种。这表明优化Cr负载量对于维持催化剂活性至关重要。

负载在微孔SiO2上的VOx表现出优异的催化性能，低聚合度的VOx物种作为主要活性中心。病毒状结构的多孔SiO2纳米球负载VOx的研究表明，适当的负载量和VOx物种的高分散度对于获得优异的PDH性能至关重要。

与传统载体相比，OMS材料能更好地控制金属分散度和孔结构。这允许优化活性位点的可及性和反应物/产物的扩散。然而，载体表面的酸性在积碳形成中起着关键作用，酸性越高，积碳倾向越大。

反应机理可能涉及负载的金属氧化物物种（V或Cr）的氧化还原循环，晶格氧参与从丙烷中提取氢。还原的金属位点通过气相氧或晶格氧迁移进行再生。

H2预处理可以增强金属物种（如Cr）与载体之间的相互作用，提高稳定性和抗积碳性能。这种预处理可能会创造氧空位并修改金属的电子态，从而影响其催化行为。

这些材料在PDH反应中的催化剂失活主要是由于积碳形成和活性金属物种的烧结。OMS载体的有序多孔结构可能在一定程度上有助于减轻烧结，但控制表面酸性和优化金属-载体相互作用是最小化积碳形成和维持催化剂长期稳定性的关键。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts offer several advantages:

1. High surface area and well-defined pore structure, allowing for better dispersion of active metal species.

2. Improved control over metal loading and distribution.

3. Enhanced stability due to the ordered mesoporous structure.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, the catalytic performance is influenced by the Cr loading. Higher Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. However, the absence of isolated Cr(VI) species contributes to high PDH activity.

VOx supported on mesoporous silica shows exceptional catalytic performance. The low polymeric VOx species are considered the major active centers for PDH. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion of VOx species are critical for achieving excellent catalytic performance.

The reaction mechanism for these catalysts typically involves the following steps:

1. Propane adsorption on the metal oxide sites
2. C-H bond activation
3. Hydrogen abstraction
4. Propylene formation and desorption

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation include:

1. Lattice oxygen species: These play a crucial role in the redox cycle of the active metal species and can affect the overall catalytic activity.

2. H2 pretreatment: This can influence the oxidation state of the metal species, potentially creating more active sites or reducing catalyst deactivation.

3. Metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between the metal species and the ordered mesoporous silica support can enhance stability and resist sintering.

4. Coke formation: The ordered pore structure may help mitigate coke deposition, but it can still lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

Limitations of these catalysts include potential pore blockage due to coke formation and the possibility of metal leaching under harsh reaction conditions. Further research is needed to optimize metal loading, improve catalyst stability, and develop efficient regeneration methods for long-term industrial use.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their structural properties, including high surface area, uniform pore structure, and enhanced dispersion of active species, contribute to improved catalytic behavior.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, high loadings of Cr reduce surface hydroxyl groups on SiO2, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. This suggests that optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

VOx supported on microporous SiO2 demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance, with low polymeric VOx species acting as the major active center for PDH. The virus-like structure of porous SiO2 nanospheres supporting VOx also shows excellent performance, highlighting the importance of adequate VOx loading and high dispersion of VOx species.

Compared to traditional supports, OMS materials offer advantages such as better dispersion of active species, higher surface area, and uniform pore structure. These properties contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. However, limitations may include potential pore blocking at high metal loadings and the need for careful control of metal-support interactions.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of vanadium or chromium species, with the support playing a crucial role in stabilizing the active sites and facilitating the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products.

Lattice oxygen species play a significant role in the PDH reaction, particularly for VOx catalysts. They participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen is involved in the abstraction of hydrogen from propane.

H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between metal species (e.g., Cr) and the support, improving catalyst stability and anti-coking properties. This pretreatment likely creates a more reduced state of the metal species, which can be beneficial for PDH activity and longevity of the catalyst.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions is often caused by coke formation and sintering of active species. The ordered structure of OMS supports may help mitigate these issues by providing better dispersion and stabilization of active sites, but careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition is still necessary to maintain long-term performance.
