[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process."

[2] "The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species. Meanwhile, the absence of the isolated state of the Cr(vi) species in this sample contributed to high activity toward the PDH process."

[3] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[4] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts offer several advantages:

1. High surface area and well-defined pore structure, allowing for better dispersion of active metal species.

2. Improved control over metal loading and distribution.

3. Enhanced stability due to the ordered mesoporous structure.

For CrOx supported on MCM-41, the catalytic performance is influenced by the Cr loading. Higher Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species. However, the absence of isolated Cr(VI) species contributes to high PDH activity.

VOx supported on mesoporous silica shows exceptional catalytic performance. The low polymeric VOx species are considered the major active centers for PDH. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion of VOx species are critical for achieving excellent catalytic performance.

The reaction mechanism for these catalysts typically involves the following steps:

1. Propane adsorption on the metal oxide sites
2. C-H bond activation
3. Hydrogen abstraction
4. Propylene formation and desorption

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation include:

1. Lattice oxygen species: These play a crucial role in the redox cycle of the active metal species and can affect the overall catalytic activity.

2. H2 pretreatment: This can influence the oxidation state of the metal species, potentially creating more active sites or reducing catalyst deactivation.

3. Metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between the metal species and the ordered mesoporous silica support can enhance stability and resist sintering.

4. Coke formation: The ordered pore structure may help mitigate coke deposition, but it can still lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

Limitations of these catalysts include potential pore blockage due to coke formation and the possibility of metal leaching under harsh reaction conditions. Further research is needed to optimize metal loading, improve catalyst stability, and develop efficient regeneration methods for long-term industrial use.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。这些催化剂具有以下几个优势：

1. 高比表面积和明确的孔结构，有利于活性金属物种的更好分散。

2. 对金属负载量和分布的更好控制。

3. 由于有序介孔结构而提高的稳定性。

对于负载在MCM-41上的CrOx，其催化性能受Cr负载量的影响。较高的Cr负载量会减少表面羟基，导致形成不活性的Cr(III)物种。然而，孤立的Cr(VI)物种的缺失有助于提高PDH活性。

负载在介孔硅上的VOx显示出优异的催化性能。低聚合度的VOx物种被认为是PDH的主要活性中心。适当的VOx负载量和VOx物种的高分散度对于获得优异的催化性能至关重要。

这些催化剂的反应机理通常包括以下步骤：

1. 丙烷在金属氧化物位点上的吸附
2. C-H键活化
3. 氢原子提取
4. 丙烯形成和脱附

影响催化剂性能和失活的因素包括：

1. 晶格氧物种：这些在活性金属物种的氧化还原循环中起着关键作用，可以影响整体催化活性。

2. H2预处理：这可以影响金属物种的氧化态，潜在地创造更多活性位点或减少催化剂失活。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：金属物种与有序介孔硅载体之间的强相互作用可以增强稳定性并抵抗烧结。

4. 积炭形成：有序的孔结构可能有助于减轻积炭沉积，但随着时间的推移仍可能导致催化剂失活。

这些催化剂的局限性包括由于积炭形成而可能导致的孔阻塞，以及在苛刻的反应条件下金属可能流失。需要进一步研究以优化金属负载量，提高催化剂稳定性，并开发有效的再生方法以实现长期工业使用。
