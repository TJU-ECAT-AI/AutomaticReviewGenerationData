[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Hu et al. prepared a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[3] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

[4] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Structural properties: OMS materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 provide high surface areas and well-defined pore structures, allowing for better dispersion of active metal species. This results in improved catalytic performance compared to conventional supports.

2. Catalytic behavior: VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials exhibit excellent catalytic activity in PDH reactions. The high dispersion of active species and the unique pore structure of OMS supports contribute to enhanced propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The PDH reaction over OMS-supported catalysts follows a similar mechanism to traditional supports, involving the activation of C-H bonds on metal oxide sites. However, the improved dispersion and accessibility of active sites in OMS materials may lead to more efficient catalytic processes.

4. Lattice oxygen species: The presence of lattice oxygen in VOx and CrOx species plays a crucial role in the PDH reaction. These oxygen species participate in the activation of propane molecules and the formation of propylene. The interaction between metal oxides and the OMS support can influence the availability and reactivity of lattice oxygen.

5. H2 pretreatment: Hydrogen pretreatment can significantly impact catalyst performance in PDH reactions. It can enhance the interaction between metal species and the support, leading to improved stability and resistance to coking. This effect is observed in both traditional and OMS-supported catalysts.

6. Limitations: Despite their advantages, OMS-supported catalysts may face some challenges. High metal loadings can lead to the reduction of surface hydroxyl groups and the formation of inactive species, as observed in the case of Cr-loaded MCM-41. Careful optimization of metal loading and preparation methods is necessary to maximize catalyst performance.

7. Deactivation: Coking and sintering of active metal species remain significant challenges for PDH catalysts, including those supported on OMS materials. However, the improved dispersion and stability offered by OMS supports can help mitigate these issues to some extent.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts show great potential for PDH reactions, offering improved performance over traditional supports due to their unique structural properties and ability to disperse active metal species effectively. However, careful optimization of catalyst composition and preparation methods is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出了promising的性能。与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂具有以下优势：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41和SBA-15等OMS材料提供了高比表面积和明确的孔结构，使活性金属物种能够更好地分散。这导致了比传统载体更好的催化性能。

2. 催化行为：负载在OMS材料上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中表现出优异的催化活性。活性物种的高度分散和OMS载体的独特孔结构有助于提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 反应机理：OMS负载催化剂上的PDH反应遵循与传统载体相似的机理，涉及金属氧化物位点上C-H键的活化。然而，OMS材料中活性位点的改善分散和可及性可能导致更高效的催化过程。

4. 晶格氧物种：VOx和CrOx物种中晶格氧的存在在PDH反应中起着关键作用。这些氧物种参与丙烷分子的活化和丙烯的形成。金属氧化物与OMS载体之间的相互作用可以影响晶格氧的可用性和反应性。

5. H2预处理：氢气预处理可以显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能。它可以增强金属物种与载体之间的相互作用，从而提高稳定性和抗积碳能力。这种效果在传统和OMS负载的催化剂中都可以观察到。

6. 局限性：尽管具有优势，OMS负载催化剂仍可能面临一些挑战。高金属负载量可能导致表面羟基群的减少和无活性物种的形成，如在Cr负载的MCM-41中观察到的那样。需要仔细优化金属负载量和制备方法以最大化催化剂性能。

7. 失活：积碳和活性金属物种的烧结仍然是PDH催化剂面临的重大挑战，包括那些负载在OMS材料上的催化剂。然而，OMS载体提供的改善分散和稳定性可以在一定程度上帮助缓解这些问题。

总之，金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在PDH反应中显示出巨大潜力，由于其独特的结构特性和有效分散活性金属物种的能力，与传统载体相比具有更好的性能。然而，仔细优化催化剂组成和制备方法对于最大化其优势和克服局限性至关重要。
