[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include:

1. Low acidity
2. High specific surface area
3. Ordered pore structure
4. Better dispersion of reactive sites
5. Enhanced anticoking capacity

These properties contribute to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions. Specifically, VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity.

However, these catalysts also face limitations, primarily rapid deactivation. The depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as a significant factor in this deactivation process.

Regarding the reaction mechanism and influencing factors:

1. Lattice oxygen species: As-prepared CrOx and VOx catalysts show the presence of lattice oxygen species participating in the PDH reaction, evidenced by initial CO production.

2. H2 pretreatment: This process eliminates the CO product, suggesting a change in the catalyst's oxidation state and its impact on the reaction mechanism.

3. Oxidation state: Oxidized CrOx and VOx species exhibit higher activity compared to their reduced counterparts.

Comparing VOx and CrOx catalysts, VOx/MCM-41 shows superior catalytic activity, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat^-1·h^-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

In summary, while Metal-OMS catalysts offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their structural properties, managing catalyst deactivation and understanding the role of lattice oxygen and oxidation states remain crucial challenges in optimizing these systems.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。OMS催化剂的优势包括：

1. 低酸性
2. 高比表面积
3. 有序孔结构
4. 更好的反应位点分散性
5. 增强的抗结焦能力

这些特性有助于提高PDH反应中的催化性能。具体而言，负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx表现出可观的丙烯生产力。

然而，这些催化剂也面临着局限性，主要是快速失活。晶格氧的消耗被认为是导致这种失活过程的重要因素。

关于反应机理和影响因素：

1. 晶格氧物种：新制备的CrOx和VOx催化剂显示晶格氧物种参与PDH反应，这从初始CO产物的生成可以得到证实。

2. H2预处理：这个过程消除了CO产物，表明催化剂的氧化状态发生了变化，并影响了反应机理。

3. 氧化态：氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种比还原态表现出更高的活性。

比较VOx和CrOx催化剂，VOx/MCM-41显示出更优越的催化活性，达到0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat^-1·h^-1的丙烷生产力和90%的丙烯选择性。

总之，虽然金属-OMS催化剂由于其结构特性在PDH反应中提供了改进的性能，但管理催化剂失活以及理解晶格氧和氧化态的作用仍然是优化这些系统的关键挑战。
