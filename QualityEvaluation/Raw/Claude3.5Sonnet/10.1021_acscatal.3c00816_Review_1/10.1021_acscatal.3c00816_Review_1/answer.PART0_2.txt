[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity.

VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst shows better catalytic activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of a small amount of CO product in the initial 3 hours of reaction over as-prepared catalysts, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment.

Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The as-prepared (oxidized) VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. This indicates that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in modifying the catalyst's behavior. It eliminates the CO product formation and affects the catalyst's stability and activity. The pretreatment likely reduces the metal oxide species, which influences their interaction with the reactants and the overall catalytic performance.

In conclusion, while Metal-OMS catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions, they face challenges related to rapid deactivation. Understanding and controlling the role of lattice oxygen species and the effects of pretreatment are crucial for optimizing these catalysts for industrial applications.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。OMS催化剂的优势包括低酸性、高比表面积和有序的孔结构，这有助于反应位点的更好分散和提高抗积炭能力。

负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中展现出可观的丙烯生产力。然而，它们存在快速失活的问题，这是一个重要的限制。VOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出比CrOx/MCM-41更好的催化活性，达到0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1的丙烷生产力和90%的丙烯选择性。

反应机理涉及未预处理的CrOx和VOx中晶格氧物种参与PDH反应。这一点通过在未预处理催化剂上反应初始3小时内检测到少量CO产物得到证实，而H2预处理则消除了这种CO产物。

晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素显著影响催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活。未预处理（氧化态）的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出更高的丙烯生产力但较差的催化稳定性，相比于它们的预还原对应物。这表明氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种比还原态更活跃。然而，晶格氧的消耗被认为是催化剂失活的重要原因。

H2预处理在调节催化剂行为方面起着关键作用。它消除了CO产物的形成，并影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。预处理可能还原了金属氧化物物种，这影响了它们与反应物的相互作用和整体催化性能。

总之，虽然金属-OMS催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能，但它们面临快速失活的挑战。理解和控制晶格氧物种的作用以及预处理的影响对于优化这些催化剂以用于工业应用至关重要。
