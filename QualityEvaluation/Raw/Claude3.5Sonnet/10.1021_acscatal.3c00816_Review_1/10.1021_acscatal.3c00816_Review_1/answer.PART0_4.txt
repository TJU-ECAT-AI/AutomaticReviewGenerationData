[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity.

VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of a small amount of CO product in the initial 3 hours of reaction over as-prepared catalysts, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment.

Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. This indicates that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in modifying catalyst behavior. It eliminates CO production and affects the oxidation state of the active species, which in turn influences catalyst activity and stability. The balance between high activity (associated with oxidized species) and improved stability (associated with reduced species) is a key consideration in optimizing these catalysts for PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。OMS催化剂的优势包括低酸性、高比表面积和有序的孔结构，这有助于反应位点的更好分散和提高抗积碳能力。

VOx和CrOx负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上在PDH反应中显示出可观的丙烯生产力。然而，它们存在快速失活的问题，这是一个显著的限制。VOx/MCM-41展现出比CrOx/MCM-41更好的催化活性，丙烷生产力达到0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1，丙烯选择性为90%。

反应机理涉及新制备的CrOx和VOx中晶格氧物种参与PDH反应。这一点从新制备催化剂在反应初始3小时内检测到少量CO产物，而经H2预处理后消除这种CO产物的现象得到证实。

晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。新制备的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂相比于其预还原的对应物表现出更高的丙烯生产力，但催化稳定性较差。这表明氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种比还原态的更活跃。然而，晶格氧的消耗被认为是催化剂失活的一个重要原因。

H2预处理在调节催化剂行为中起着关键作用。它消除了CO的产生，并影响活性物种的氧化态，从而影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。在优化这些催化剂用于PDH反应时，平衡高活性（与氧化态物种相关）和改善稳定性（与还原态物种相关）是一个关键考虑因素。
