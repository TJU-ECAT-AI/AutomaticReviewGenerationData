[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include:

1. Low acidity
2. High specific surface area
3. Ordered pore structure

These properties contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity. The VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions.

However, these catalysts suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of CO product in the initial stages of the reaction, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment.

The oxidized forms of CrOx and VOx species are more active than their reduced counterparts. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen during the reaction is proposed as a major reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in influencing catalyst performance. It eliminates the CO product formation, suggesting a change in the reaction mechanism and the state of the active species.

Among the compared catalysts, VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

In summary, while Metal-OMS catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions due to their structural advantages, they face challenges related to fast deactivation and the complex interplay between oxidation states and lattice oxygen species.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。OMS催化剂的优点包括：

1. 低酸性
2. 高比表面积
3. 有序孔结构

这些特性有助于反应位点的更好分散和提高抗积碳能力。负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中表现出相当高的丙烯生产力。

然而，这些催化剂存在快速失活的问题，这是一个显著的局限性。反应机理涉及新制备的CrOx和VOx中晶格氧物种参与PDH反应。这一点可以从反应初期检测到CO产物得到证实，而H2预处理可以消除这种CO产物。

CrOx和VOx物种的氧化态比还原态更具活性。然而，反应过程中晶格氧的耗尽被认为是催化剂失活的主要原因之一。

H2预处理在影响催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。它消除了CO产物的形成，表明反应机理和活性物种状态发生了变化。

在比较的催化剂中，VOx/MCM-41表现出比CrOx/MCM-41更好的催化活性，丙烷生产力达到0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1，丙烯选择性为90%。

总之，虽然金属-OMS催化剂由于其结构优势在PDH反应中表现出promising的性能，但它们面临快速失活和氧化态与晶格氧物种之间复杂相互作用的挑战。
