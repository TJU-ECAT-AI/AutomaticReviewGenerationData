[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity.

MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst shows better catalytic activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of a small amount of CO product in the initial 3 hours of reaction over as-prepared catalysts. H2 pretreatment eliminates this CO product, suggesting that the pretreatment affects the lattice oxygen species and their involvement in the reaction.

The oxidation state of the metal species plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. As-prepared (oxidized) VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. This indicates that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones.

However, the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation. This suggests that while the oxidized species are initially more active, their performance declines as the lattice oxygen is consumed during the reaction.

In summary, Metal-OMS catalysts show promise for PDH reactions due to their structural properties, but they face challenges related to rapid deactivation. The balance between initial activity and long-term stability, influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species and pretreatment conditions, remains a key area for optimization in these catalytic systems.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。OMS催化剂的优势包括低酸性、高比表面积和有序的孔结构，这些特性有助于反应位点的更好分散和提高抗积碳能力。

MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出可观的丙烯生产力。然而，它们存在快速失活的显著限制。VOx/MCM-41催化剂比CrOx/MCM-41表现出更好的催化活性，丙烷生产力达到0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1，丙烯选择性达90%。

反应机理涉及新制备的CrOx和VOx的晶格氧参与PDH反应。这一点通过在新制备催化剂反应初始3小时内检测到少量CO产物得到证实。H2预处理消除了这种CO产物，表明预处理影响了晶格氧物种及其在反应中的参与。

金属物种的氧化态在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。新制备的（氧化态）VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出优越的丙烯生产力，但催化稳定性较差，相比之下，预还原的催化剂则表现相反。这表明氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种比还原态的更活跃。

然而，晶格氧的消耗被认为是催化剂失活的重要原因。这表明虽然氧化态物种最初活性更高，但随着反应过程中晶格氧的消耗，其性能会下降。

总之，金属-OMS催化剂由于其结构特性在PDH反应中表现出潜力，但面临快速失活的挑战。初始活性和长期稳定性之间的平衡，受晶格氧物种和预处理条件等因素影响，仍然是这些催化体系优化的关键领域。

The oxidized forms of CrOx and VOx species are more active than their reduced counterparts. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen during the reaction is proposed as a major reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in influencing catalyst performance. It eliminates the CO product formation, suggesting a change in the reaction mechanism and the state of the active species.

Among the compared catalysts, VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

In summary, while Metal-OMS catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions due to their structural advantages, they face challenges related to fast deactivation and the complex interplay between oxidation states and lattice oxygen species.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in modifying the catalyst's behavior. It eliminates the CO product formation and affects the catalyst's stability and activity. The pretreatment likely reduces the metal oxide species, which influences their interaction with the reactants and the overall catalytic performance.

In conclusion, while Metal-OMS catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions, they face challenges related to rapid deactivation. Understanding and controlling the role of lattice oxygen species and the effects of pretreatment are crucial for optimizing these catalysts for industrial applications.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include:

1. Low acidity
2. High specific surface area
3. Ordered pore structure
4. Better dispersion of reactive sites
5. Enhanced anticoking capacity

These properties contribute to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions. Specifically, VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity.

However, these catalysts also face limitations, primarily rapid deactivation. The depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as a significant factor in this deactivation process.

Regarding the reaction mechanism and influencing factors:

1. Lattice oxygen species: As-prepared CrOx and VOx catalysts show the presence of lattice oxygen species participating in the PDH reaction, evidenced by initial CO production.

2. H2 pretreatment: This process eliminates the CO product, suggesting a change in the catalyst's oxidation state and its impact on the reaction mechanism.

3. Oxidation state: Oxidized CrOx and VOx species exhibit higher activity compared to their reduced counterparts.

Comparing VOx and CrOx catalysts, VOx/MCM-41 shows superior catalytic activity, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat^-1·h^-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

In summary, while Metal-OMS catalysts offer improved performance in PDH reactions due to their structural properties, managing catalyst deactivation and understanding the role of lattice oxygen and oxidation states remain crucial challenges in optimizing these systems.
