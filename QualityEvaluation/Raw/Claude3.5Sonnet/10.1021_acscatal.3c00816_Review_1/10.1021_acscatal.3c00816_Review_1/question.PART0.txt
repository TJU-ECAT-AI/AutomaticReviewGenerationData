2. Metal-OMS Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity. (75,122) MCM-41 and SBA-15 are typical mesoporous silica materials with a hexagonal structure and long 1D pores. The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2). (75,7779) For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction. (78) Besides, the as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%. The calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC). (123) In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3. However, when the sample was calcinated in static air, the CrO42 species remained stable at 350 C, and further increasing the calcination temperature resulted in aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3. Recently, He (77) reported that adsorbed water is essential to facilitate dispersion of Co species on SBA-15. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra reveal that adsorbed water could react with an impregnated Co(NO3)2 precursor to form [Co(H2O)6]2+ intermediates, which facilitates the dehydroxylation on SBA-15 support toward tetrahedral (Td) Co2+ sites during a direct H2 reduction process. The PDH reactivity over a series of Co/SBA-15 catalysts was positively correlated with the number of Td Co2+ sites. The optimized catalyst with the highest amount of Td Co2+ sites achieves a propane conversion of 37% and propylene selectivity of 96%.
In addition to impregnating metal species on molecular sieves, the coassembly of the metal precursor and silica source enables the metal species to be incorporated within the framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15. For example, Co@MCM-41 with only tetrahedral framework Coδ+ (δ = 23) species can be synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal process. (16) This Co@MCM-41 was used as a model catalyst to investigate the effect of H2 prereduction on the Co structure and PDH activity. The as-prepared (unreduced) Co-MCM-41 exhibits a propane TOF of 0.004 s1 and propylene selectivity of 92%. The prereduction at 650 C to 700 C allows partial Co species to migrate to the extraframework forming small Co nanoparticles (3 nm), which display a superior TOF of 0.012 s1 with a propylene selectivity of 95%. Higher prereduction temperatures (>750 C) result in larger Co nanoparticles (>8 nm), which reduces the propylene selectivity (46%) due to CC cracking and overdehydrogenation.
Apart from acting as active sites, the framework heteroatoms in the OMS can serve as anchor sites to stabilize the postimpregnated metal/oxide species, which typically exhibit superior PDH performance compared to the coimpregnated counterparts. (28,31) For example, Li et al. (28) prepared Sn-SBA-15 with framework Sn and Sn/SBA-15 with impregnated SnOx species. The framework Sn species with a strong Sn-support interaction can better maintain the oxidation state of Sn during the PDH reaction. As a result, Pt/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits a higher propane conversion (43.8%) and propylene selectivity (98.5%) than the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst (39.6% and 95%). Particularly, H2 temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) measurements reveal that the framework Sn species contribute to hydrogen desorption and spillover, which inhibits Pt sintering and facilitates the transfer of coke from Pt sites to the support. (124) The same group (29,30) also investigated the effect of second promoters (M = Ce, La, In, Fe, Mg) on the PDH performance over trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts. Among the investigated catalysts, PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 shows the highest initial propane conversion, while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits the best catalytic stability. The Pt sintering and coke deposits are the main deactivation issues. For synthesizing PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts, the control of the hydrothermal reaction temperature enables regulation of the pore size of Sn-SBA-15 supports from 5 to 14 nm. (32) The best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% was obtained on the catalyst with a medium pore size (7.6 nm). For the supports with a smaller pore size (5.3 nm), the diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors was limited, while for the ones with larger pores (11.0 and 13.7 nm), the metal aggregation during the reaction becomes dramatic. Both cases lead to an inferior PDH performance.
Gong et al. (43) reported a pioneering work which uses a subsurface engineering strategy to improve the PDH performance. The Pt and M species (M = Ni, Fe, Co) were impregnated on an SBA-15 support to form PtM/SBA-15. Then, selective etching of the superficial M atoms by HNO3 produces PtM@Pt/SBA-15 with a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure. The Pt-shell structure can restrain CC cracking reactions on transition metal (M = Ni, Fe, Co) sites. Moreover, the subsurface PtM species enrich the electron density of superficial Pt sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic enriched Pt has a more negative d-band center, while the d-band center values negatively correlate with propylene selectivity for PtM@Pt models. As a result, the PtFe@Pt/SBA-15 catalyst with subsurface PtFe modification exhibits 85% propylene selectivity, which is 10% higher than that of the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst.
Although the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts have attracted steady attention in PDH, their long-range 1D channel structure may cause mass transport limitations for reactants (125) or metal precursors (32) during the impregnation step. Karakoulia et al. (126) investigated the effect of the support on PDH performance for a set of OMS supported VOx catalysts. The propane conversions follow the sequence of 4V/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) > 4V/MCM-41 > 4V/SBA-15  4V/MCF. For the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts, the mesopores would be partially destructed during NH4VO3 impregnation, resulting in the formation of an amorphous silica phase that is unfavorable for VOx dispersion, and accordingly the PDH activity. In comparison, the HMS support possesses a 3D wormhole pore structure, leading to a better VOx dispersion and enhanced catalytic activity. Similar to M-MCM-41 or M-SBA-15 materials, the in situ coassembly process also enables SnOx, CoOx, and Pd species to be incorporated within the HMS framework, which exhibits a stronger antireduction and anticoking capacity compared to the impregnated counterparts. (17,18,81) Notably, the Sn containing a hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalyst was synthesized with dodecylamine as the surfactant. (17) The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species. Specifically, the Sn content in Sn-HMS decreases from 3.58 to 3.54 wt % after 166 h of PDH reaction, which is indicative of 1.1 wt % loss of Sn species. The Sn loss is much lower than that in the Sn/SiO2 catalyst during a 70 h reaction (Sn loss of 6.0 wt %). This Sn-HMS obtained 40% propane conversion with 90% propylene selectivity. No deactivation was detected after the 170 h test, even after three oxidative regenerations.
The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) is another advanced mesoporous silica support, which was typically synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants (CTAB, CTAC, etc.). (127) Researchers have indicated that the 3D interconnected central-radial porous structure, larger pore entrance, and uniform monodispersed morphology of DMSN can facilitate the accessibility of active sites and the diffusion efficiency of reactants compared to MCM-41, SBA-15, and HMS materials. (82) The addition of sodium salicylate in the synthesis precursor could increase the surface area and pore diameter of the DMSN support, leading to enhanced PDH performance for Sn-DMSN catalysts. (82) Besides, addition of an appropriate amount of sodium salicylate (φ = 1.5) would weaken the SnOSi bond strength to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Sn species upon H2 pretreatment, which improves the PDH activity. The optimized catalyst with 2.5 wt % Sn loading and φ value of 1.25 exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 0.021 s1 with a propylene selectivity of 88%. Wang et al. (128) revealed that simultaneous addition of Si and Cr sources during synthesis leads to the highest Cr dispersion on the DMSN support, resulting in superior performance of PDH. In comparison, later Cr addition leads to poor CrOx dispersion and partial blockage of DMSN channels, while earlier Cr addition produces Cr6+ species wrapped in the DMSN center, which limits the contact with reactants. Both cases lead to inferior activity. Fan et al. (44) prepared the Mn-substituted DMSN (Mn-DMSN) catalyst as a support for Pt active species. The introduction of MnOx species consumes partial silanol groups and decreases the negative charge for the Mn-DMSN support, which benefits the dispersion of the negatively charged [PtCl6]2 precursor during impregnation (Figure 3a). During the calcination and reduction processes, the MnOx species would react with Pt to form PtxMny alloys with different stoichiometric ratios on the basis of the Mn loadings. The alloyed Mn would donate electrons to Pt and isolate the Pt assembles, which helps the propylene desorption to suppress the formation of coke deposits. The Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst exhibits a deactivation rate of 0.06 h1, which is smaller than that of the Pt/DMSN (0.18 h1). Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3Mn structure possesses a stronger CH bond activation ability than Pt4, which is consistent with the highest TOF of Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst (Figure 3b).
Recently, Wang et al. (84) reported novel silica nanomeshes (SiO2 NMs) that possesses abundant oxygen vacancies to anchor cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) sites for PDH. The SiO2 NMs possess ultrashort 3D channels (pore size of 3.7 nm) with a large surface area of 804 m2·g1, and this ordered porous structure could be maintained after 900 C calcination. The ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs were formed by gasifying carbon in self-assembled SiO2@polymer composites in air. Moreover, the carbon gasification process results in abundant oxygen (O*) defects within SiO2 NMs channels, which help produce three unique coordinated Co SAs sites (Figure 3c). Benefiting from the coordinative unsaturated and reduction-resistant Co SAs sites and the ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs support, this Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst exhibits superior PDH activity (TOFCo = 196 h1, Figure 3d) and propylene selectivity (95%) compared to Co SAs/SiO2 (TOF = 49 h1 and propylene selectivity is 83%).
