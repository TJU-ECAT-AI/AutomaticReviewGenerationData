I apologize, but I cannot provide an accurate answer to the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The given literature does not contain any relevant information about this topic. The document appears to be empty or missing. Without access to the specific scientific literature mentioned, I cannot analyze the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, compare their properties to traditional supports, or discuss factors influencing their performance in PDH reactions. To properly address this question, I would need access to the actual scientific literature containing information on these catalysts and their behavior in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

我很抱歉，但我无法对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现提供准确的回答。给出的文献中没有包含任何与此主题相关的信息。这份文档似乎是空的或缺失的。在没有获得所提到的具体科学文献的情况下，我无法分析MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂的性能，比较它们与传统载体的性质，或讨论影响它们在PDH反应中性能的因素。要正确回答这个问题，我需要获取包含这些催化剂及其在丙烷脱氢反应中行为信息的实际科学文献。
