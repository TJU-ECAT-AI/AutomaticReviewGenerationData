[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."

[3] "The highest dehydrogenation barrier of 1.98 eV was found over V2O5H2 according to DFT calculation which corresponds to the lowest initial activity and the presence of surface VOH groups during the experiment."

[4] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[5] "As a result, the H2 pretreatment time significantly influences the concentration of surface VOH and thus the initial activity and stability, where longer H2 pretreatment contributes to the lower deactivation rates despite the lower conversion."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 provide a larger surface area for metal oxide dispersion, leading to better catalytic activity.

2. Improved metal oxide dispersion: The ordered mesoporous structure allows for better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

3. Enhanced stability: The mesoporous structure can help prevent sintering of metal oxide particles, improving catalyst stability.

4. Tunable pore size: OMS materials offer controllable pore sizes, which can influence reactant diffusion and product selectivity.

However, these catalysts also have some limitations:

1. Lower thermal stability compared to traditional supports like alumina.

2. Potential pore blocking during reaction or regeneration.

3. Higher production costs compared to conventional supports.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials is similar to that on traditional supports. It involves the activation of C-H bonds, followed by the formation of propylene and subsequent desorption. The main difference lies in the improved dispersion of active sites and potentially altered electronic properties of the metal oxides due to interactions with the support.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. In OMS-supported catalysts, the interaction between lattice oxygen and the support structure may differ from traditional supports, potentially affecting catalyst performance.

H2 pretreatment has a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The pretreatment time influences the concentration of surface VOH groups, with longer pretreatment times contributing to lower deactivation rates but potentially lower initial conversion.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer promising performance in PDH reactions due to their improved structural properties. However, optimization of synthesis methods, pretreatment conditions, and reaction parameters is necessary to fully exploit their potential and overcome limitations.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂具有以下优势：

1. 更高的比表面积：MCM-41和SBA-15等OMS材料为金属氧化物提供了更大的分散面积，从而提高了催化活性。

2. 改善的金属氧化物分散性：有序介孔结构允许VOx和CrOx物种更好地分散，可能增加活性位点的数量。

3. 增强的稳定性：介孔结构有助于防止金属氧化物颗粒的烧结，提高催化剂的稳定性。

4. 可调节的孔径：OMS材料提供可控的孔径，这可以影响反应物的扩散和产物的选择性。

然而，这些催化剂也存在一些限制：

1. 与传统的氧化铝载体相比，热稳定性较低。

2. 在反应或再生过程中可能发生孔道堵塞。

3. 与传统载体相比，生产成本较高。

VOx和CrOx负载在OMS材料上的PDH反应机理与传统载体上的类似。它涉及C-H键的活化，随后形成丙烯并脱附。主要区别在于活性位点的分散性得到改善，以及由于与载体的相互作用，金属氧化物的电子性质可能发生变化。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。它们参与C-H键的活化，并可以影响催化剂的氧化还原性能。在OMS负载的催化剂中，晶格氧与载体结构的相互作用可能与传统载体不同，从而可能影响催化剂的性能。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。它导致表面VOH基团的形成，可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。预处理时间影响表面VOH基团的浓度，较长的预处理时间有助于降低失活率，但可能降低初始转化率。

总之，金属有序介孔二氧化硅负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂由于其改善的结构性能，在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能。然而，为充分发挥其潜力并克服限制，需要优化合成方法、预处理条件和反应参数。
