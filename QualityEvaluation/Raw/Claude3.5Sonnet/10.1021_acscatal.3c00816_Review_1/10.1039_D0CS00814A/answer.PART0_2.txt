Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency.

2. Uniform pore structure: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials has shown higher activity compared to bulk V2O5 or other traditional supports. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of VOx species on the high surface area of OMS supports, leading to a higher number of accessible active sites.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface. Different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, which can affect the overall catalytic performance.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. However, the mobility of lattice oxygen can also lead to deep oxidation of propane or propylene, potentially decreasing selectivity.

H2 pretreatment has been shown to have a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Pretreatment with H2 leads to the formation of surface V-OH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. This effect is attributed to the tuning of surface hydroxyl group coverage, which in turn affects the desorption barrier of propylene.

One of the main limitations of VOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

In conclusion, while VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 show promising performance in PDH reactions, careful control of metal dispersion, surface hydroxyl groups, and reaction conditions is necessary to optimize their catalytic behavior and minimize deactivation. Further research into the precise nature of active sites and the role of support-metal interactions could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更有前景的性能。由于其独特的结构特性，这些材料提供了几个优势：

1. 更高的比表面积：OMS材料为活性位点分散提供了更大的表面积，可能会提高催化剂效率。

2. 均匀的孔结构：MCM-41和SBA-15的有序介孔结构可以改善反应物和产物的扩散，可能会提高催化活性。

3. 增强金属分散：OMS载体的均匀孔结构可以导致VOx和CrOx物种更好的分散，可能会增加活性位点的数量。

4. 热稳定性：OMS材料通常表现出良好的热稳定性，这对于在高温下进行的PDH反应至关重要。

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx与体相V2O5或其他传统载体相比表现出更高的活性。这种增强的性能可以归因于VOx物种在OMS载体高比表面积上的更好分散，导致可接触的活性位点数量增加。

VOx/OMS催化剂上PDH反应的机理涉及丙烷C-H键的活化，随后是丙烯的脱附。这些催化剂的活性和选择性受表面存在的V-O键性质的影响。不同的V-O键表现出不同的C-H活化和丙烯脱附能垒，这可能会影响整体催化性能。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着关键作用。它们参与C-H键的活化，并可以影响催化剂的氧化还原性能。然而，晶格氧的迁移也可能导致丙烷或丙烯的深度氧化，可能会降低选择性。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。用H2预处理会导致表面V-OH基团的形成，这可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。这种效果归因于表面羟基覆盖度的调节，进而影响丙烯的脱附能垒。

VOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的主要限制之一是它们倾向于形成焦炭沉积，导致失活。焦炭形成速率随VOx物种聚合度的增加而增加。这表明在OMS载体上保持VOx物种的高度分散对于延长催化剂寿命至关重要。

总之，虽然负载在MCM-41和SBA-15等OMS材料上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中表现出promising的性能，但仍需要仔细控制金属分散、表面羟基和反应条件，以优化其催化行为并最小化失活。对活性位点的精确性质和载体-金属相互作用作用的进一步研究可能会导致开发出更高效和稳定的PDH反应催化剂。
