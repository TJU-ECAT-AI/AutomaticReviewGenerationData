[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr. This effect could be induced by the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2."

[3] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[4] "By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance."

[5] "For example, when VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. High surface area: OMS materials provide a large surface area for better dispersion of active metal species, leading to increased catalytic activity.

2. Ordered pore structure: The uniform pore size distribution of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing overall reaction efficiency.

3. Improved stability: The mesoporous structure can help stabilize metal particles and prevent sintering during high-temperature reactions.

4. Tunable surface properties: The surface of OMS materials can be easily modified to optimize the interaction between the support and active metal species.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials often exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to their bulk oxide counterparts. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of active sites and the interaction between the metal species and the support.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over these catalysts typically involves the following steps:

1. Propane adsorption on the active sites
2. C-H bond activation
3. Hydrogen abstraction
4. Propylene formation and desorption
5. Catalyst regeneration

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of surface hydroxyl groups. The presence of lattice oxygen can also influence the redox properties of the catalyst, affecting its overall performance.

H2 pretreatment has a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It can lead to the formation of surface hydroxyl groups, which have been shown to improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The presence of these hydroxyl groups can modify the electronic properties of the active sites and promote the desorption of propylene, thereby enhancing catalyst stability.

However, there are some limitations to consider:

1. Potential pore blockage: Over time, coke deposition may lead to pore blockage, reducing the accessibility of active sites.

2. Thermal stability: While more stable than traditional supports, OMS materials may still undergo structural changes at very high temperatures.

3. Complexity of synthesis: The preparation of well-defined OMS-supported catalysts can be more challenging and costly compared to conventional supports.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer significant advantages in PDH reactions due to their unique structural properties and ability to stabilize active metal species. The interplay between lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and surface hydroxyl groups plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and stability. Further research into optimizing these factors could lead to even more efficient and durable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。这些材料由于其独特的结构特性提供了几个优势：

1. 高比表面积：OMS材料提供了大的表面积，可以更好地分散活性金属物种，从而提高催化活性。

2. 有序孔结构：MCM-41和SBA-15的均匀孔径分布可以改善反应物和产物的扩散，提高整体反应效率。

3. 提高稳定性：介孔结构可以帮助稳定金属颗粒，防止高温反应过程中的烧结。

4. 可调表面性质：OMS材料的表面可以很容易地被修饰，以优化载体和活性金属物种之间的相互作用。

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx和CrOx通常比其块体氧化物对应物表现出更高的活性和选择性。这种性能的提升可以归因于活性位点的更好分散以及金属物种与载体之间的相互作用。

这些催化剂上PDH反应的机理通常涉及以下步骤：

1. 丙烷在活性位点上的吸附
2. C-H键的活化
3. 氢的抽离
4. 丙烯的形成和脱附
5. 催化剂的再生

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。它们参与C-H键的活化和表面羟基的形成。晶格氧的存在还可以影响催化剂的氧化还原性质，从而影响其整体性能。

氢气预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。它可以导致表面羟基的形成，这些羟基已被证明可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。这些羟基的存在可以修改活性位点的电子性质，促进丙烯的脱附，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。

然而，还有一些限制需要考虑：

1. 潜在的孔阻塞：随着时间的推移，积碳可能导致孔阻塞，降低活性位点的可及性。

2. 热稳定性：虽然比传统载体更稳定，但OMS材料在非常高的温度下仍可能发生结构变化。

3. 合成复杂性：与常规载体相比，制备明确定义的OMS负载催化剂可能更具挑战性和成本。

总之，金属有序介孔二氧化硅负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂由于其独特的结构特性和稳定活性金属物种的能力，在PDH反应中提供了显著的优势。晶格氧物种、氢气预处理和表面羟基之间的相互作用在决定催化剂性能和稳定性方面起着关键作用。对这些因素的进一步优化研究可能会导致更高效和更耐用的丙烷脱氢催化剂的开发。
