[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "Notably, when VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[3] "The incipient activity and deactivation rate turned out to be linearly relevant to the intensity of the VOH band which reflects the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. The presence of surface VOH decreases the desorption barrier of propylene and thus promotes the desorption of propylene and decreases the coke formation."

[4] "Deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with increasing degree of aggregation of VOx species with increasing VOV bonds."

[5] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, offer several advantages for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The ordered mesoporous structure of these materials provides a high surface area and uniform pore size distribution, which allows for better dispersion of active metal species. This improved dispersion leads to a higher number of accessible active sites, potentially increasing catalytic activity. The uniform pore structure also facilitates mass transfer of reactants and products, which can enhance overall reaction efficiency.

For VOx catalysts, the literature suggests that isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The mesoporous structure of OMS supports likely helps maintain this isolation, preventing the formation of less active V2O5 crystallites. This is supported by the observation that deactivation increases with the degree of aggregation of VOx species.

The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. H2 pretreatment leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which improve propylene selectivity and decrease coke formation. The presence of these hydroxyl groups decreases the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation.

The reaction mechanism on these catalysts likely involves the activation of propane on Lewis acid sites (metal cations), followed by CH bond cleavage. The lattice oxygen or hydroxyl groups then act as hydrogen acceptors, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

However, these catalysts also have limitations. Despite their improved dispersion, they can still suffer from aggregation of active species over time, leading to deactivation. Additionally, the strong interaction between the metal species and the support can sometimes lead to the formation of inactive silicate species, particularly at high metal loadings or severe reaction conditions.

In conclusion, while Metal-OMS supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer improved dispersion and potentially higher activity for PDH reactions, their performance is heavily dependent on maintaining isolated active sites and managing the surface hydroxyl groups through appropriate pretreatment. Further research is needed to fully optimize these systems and overcome their limitations for industrial applications.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，相比传统金属氧化物载体，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中具有几个优势。

这些材料的有序介孔结构提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔径分布，这允许活性金属物种更好地分散。这种改进的分散性导致可访问的活性位点数量增加，可能提高催化活性。均匀的孔结构还有助于反应物和产物的传质，这可以提高整体反应效率。

对于VOx催化剂，文献表明，孤立的VOx物种比其寡聚体表现出更高的本征活性。OMS载体的介孔结构可能有助于保持这种孤立性，防止形成活性较低的V2O5晶体。这一点得到了VOx物种聚集度增加会导致失活增加的观察结果的支持。

这些催化剂的性能受晶格氧物种和H2预处理的显著影响。H2预处理导致表面VOH基团的形成，这改善了丙烯选择性并减少了积碳形成。这些羟基的存在降低了丙烯的脱附能垒，促进其释放并减少导致积碳的不需要的副反应。

这些催化剂上的反应机理可能涉及在路易斯酸位点（金属阳离子）上活化丙烷，然后是CH键断裂。晶格氧或羟基随后作为氢接受体，促进脱氢过程。

然而，这些催化剂也有局限性。尽管它们的分散性得到改善，但活性物种仍可能随时间聚集，导致失活。此外，金属物种与载体之间的强相互作用有时可能导致无活性硅酸盐物种的形成，特别是在高金属负载或严苛反应条件下。

总之，虽然金属-OMS负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂为PDH反应提供了改进的分散性和潜在的更高活性，但它们的性能在很大程度上依赖于保持孤立的活性位点和通过适当的预处理管理表面羟基。需要进一步研究以充分优化这些系统并克服它们在工业应用中的局限性。
