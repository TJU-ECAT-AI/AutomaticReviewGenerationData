[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr. This effect could be induced by the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2."

[3] "For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 16a, two typical Raman bands corresponding to coke deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1 band (1320 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibrations of defects and edges of the graphitic lattice."

[4] "Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers allowed gaining novel insight into coke formation by kinetic evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization of VOx species."

[5] "By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for better dispersion of active metal species.

2. Ordered pore structure: The uniform pore channels in MCM-41 and SBA-15 can enhance mass transfer and provide better accessibility to active sites.

3. Improved thermal stability: The silica framework of OMS materials offers better thermal stability compared to some traditional oxide supports.

4. Tunable surface properties: OMS supports allow for easier modification of surface properties through functionalization.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials generally shows higher activity and selectivity compared to bulk V2O5. This is likely due to the better dispersion of VOx species, leading to more isolated and highly coordinated vanadium sites. Similarly, CrOx supported on OMS materials often exhibits improved performance compared to traditional CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

The reaction mechanisms for PDH over VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials are similar to those on traditional supports, involving the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, the ordered structure of OMS supports may influence the redox properties of the active metal species and affect the reaction kinetics.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. For VOx catalysts, the VO bonds are involved in the activation of propane molecules. The interaction between VOx and the support can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV, and VOZr, which is beneficial for the PDH reaction.

H2 pretreatment has a significant influence on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For VOx-based catalysts, H2 pretreatment can create surface hydroxyl groups, which have been shown to have a positive relationship with propylene selectivity and resistance to deactivation. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups can lower the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing coke formation.

Deactivation of these catalysts primarily occurs through coke formation. The ordered pore structure of OMS supports may help in reducing coke deposition by facilitating the diffusion of reaction products. However, the accumulation of coke deposits over time can still lead to catalyst deactivation, necessitating periodic regeneration.

In conclusion, while Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer several advantages in PDH reactions, they still face challenges related to long-term stability and coke formation. Ongoing research is focused on further improving their performance through modifications in catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，这些材料具有以下优势：

1. 更高的比表面积：OMS材料提供了更大的表面积，有利于活性金属物种的更好分散。

2. 有序的孔道结构：MCM-41和SBA-15中均匀的孔道可以增强质量传递，并提供更好的活性位点可及性。

3. 改善的热稳定性：OMS材料的二氧化硅骨架比某些传统氧化物载体具有更好的热稳定性。

4. 可调节的表面性质：OMS载体通过功能化可以更容易地修饰表面性质。

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx通常表现出比块状V2O5更高的活性和选择性。这可能是由于VOx物种的更好分散，导致形成更多的孤立和高配位的钒位点。同样，负载在OMS材料上的CrOx often比传统的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表现出更好的性能。

VOx和CrOx负载在OMS材料上的PDH反应机理与传统载体上的类似，涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理。然而，OMS载体的有序结构可能会影响活性金属物种的氧化还原性质，从而影响反应动力学。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着关键作用。对于VOx催化剂，VO键参与了丙烷分子的活化。VOx与载体之间的相互作用可以促进VO键的还原，包括VO、VOV和VOZr，这对PDH反应有利。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。对于基于VOx的催化剂，H2预处理可以在表面形成羟基，这些羟基已被证明与丙烯选择性和抗失活能力呈正相关。表面羟基的存在可以降低丙烯的脱附能垒，促进其释放并减少积碳形成。

这些催化剂的失活主要通过积碳形成。OMS载体的有序孔道结构可能有助于通过促进反应产物的扩散来减少积碳沉积。然而，随时间推移积碳的累积仍然可能导致催化剂失活，需要定期再生。

总之，虽然金属有序介孔二氧化硅负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供了几个优势，但它们在长期稳定性和积碳形成方面仍面临挑战。当前的研究重点是通过改进催化剂组成、制备方法和反应条件来进一步提高它们的性能。
