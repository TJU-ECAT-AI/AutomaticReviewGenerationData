[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "Notably, when VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[3] "The incipient activity and deactivation rate turned out to be linearly relevant to the intensity of the VOH band which reflects the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. The presence of surface VOH decreases the desorption barrier of propylene and thus promotes the desorption of propylene and decreases the coke formation."

[4] "Deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with increasing degree of aggregation of VOx species with increasing VOV bonds."

[5] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, offer several advantages for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The ordered mesoporous structure of these materials provides a high surface area and uniform pore size distribution, which allows for better dispersion of active metal species. This improved dispersion leads to a higher number of accessible active sites, potentially increasing catalytic activity. The uniform pore structure also facilitates mass transfer of reactants and products, which can enhance overall reaction efficiency.

For VOx catalysts, the literature suggests that isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The mesoporous structure of OMS supports likely helps maintain this isolation, preventing the formation of less active V2O5 crystallites. This is supported by the observation that deactivation increases with the degree of aggregation of VOx species.

The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. H2 pretreatment leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which improve propylene selectivity and decrease coke formation. The presence of these hydroxyl groups decreases the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation.

The reaction mechanism on these catalysts likely involves the activation of propane on Lewis acid sites (metal cations), followed by CH bond cleavage. The lattice oxygen or hydroxyl groups then act as hydrogen acceptors, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

However, these catalysts also have limitations. Despite their improved dispersion, they can still suffer from aggregation of active species over time, leading to deactivation. Additionally, the strong interaction between the metal species and the support can sometimes lead to the formation of inactive silicate species, particularly at high metal loadings or severe reaction conditions.

In conclusion, while Metal-OMS supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer improved dispersion and potentially higher activity for PDH reactions, their performance is heavily dependent on maintaining isolated active sites and managing the surface hydroxyl groups through appropriate pretreatment. Further research is needed to fully optimize these systems and overcome their limitations for industrial applications.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，相比传统金属氧化物载体，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中具有几个优势。

这些材料的有序介孔结构提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔径分布，这允许活性金属物种更好地分散。这种改进的分散性导致可访问的活性位点数量增加，可能提高催化活性。均匀的孔结构还有助于反应物和产物的传质，这可以提高整体反应效率。

对于VOx催化剂，文献表明，孤立的VOx物种比其寡聚体表现出更高的本征活性。OMS载体的介孔结构可能有助于保持这种孤立性，防止形成活性较低的V2O5晶体。这一点得到了VOx物种聚集度增加会导致失活增加的观察结果的支持。

这些催化剂的性能受晶格氧物种和H2预处理的显著影响。H2预处理导致表面VOH基团的形成，这改善了丙烯选择性并减少了积碳形成。这些羟基的存在降低了丙烯的脱附能垒，促进其释放并减少导致积碳的不需要的副反应。

这些催化剂上的反应机理可能涉及在路易斯酸位点（金属阳离子）上活化丙烷，然后是CH键断裂。晶格氧或羟基随后作为氢接受体，促进脱氢过程。

然而，这些催化剂也有局限性。尽管它们的分散性得到改善，但活性物种仍可能随时间聚集，导致失活。此外，金属物种与载体之间的强相互作用有时可能导致无活性硅酸盐物种的形成，特别是在高金属负载或严苛反应条件下。

总之，虽然金属-OMS负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂为PDH反应提供了改进的分散性和潜在的更高活性，但它们的性能在很大程度上依赖于保持孤立的活性位点和通过适当的预处理管理表面羟基。需要进一步研究以充分优化这些系统并克服它们在工业应用中的局限性。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 provide a larger surface area for metal oxide dispersion, leading to better catalytic activity.

2. Improved metal oxide dispersion: The ordered mesoporous structure allows for better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

3. Enhanced stability: The mesoporous structure can help prevent sintering of metal oxide particles, improving catalyst stability.

4. Tunable pore size: OMS materials offer controllable pore sizes, which can influence reactant diffusion and product selectivity.

However, these catalysts also have some limitations:

1. Lower thermal stability compared to traditional supports like alumina.

2. Potential pore blocking during reaction or regeneration.

3. Higher production costs compared to conventional supports.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials is similar to that on traditional supports. It involves the activation of C-H bonds, followed by the formation of propylene and subsequent desorption. The main difference lies in the improved dispersion of active sites and potentially altered electronic properties of the metal oxides due to interactions with the support.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. In OMS-supported catalysts, the interaction between lattice oxygen and the support structure may differ from traditional supports, potentially affecting catalyst performance.

H2 pretreatment has a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The pretreatment time influences the concentration of surface VOH groups, with longer pretreatment times contributing to lower deactivation rates but potentially lower initial conversion.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer promising performance in PDH reactions due to their improved structural properties. However, optimization of synthesis methods, pretreatment conditions, and reaction parameters is necessary to fully exploit their potential and overcome limitations.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency.

2. Uniform pore structure: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials has shown higher activity compared to bulk V2O5 or other traditional supports. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of VOx species on the high surface area of OMS supports, leading to a higher number of accessible active sites.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface. Different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, which can affect the overall catalytic performance.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. However, the mobility of lattice oxygen can also lead to deep oxidation of propane or propylene, potentially decreasing selectivity.

H2 pretreatment has been shown to have a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Pretreatment with H2 leads to the formation of surface V-OH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. This effect is attributed to the tuning of surface hydroxyl group coverage, which in turn affects the desorption barrier of propylene.

One of the main limitations of VOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

In conclusion, while VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 show promising performance in PDH reactions, careful control of metal dispersion, surface hydroxyl groups, and reaction conditions is necessary to optimize their catalytic behavior and minimize deactivation. Further research into the precise nature of active sites and the role of support-metal interactions could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx与体相V2O5或其他传统载体相比表现出更高的活性。这种增强的性能可以归因于VOx物种在OMS载体高比表面积上的更好分散，导致可接触的活性位点数量增加。

VOx/OMS催化剂上PDH反应的机理涉及丙烷C-H键的活化，随后是丙烯的脱附。这些催化剂的活性和选择性受表面存在的V-O键性质的影响。不同的V-O键表现出不同的C-H活化和丙烯脱附能垒，这可能会影响整体催化性能。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着关键作用。它们参与C-H键的活化，并可以影响催化剂的氧化还原性能。然而，晶格氧的迁移也可能导致丙烷或丙烯的深度氧化，可能会降低选择性。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。用H2预处理会导致表面V-OH基团的形成，这可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。这种效果归因于表面羟基覆盖度的调节，进而影响丙烯的脱附能垒。

VOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的主要限制之一是它们倾向于形成焦炭沉积，导致失活。焦炭形成速率随VOx物种聚合度的增加而增加。这表明在OMS载体上保持VOx物种的高度分散对于延长催化剂寿命至关重要。

总之，虽然负载在MCM-41和SBA-15等OMS材料上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中表现出promising的性能，但仍需要仔细控制金属分散、表面羟基和反应条件，以优化其催化行为并最小化失活。对活性位点的精确性质和载体-金属相互作用作用的进一步研究可能会导致开发出更高效和稳定的PDH反应催化剂。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for better dispersion of active metal species.

2. Ordered pore structure: The uniform pore channels in MCM-41 and SBA-15 can enhance mass transfer and provide better accessibility to active sites.

3. Improved thermal stability: The silica framework of OMS materials offers better thermal stability compared to some traditional oxide supports.

4. Tunable surface properties: OMS supports allow for easier modification of surface properties through functionalization.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials generally shows higher activity and selectivity compared to bulk V2O5. This is likely due to the better dispersion of VOx species, leading to more isolated and highly coordinated vanadium sites. Similarly, CrOx supported on OMS materials often exhibits improved performance compared to traditional CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

The reaction mechanisms for PDH over VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials are similar to those on traditional supports, involving the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, the ordered structure of OMS supports may influence the redox properties of the active metal species and affect the reaction kinetics.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. For VOx catalysts, the VO bonds are involved in the activation of propane molecules. The interaction between VOx and the support can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV, and VOZr, which is beneficial for the PDH reaction.

H2 pretreatment has a significant influence on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For VOx-based catalysts, H2 pretreatment can create surface hydroxyl groups, which have been shown to have a positive relationship with propylene selectivity and resistance to deactivation. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups can lower the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing coke formation.

Deactivation of these catalysts primarily occurs through coke formation. The ordered pore structure of OMS supports may help in reducing coke deposition by facilitating the diffusion of reaction products. However, the accumulation of coke deposits over time can still lead to catalyst deactivation, necessitating periodic regeneration.

In conclusion, while Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer several advantages in PDH reactions, they still face challenges related to long-term stability and coke formation. Ongoing research is focused on further improving their performance through modifications in catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions.

4. 可调节的表面性质：OMS载体通过功能化可以更容易地修饰表面性质。

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx通常表现出比块状V2O5更高的活性和选择性。这可能是由于VOx物种的更好分散，导致形成更多的孤立和高配位的钒位点。同样，负载在OMS材料上的CrOx often比传统的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表现出更好的性能。

VOx和CrOx负载在OMS材料上的PDH反应机理与传统载体上的类似，涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理。然而，OMS载体的有序结构可能会影响活性金属物种的氧化还原性质，从而影响反应动力学。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着关键作用。对于VOx催化剂，VO键参与了丙烷分子的活化。VOx与载体之间的相互作用可以促进VO键的还原，包括VO、VOV和VOZr，这对PDH反应有利。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。对于基于VOx的催化剂，H2预处理可以在表面形成羟基，这些羟基已被证明与丙烯选择性和抗失活能力呈正相关。表面羟基的存在可以降低丙烯的脱附能垒，促进其释放并减少积碳形成。

这些催化剂的失活主要通过积碳形成。OMS载体的有序孔道结构可能有助于通过促进反应产物的扩散来减少积碳沉积。然而，随时间推移积碳的累积仍然可能导致催化剂失活，需要定期再生。

总之，虽然金属有序介孔二氧化硅负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供了几个优势，但它们在长期稳定性和积碳形成方面仍面临挑战。当前的研究重点是通过改进催化剂组成、制备方法和反应条件来进一步提高它们的性能。
