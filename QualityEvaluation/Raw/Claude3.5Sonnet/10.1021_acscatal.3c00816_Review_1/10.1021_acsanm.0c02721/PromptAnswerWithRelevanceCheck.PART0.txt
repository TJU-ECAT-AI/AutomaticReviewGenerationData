Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text appears to be a partial citation for a scientific article about mesoporous-silica-stabilized cobalt(II) oxide nanoclusters for propane dehydrogenation, but does not include the full content of the article. Without access to the complete text, it is not possible to answer the specific questions about structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, reaction mechanisms, or the influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

所提供的文献中没有包含任何与分析金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能相关的信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于介孔硅稳定的二价钴氧化物纳米簇用于丙烷脱氢的科学文章的部分引用，但并未包含文章的完整内容。在无法获取完整文本的情况下，无法回答关于结构特性、催化行为、优势、局限性、反应机理，或者晶格氧物种和氢气预处理等因素如何影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的具体问题。

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text appears to be a partial citation or header for an article about mesoporous-silica-stabilized cobalt(II) oxide nanoclusters for propane dehydrogenation, but it does not provide any details about the catalysts' performance, structural properties, or reaction mechanisms. There is no information about traditional metal oxide supports, advantages, limitations, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text appears to be a truncated article title and author list, without any content discussing MCM-41, SBA-15, VOx, CrOx catalysts, or PDH reaction mechanisms. There is insufficient information to compare structural properties, discuss advantages/limitations, or analyze factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
