[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

[2] "Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

[3] "VOx/MCM-41, which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts"

[4] "Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

[5] "Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."

[6] "Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The structural properties of MCM-41 allow for highly dispersed VOx species, which contribute to their enhanced catalytic behavior.

The main advantages of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts include:

1. High activity and selectivity
2. Good onstream stability
3. Resistance to deactivation, especially for isolated VOx species

The reaction mechanism involves Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ sites as the active centers for dehydrogenation. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors:

1. VOx species dispersion: Isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity and better resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species.

2. Reduction temperature: Increasing the reduction temperature leads to higher turnover frequencies (TOF) for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

3. VOV bond number: Catalysts with a lower mean number of VOV bonds (i.e., more isolated VOx species) exhibit higher activity and lower deactivation rates.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing V5+ species to the catalytically active V3+ and V4+ states. This pretreatment can enhance the catalyst's activity, but the literature does not provide specific information on its impact on deactivation in PDH reactions.

The literature does not directly discuss the role of lattice oxygen species in these catalysts. However, the high dispersion of VOx species on MCM-41 likely contributes to the availability of active sites and oxygen mobility, which can influence catalyst performance.

In conclusion, VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports, mainly due to their structural properties that allow for highly dispersed and isolated VOx species. The balance between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be optimized by controlling the dispersion and reduction state of the VOx species.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂展现出良好的在线稳定性和高选择性。MCM-41的结构特性允许高度分散的VOx物种，这contributes to their enhanced catalytic behavior.

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的主要优点包括：

1. 高活性和选择性
2. 良好的在线稳定性
3. 抗失活能力强，尤其是孤立的VOx物种

反应机理涉及Lewis酸性V3+和V4+位作为脱氢的活性中心。这些催化剂的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. VOx物种分散度：孤立的VOx物种相比聚集态物种表现出更高的本征活性和更好的抗失活能力。

2. 还原温度：提高还原温度会导致丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的转化频率（TOF）增加。

3. VOV键数：具有较低平均VOV键数（即更多孤立VOx物种）的催化剂表现出更高的活性和更低的失活率。

H2预处理通过将V5+物种还原为催化活性的V3+和V4+状态来影响催化剂性能。这种预处理可以提高催化剂的活性，但文献中没有提供关于其对PDH反应中失活影响的具体信息。

文献中没有直接讨论这些催化剂中晶格氧物种的作用。然而，VOx物种在MCM-41上的高度分散可能会contributes to the availability of active sites and oxygen mobility，这可能会影响催化剂的性能。

总之，与传统载体相比，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优异的性能，主要是由于其结构特性允许高度分散和孤立的VOx物种。通过控制VOx物种的分散度和还原状态，可以优化催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。

[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

[2] "Generally, the TOF values are higher for isobutane conversion compared to propane DH. This may be due to lower activation energy for the former reaction caused by weaker C-H bond in the alkane feed."

[3] "For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

[4] "Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

[5] "V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

[6] "Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

The study examines VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation (DH), focusing on the impact of VOx site density on catalytic performance. MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show several advantages in PDH reactions:

1. Higher activity: Isolated VOx sites demonstrate higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species for both propane and isobutane DH. This is attributed to the increased Lewis acidity of isolated sites.

2. Selectivity: For propane DH, selectivity to propene is high (about 90%) and only marginally affected by VOx aggregation. However, for isobutane DH, isolated VOx sites show lower selectivity due to increased cracking and isomerization reactions.

3. Active sites: V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with their Lewis acidity increasing as the number of VOV bonds decreases.

4. Support effect: MCM-41, as an ordered mesoporous silica support, allows for better control of VOx site density and distribution compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

The reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes at Lewis-acidic V atoms and neighboring basic O atoms. The weaker C-H bond in isobutane leads to higher TOF values compared to propane DH.

Limitations include the tendency of isolated VOx sites to promote cracking and isomerization reactions, especially in isobutane DH, due to their stronger Lewis acidity.

The study does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation. However, it mentions that in-situ reduction of catalysts under reaction conditions is as efficient as reduction in hydrogen, suggesting that pretreatment may not significantly impact performance.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show promise for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites offering higher activity but potentially lower selectivity, especially for isobutane DH. The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 provides advantages in controlling catalyst properties compared to traditional supports.

这项研究考察了VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢(DH)反应中的性能，重点关注VOx位点密度对催化性能的影响。MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出几个优势：

1. 更高的活性：孤立的VOx位点在丙烷和异丁烷DH反应中都表现出比聚集态物种更高的转化频率(TOF)。这归因于孤立位点的路易斯酸性增强。

2. 选择性：对于丙烷DH，丙烯的选择性很高（约90%），且几乎不受VOx聚集程度的影响。然而，对于异丁烷DH，孤立的VOx位点由于增加了裂解和异构反应，表现出较低的选择性。

3. 活性位点：V4+和V3+物种被确定为催化活性位点，随着VOV键数量的减少，它们的路易斯酸性增强。

4. 载体效应：作为有序介孔二氧化硅载体，MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体相比，能更好地控制VOx位点密度和分布。

反应机理涉及在路易斯酸性V原子和相邻的碱性O原子上活化烷烃。异丁烷中较弱的C-H键导致其比丙烷DH具有更高的TOF值。

局限性包括孤立VOx位点由于其较强的路易斯酸性，倾向于促进裂解和异构反应，特别是在异丁烷DH中。

该研究没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，它提到在反应条件下催化剂的原位还原与氢气还原一样有效，这表明预处理可能不会显著影响性能。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的前景，孤立的VOx位点提供了更高的活性，但可能降低选择性，特别是对于异丁烷DH。MCM-41的有序介孔结构与传统载体相比，在控制催化剂性质方面提供了优势。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

The structural properties of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts significantly influence their catalytic behavior. Isolated VOx sites on MCM-41 demonstrate higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated VOx species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. This superior performance is attributed to the increased Lewis acidity of isolated VOx sites, which results from a decreased number of V-O-V bonds around the central V cation.

The reaction mechanism involves V4+ and V3+ species as the catalytically active sites. These reduced vanadium species are formed under reaction conditions and are responsible for activating the C-H bonds in propane.

One advantage of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts is their high selectivity towards propene (about 90%) in propane dehydrogenation. However, a limitation is the formation of small amounts of cracking products and coke.

The degree of VOx aggregation affects catalyst performance and deactivation. Isolated VOx sites show higher resistance to deactivation by coke formation, as the simultaneous adsorption of two olefins (necessary for coke precursor formation) is less likely on isolated sites compared to dimers or higher polymerized species.

While the literature doesn't directly discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on these specific catalysts, it does mention that the reducibility of VOx species affects their catalytic performance. This suggests that H2 pretreatment could potentially influence the catalyst's activity by altering the oxidation state of vanadium species.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites providing the best overall performance due to their higher intrinsic activity and resistance to deactivation.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂表现出较高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的结构特性显著影响其催化行为。MCM-41上的孤立VOx位点在丙烷和异丁烷的非氧化脱氢反应中表现出比聚集VOx物种更高的转化频率（TOF）。这种优越性能归因于孤立VOx位点的Lewis酸性增强，这是由于中心V阳离子周围的V-O-V键数量减少所致。

反应机理涉及V4+和V3+物种作为催化活性位点。这些还原态的钒物种在反应条件下形成，负责活化丙烷中的C-H键。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个优点是在丙烷脱氢反应中对丙烯的高选择性（约90%）。然而，其局限性在于会形成少量的裂解产物和焦炭。

VOx聚集程度影响催化剂性能和失活。孤立VOx位点对焦炭形成导致的失活表现出更高的抗性，因为在孤立位点上同时吸附两个烯烃（形成焦炭前体所必需的）比在二聚体或更高聚合度的物种上更不容易发生。

虽然文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对这些特定催化剂的影响，但确实提到了VOx物种的可还原性影响其催化性能。这表明H2预处理可能通过改变钒物种的氧化态来影响催化剂的活性。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中在活性、选择性和稳定性方面具有优势，其中孤立VOx位点由于具有更高的本征活性和抗失活能力，提供了最佳的整体性能。

The literature focuses primarily on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than comparing different metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) supports. However, some insights can be drawn regarding the performance of these catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: VOx species supported on MCM-41 exhibit varying degrees of aggregation depending on the loading. Isolated VOx sites show higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species in both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalytic behavior: The catalysts show higher TOF values for isobutane conversion compared to propane dehydrogenation, likely due to the weaker C-H bond in isobutane. The selectivity to propene in propane dehydrogenation is minimally affected by the number of V-O-V bonds.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Reduced VOx species (V4+ and V3+) are identified as the active sites for alkane activation. These are created by the reduction of V5+ species under reaction conditions.

4. Catalyst performance and deactivation: Isolated VOx sites show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species. However, they are less selective for isobutane dehydrogenation due to their higher activity for cracking reactions and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes.

5. Influence of Lewis acidity: The Lewis acidity of the active sites increases with a decreasing number of V-O-V bonds, which contributes to the higher activity of isolated VOx sites.

The literature does not provide specific information on the role of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment in PDH reactions for these catalysts. Additionally, direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports are not discussed in the given text.

该文献主要聚焦于VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非比较不同的金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)载体。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于这些催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解：

1. 结构特性：负载在MCM-41上的VOx物种根据负载量的不同表现出不同程度的聚集。在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中，孤立的VOx位点比聚集态物种表现出更高的转化频率(TOF)。

2. 催化行为：这些催化剂在异丁烷转化中表现出比丙烷脱氢更高的TOF值，可能是由于异丁烷中C-H键较弱。丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性受V-O-V键数量的影响很小。

3. 反应机理：还原态的VOx物种（V4+和V3+）被确定为烷烃活化的活性位点。这些物种是在反应条件下由V5+物种还原而成。

4. 催化剂性能和失活：与聚集态物种相比，孤立的VOx位点表现出更高的抗失活能力。然而，由于它们对裂解反应和异丁烯向正丁烯异构化的活性较高，在异丁烷脱氢反应中的选择性较低。

5. 路易斯酸性的影响：活性位点的路易斯酸性随着V-O-V键数量的减少而增加，这是孤立VOx位点活性较高的原因。

文献中没有提供关于这些催化剂在PDH反应中晶格氧物种或H2预处理作用的具体信息。此外，文中也没有讨论与传统金属氧化物载体的直接比较。

[1] "VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5"

[2] "Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

[3] "VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

[4] "VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species"

[5] "Isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activity in comparison with their oligomerized counterparts. However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 supported VOx show improved performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The main advantages of these catalysts include:

1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx species highly dispersed on MCM-41 exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to bulk V2O5.

2. Better stability: These catalysts show good onstream stability, particularly in the presence of small amounts of oxygen.

3. Improved selectivity for propane dehydrogenation: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts perform more selectively in propane dehydrogenation compared to isobutane dehydrogenation, as the isomerization of propene is not possible.

4. Lower coke formation: Isolated VOx species on MCM-41 show lower coke formation compared to aggregated species.

The reaction mechanism and catalyst performance are influenced by several factors:

1. VOx species structure: Isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity compared to oligomerized counterparts. However, they also exhibit higher Lewis acidity, leading to increased cracking and isomerization reactions in isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Aggregation of VOx species: The degree of VOx aggregation affects both activity and deactivation. Single VOx sites show lower deactivation rates, while aggregated species are more prone to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

3. Support acidity: The acidity of the support plays a role in coke formation, with VOx species being more active for coke formation than acidic sites on the support.

The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, the overall performance of MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts in PDH reactions appears to be superior to traditional metal oxide supports, offering a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.
