[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

[2] "Generally, the TOF values are higher for isobutane conversion compared to propane DH. This may be due to lower activation energy for the former reaction caused by weaker C-H bond in the alkane feed."

[3] "For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

[4] "Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

[5] "V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

[6] "Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

The study examines VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation (DH), focusing on the impact of VOx site density on catalytic performance. MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show several advantages in PDH reactions:

1. Higher activity: Isolated VOx sites demonstrate higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species for both propane and isobutane DH. This is attributed to the increased Lewis acidity of isolated sites.

2. Selectivity: For propane DH, selectivity to propene is high (about 90%) and only marginally affected by VOx aggregation. However, for isobutane DH, isolated VOx sites show lower selectivity due to increased cracking and isomerization reactions.

3. Active sites: V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with their Lewis acidity increasing as the number of VOV bonds decreases.

4. Support effect: MCM-41, as an ordered mesoporous silica support, allows for better control of VOx site density and distribution compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

The reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes at Lewis-acidic V atoms and neighboring basic O atoms. The weaker C-H bond in isobutane leads to higher TOF values compared to propane DH.

Limitations include the tendency of isolated VOx sites to promote cracking and isomerization reactions, especially in isobutane DH, due to their stronger Lewis acidity.

The study does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation. However, it mentions that in-situ reduction of catalysts under reaction conditions is as efficient as reduction in hydrogen, suggesting that pretreatment may not significantly impact performance.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show promise for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites offering higher activity but potentially lower selectivity, especially for isobutane DH. The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 provides advantages in controlling catalyst properties compared to traditional supports.

这项研究考察了VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢(DH)反应中的性能，重点关注VOx位点密度对催化性能的影响。MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出几个优势：

1. 更高的活性：孤立的VOx位点在丙烷和异丁烷DH反应中都表现出比聚集态物种更高的转化频率(TOF)。这归因于孤立位点的路易斯酸性增强。

2. 选择性：对于丙烷DH，丙烯的选择性很高（约90%），且几乎不受VOx聚集程度的影响。然而，对于异丁烷DH，孤立的VOx位点由于增加了裂解和异构反应，表现出较低的选择性。

3. 活性位点：V4+和V3+物种被确定为催化活性位点，随着VOV键数量的减少，它们的路易斯酸性增强。

4. 载体效应：作为有序介孔二氧化硅载体，MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体相比，能更好地控制VOx位点密度和分布。

反应机理涉及在路易斯酸性V原子和相邻的碱性O原子上活化烷烃。异丁烷中较弱的C-H键导致其比丙烷DH具有更高的TOF值。

局限性包括孤立VOx位点由于其较强的路易斯酸性，倾向于促进裂解和异构反应，特别是在异丁烷DH中。

该研究没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，它提到在反应条件下催化剂的原位还原与氢气还原一样有效，这表明预处理可能不会显著影响性能。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的前景，孤立的VOx位点提供了更高的活性，但可能降低选择性，特别是对于异丁烷DH。MCM-41的有序介孔结构与传统载体相比，在控制催化剂性质方面提供了优势。
