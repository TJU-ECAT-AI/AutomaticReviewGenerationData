[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

[2] "For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

[3] "Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

[4] "V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

[5] "Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

The structural properties of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts significantly influence their catalytic behavior. Isolated VOx sites on MCM-41 demonstrate higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated VOx species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. This superior performance is attributed to the increased Lewis acidity of isolated VOx sites, which results from a decreased number of V-O-V bonds around the central V cation.

The reaction mechanism involves V4+ and V3+ species as the catalytically active sites. These reduced vanadium species are formed under reaction conditions and are responsible for activating the C-H bonds in propane.

One advantage of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts is their high selectivity towards propene (about 90%) in propane dehydrogenation. However, a limitation is the formation of small amounts of cracking products and coke.

The degree of VOx aggregation affects catalyst performance and deactivation. Isolated VOx sites show higher resistance to deactivation by coke formation, as the simultaneous adsorption of two olefins (necessary for coke precursor formation) is less likely on isolated sites compared to dimers or higher polymerized species.

While the literature doesn't directly discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on these specific catalysts, it does mention that the reducibility of VOx species affects their catalytic performance. This suggests that H2 pretreatment could potentially influence the catalyst's activity by altering the oxidation state of vanadium species.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites providing the best overall performance due to their higher intrinsic activity and resistance to deactivation.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂表现出较高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的结构特性显著影响其催化行为。MCM-41上的孤立VOx位点在丙烷和异丁烷的非氧化脱氢反应中表现出比聚集VOx物种更高的转化频率（TOF）。这种优越性能归因于孤立VOx位点的Lewis酸性增强，这是由于中心V阳离子周围的V-O-V键数量减少所致。

反应机理涉及V4+和V3+物种作为催化活性位点。这些还原态的钒物种在反应条件下形成，负责活化丙烷中的C-H键。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个优点是在丙烷脱氢反应中对丙烯的高选择性（约90%）。然而，其局限性在于会形成少量的裂解产物和焦炭。

VOx聚集程度影响催化剂性能和失活。孤立VOx位点对焦炭形成导致的失活表现出更高的抗性，因为在孤立位点上同时吸附两个烯烃（形成焦炭前体所必需的）比在二聚体或更高聚合度的物种上更不容易发生。

虽然文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对这些特定催化剂的影响，但确实提到了VOx物种的可还原性影响其催化性能。这表明H2预处理可能通过改变钒物种的氧化态来影响催化剂的活性。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中在活性、选择性和稳定性方面具有优势，其中孤立VOx位点由于具有更高的本征活性和抗失活能力，提供了最佳的整体性能。
