[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

[2] "Generally, the TOF values are higher for isobutane conversion compared to propane DH. This may be due to lower activation energy for the former reaction caused by weaker C-H bond in the alkane feed."

[3] "For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds."

[4] "It is supposed that reduced VOx species represent the active site for alkane activation. They are created upon reduction of V5+ species under reaction conditions."

[5] "Besides activity, product selectivity is also influenced by the kind of VOx species. In particular, isolated sites are not selective for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene due to their high activity for cracking reactions and particularly isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes"

[6] "Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

[7] "V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

The literature focuses primarily on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than comparing different metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) supports. However, some insights can be drawn regarding the performance of these catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: VOx species supported on MCM-41 exhibit varying degrees of aggregation depending on the loading. Isolated VOx sites show higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species in both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalytic behavior: The catalysts show higher TOF values for isobutane conversion compared to propane dehydrogenation, likely due to the weaker C-H bond in isobutane. The selectivity to propene in propane dehydrogenation is minimally affected by the number of V-O-V bonds.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Reduced VOx species (V4+ and V3+) are identified as the active sites for alkane activation. These are created by the reduction of V5+ species under reaction conditions.

4. Catalyst performance and deactivation: Isolated VOx sites show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species. However, they are less selective for isobutane dehydrogenation due to their higher activity for cracking reactions and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes.

5. Influence of Lewis acidity: The Lewis acidity of the active sites increases with a decreasing number of V-O-V bonds, which contributes to the higher activity of isolated VOx sites.

The literature does not provide specific information on the role of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment in PDH reactions for these catalysts. Additionally, direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports are not discussed in the given text.

该文献主要聚焦于VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非比较不同的金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)载体。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于这些催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解：

1. 结构特性：负载在MCM-41上的VOx物种根据负载量的不同表现出不同程度的聚集。在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢反应中，孤立的VOx位点比聚集态物种表现出更高的转化频率(TOF)。

2. 催化行为：这些催化剂在异丁烷转化中表现出比丙烷脱氢更高的TOF值，可能是由于异丁烷中C-H键较弱。丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性受V-O-V键数量的影响很小。

3. 反应机理：还原态的VOx物种（V4+和V3+）被确定为烷烃活化的活性位点。这些物种是在反应条件下由V5+物种还原而成。

4. 催化剂性能和失活：与聚集态物种相比，孤立的VOx位点表现出更高的抗失活能力。然而，由于它们对裂解反应和异丁烯向正丁烯异构化的活性较高，在异丁烷脱氢反应中的选择性较低。

5. 路易斯酸性的影响：活性位点的路易斯酸性随着V-O-V键数量的减少而增加，这是孤立VOx位点活性较高的原因。

文献中没有提供关于这些催化剂在PDH反应中晶格氧物种或H2预处理作用的具体信息。此外，文中也没有讨论与传统金属氧化物载体的直接比较。
