[1] "VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5"

[2] "Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

[3] "VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

[4] "VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species"

[5] "Isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activity in comparison with their oligomerized counterparts. However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions."

[6] "Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 supported VOx show improved performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The main advantages of these catalysts include:

1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx species highly dispersed on MCM-41 exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to bulk V2O5.

2. Better stability: These catalysts show good onstream stability, particularly in the presence of small amounts of oxygen.

3. Improved selectivity for propane dehydrogenation: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts perform more selectively in propane dehydrogenation compared to isobutane dehydrogenation, as the isomerization of propene is not possible.

4. Lower coke formation: Isolated VOx species on MCM-41 show lower coke formation compared to aggregated species.

The reaction mechanism and catalyst performance are influenced by several factors:

1. VOx species structure: Isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity compared to oligomerized counterparts. However, they also exhibit higher Lewis acidity, leading to increased cracking and isomerization reactions in isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Aggregation of VOx species: The degree of VOx aggregation affects both activity and deactivation. Single VOx sites show lower deactivation rates, while aggregated species are more prone to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

3. Support acidity: The acidity of the support plays a role in coke formation, with VOx species being more active for coke formation than acidic sites on the support.

The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, the overall performance of MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts in PDH reactions appears to be superior to traditional metal oxide supports, offering a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，如MCM-41负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。这些催化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 更高的活性和选择性：高度分散在MCM-41上的VOx物种表现出比块状V2O5更高的活性和选择性。

2. 更好的稳定性：这些催化剂显示出良好的在线稳定性，特别是在存在少量氧气的情况下。

3. 丙烷脱氢的改进选择性：与异丁烷脱氢相比，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢中表现出更高的选择性，因为丙烯不可能发生异构化。

4. 更低的积碳形成：MCM-41上的孤立VOx物种比聚集态物种表现出更低的积碳形成。

反应机理和催化剂性能受几个因素影响：

1. VOx物种结构：与寡聚态相比，孤立的VOx物种表现出更高的本征活性。然而，它们也表现出更高的路易斯酸性，导致在异丁烷脱氢中增加了裂解和异构化反应。

2. VOx物种的聚集：VOx聚集程度影响活性和失活。单一VOx位点表现出较低的失活速率，而聚集态物种更容易形成积碳并随后失活。

3. 载体酸性：载体的酸性在积碳形成中起作用，VOx物种比载体上的酸性位点更活跃于积碳形成。

文献中没有具体讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。然而，MCM-41负载VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的整体性能似乎优于传统金属氧化物载体，在活性、选择性和稳定性之间提供了良好的平衡。
