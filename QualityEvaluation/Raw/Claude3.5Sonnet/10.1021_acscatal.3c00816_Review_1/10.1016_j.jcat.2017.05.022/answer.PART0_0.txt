[1] "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

[2] "Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

[3] "VOx/MCM-41, which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts"

[4] "Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

[5] "Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."

[6] "Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

[7] "For both propane and isobutane DH, an increase in TOF with increasing reduction and reaction temperature was observed"

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The structural properties of MCM-41 allow for highly dispersed VOx species, which contribute to their enhanced catalytic behavior.

The main advantages of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts include:

1. High activity and selectivity
2. Good onstream stability
3. Resistance to deactivation, especially for isolated VOx species

The reaction mechanism involves Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ sites as the active centers for dehydrogenation. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors:

1. VOx species dispersion: Isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity and better resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species.

2. Reduction temperature: Increasing the reduction temperature leads to higher turnover frequencies (TOF) for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

3. VOV bond number: Catalysts with a lower mean number of VOV bonds (i.e., more isolated VOx species) exhibit higher activity and lower deactivation rates.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing V5+ species to the catalytically active V3+ and V4+ states. This pretreatment can enhance the catalyst's activity, but the literature does not provide specific information on its impact on deactivation in PDH reactions.

The literature does not directly discuss the role of lattice oxygen species in these catalysts. However, the high dispersion of VOx species on MCM-41 likely contributes to the availability of active sites and oxygen mobility, which can influence catalyst performance.

In conclusion, VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports, mainly due to their structural properties that allow for highly dispersed and isolated VOx species. The balance between catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be optimized by controlling the dispersion and reduction state of the VOx species.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，这些催化剂展现出良好的在线稳定性和高选择性。MCM-41的结构特性允许高度分散的VOx物种，这contributes to their enhanced catalytic behavior.

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的主要优点包括：

1. 高活性和选择性
2. 良好的在线稳定性
3. 抗失活能力强，尤其是孤立的VOx物种

反应机理涉及Lewis酸性V3+和V4+位作为脱氢的活性中心。这些催化剂的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. VOx物种分散度：孤立的VOx物种相比聚集态物种表现出更高的本征活性和更好的抗失活能力。

2. 还原温度：提高还原温度会导致丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的转化频率（TOF）增加。

3. VOV键数：具有较低平均VOV键数（即更多孤立VOx物种）的催化剂表现出更高的活性和更低的失活率。

H2预处理通过将V5+物种还原为催化活性的V3+和V4+状态来影响催化剂性能。这种预处理可以提高催化剂的活性，但文献中没有提供关于其对PDH反应中失活影响的具体信息。

文献中没有直接讨论这些催化剂中晶格氧物种的作用。然而，VOx物种在MCM-41上的高度分散可能会contributes to the availability of active sites and oxygen mobility，这可能会影响催化剂的性能。

总之，与传统载体相比，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优异的性能，主要是由于其结构特性允许高度分散和孤立的VOx物种。通过控制VOx物种的分散度和还原状态，可以优化催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。
