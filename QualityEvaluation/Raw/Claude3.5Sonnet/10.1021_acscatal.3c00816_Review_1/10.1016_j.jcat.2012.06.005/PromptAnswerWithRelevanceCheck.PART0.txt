The study analyzes the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts showed high specific surface areas of around 780 m2/g, which is beneficial for catalytic activity due to the increased number of accessible active sites.

The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. It exhibited excellent time-on-stream stability across multiple dehydrogenation cycles and its activity could be fully restored through oxidative regeneration. This suggests that the VOx species remained highly dispersed and resistant to structural changes under reaction conditions.

In contrast, CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed gradual activity loss over multiple cycles due to transformation of active species. This highlights the advantage of VOx/MCM-41 in maintaining structural integrity and catalytic performance.

The study found that both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species can function as active sites for propane dehydrogenation, with oxidized species being more active initially. However, the difference in activity between oxidized and reduced catalysts diminished over time as the oxidized species were reduced by the propane stream.

Lattice oxygen species played a role in the initial stages of the reaction, as evidenced by trace amounts of CO formation over oxidized VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. This suggests that lattice oxygen participates in propane activation.

H2 pretreatment had different effects on the catalysts. For VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41, reduction slightly improved on-stream stability but decreased initial activity. In contrast, H2 pretreatment significantly enhanced the activity of PtSn/Al2O3 by forming metallic Pt and/or PtSn alloys.

The main cause of catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle was coke deposition. However, the nature and impact of these carbon deposits varied among the catalysts, with VOx/MCM-41 showing better resistance to deactivation despite forming more carbon deposits.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrated superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to CrOx and traditional supports, highlighting the potential of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for this application.

该研究分析了金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。这些催化剂表现出约780 m2/g的高比表面积，这有利于催化活性，因为增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的性能。它在多个脱氢循环中表现出优异的时间稳定性，并且其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。这表明VOx物种保持高度分散，并在反应条件下抗结构变化。

相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂由于活性物种的转变而在多个循环中表现出逐渐的活性损失。这突出了VOx/MCM-41在保持结构完整性和催化性能方面的优势。

研究发现，氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种都可以作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点，其中氧化态物种最初更加活跃。然而，随着氧化态物种被丙烷流还原，氧化态和还原态催化剂之间的活性差异随时间减小。

晶格氧物种在反应的初始阶段发挥了作用，这从氧化态VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂上产生微量CO可以证明。这表明晶格氧参与了丙烷的活化。

H2预处理对催化剂有不同的影响。对于VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41，还原略微改善了时间稳定性，但降低了初始活性。相比之下，H2预处理通过形成金属Pt和/或PtSn合金显著提高了PtSn/Al2O3的活性。

在单个PDH循环内，催化剂失活的主要原因是积碳。然而，这些碳沉积物的性质和影响在催化剂之间有所不同，VOx/MCM-41虽然形成了更多的碳沉积物，但表现出更好的抗失活能力。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优于CrOx和传统载体的性能和稳定性，突显了金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在这一应用中的潜力。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts having specific surface areas of around 780 m2/g. This high surface area allows for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species, potentially achieving monolayer coverage.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports, MCM-41 supported catalysts demonstrate superior structural properties. The ordered mesoporous structure provides better dispersion of active metal species and potentially improves catalytic performance. VOx/MCM-41 in particular shows excellent time-on-stream stability and the ability to fully recover its activity through oxidative regeneration.

The reaction mechanism in PDH over these catalysts involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species. Oxidized CrOx and VOx species are initially more active, but their activity becomes similar to reduced species over time as they are reduced by the propane stream. This suggests that lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the initial stages of the reaction.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing the metal oxide species before the reaction. While this can improve the stability of some catalysts (e.g., CrOx/MCM-41), it may slightly decrease initial activity compared to oxidized forms.

Deactivation in PDH reactions over these catalysts occurs primarily due to coke deposition. However, the structural stability of the active species also plays a significant role in long-term performance. VOx species on MCM-41 show remarkable resistance to structural changes, allowing for consistent performance over multiple PDH/regeneration cycles. In contrast, CrOx species on MCM-41 tend to sinter over time, leading to gradual activity loss.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show particular promise for PDH reactions due to their high stability, ability to maintain dispersed active species, and full recovery of activity through regeneration. These properties give them an advantage over traditional supports and other OMS-supported catalysts like CrOx/MCM-41.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂具有高比表面积，MCM-41负载的催化剂比表面积约为780 m2/g。这种高比表面积允许VOx和CrOx物种高度分散在表面上，可能达到单层覆盖。

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，MCM-41负载的催化剂展示出优越的结构特性。有序介孔结构提供了更好的活性金属物种分散性，可能提高催化性能。特别是VOx/MCM-41表现出优异的时间稳定性，并能通过氧化再生完全恢复其活性。

这些催化剂上PDH的反应机理涉及氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种。氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种最初活性更高，但随着时间推移，它们被丙烷流还原，活性逐渐与还原态物种相似。这表明晶格氧物种在反应初期起着关键作用。

H2预处理通过在反应前还原金属氧化物物种来影响催化剂性能。虽然这可以提高某些催化剂（如CrOx/MCM-41）的稳定性，但与氧化态相比，可能略微降低初始活性。

这些催化剂在PDH反应中的失活主要是由于焦炭沉积。然而，活性物种的结构稳定性对长期性能也起着重要作用。MCM-41上的VOx物种对结构变化表现出显著的抗性，允许在多个PDH/再生循环中保持稳定性能。相比之下，MCM-41上的CrOx物种随时间推移容易烧结，导致活性逐渐下降。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂由于其高稳定性、保持分散活性物种的能力以及通过再生完全恢复活性的特性，在PDH反应中表现出特别的优势。这些特性使其相比传统载体和其他OMS负载催化剂（如CrOx/MCM-41）具有优势。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts maintain high surface areas after metal impregnation and calcination, preserving the pore structure of the support. The high dispersion of metal oxide species on the OMS surface leads to improved catalytic performance compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

VOx/MCM-41 demonstrates superior time-on-stream stability and regenerability compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the resistance of VOx species to structural changes under reaction conditions, allowing full activity recovery through oxidative regeneration over multiple PDH cycles.

The use of OMS supports, particularly MCM-41, results in lower coke formation compared to traditional alumina supports. This suppressed coke formation contributes to the extended stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts.

Both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species can act as active sites for PDH, with oxidized species showing higher activity. The presence of lattice oxygen in oxidized species contributes to their superior performance. H2 pretreatment reduces the metal oxide species, slightly decreasing their initial activity but potentially improving on-stream stability, especially for CrOx-based catalysts.

The main advantages of OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions include high metal dispersion, improved stability, reduced coke formation, and enhanced regenerability. However, the gradual transformation of CrOx species during reaction cycles remains a limitation for CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The reaction mechanism involves both oxidative (with lattice oxygen participation) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, with the former being more prominent in the initial stages of the reaction.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂在金属浸渍和煅烧后保持高比表面积，保留了载体的孔结构。OMS表面上金属氧化物物种的高度分散导致其催化性能优于传统金属氧化物载体。

VOx/MCM-41表现出优越的时间稳定性和再生能力，优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统催化剂。这种性能的提升归因于VOx物种在反应条件下对结构变化的抵抗力，使其能够在多个PDH循环中通过氧化再生完全恢复活性。

使用OMS载体，特别是MCM-41，与传统的氧化铝载体相比，能够减少积碳形成。这种抑制积碳形成的特性有助于VOx/SiO2催化剂保持长期稳定的性能。

氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种都可以作为PDH的活性位点，其中氧化态物种表现出更高的活性。氧化态物种中的晶格氧对其优越性能有所贡献。H2预处理会还原金属氧化物物种，略微降低其初始活性，但可能改善在线稳定性，特别是对于基于CrOx的催化剂。

OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的主要优势包括高金属分散度、improved稳定性、reduced积碳形成和enhanced再生能力。然而，CrOx物种在反应循环过程中的缓慢转化仍然是CrOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个限制。反应机理涉及氧化（晶格氧参与）和非氧化脱氢途径，前者在反应初期更为突出。

These catalysts exhibit high specific surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts showing around 780 m2/g, allowing for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. This high dispersion contributes to their catalytic activity.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports, OMS catalysts offer advantages in terms of surface area and metal dispersion. The highly ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 provides a large surface area for active site distribution, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

In PDH reactions, VOx/MCM-41 shows superior performance and stability compared to CrOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 maintains its activity through multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, while CrOx/MCM-41 gradually loses activity due to aggregation of CrOx species.

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role, particularly in oxidized catalysts, where they participate in the initial propene production. This is evidenced by the slight decrease in productivity observed for reduced V- and Cr-containing catalysts.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing the metal oxide species. While this reduction can slightly decrease initial productivity, it may also affect long-term stability. The study shows that oxidized catalysts generally perform better than reduced ones in PDH reactions.

Catalyst deactivation is primarily caused by coke deposition and structural changes in the active species. VOx/MCM-41 shows remarkable resistance to deactivation, maintaining its highly dispersed VOx species structure throughout multiple reaction cycles. In contrast, CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 experience gradual activity loss due to transformations in their active species.

Overall, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to both CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional supports, making them promising candidates for industrial applications.

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，OMS催化剂在表面积和金属分散性方面具有优势。MCM-41的高度有序介孔结构提供了大面积的活性位分布，可能导致更好的催化性能。

在PDH反应中，VOx/MCM-41的性能和稳定性优于CrOx/MCM-41。VOx/MCM-41在多个脱氢/再生循环中保持其活性，而CrOx/MCM-41由于CrOx物种的聚集而逐渐失去活性。

反应机理涉及氧化和非氧化脱氢途径。晶格氧物种起着关键作用，特别是在氧化态催化剂中，它们参与初始丙烯的生产。这一点从V和Cr含有的还原态催化剂的生产率略有下降可以得到证实。

H2预处理通过还原金属氧化物物种影响催化剂性能。虽然这种还原可能略微降低初始生产率，但也可能影响长期稳定性。研究表明，在PDH反应中，氧化态催化剂的性能通常优于还原态催化剂。

催化剂失活主要是由焦炭沉积和活性物种的结构变化引起的。VOx/MCM-41表现出对失活的显著抵抗力，在多个反应循环中保持其高度分散的VOx物种结构。相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41和传统催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3由于活性物种的转变而经历逐渐的活性损失。

总的来说，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统载体的性能和稳定性，使其成为工业应用的有前景的候选者。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The structural properties of these catalysts are characterized by high surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts maintaining most of their pore structure after impregnation and calcination. This high surface area allows for better dispersion of active metal species.

VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional metal oxide supports. The VOx species remain highly dispersed as VO4 surface species, which contributes to their excellent stability over multiple dehydrogenation cycles. In contrast, CrOx species tend to aggregate over time, leading to gradual loss of activity.

The main advantage of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts is their remarkable stability and ability to fully recover activity through oxidative regeneration. This is attributed to the preservation of the highly dispersed VOx species throughout multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. The primary limitation for all catalysts in PDH reactions is deactivation due to carbon deposition during the reaction.

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Oxidized species are generally more active, but reduced species also contribute to the reaction. Lattice oxygen species play a role in the initial stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts, as evidenced by the formation of trace amounts of CO.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance differently depending on the metal. For VOx/MCM-41, reduction slightly improves on-stream stability. The effect is more pronounced for CrOx/MCM-41, where H2 treatment significantly enhances propene formation and stability. This suggests that the oxidation state of the metal species is an important factor in determining catalyst performance and deactivation behavior in PDH reactions.

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的主要优势在于其出色的稳定性和通过氧化再生完全恢复活性的能力。这归因于在多个反应-再生循环中高度分散的VOx物种得以保存。PDH反应中所有催化剂的主要限制是由于反应过程中碳沉积导致的失活。
