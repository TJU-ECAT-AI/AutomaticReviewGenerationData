[1] "The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1. Thus, the pore structure of the support was mostly preserved after impregnation and the following calcination."

[2] "A broad absorption band at ca. 300 nm in the spectrum of VOx/MCM-41 is characteristic of highly dispersed dehydrated VO4 surface species"

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated."

[5] "As evident from Fig. 3, both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream. Based on previous studies on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts as well as our UV/Vis and TPO results (Section 3.3), the activity decrease within one DH cycle must be related to deposition of carbonaceous species."

[6] "In the 1st DH cycle, the yields ratio for oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 was 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, that is, VOx/MCM-41 slightly improved its on-stream stability when used in a reduced form. The effect of H2 treatment on the propene formation over CrOx/MCM-41 was even higher: The corresponding values were 2.5 and 1.4."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The structural properties of these catalysts are characterized by high surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts maintaining most of their pore structure after impregnation and calcination. This high surface area allows for better dispersion of active metal species.

VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional metal oxide supports. The VOx species remain highly dispersed as VO4 surface species, which contributes to their excellent stability over multiple dehydrogenation cycles. In contrast, CrOx species tend to aggregate over time, leading to gradual loss of activity.

The main advantage of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts is their remarkable stability and ability to fully recover activity through oxidative regeneration. This is attributed to the preservation of the highly dispersed VOx species throughout multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. The primary limitation for all catalysts in PDH reactions is deactivation due to carbon deposition during the reaction.

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Oxidized species are generally more active, but reduced species also contribute to the reaction. Lattice oxygen species play a role in the initial stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts, as evidenced by the formation of trace amounts of CO.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance differently depending on the metal. For VOx/MCM-41, reduction slightly improves on-stream stability. The effect is more pronounced for CrOx/MCM-41, where H2 treatment significantly enhances propene formation and stability. This suggests that the oxidation state of the metal species is an important factor in determining catalyst performance and deactivation behavior in PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂的结构特性以高比表面积为特征，MCM-41负载的催化剂在浸渍和煅烧后仍保持了大部分孔结构。这种高比表面积允许活性金属物种更好地分散。

与CrOx/MCM-41和传统金属氧化物载体相比，VOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出优越的性能。VOx物种作为高度分散的VO4表面物种保持稳定，这有助于其在多个脱氢循环中保持出色的稳定性。相比之下，CrOx物种随时间tend聚集，导致活性逐渐下降。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂的主要优势在于其出色的稳定性和通过氧化再生完全恢复活性的能力。这归因于在多个反应-再生循环中高度分散的VOx物种得以保存。PDH反应中所有催化剂的主要限制是由于反应过程中碳沉积导致的失活。

反应机理涉及氧化态和还原态金属氧化物物种作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。氧化态物种通常更活跃，但还原态物种也对反应有贡献。晶格氧物种在反应的初始阶段发挥作用，特别是对于氧化态催化剂，这从微量CO的形成可以得到证实。

H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响因金属而异。对于VOx/MCM-41，还原略微改善了反应中的稳定性。这种效果在CrOx/MCM-41上更为显著，H2处理显著提高了丙烯的生成和稳定性。这表明金属物种的氧化态是决定PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活行为的重要因素。
