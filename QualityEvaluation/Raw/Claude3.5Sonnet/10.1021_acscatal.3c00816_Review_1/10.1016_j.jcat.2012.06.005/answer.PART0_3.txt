[1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "The propene STY values obtained over oxidized catalysts were in the range between 0.15 and 0.23 gC3H6 gcat1 h1. A similar productivity was reported for propane DH at 823 K in the absence of gas-phase O2 over a VOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6.8 wt.% V2O5 [25]."

[4] "A slight decrease in the productivity was observed over reduced V- and Cr-containing catalysts. This is probably due to the fact that both oxidative (with participation of lattice oxygen) and non-oxidative propane DH contribute to the initial propene production over the oxidized catalysts, while only non-oxidative DH occurs over the reduced ones."

[5] "VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high specific surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts showing around 780 m2/g, allowing for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. This high dispersion contributes to their catalytic activity.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports, OMS catalysts offer advantages in terms of surface area and metal dispersion. The highly ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 provides a large surface area for active site distribution, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

In PDH reactions, VOx/MCM-41 shows superior performance and stability compared to CrOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 maintains its activity through multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, while CrOx/MCM-41 gradually loses activity due to aggregation of CrOx species.

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role, particularly in oxidized catalysts, where they participate in the initial propene production. This is evidenced by the slight decrease in productivity observed for reduced V- and Cr-containing catalysts.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing the metal oxide species. While this reduction can slightly decrease initial productivity, it may also affect long-term stability. The study shows that oxidized catalysts generally perform better than reduced ones in PDH reactions.

Catalyst deactivation is primarily caused by coke deposition and structural changes in the active species. VOx/MCM-41 shows remarkable resistance to deactivation, maintaining its highly dispersed VOx species structure throughout multiple reaction cycles. In contrast, CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 experience gradual activity loss due to transformations in their active species.

Overall, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to both CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional supports, making them promising candidates for industrial applications.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，金属有序介孔氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂具有高比表面积，MCM-41负载的催化剂比表面积约为780 m2/g，允许高度分散的表面VOx和CrOx物种。这种高度分散性有助于提高其催化活性。

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，OMS催化剂在表面积和金属分散性方面具有优势。MCM-41的高度有序介孔结构提供了大面积的活性位分布，可能导致更好的催化性能。

在PDH反应中，VOx/MCM-41的性能和稳定性优于CrOx/MCM-41。VOx/MCM-41在多个脱氢/再生循环中保持其活性，而CrOx/MCM-41由于CrOx物种的聚集而逐渐失去活性。

反应机理涉及氧化和非氧化脱氢途径。晶格氧物种起着关键作用，特别是在氧化态催化剂中，它们参与初始丙烯的生产。这一点从V和Cr含有的还原态催化剂的生产率略有下降可以得到证实。

H2预处理通过还原金属氧化物物种影响催化剂性能。虽然这种还原可能略微降低初始生产率，但也可能影响长期稳定性。研究表明，在PDH反应中，氧化态催化剂的性能通常优于还原态催化剂。

催化剂失活主要是由焦炭沉积和活性物种的结构变化引起的。VOx/MCM-41表现出对失活的显著抵抗力，在多个反应循环中保持其高度分散的VOx物种结构。相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41和传统催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3由于活性物种的转变而经历逐渐的活性损失。

总的来说，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统载体的性能和稳定性，使其成为工业应用的有前景的候选者。
