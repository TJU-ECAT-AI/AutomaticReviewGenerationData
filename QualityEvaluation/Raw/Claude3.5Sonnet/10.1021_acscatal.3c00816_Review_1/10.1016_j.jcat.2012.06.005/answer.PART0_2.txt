[1] "VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed SBET of ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1. Thus, the pore structure of the support was mostly preserved after impregnation and the following calcination."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22], [23], [26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."

[5] "Both oxidized and reduced MeOx species can function as active sites for propane dehydrogenation with the former being more active"

[6] "VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts maintain high surface areas after metal impregnation and calcination, preserving the pore structure of the support. The high dispersion of metal oxide species on the OMS surface leads to improved catalytic performance compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

VOx/MCM-41 demonstrates superior time-on-stream stability and regenerability compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the resistance of VOx species to structural changes under reaction conditions, allowing full activity recovery through oxidative regeneration over multiple PDH cycles.

The use of OMS supports, particularly MCM-41, results in lower coke formation compared to traditional alumina supports. This suppressed coke formation contributes to the extended stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts.

Both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species can act as active sites for PDH, with oxidized species showing higher activity. The presence of lattice oxygen in oxidized species contributes to their superior performance. H2 pretreatment reduces the metal oxide species, slightly decreasing their initial activity but potentially improving on-stream stability, especially for CrOx-based catalysts.

The main advantages of OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions include high metal dispersion, improved stability, reduced coke formation, and enhanced regenerability. However, the gradual transformation of CrOx species during reaction cycles remains a limitation for CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The reaction mechanism involves both oxidative (with lattice oxygen participation) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, with the former being more prominent in the initial stages of the reaction.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂在金属浸渍和煅烧后保持高比表面积，保留了载体的孔结构。OMS表面上金属氧化物物种的高度分散导致其催化性能优于传统金属氧化物载体。

VOx/MCM-41表现出优越的时间稳定性和再生能力，优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统催化剂。这种性能的提升归因于VOx物种在反应条件下对结构变化的抵抗力，使其能够在多个PDH循环中通过氧化再生完全恢复活性。

使用OMS载体，特别是MCM-41，与传统的氧化铝载体相比，能够减少积碳形成。这种抑制积碳形成的特性有助于VOx/SiO2催化剂保持长期稳定的性能。

氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种都可以作为PDH的活性位点，其中氧化态物种表现出更高的活性。氧化态物种中的晶格氧对其优越性能有所贡献。H2预处理会还原金属氧化物物种，略微降低其初始活性，但可能改善在线稳定性，特别是对于基于CrOx的催化剂。

OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的主要优势包括高金属分散度、improved稳定性、reduced积碳形成和enhanced再生能力。然而，CrOx物种在反应循环过程中的缓慢转化仍然是CrOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个限制。反应机理涉及氧化（晶格氧参与）和非氧化脱氢途径，前者在反应初期更为突出。
