[1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "From the BET data and the content of chromium and vanadium, we calculated their apparent surface densities. The respective values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm2 and 0.24 Cr nm2."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

[5] "Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream"

The study analyzes the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts showed high specific surface areas of around 780 m2/g, which is beneficial for catalytic activity due to the increased number of accessible active sites.

The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. It exhibited excellent time-on-stream stability across multiple dehydrogenation cycles and its activity could be fully restored through oxidative regeneration. This suggests that the VOx species remained highly dispersed and resistant to structural changes under reaction conditions.

In contrast, CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed gradual activity loss over multiple cycles due to transformation of active species. This highlights the advantage of VOx/MCM-41 in maintaining structural integrity and catalytic performance.

The study found that both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species can function as active sites for propane dehydrogenation, with oxidized species being more active initially. However, the difference in activity between oxidized and reduced catalysts diminished over time as the oxidized species were reduced by the propane stream.

Lattice oxygen species played a role in the initial stages of the reaction, as evidenced by trace amounts of CO formation over oxidized VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. This suggests that lattice oxygen participates in propane activation.

H2 pretreatment had different effects on the catalysts. For VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41, reduction slightly improved on-stream stability but decreased initial activity. In contrast, H2 pretreatment significantly enhanced the activity of PtSn/Al2O3 by forming metallic Pt and/or PtSn alloys.

The main cause of catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle was coke deposition. However, the nature and impact of these carbon deposits varied among the catalysts, with VOx/MCM-41 showing better resistance to deactivation despite forming more carbon deposits.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrated superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to CrOx and traditional supports, highlighting the potential of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for this application.

该研究分析了金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。这些催化剂表现出约780 m2/g的高比表面积，这有利于催化活性，因为增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

VOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的性能。它在多个脱氢循环中表现出优异的时间稳定性，并且其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。这表明VOx物种保持高度分散，并在反应条件下抗结构变化。

相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂由于活性物种的转变而在多个循环中表现出逐渐的活性损失。这突出了VOx/MCM-41在保持结构完整性和催化性能方面的优势。

研究发现，氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种都可以作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点，其中氧化态物种最初更加活跃。然而，随着氧化态物种被丙烷流还原，氧化态和还原态催化剂之间的活性差异随时间减小。

晶格氧物种在反应的初始阶段发挥了作用，这从氧化态VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂上产生微量CO可以证明。这表明晶格氧参与了丙烷的活化。

H2预处理对催化剂有不同的影响。对于VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41，还原略微改善了时间稳定性，但降低了初始活性。相比之下，H2预处理通过形成金属Pt和/或PtSn合金显著提高了PtSn/Al2O3的活性。

在单个PDH循环内，催化剂失活的主要原因是积碳。然而，这些碳沉积物的性质和影响在催化剂之间有所不同，VOx/MCM-41虽然形成了更多的碳沉积物，但表现出更好的抗失活能力。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优于CrOx和传统载体的性能和稳定性，突显了金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在这一应用中的潜力。
