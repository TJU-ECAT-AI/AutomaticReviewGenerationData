[1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream (Fig. S3)."

[5] "Based on the above discussion, we conclude that the origin of CrOx/MCM-41 activity loss over several DH/regeneration cycles lays in CrOx sintering."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high surface areas, with MCM-41-supported catalysts having specific surface areas of around 780 m2/g. This high surface area allows for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species, potentially achieving monolayer coverage.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports, MCM-41 supported catalysts demonstrate superior structural properties. The ordered mesoporous structure provides better dispersion of active metal species and potentially improves catalytic performance. VOx/MCM-41 in particular shows excellent time-on-stream stability and the ability to fully recover its activity through oxidative regeneration.

The reaction mechanism in PDH over these catalysts involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species. Oxidized CrOx and VOx species are initially more active, but their activity becomes similar to reduced species over time as they are reduced by the propane stream. This suggests that lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the initial stages of the reaction.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing the metal oxide species before the reaction. While this can improve the stability of some catalysts (e.g., CrOx/MCM-41), it may slightly decrease initial activity compared to oxidized forms.

Deactivation in PDH reactions over these catalysts occurs primarily due to coke deposition. However, the structural stability of the active species also plays a significant role in long-term performance. VOx species on MCM-41 show remarkable resistance to structural changes, allowing for consistent performance over multiple PDH/regeneration cycles. In contrast, CrOx species on MCM-41 tend to sinter over time, leading to gradual activity loss.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts show particular promise for PDH reactions due to their high stability, ability to maintain dispersed active species, and full recovery of activity through regeneration. These properties give them an advantage over traditional supports and other OMS-supported catalysts like CrOx/MCM-41.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂具有高比表面积，MCM-41负载的催化剂比表面积约为780 m2/g。这种高比表面积允许VOx和CrOx物种高度分散在表面上，可能达到单层覆盖。

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，MCM-41负载的催化剂展示出优越的结构特性。有序介孔结构提供了更好的活性金属物种分散性，可能提高催化性能。特别是VOx/MCM-41表现出优异的时间稳定性，并能通过氧化再生完全恢复其活性。

这些催化剂上PDH的反应机理涉及氧化态和还原态的金属氧化物物种。氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种最初活性更高，但随着时间推移，它们被丙烷流还原，活性逐渐与还原态物种相似。这表明晶格氧物种在反应初期起着关键作用。

H2预处理通过在反应前还原金属氧化物物种来影响催化剂性能。虽然这可以提高某些催化剂（如CrOx/MCM-41）的稳定性，但与氧化态相比，可能略微降低初始活性。

这些催化剂在PDH反应中的失活主要是由于焦炭沉积。然而，活性物种的结构稳定性对长期性能也起着重要作用。MCM-41上的VOx物种对结构变化表现出显著的抗性，允许在多个PDH/再生循环中保持稳定性能。相比之下，MCM-41上的CrOx物种随时间推移容易烧结，导致活性逐渐下降。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂由于其高稳定性、保持分散活性物种的能力以及通过再生完全恢复活性的特性，在PDH反应中表现出特别的优势。这些特性使其相比传统载体和其他OMS负载催化剂（如CrOx/MCM-41）具有优势。
