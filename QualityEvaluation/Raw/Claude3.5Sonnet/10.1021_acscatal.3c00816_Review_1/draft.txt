1. The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior.

Structural properties:
1. High surface area: OMS materials provide larger surface areas (e.g., MCM-41 with ~780-900 m2/g) for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency [10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005].
2. Ordered mesoporous structure: The well-defined pore structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, improving catalytic activity [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62805-5].
3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure leads to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, increasing the number of active sites [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.05.024].
4. Thermal stability: OMS materials exhibit good thermal stability, crucial for high-temperature PDH reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.04.018].

Catalytic behavior:
1. Higher activity: VOx and CrOx supported on OMS materials show higher activity compared to bulk V2O5, Cr2O3, or traditional supports [10.1039/D0CS00814A].
2. Improved selectivity: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate high propylene selectivity (up to 90%) [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_1].
3. Enhanced stability: OMS-supported catalysts often show better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional supports [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022].

Reaction mechanisms:
The PDH reaction over VOx/OMS and CrOx/OMS catalysts involves:
1. C-H bond activation in propane
2. Propylene desorption
3. Regeneration of active sites

For VOx catalysts, V4+ and V3+ species are identified as catalytically active sites, with Lewis acidity increasing as the number of V-O-V bonds decreases [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022]. For CrOx catalysts, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active and selective than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, participating in the initial stages of PDH. Their depletion is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_1].

Factors influencing performance and deactivation:
1. Metal loading and dispersion: Optimal metal loading is crucial for maintaining high dispersion and activity [10.1002/cctc.201801598].
2. Support acidity: Lower acidity of OMS supports contributes to better anticoking capacity [10.1016/j.cej.2019.122423].
3. Redox properties: The ability to undergo redox cycles affects catalyst activity and stability [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01413].
4. H2 pretreatment: Affects the oxidation state of active species, influencing activity and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2021.111187].

Challenges and limitations:
1. Coke formation: The main cause of deactivation, although OMS supports show improved resistance compared to traditional supports [10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005].
2. Sintering of active phases: Can occur at high reaction temperatures, leading to activity loss [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01413].
3. Potential pore blockage: May occur due to coke formation or metal aggregation [10.1039/D2NR02208G].

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer significant advantages in PDH reactions due to their structural properties and improved catalytic behavior. However, optimizing metal loading, pretreatment conditions, and reaction parameters is crucial to maximize their performance and overcome limitations.
