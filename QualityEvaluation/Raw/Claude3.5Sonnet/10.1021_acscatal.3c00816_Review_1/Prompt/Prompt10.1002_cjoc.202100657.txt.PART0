Framework Zr Stabilized PtSn/Zr-MCM-41 as a Promising Catalyst for Non-oxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation
Comprehensive Summary
Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route to produce ethene. Herein, PtSn supported catalysts were investigated to achieve better ethane dehydrogenation performance by introduction of different Zr promoters, i.e., framework Zr and ZrO2, to mesoporous MCM-41. In-situ XRD, TEM and CO chemisorption show that aggregation of metal particles and phase segregation of Pt3Sn to Pt and PtSn3 at high temperature occur for PtSn/M, leading to bad ethane dehydrogenation activity. Strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species, as proved by XPS, results in restrained metal particles, which promotes the initial reactivity. However, Pt phase generated on surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of produced ethene as indicated by CO-IR and C3H6-TPD, and pyridine-IR and NH3-TPD indicate strong acidity generated. Both deactivate the catalyst rapidly by deep dehydrogenation and coking. Moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr with much weaker acidity is formed when framework Zr is incorporated into MCM-41, which benefits the dispersion of metal particles, formation of Pt3Sn/Pt species and stabilization of metal species from phase segregation. Outstanding initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity of ca. 99% were achieved for the optimal PtSn/ZrM, which is more coking-tolerant and stable by generating graphitic carbon mainly on support instead of active metals.
Background and Originality Content
Ethene is a key building block of petrochemical industry for production of plastics, fibers, rubbers, and so on, which is mainly obtained from steam cracking of oil, coal to olefins and methanol to olefins.[1] Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods. Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive.[2] Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1). The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically controlled,[3] thus high temperature is required (>550C) to achieve efficient conversion of ethane to ethene.
C2H6  C2H4 + H2  H298θ =136.6 kJ/mol (Eq. 1)
Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.[4, 5] Pt phase is highly active for alkane dehydrogenation,[6, 7] while Pt3Sn/Pt has been recognized as a better structure compared with Pt for that the desorption of generated ethene on its surface is much easier.[8, 9] However, the melting point of Sn is merely 232C,[10] while Pt's melting point is as high as 1755C and its Httig temperature is 335C.[11] Aggregated particles with less active sites exposed on the surface and phases like PtSn3 that are low-active for dehydrogenation of alkanes may generate during reduction and reaction, due to the high operation temperature and different mobility of Pt and Sn.[12, 13] To maintain dehydrogenation efficiency, PtSn phase segregation and metal sintering must be minimized,[14-17] in which the supports play an important role by regulating the geometric and electronic structure of PtSn.
ZrO2 is well known for strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) with Pt.[18-20] Ji et al. showed that interaction between metal species and B-ZrO2 support is desired to strengthen the interaction between Pt and Sn,[21] thus improving the performance of propane dehydrogenation. Considering that the surface area of bulk ZrO2 is very low, supports have been recommended for better dispersion and performance.[22, 23] Long et al.[24] and Yu et al.[25] found ZrO2 loaded on Al2O3 benefits higher Pt-Sn dispersion accompanied with smaller particle size. However, acidic supports may induce carbon deposit under high operation temperature and deactivate catalysts by following coverage of active sites.[26, 27] What's more, ZrO2 contains plentiful Lewis acid sites,[28] and Brnsted sites are generated upon reduction by hydrogen,[29] which may further deteriorate the coking during dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, modulation of Zr species on porous non- acidic support to achieve highly dispersed and stable PtSn catalyst, as well as to decrease the acidity and prevent rapid deactivation, is of importance.
Herein, we synthesized framework Zr-incorporated MCM-41 (ZrM), and compared it with MCM-41 (M) and ZrO2-supported MCM-41 (Zr/M), for the optimal formation and dispersion of supported PtSn species during reduction and dehydrogenation process. The preparation procedure and structure of supports are shown in Scheme 1. It was found that framework Zr can restrain the growth of PtSn particles and stabilize highly active Pt3Sn/Pt without phase segregation by moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr. The weak Lewis acidity remains stable without enhancement for PtSn/ZrM after reduction, and the generated carbon deposit during reaction is largely on support instead of active sites. PtSn/ZrM shows the best dehydrogenation efficiency with ca. 99% ethene selectivity, the highest ethane conversion and stability. The incorporation of moderate heteroatoms to MCM-41 framework to promote ethane dehydrogenation can also be applied to Ti and V, which offers an alternative strategy to achieve better alkane dehydrogenation performance.

Results and Discussion
Physic-chemical properties
N2 adsorption-desorption and mesopore diameter distribution curves indicate that synthesized M and ZrM possess large specific surface areas (SBET = ca. 1000 m2·g1), ordered mesopores (dBJH = ca. 3.0 nm) and large mesoporous volumes (Vmeso = ca. 1.0 cm3·g1) (Figure S1 and Table S1). SXRD patterns (Figure S2) directly identify the formation of MCM-41 with p6mm structure. IR spectra of the supports can be seen in Figure 1a. Compared with M, ZrM shows an enhanced absorption at ca. 960 cm1, which is attributed to the formation of Si-O-Zr structure.[30] As for Zr/M, it's adsorption at ca. 960 cm1 is much weaker, because Zr species is impregnated on the surface rather than incorporated into the framework. UV-vis DRS spectra are presented in Figure 1b. Tetrahedral Zr4+ species is formed in ZrM with adsorption edge at ca. 210 nm. The results indicate that Zr, as a heteroatom, is successfully incorporated into the framework for ZrM. While for Zr/M, much intensive absorbance (210 & 270 nm) of ZrO2 species is found. A slight blue-shift of absorption band comparing Zr/M with ZrO2 may result from the decreased ZrO2 particle size of the former.[31, 32] The generation of PtSn species and ZrO2 in Zr/M was further identified by in-situ XRD (Figure 1c and Figure S3), which shows the emergence of ZrO2 peak at 30.0 for PtSn/Zr/M with the increase of heating temperature.

Different Zr species result in great changes in the support's acidity. Pyridine was applied as probe molecule in infrared spectra testing (pyridine-IR). As indicated in Figure 1d, peaks at 1605, 1573, 1489 and 1446 cm1 are recognized for ZrM and Zr/M, attributed to vibration modes of pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites.[28, 33] The acid content of ZrM is much lower than that of Zr/M. The lack of medium and strong acid as shown in Figure 1e at ca. 370C and ca. 520C results in the differences in pyridine-IR. On the contrary, not only Zr/M owns stronger acidity, but also the acidity of PtSn/Zr/M is enhanced by hydrogen reduction. It has been reported that hydrogen spillover occurs during the reduction of Pt on ZrO2.[29, 34] The activated hydrogen atoms migrate to the O2 site of ZrO2 in close neighbourhood. Brnsted acid sites are therefore generated and increase the acidity.
Crystal structure and particle size of metal species
In-situ XRD patterns (Figure 1c and Figure S3) also identify the crystal structure of metal particles during reduction process.[35] All catalysts show the emergence of Pt and Pt3Sn peaks during the reduction. What's more, a small peak at ca. 41.3 ascribed to PtSn3 is only observed for PtSn/M, which has a trend to grow gradually during the reduction process. This may be because PtSn species own little interaction with pure silica M, so part of Sn atoms immigrate easily to form Sn-rich PtSn3 phase and Pt phase.
Detailed deconvolution of XRD patterns of reduced catalysts can be seen in Figure 1c. The width of Pt and Pt3Sn peaks follows a sequence of PtSn/M < PtSn/ZrM < PtSn/Zr/M, and the intensity of them follows an opposite sequence, indicating that the particle size is PtSn/M > PtSn/ZrM > PtSn/Zr/M.[36] HAADF-TEM images and particle size distribution of PtSn species in reduced catalysts are exhibited in Figures 2a2c. Metal nanoparticles are formed for all samples, and the sequence of average particle size is PtSn/M (5.8 nm) > PtSn/ZrM (2.5 nm) > PtSn/Zr/M (1.5 nm), consistent with in-situ XRD results. The elemental mapping images of PtSn/ZrM have also been examined in Figures 2d2f. Overlapped signals were collected for Zr and Pt elements in Figure 2e, for that the photo energy data of stimulated characteristic X-rays of them are very close. Nevertheless, Zr is incorporated into the framework of support, and Pt's contrast is much higher than that of Zr, so Zr doesn't bother the analysis of metal particles in HAADF-TEM images. Concentrated intensive signals of Pt and Sn located at the same position are recognizable in large metal particles, which is consistent with XRD analysis that Pt3Sn exists widely on ZrM support.

Electronic state of Pt
XPS spectra of Pt 4f are presented in Figure 3a, the chemical shift of Pt 4f7/2 peak for PtSn/Zr/M moves to much higher binding energy (72.01 eV) compared with others. Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and ZrO2 causes the most positive Pt atoms as reported by literature.[20, 24, 37] Moreover, the surface Pt and Sn contents calculated by XPS are much higher than the bulk ones for PtSn/Zr/M (Table 1), further indicating the strong interaction of surface ZrO2 and PtSn species. As for PtSn/ZrM, its Pt 4f7/2 binding energy is slightly higher than that of PtSn/M, i.e.,

Pt Sn Pt Sn
PtSn/M 1.3 0.4 2.0 1.06 0.53 1.22
PtSn/ZrM 0.85 0.57 0.90
PtSn/Zr/M 1.87 1.14 1.00
the interaction between Pt and Si-O-Zr is moderate. An interesting finding is that PtSn/ZrM owns the lowest surface Pt/Sn ratio of 0.90, the surface content of Sn is as high as 0.57 wt% (>0.4 wt%), and the surface content of Pt is only 0.85 wt% (<1.3 wt%), indicating the most coverage of Sn on Pt surface.
An important indicator of surface Pt's electron density is CO-IR as shown in Figure 3b. The peaks at ca. 1830 cm1 are due to the bridge-bound CO on large Pt surface (Figure S4),[38-40] which is tiny because of the possible coverage of Pt3Sn on Pt surface and the small Pt particle size. The peaks at wavenumber higher than 2000 cm1 are assignable to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt atoms,[41] the vibration frequency of which (vCO) for PtSn/ZrM is 2068 cm1, the lowest among the studied catalysts. Decrease of vCO results from higher electron density available on surface Pt atoms.[38, 42] Hence, the highest electron density of surface Pt is identified for PtSn/ ZrM, which benefits easier desorption of generated ethene.[43] Propylene is a good indicator of alkene's chemisorption property on catalyst.[14] C3H6-TPD curves in Figure 3c directly indicate that the best PtSn/ZrM catalyst shows the weakest adsorption capacity of alkene. The easier removal of ethene product from active sites for PtSn/ZrM is therefore identified, which is important for the alleviation of ethene's deep dehydrogenation and polymerization to coke, and the following coverage of active sites.
Exposed surface Pt atoms of the catalysts were detected by CO chemisorption measurement and COads/Pt is the molar ratio of adsorbed CO to Pt (Figure 3d). For PtSn/Zr/M that owns the smallest average particle size (), the highest content of Pt phase and the lowest content of Pt3Sn phase (Figure 1c), significant CO chemisorption occurs. The largest for PtSn/M with decreased expose of Pt contributes to its less CO chemisorption than PtSn/ Zr/M. However, PtSn/ZrM with much smaller than PtSn/M shows further decreased CO chemisorption. Besides particle size, the dispersion of different PtSn species has great influence on it. Combined with XRD results that Pt and Pt3Sn are the main phases in PtSn/ZrM, it can be inferred that Pt in PtSn/ZrM is largely covered by Pt3Sn on the surface. The electron density of Pt atom of surface Pt3Sn is enriched by Sn, therefore the lowest vCO of PtSn/ZrM can be explained. While for PtSn/M, Pt and Pt3Sn are also exist widely, but phase segregation of part Pt3Sn to Pt and PtSn3 contributes to increased CO chemisorption. What's more, Ar+ etching was applied to explore the depth profile of Pt 4f for PtSn/ZrM as shown in Figure S5, the peak of which moves to higher binding energy with etching time. This indicates that more positive Pt atoms are generated in the depth compared with those in the surface for PtSn/ZrM. Close interaction between Pt and Si-O-Zr in the depth, and shift of electron cloud from Sn to nearby Pt in the surface Pt3Sn, contribute to it.
Behaviour of ethane dehydrogenation
Although bulk ZrO2 was reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation,[44] no obvious conversion of ethane was observed for our Zr/M or ZrM support. PtSn/M performs the lowest activity and stability as shown in Figures 4a, 4b. The biggest particle size of it causes the decrease of amount of exposed active sites. And formation of low-active PtSn3 further inhibits the reactivity. The initial ethane conversion of PtSn/Zr/M is outstanding (35.5% (equilibrium conversion of ethane to ethene: 32.7%, Figure S6)), which may be due to the smallest metal particles. What's more, the generated hydrogen atoms on Pt spillover to nearby ZrO2 quickly [29, 34, 45] and promote the dehydrogenation reaction. However, this reaction suffers fast deactivation over time on stream. PtSn/ZrM not only achieves excellent initial activity (34.2%), but also exhibits much better stability. This owns to the incorporation of framework Zr and its regulation on PtSn species to well dispersed, highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt. Three gas reaction products, i.e., hydrogen, ethene and methane, are detected by GC (Figure S7), and there is no liquid by-product found. All catalysts show excellent ethene selectivity of ca. 99% except for the first 20 min as represented in Figure 4c. While methane selectivity higher than 2% occurs for PtSn/M and PtSn/Zr/M at the early stage of time on stream (Figure 4d).

Reaction conditions: 600C, 0.1 MPa, 20% C2H6/N2, space velocity of 30000 mL·h1·g1. Stability is measured by the conversion at a certain time on stream divided by the initial one. The selectivity is calculated based on gas products.
Supplementary experiments were further conducted with pure-Pt catalysts without the assistance of Sn species to explore the reactivity of ethane as exhibited in Figure S8. It reveals that the selectivity of methane is much higher for pure-Pt catalysts compared with PtSn catalysts for all supports. Therefore, more methane at the early stage for PtSn/M and PtSn/Zr/M compared with PtSn/ZrM is very likely due to the larger degree of exposed Pt species, which is known to be active for cracking reaction.[46, 47] What's more, Sn's critical role for the high selectivity of ethene is
identified. Heavy coking occurs for such sites with time on stream, resulting in decreased methane selectivity and rapid deactivation. Nevertheless, the catalyst's stability is largely improved by the incorporation of framework Zr (Figure S8b).
Stability is vital to achieve better ethane dehydrogenation performance, which requires further exploration and explanation. In-situ XRD of catalysts during the dehydrogenation reaction was measured as shown in Figures 5a5c and no growth of PtSn species peaks is found, ruling out the effect of sintering on deactivation. Coke deposit is generated inevitably under high reaction temperature and may decrease the catalyst's activity. TG results of reacted catalysts in Figure 5d indicate that the amount of coke on PtSn/ZrM (3.7%) is slightly lower than that on PtSn/Zr/M (3.9%), although the former's ethane overall conversion is much higher, indicating PtSn/ZrM is more anti-coking. PtSn/M possesses the least coke while it deactivates rapidly. Then, different kinds of carbon species are identified by DTG curves (Figure 5e) and TPO profiles (Figure 5f). The peaks at lower temperature (230, 265 & 360C) are due to the oxidation of polycyclic carbons and amorphous carbon that can be easily removed. The other two peaks at higher temperature are ascribed to the combustion of graphitic carbon that is hard to burn out, in which the peak at 480C corresponds to coke deposited on surface of PtSn species that is more active to oxygen to promote the burning, and the peak at the highest temperature of 550C is assigned to coking on support.[48, 49] A lot of amorphous carbon exists in PtSn/M and PtSn/ZrM, while most of the coke in PtSn/Zr/M is graphitic carbon. This is consistent with Raman results (Figure S9), in which the sequence of coke's graphitization degree is PtSn/M < PtSn/ZrM < PtSn/Zr/M, coinciding with the variation in catalysts acidity.[50] What's more, most of the graphitic carbon is located on the metal

surface for PtSn/M and PtSn/Zr/M. However, despite graphitic carbons formed for PtSn/ZrM during the reaction, the coke locates mainly on the support instead of the surface of the highly active metal sites, which contributes to enhanced coke tolerance and more stable reactivity. The easiest desorption of generated ethene from the active metal sites of PtSn/ZrM plays a key role for that, deep dehydrogenation of ethene and coking on the active sites can be avoid to a large extent.
When talks about methane, a clear relation of the selectivity of it and the Si/Zr ratio of support is found as shown in Figure S10. Moderate amount of Si-O-Zr is necessary for conversion of ethane, meanwhile keeping a high selectivity of ethene. Apart from Zr-MCM-41, introduction of other heteroatoms with similar chemical properties to the mesoporous MCM-41, i.e., Ti and V, was also examined. The activities of PtSn/TiM and PtSn/VM are also enhanced in certain degree compared with that of PtSn/M (Figure S11), indicating the success of this strategy to achieve better ethane dehydrogenation performance.
Conclusions
Initial activity of supported PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation is promoted by introduction of framework Zr and ZrO2. Strong acidity and strong interaction between PtSn species and ZrO2 deteriorate the catalytic stability for PtSn/Zr/M. Acidity of PtSn/ZrM is weak and remains stable during the reduction process, meanwhile moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr is generated, which benefits the formation, dispersion and stabilization of highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt particles. This catalyst is coking-tolerant by locating carbon deposit mainly on the support instead of active metal species, resulting in much more stable performance. The incorporation of moderate content of heteroatoms like Zr, Ti and V to the framework of mesoporous MCM-41 is found effective to promote ethane dehydrogenation performance, which offers an alternative strategy to develop more stable and dispersed PtSn catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes.
Experimental
Preparation of supports and catalysts
Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), zirconium nitrate pentahydrate (Zr(NO3)4·5H2O), tetrabutyl titanate, vanadium oxysulfate, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), tin(IV) chloride (SnCl4) were all purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. and used without further treatment. Ethane gas was purchased from Tianjin ShengTang Gas Co., Ltd.
The Zr-incorporated MCM-41 support (abbreviated as ZrM) was synthesized according to our previous work[51, 52] with modification. Typically, 50 mL of NaOH solution (0.21 mol/L) in a three- necked round-bottom flask was heated at 50C under magnetic stirring, after which 1.82 g of CTAB was dissolved in it. 8.21 mL of TEOS was added dropwise and the stirring speed was set as 300 r/min to control the TEOS hydrolysis rate. When the solution turned pale grey, the stirring speed was slowed down to 200 r/min. Zr(NO3)4 dissolved in 20 mL of water was then added dropwise to the aforementioned solution. The pH value was adjusted in the range of 10.511.0 by NaOH (3.00 mol/L) followed by stirring for another 1 h. Afterwards, the mixture was transferred to a 100-mL sealed Teflon-lined autoclave and treated hydrothermally at 100C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the precipitation was collected by centrifugation, washed by deionized water thoroughly, dried at 200C overnight and calcinated at 500C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5C·min1. The content of Zr was 3.0 wt% and molar ratio of Si/Zr is 47 as analyzed by ICP-OES. Pure siliceous MCM-41 (abbreviated as M) was synthesized as described above without the addition of Zr source.
Incipient wetness co-impregnation method was applied to load H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 on M and ZrM applying water as the solvent. Pt and Sn loading amounts were 1.3 wt% and 0.4 wt%, respectively, Pt/Sn = 2.0 (molar ratio).[8, 12, 16] After drying overnight at 200C, the catalysts were obtained and named PtSn/M and PtSn/ZrM, respectively. As for PtSn/Zr/M, impregnation of Zr(NO3)4 solution to M with the same content of Zr as ZrM (3.0 wt%) followed by drying at 200C overnight was firstly applied. Zr/M was annealed at 600C for 1 h before characterization. Pure-Pt catalysts were also prepared as above without the addition of Sn.
Characterizations
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were conducted by a Micrometrics ASAP 2460 physisorption analyzer at 196C. Specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated using Bunauer-Emmett- Teller (BET) method and the mesoporous size distributions were calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method based on adsorption branch data. Small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA at a scanning rate of 1 ()·min1. Transmission infrared (FT-IR) spectra were carried out on a Bruker Vertex70 spectrophotometer, samples were mixed with KBr and pressed into thin plates for measurement. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu U-3100 spectrophotometer equipped with a 60-nm (diameter) integrating sphere using BaSO4 as reflectance. High- angle annular dark field-transmission electron microscope (HAADF- TEM) images and elemental mapping images were achieved using a JEOL JEM-F200 field emission transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. Contents of Zr were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis with VARIAN Vista MPX spectrometer. Thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) curves of reacted catalysts were measured by a TA Q500A instrument under air atmosphere.
X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analysis was conducted with a ThermoFisher Scientific K-Alpha+ spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα radiation at 20 eV pass energy, and the Ar+ sputtering was carried out to explore the XPS profile in the depth with a ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer.
In-situ XRD patterns were recorded by a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation source) at 60 kV and 220 mA. The sample was reduced at 600C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10C·min1 under 10% H2/Ar, then the gas was switched to 20% C2H6/N2 at 600C for another 2 h. Signals were collected at regular intervals.
Pyridine-IR spectra were collected by a Bruker Vertex70 spectrophotometer, in which pure sample powder was pressed into very thin self-supporting wafer and degassed at 400C before the test. Pyridine was transferred to sample chamber by flowing N2 at 60C and adsorbed for 30 min. Then, the temperature was raised to 200C under 105 mbar for the measurement. As for CO-IR, the reduced sample wafer was treated by 10% CO/Ar at 40C for 30 min, then replaced by N2 purging for removal of physically adsorbed CO. CO-IR signals were recorded at regular interval until the peak remained unchanged to avoid dipole-dipole effect.
Temperature-programmed NH3 desorption (NH3-TPD) and C3H6-TPD measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument in the temperature range of 50 600C at a ramp rate of 10C·min1. CO chemisorption was measured by a dynamic pulse method in a flow of 10% CO/He at 50C using the same instrument. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles were achieved in a flow of 5% O2/He with a heating rate of 10C·min1 by an AMI-300 apparatus.
Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were carried out in a quartz tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 4mm (Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd.). 200 mg catalyst (tableted and crushed to 2040 mesh) was mixed evenly with SiC particles (2040 mesh) to fill a 10-cm length of tubular reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ by 100 mL·min1 20% H2/N2 at 600C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10C·min1, followed by replacement of 200 mL·min1 N2 for 0.5 h to remove residual hydrogen. Then, the gas flow was switched to 100 mL·min1 20% C2H6/N2 for dehydrogenation reaction. The outlet gas was analysed by an on-line Agilent 490 Micro GC equipped with three different GC columns (MS5A for C1, PPU for C2 and Al2O3/KCl for C3&C4) and thermal conductivity detectors.
