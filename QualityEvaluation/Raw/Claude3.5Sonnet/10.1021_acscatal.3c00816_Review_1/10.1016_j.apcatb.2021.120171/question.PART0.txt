Abstract
Herein, a series of nano-flower sheet-like alumina spheres (NF-Al2O3) with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites stabilizing Ru-CeOx catalysts were designed and synthesized for catalytic total oxidation of one typical light alkanes (propane, C3H8). The 90 % conversion temperature (T90) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 modified by 7 wt.% of CeO2 were as low as 207 C and 56.7 kJ mol1, respectively. In addition, it also exhibited superior water, sulfur and carbon dioxide resistance and recycling performance. The excellent catalytic performance of propane total oxidation over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 is mainly attributed to NF-Al2O3 has rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can anchor the Ru-CeOx active species. The anchoring effect of Al3+penta on the metal active unit can effectively promote the dispersion of Ru-CeOx active species and stabilize the electronic valence state of Ru0. The degradation of C3H8 over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 conformed to the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism through two different pathways as revealed by the in situ DRIFTS.

1. Introduction
The growing emission levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have caused a certain threat to the environment and human health [
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
]. VOCs mainly include species such as hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, oxygen hydrocarbons and nitrogen hydrocarbons [
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
], which are mainly derived from petroleum processing, chemical production and household products emissions [
9
,
10
]. It has been revealed that the VOCs can participate the reaction with nitrogen oxides (NOx) under the action of sunlight and heat to form ozone (O3), which leads to poor air quality and causes the secondary pollution [
11
]. In order to reduce the emission of VOCs in the atmosphere, a variety of methods were developed, such as membrane adsorption method, photocatalytic decomposition method, solvent absorption method, ultraviolet catalytic ozone oxidation method, biological filtration method, thermal incineration method, catalytic oxidation method, condensation method and so on [
6
,
12
]. For treatment of the exhaust gases with large flow rate and low pollutant concentration, catalytic oxidation technology is generally considered as one of the best methods and has been widely used because of its high efficiency, low energy consumption and the final products of the reaction are non-toxic CO2 and H2O [
13
]. In addition, catalytic total oxidation also provides the possibility of removing VOCs from the air or wastewater on lower concentration levels at lower temperatures [
14
].However, the catalytic oxidation method still faces some challenging problems for oxidizing low-carbon alkanes (i.e., light alkanes) due to the short carbon chain molecules are both thermally and chemically stable, and breaking the CH bond is inconvenience, so that leading to eliminate light alkanes needs higher temperature [
10
,
15
]. Therefore, the intervention of efficient catalysts is required to totally degrade the low-carbon alkanes at lower temperature [
16
].
Generally, there are mainly two types of high-efficiency catalysts developed for the total oxidation of light alkanes, including noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts. Non-noble metal catalysts such as Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, etc. are widely used in thermal catalysis, which have low price but still have the disadvantage of insufficient activity [
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
]. Noble metal catalysts such as Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ag and Au have excellent catalytic activity and low ignition reaction temperature when they are applied in thermal catalysis, which are the main catalysts used in the catalytic combustion of VOCs in real applications [
16
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
]. However, general precious metals (e.g., Pt and Pd) are expensive, while Ru is relatively cheaper than other precious metals, particularly, the Ru-based catalysts exhibit the best propane total oxidation activity according to the current research. Therefore, the Ru- based catalysts can be used as the promising and preferred catalyst for propane catalytic combustion [
9
,
10
,
26
].
It is well known that the gamma phase alumina (γ-Al2O3) was widely used as the carrier for efficient catalysts in thermal catalysis because of the large specific surface area and high thermodynamic and chemical stability [
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
]. Traditional γ-Al2O3 was mostly solid microspherical nanoparticles, specially, tailoring morphology and pore structure can effectively optimize the structural performance to improve the mass transfer effect of reactants and product molecules. Furthermore, the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) sites has been proved to be the primary anchoring sites for catalytic active phases and should play an essential role in the dispersion and stabilization of active units according to previous studies [
27
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
]. The anchoring effect of Al3+penta can significantly improve catalytic performance of the catalyst. However, the catalytic reaction interface usually needs to be optimized due to the surface chemical inertia of γ-Al2O3. As a material that can be reduced (Ce4+  Ce3+), cerium dioxide (CeO2) is widely used as a carrier or co-catalyst for catalytic oxidation reaction because of its excellent oxygen storage and transport capabilities (Ce4+ /Ce3+ redox cycle) [
10
,
29
,
30
]. Moreover, studies have proved that the noble metal-CeOx interface has excellent catalytic performance in catalytic oxidation reaction [
21
,
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
]. Therefore, designing and constructing of the active metal-CeOx interfaces are more and more importantly for catalytic oxidation reaction.
In this work, the Ru-CeOx interfaces are constructed and anchored on nano-flower sheet-like alumina spheres (NF-Al2O3) with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites for catalytic oxidation of C3H8. The designed Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance for total oxidation of propane. Additionally, it also exhibited superior water, sulfur and carbon dioxide resistance and recycling performance. Various characterization methods including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, energy dispersive, physical and chemical adsorption analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrum, solid state 27Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were applied to investigate the physicochemical performance of our designed Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts. Importantly, the mechanism over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 for propane total oxidation was also revealed by the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (In situ DRIFTS). The illustration for construction of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and its total oxidation of C3H8 is displayed in

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of NF-Al2O3
NF-Al2O3 is synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Typically, 7.55 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O (from Sinopharm Chemical,  99.0 wt.%), 3.5 g K2SO4 (from Aladdin Biochemical, 99.0 wt.%), and 2.5 g CO(NH2)2 (from Aladdin Biochemical) were dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water. Then the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflonlined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 C for 3 h. The suction filtration process was implemented after cooled to room temperature and collected the white precipitate when the value of the total dissolved solids (TDS) of the filtrate was < 10, and dried at 80 C for 12 h and subequently calcined at 500 C for 2 h.
2.1.2. Synthesis of Al2O3-Con
For comparison, the conventional Al2O3 (Al2O3-Con) was also synthesized. Appropriate amount of Al(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in deionized water. Then, NH4OH (from Xilong Scientific, 2528 wt.%) was added drop by drop as the precipitant, until completely precipitated (The mixture was considered to be completely precipitated at a pH of about 10.0), and the filter was washed by ionized water until the pH reduced to 7.0, then dried at 80 C for 12 h and finally calcined at 500 C for 2 h.
2.1.3. Synthesis of Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3-Con
Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3-Con were prepared by a well-developed deposition-precipitation (DP) method using RuCl3 (from Aladdin Biochemical, Ru content 4555 wt.%) as the Ru precursor. Take an appropriate amount of support powder and an appropriate amount of RuCl3 into an appropriate amount of deionized water, then, an aqueous NaOH solution (0.01 M) (from Xilong Scientific,  96.0 wt.%) was added dropwise to the suspension to change the pH of the mixture to 9.0 and the mixture was further stirred at 25 C for 3 h, and the precipitate was filtered and washed until the pH of the solution decreased to 7.0. It was followed by drying at 80 C for 12 h and reduced directly at 400 C for 2 h under 5% H2/N2 atmosphere to obtain the final catalysts.
2.1.4. Synthesis of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con
Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 were prepared by a well-developed deposition-precipitation (DP) method using RuCl3 and Ce(NO3)3.6H2O as the Ru and Ce precursor, respectively. Firstly, appropriate amount of Ce(NO3)3.6H2O (from Aladdin Biochemical, 99.5 wt.%) was dissolved in appropriate amount of deionized water and then quantitative NF-Al2O3 support powder was added sequently. Then, an aqueous NH4OH solution (0.1 M) was added dropwise to the above suspension to change the pH of the mixture to 9.0 and the mixture was further stirred at 25 C for 3 h, and the filter with suction until the pH of the filtrate decreased to 7.0. After this, the obtained powder was dried at 80 C for 12 h and finally calcined at 500 C for 2 h. Afterwards, appropriate amount of product was added to the appropriate amount of RuCl3 solution, and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 15 min and stirred at 30 C for 15 min. Then, an aqueous NaOH solution (0.01 M) was added dropwise to the suspension to change the pH of the mixture to 9.0 and the mixture was further stirred at 25 C for 3 h, and the filter with suction until the pH of the filtrate decreased to 7.0. It was followed by drying at 80 C for 12 h and reducing at 400 C for 2 h under 5% H2/N2 atmosphere to prepare Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst. The synthesis method of Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con was the same with that of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3.
2.2. Characterization methods
Various test methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma  optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), physical and chemical adsorption methods, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) were adopted to measure the physical and chemical performances and plausible reaction mechanism over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts, and the detailed measuring processes are described in the Supplementary Information.
2.3. Activity and kinetic tests
Propane (C3H8) was selected as the typical light alkane VOCs to test the catalytic total oxidation performances of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and the related catalysts. The detailed activity, stability and kinetic tests are also presented in the Supplementary Information.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity of the catalysts
The catalytic activities of the Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 (content of CeO2 was 7.0 wt.%) and related catalysts for propane total oxidation are displayed in
Fig. 1
. As shown in
Fig. 1
(a, c) and Table S1, the propane total oxidation activity over Ru/NF-Al2O3 is evidently higher than that of Ru/Al2O3-Con. The T10, T50 and T90 (conversion temperatures of 10 %, 50 % and 90 %) of Ru/NF-Al2O3 were 179, 214 and 242 C, respectively, and propane was completely degraded before the temperature reaching up to 250 C. While the T10, T50 and T90 of Ru/Al2O3-Con were 193, 229 and 269 C, respectively, and the propane was completely degraded before the temperature reaching to 300 C. It has been reported that Ru-CeOx interface has excellent catalytic capability for oxidation reaction. In order to obtain better catalytic performance, a series of nano-flower sheet-like alumina supported Ru (Ru/NF-Al2O3) catalyst was modified by CeO2(Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3), where the Ru-CeOx interface was introduced. Evidently, the introduction of Ru-CeOx interface effectively improves the catalytic activity of propane total oxidation performance. Even the CeO2 content was only 1.0 wt.%, the catalytic activity of the catalyst was significantly improved. The T10, T50 and T90 of Ru-Ce1/NF-Al2O3 decreased sharply to 164, 197 and 215 C, respectively, compared with Ru/NF-Al2O3. Moreover, the catalytic activity of propane combustion of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts increases with the increase of CeO2 content, which is caused by the effective increase of Ru-CeOx interface with the increase of CeO2 content. When the CeO2 content reaches 3.0 wt.%, Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts can completely degrade propane before the temperature reaching to 220 C. When the content of CeO2 reaches 7.0 wt.%, the increase amplitude of propane combustion catalytic activity decreases with the increase of CeO2 content, while the reason is that sufficient Ru-CeOx interface has been obtained when the CeO2 content reaches 7.0 wt.%. As a result, the influence of the increase of CeO2 content on the catalytic activity of propane total oxidation gradually decreased. Therefore, Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 is used as the primary catalyst to study. In addition, compared with the Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con catalyst, the catalytic activity of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 is significantly higher than that of Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con as shown in Figure S1. The better catalytic activity of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 than Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con might be attributed to the superiority of NF-Al2O3 carrier. The specific activity is present in Figure S1. The T10, T50 and T90 of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts are visually displayed in
Fig. 1
(c). Evidently, the propane oxidation activity of these catalysts was in the order of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 > Ru/NF-Al2O3 > Ru/Al2O3-Con. The kinetic test was investigated to further test the excellent catalytic performance of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 under high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV =180000 mL gcat.1 h-1) at low conversion (< 15 %) as shown in
Fig. 1
(b, d) and Table S2. Besides, a series of preliminary experiments and mathematical calculations were carried out to ensure the negligible mass and heat transfer effect on the collected kinetic data (Supporting Information, Table S3 - S5) [
23
,
37
]. It can be seen that the apparent activation energy (Ea) of propane catalytic combustion reaction over Ru/NF-Al2O3 (Ea =80.3 kJ mol -1) is significantly lower than Ru/Al2O3-Con (Ea=103.6 kJ mol -1). The Ea of the reaction is further reduced after CeO2 was involved, and the Ea corresponding to CeO2 content of 1 wt.%  10 wt.% is in the range of 56.9 kJ mol -1  70.7 kJ mol -1. The Ea value over Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 is as low as 56.9 kJ mol -1. Then the reaction rate [Rate @175oC (mol gRu.-1 s-1)] of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and the related catalysts at 175 C was calculated according the kinetic test conditions and results. The turnover frequency (TOF (s-1)@175 oC) of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts at 175 C was calculated based on ICP, CO-TPD results, and the relevant data are shown in
Fig. 1
(d) and Table S2. Both the rate and TOF conform to the law of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 > Ru/NF-Al2O3 > Ru/Al2O3-Con, which further demonstrates that Ru/NF-Al2O3 has a superior catalytic propane total oxidation performance compared with Ru/Al2O3-Con, and the introduction of Ru-CeOx interface can further improve its catalytic performance.

3.2. Environmental resistance and recycling performance
The anti-harsh environment and recycling ability of catalysts are often the main factors to evaluate the performance of catalysts for real application. Therefore, the Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 catalyst has been tested for water, sulfur and CO2 resistance and the recycling performance in this work, with the results shown in
Fig. 2
. Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was tested for water resistance at complete conversion temperature (220 C), lower temperature (200 C) and higher temperature (275 C), the conversion rate of propane on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 at 220 C and 275 C was decreased from 100 % to about 95 % after 5% H2O introduced into the reaction system, and the activity is restored after the water is turned off (
Fig. 2
a). And the conversion rate of propane at 200 C decreased sharply from 82 % to 74 % and then remained stable before water was passed, which might be the result of the direct oxidation of a part of Ru by oxygen. The activity decreased from 74 % to about 60 % after water turned on and recovered after water turned off, which fully demonstrated the excellent water-resistance performance of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3. The decreased activity exposed on water might be caused by the competitive adsorption of water molecule with reactant of propane or oxygen [
38
]. The sulfur resistance test results are shown in
Fig. 2
(b). After two hours of pre-sulfurization treatment on the catalysts under a high concentration atmosphere of 100 ppm SO2 at 200 C, the total conversion temperature of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 only increased by about 10 C. The excellent sulfur resistance of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 might be attributed to the easier formation of cerium sulfate or cerium sulfite than Ru sulphates, which effectively retards the sulfur poisoning to the precious metal Ru [
39
]. The actual industrial working conditions of the catalyst are often accompanied by high concentrations of CO2. Therefore, it is very necessary to test the high concentration of CO2 resistance on the catalyst. The catalytic activity of propane combustion was tested for Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 in the presence of 10 % CO2 in this work, and the results were shown in
Fig. 2
(c). The results showed that the catalytic activity of propane combustion over Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 has almost no decrease in the presence of high concentrations of CO2. The excellent CO2 resistance might be attributed to the result that propane or oxygen and CO2 avoid competitive adsorption on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 [
40
,
41
]. Furthermore, the primary catalyst Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was tested for five cycles to investigate its recycling stability (
Fig. 2
d and e). There was a certain decrease in catalytic activity in the first to third cycle tests, and the reason might be that part of Ru was directly oxidized by oxygen, which resulted in the decrease of Ru-CeOx interface. However, the total oxidation of propane can still be completed before 230 C. The catalytic activity remains unchanged after the fourth cycle, which is the result of Ru/Ru+n gong to saturation. Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was restored after five cycles of testing through a simple reduction process (
Fig. 2
e), which leads to the restoring of Ru-CeOx interface [
2
]. In summary, Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 exhibits excellent water, sulfur and CO2 resistance and recycling performance for propane total oxidation.

3.3. Physicochemical performance of the catalysts
The above results demonstrate that Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 has excellent propane catalytic total oxidation performance. The physical morphology of the catalyst was measured by SEM and TEM, with the results shown in
Fig. 3
(ai). It can be clearly observed that NF-Al2O3 has a hollow flower-like morphology with a large number of stacked mesopores assembled from nanosheets. The particle size distribution of NF-Al2O3 is ranged between 2 and 5 μm, and the thickness of the nanosheet is 5.2 nm (
Fig. 3
i). SEM and TEM characterizations of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and Ru/NF-Al2O3 showed that their structures was retained well (
Fig. 3
(e, f, h, i)), and the unique structural feature can significantly promote the diffusion of reactant molecules, which is one of the reasons why the Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts have high catalytic performance. The SEM and TEM characterization of Al2O3-Con and Ru/Al2O3-Con were are shown in Figure S2. The results show that Al2O3-Con has a random block structure with interstitial pores formed by the accumulation of nanoparticles. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the catalyst were analyzed by the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm characterization, and the results are shown in
Fig. 3
(j), Figure S3 and Table S6. The NF-Al2O3 and Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts present a type II adsorption-desorption curve and a H3 type hysteresis loop, and the relative pressure p/p0 = 0.40.85 all have a large hysteresis loop owing to the presence of a large number of mesopores, while Al2O3-Con and Ru/Al2O3-Con catalysts show type IV absorption/desorption curve and H2 type hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop with relative pressure p/p0 = 0.40.85 is due to the existence of interstitial pores (
Fig. 3
(j) and Figure S3). The physical adsorption test results were consistent with the morphology characterization of electron microscope. The specific surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vmeso) and pore diameter (Dmeso) of all the catalysts are listed in Table S6. The SBET of the Al2O3-Con and supported samples is ranged from 186 to 221 m2 g1 and the pore diameter is between 5.32 and 6.05 nm, while the SBET of the NF-Al2O3 and related samples is in the range of 195 - 223 m2 g 1 and the pore diameter is 4.034.19 nm. It can be observed that the SBET of Al2O3-Con and NF-Al2O3 are 186 m2 g1 and 195 m2 g1, respectively, both of which have large specific surface areas. However, after loading Ru and Ru-CeO2, the SBET was not decreased but increased to 208 - 223 m2 g1. In order to reveal the reasons, the supports were treated by a 0.01 mol/L NaOH alkaline solution for 3 h to obtain Al2O3-Con-AT and NF-Al2O3-AT. As expected, the SBET of the two carriers increased to 210 and 212 m2 g 1, respectively, indicating that the low-concentration NaOH alkaline solution slightly etched the surface of the Al2O3 support, resulting in an increase in the specific surface area. This etching phenomenon was clearly observed by SEM (Figure S4). As can be seen in Figure S4, Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 surfaces are obviously rougher due to etching compared to the untreated samples, indicating that OH- can etch the surface of NF-Al2O3, which is well in line with the BET results.

It is well known that the dispersion of noble metal catalysts often affects the number of exposed active sites, and directly determines the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The XRD results of all catalysts are shown in Figure S5. Significant characteristic diffraction peaks of γ- Al2O3 are observed in all the samples, and the characteristic diffraction peaks of CeO2 were gradually observed with the increase of CeO2 content. However, no diffraction peaks corresponding to RuO2 or Ru were observed, so it can be preliminarily judged that the Ru species is highly dispersed on the support with small particle size [
9
,
10
]. In order to further prove that the metal Ru is highly dispersed on the surface of all the supports, the TEM and EDX-mapping analysis of the Ru/Al2O3-Con, Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 catalysts is carried out, as shown in
Fig. 4
. Ultrasmall size of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) are observed in the TEM images of all the catalysts (
Fig. 4
(ae)). Ru NPs are uniformly distributed on the supports with average size of 2.0, 1.18 and 1.18 nm for the Ru/Al2O3-Con, Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3, respectively. Based on the results of carbon monoxide temperature programmed desorption (CO-TPD, Figure S6), the dispersion of these three catalysts was 23.48 %, 32.59 % and 34.92 %, respectively (Table S2), which was consistent with the above TEM analysis. And we found that the CO-TPD result of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 had much larger desorption peaks in the low-temperature region than its analogs (Ru-Ce3/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce10/NF-Al2O3), the reason may be attributed to more CO molecules are weakly adsorbed over Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3. The Catalysts using NF-Al2O3 as support have smaller Ru NPs and higher dispersion, which preliminarily indicates that NF-Al2O3 with nano-sheet flower structure can promote the dispersion of Ru species. Then, the primary catalyst Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was characterized by EDX-mapping, and the distribution of all elements is shown in
Fig. 4
(fl), Ru and Ce elements are uniformly dispersed on the surface of NF-Al2O3 support, which also clearly proves the highly dispersion of Ru species. The high dispersion of Ru species ensures the existence of as many Ru-CeOx interfaces as possible, which is one of the reasons for the high propane total oxidation performance over Ru-Ce7/ NF-Al2O3.

As a material with excellent capacity to store and transport oxygen, CeO2 has been widely used in thermal catalytic oxidation reactions. It was reported that the oxygen vacancy at the reduced noble metal-CeOx interfaces can be used as the active sites for propane catalytic combustion [
30
,
42
,
43
]. In addition, many researches have shown that the strong interaction between Ru and CeO2 can generate lots of oxygen vacancies, and the oxygen vacancies can be used for adsorption and activation of oxygen in the total oxidation reaction [
9
,
10
,
32
]. In order to investigate the existence of oxygen vacancies in Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 and the distribution of surface oxygen species, Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Figure S7) and XPS (
Fig. 4
(b, c)). From the Raman spectrum, it is obvious that the peak intensity at 456 cm1 was gradually increased with the increase of CeO2 content, which is assigned to the F2g vibration mode of the CeO2 fluorite structure [

], and the peak at 690 cm1 is assigned to Ru-O-Ce bond resulting from the metal  support interaction, while the peak at 596 cm1 is assigned to the defect-induced (D) mode of oxygen vacancies [
29
,
44
,
45
], which also demonstrates the existence of oxygen vacancies. The relatively weak intensity of these two peaks suggest that the Ru-CeOx active species might be distributed and stabilized in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3. XPS spectra and its quantitative analysis further prove this characterization result (
Fig. 4
(ac) and Table S7). It can be observed that the signal intensity of Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 are much weaker than that of Ru/Al2O3-Con from the Ru 3p XPS spectra (
Fig. 4
(a)), which indicates that the Ru species of Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 are mostly distributed in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3. Then the Ru and Ce species were quantitatively analyzed based on XPS and ICP data (Table S7) [
13
]. Since Al atoms were uniformly distributed throughout the catalyst for all catalysts, the molar ratio of n(Ru)/n(Al) and n(Ce)/n(Al) were calculated according the XPS and ICP results, respectively. The (XPS/ICP)n(Ru)/n(Al) of both Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 is nearly 0.9, which are approximately equal to 1, indicating that Ru species are uniformly distributed in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3. While the (XPS/ICP)n(Ru)/n(Al) of Ru/Al2O3-Con is 2.0, which is twice higher than that of Ru/NF-Al2O3 and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3, indicating that Ru species are mostly distributed on the surface of Al2O3-Con support. The Raman results showed that Ru/Al2O3-Con detected two distinct peaks belonging to the Eg and A1g vibration modes of Ru-O at 520 cm1 and 636 cm-1 [
46
], and the vibration peak of Ru-O was not detected on NF-Al2O3 supported catalyst. This result also indicates the distribution of Ru species is consistent with the XPS results. And the XPS/ICP of n(Ce)/n(Al) is 0.7, indicating that the Ce species is also uniformly distributed in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3. Both XPS and Raman results suggest that Ru-CeOx is uniformly distributed in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3, which can also facilitate the reactant molecules to contact the Ru-CeOx active interface more efficiently during reaction.
The Ce 3d and O 1s spectra of XPS results further suggest the existence of a large number of oxygen vacancies [
10
]. The Ce 3d spectra is shown in
Fig. 5
(b). It consists of two series of spin-orbit lines u and v [
9
]; Ce 3d3/2 spin-orbit components that correspond to u lines include three characteristic peaks labeled as u(900.8 eV), u(907.2 eV) and u(916.8 eV); and Ce 3d5/2 spin-orbit components that correspond to v lines include three peaks labeled as v(884.9 eV), v(888.8 eV), and v(897.9 eV). These six peaks are attributed to the characteristic peaks of Ce4+. The remaining four peaks u0(899.4 eV), v0(879.7 eV), u(903.1 eV) and v(884.9 eV) are attributed to the characteristic peaks of Ce3+. The presence of Ce3+ indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies. The Ce3+ concentration is calculated through quantitative analysis. The results are listed in Table S7, where Ce3+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) is 38.5 %, indicating the presence of high-concentration of oxygen vacancy. Then the O 1s spectra of XPS shows the characteristic peaks of surface adsorbed oxygen Oads (523.7 eV) and surface lattice oxygen Olatt (531.1 eV) (
Fig. 5
(c)). Although Ru-CeOx is mostly distributed in the cavity of the NF-Al2O3 and is not detected, and the Oads / Olatt ratio of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 (25.0 %) is significantly higher than that of the catalysts without Ce (14.5 % and 15.7 %) (Table S7), which also shows the existence of a large number of oxygen vacancies in Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 [
10
]. The existence of a large number of oxygen vacancies effectively improves the ability of the catalyst to adsorb and activate oxygen in the propane oxidation reaction and accelerate the oxidation reaction process.

3.4. The valence distribution of Ru species and the anchoring effect of Al3+penta
The chemical valence state of noble metal often significantly affects the catalytic activity.
Fig. 5
(a) shows the Ru 3d XPS spectra of the Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 and related catalysts. The resulting peaks at approximately 462.2 and 463.3 eV were assigned to Ru and Run+ (0 < n < 4), respectively [
9
,
47
,
48
]. Although all the catalysts were reduced during the preparation process, positively charged Ru was observed in all the catalysts, because Ru metal can become partially oxidized when exposed to air at ambient temperature. Run+/Ru was calculated through quantitative analysis (Table S7), and it was found that the Run+/Ru value of Ru/Al2O3-Con (54.5 %) was significantly higher than that of Ru/NF-Al2O3 (39.7 %) and Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 (43.7 %), which demonstrates that NF-Al2O3 effectively affects the distribution of the electronic valence state of Ru, and the possible reason is that this support effectively inhibits the direct oxidation of Ru by oxygen in the air. The activity test of RuOx-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 obtained by direct calcinating at 500 C for 2 h showed that the catalytic activity of RuOx-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was much lower than that of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 for propane combustion (
Fig. 5
(d)). These results show that the superiority of the Ru0-CeOx interface, and also shows that Ru may be used as the optimal active electronic valence for propane catalytic combustion reaction. This is also one of the reasons why the apparent activation energy of Ru/NF-Al2O3 is significantly lower than that of Ru/Al2O3-Con under the kinetic condition of excluding mass and heat transfer. In order to clarify the reason why NF-Al2O3 can affect the valence state of Ru, all catalysts were characterized by 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectra (27Al MAS NMR). As shown in
Fig. 6
. The two characteristic peaks at 9 and 74 ppm represent Al3+ cations in octahedral (Al3+octa) and tetrahedral (Al3+tetra) coordination, and that at 38 ppm represents coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ cations with pentahedral coordination (Al3+penta) [
34
]. However, NF-Al2O3 showed a peak of Al3+penta compared with Al2O3-Con, and the Al3+penta peak almost disappeared after loading Ru and Ru-CeO2. The reason is that Al3+penta is the unsaturated coordinated Al3+ cations, and the active units of Ru and Ru-CeOx occupy the unsaturated coordination sites and are anchored by the unsaturated coordination sites of Al3+penta. Previous studies have shown that the unsaturated coordination site of Al3+penta has been regarded as the active site, and its anchoring effect can greatly promote the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, stabilize the metal active unit and affect electronic features of surface species [
49
,
50
], which is also the reason of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 exhibits excellent activity, stability and recycling performance. Based on the XPS test results, Al3+penta not only promotes the dispersion of Ru nanoparticles, but also effectively stabilizes the electronic valence state of Ru, and inhibits the process of Ru being directly oxidized to Run+ by oxygen.

3.5. The reaction mechanism over Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3
The Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst designed in this work has excellent propane combustion catalytic performance. In order to have a deeper understanding of the reaction pathway of the total oxidation of propane, the Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 catalyst was subjected to in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) characterization to investigate its reaction mechanism. We designed three types of in situ DRIFTS exploration experiments according to the oxidation type of the catalytic combustion reaction of propane and related literature investigations, which consist of C3H8 pre-adsorption and total oxidation experiments at 200 C, C3H8 temperature-programmed oxidation experiments (50400 C) and C3H8-TPD experiments in N2 + O2 feed gases (50400 C).
3.5.1. C3H8 pre-adsorption and total oxidation experiments at 200 C
The in situ DRIFT spectra results of the pre-adsorption and oxidation of propane at 200 C are shown in
Fig. 7
(ad). The peak positions of all bands are shown in Table S8. First, Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 was pre-adsorbed at 2000 ppm C3H8 + N2 for 30 min. The asymmetric stretching vibration peak of methyl (Vas(CH3)) at 2968 cm1 and the asymmetric stretching vibration peaks of methylene (Vas(CH2)) at  2900 cm1 were observed, which were attributed to the adsorption of gaseous propane [
51
,
52
]. The peak at 1851 cm1 was attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of the carbonyl group (V(CO)) of acetone species; the peak at 1584 cm1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the carbonyl group (Vas(COO)) of formate species [
11
,
51
]; the peaks at 1548 cm1 and 1507 cm-1 were attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the carbonyl group (Vas(COO)) of acetate species [
2
,
53
]; the peak at 1454 cm1 was attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of the carbonyl group (Vs(COO)) of acetate species [
10
,
53
], and the peaks at 2330 cm1 and 2367 cm1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the product CO2 (V(CO2)) [
20
,
54
]. During the 30 min pre-adsorption stage of propane, the peaks between 1300 cm-1 - 2400 cm1 showed a gradually increasing trend, indicating that propane continuously reacts with the lattice oxygen from the Ru-CeOx interface, resulting in the accumulation of intermediate and final products on the surface of the Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 catalyst, which also indicated that the oxidation of propane on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 may conform to the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. After the intervention of 10 % O2 + N2, the adsorption peak intensity of propane gradually decreased until it disappeared, indicating that the propane adsorbed on the surface gradually reacted with oxygen. Moreover, the peak strength at 1851 cm1, 1584 cm1 and 1507 cm1 showed a gradually decreasing trend, indicating that the acetone, formate and acetate species might be the intermediate species of propane catalytic oxidation reaction on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3.

Conditions: first adsorption with 2000 ppm C3H8 + N2 and then 10 % O2 + N2 was introduced for 30 min for a-d; 2000 ppm C3H8 + 10 % O2 + N2 for e-h, flow rate =30 mL min1 for the above test.
3.5.2. C3H8 temperature-programmed oxidation (50400 C)
In order to further investigate the reaction process of propane total oxidation on Ru-Ce7/ NF-Al2O3, the in-situ infrared spectrum of the temperature-programmed oxidation of propane was tested and analyzed. The results are shown in
Fig. 7
(eh) and Table S8. The signal intensity of Vas(CH3) (2973 cm1) and Vas(CH2) (2894 cm1) increases firstly and then decreases with the rise of temperature, which represents the deepening of the adsorption and oxidation of propane. V(C = O) (1851 cm-1) of acetone, Vas(COO) (1595 cm-1) of formate, Vas(COO) (1541 cm-1) and Vs(COO) (1446 cm-1) of acetate, and V(CO2) (2311 cm-1, 2359 cm-1) of the final product also appeared along with the progress of the oxidation reaction. And the peak of acetone gradually changed to desorption peak with the increase of temperature, indicating that acetone species participated in the reaction as an intermediate species, while the signal intensity of formate and acetate species was only slightly weakened and the change was not obvious. The reason may be that formate and acetate species participate in the process of propane oxidation as the second intermediate species after acetone species. According to the MvK mechanism, the active oxygen species from the Ru-CeOx interface may participate in the entire redox process, so we proposed a possible propane oxidation reaction process on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3: C3H8
C3H6O
HCOOH + CH3COOH
CO2 + H2O.
3.5.3. C3H8-TPD in N2 + O2 feed gas (50400 C)
The C3H8-TPD testing over Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 in N2 + O2 flow gas was performed to investigate the conversion of the pre-adsorbed C3H8 species. The DRIFTS spectra were collected from 50 to 400 C under N2 and O2 mixture gases. The results are shown in
Fig. 8
and Table S8. The water shear vibration peak δ(HOH) appears at 1643 cm1 [
55
], which can be attributed to the formation of H2O by the reaction of propane with the oxygen species from the Ru-CeOx interface during the low-temperature pre-adsorption stage. Moreover, the peak of δ(HOH) becomes desorption peak when the temperature rises above 100 C [
56
], which also verifies the above inference. The peaks of Vas(CH3) (2973 cm-1) and Vas(CH2) (2894 cm-1) almost disappeared at 100 C, indicating that the pre-adsorbed propane was oxidized. The appearance and changing laws of V(C = O) (1853 cm-1) of acetone, Vas(COO) (1595 cm-1) of formate, Vas(COO) (1540 cm-1) of acetate and Vs(COO) (1488 cm-1, 1440 cm-1) of acetone were also consistent with the above mentioned mechanism. In addition, the V(C = C) peak of the acrylic species was detected at 1617 cm-1 above 300 C [
52
,
57
], indicating that there may be another reaction pathway in the reactionC3H8
CH2CHCOOH
CO2 + H2O.

Fig. 8. in situ DRIFT spectra collected of propane temperature-programmed desorption (C3H8-TPD) in N2 + O2 atmosphere from 50 C to 400 C on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3. Pre-adsorption condition: 2000 ppm C3H8 + N2 for 30 min and after from pure N2 with 30 min at 50 C, flow rate =30 mL min1; TPD condition: 10 % O2 + N2, flow rate =30 mL min1.
We summarized the possible propane oxidation mechanism on Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 based on the above in situ DRIFT spectra results. First of all, the entire propane oxidation reaction follows the MvK mechanism. Active oxygen species from the Ru-CeOx interface participate in the entire redox cycle. Gaseous oxygen take advantage of the oxygen vacancies at the Ru-CeOx interface as the binding sites to complete conversion with lattice oxygen, where the conversion mechanism follows the law of O2 (ad)  O2 (ad)  O22- (ad)  O (ad)  2O2- (latt) [
58
,
59
]. And the possible two reaction pathways of C3H8 total oxidation of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 are illustrated in
Scheme 2
. The first path is that C3H8 first adsorbed on the Ru-CeOx interface, and reacted with the active oxygen species to form acetone species, then acetone species reacts with the active oxygen species to form formate and acetate species, and finally degraded to CO2 and H2O by active oxygen species. The second degradation pathway is that the adsorbed C3H8 reacts with active oxygen to generate acrylic species, which is then degraded into CO2 and H2O by the active oxygen (
Scheme 2
).

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of Ru-CeOx supported on nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ were designed and synthesized for propane total oxidation. Compared with the Ru supported on conventional Al2O3-Con catalyst, Nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich Al3+penta stabilizing Ru catalyst exhibited higher propane total oxidation performance and lower activation energy (Ea), which should be mainly attributed to the anchoring effect of a large amount of Al3+penta greatly promote the dispersion of Ru species. And the introduction of Ru-CeOx interface further increases its catalytic activity. Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst shows excellent recycling performance and outstanding resistance to water, sulfur and carbon dioxide, which is also mainly attributed to the structural effect of NF-Al2O3 and the stabilizing effect of Al3+penta for Ru-CeOx active units and the electronic valence state of Ru0. The catalytic total oxidation of propane over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst conformed the MvK mechanism and the O derived from the Ru-CeOx interface participates in the entire redox cycle. The Al2O3 with rich unsaturated penta-coordinate Al3+ might be a good support for catalytic total oxidation of other volatile organic compounds.
