Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, MCM-41, SBA-15, VOx, CrOx, or Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document primarily focuses on the catalytic total oxidation of propane using Ru-CeOx supported on nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 catalysts. It does not discuss the performance, structural properties, or reaction mechanisms of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions. The literature also does not mention lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment in the context of PDH reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

The given literature does not contain any information about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, MCM-41, SBA-15, VOx, or CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on alumina-supported Ru-CeOx catalysts for propane total oxidation, which is a different reaction. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of OMS catalysts' performance in PDH reactions or compare them to traditional metal oxide supports based on this literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>
