[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[3] "However, in the present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[4] "In contrast, a good dispersion of the Cr species was obtained using a chromium column adsorption process, and the absence of the isolated state of Cr(VI) species on this sample contributed to high activity toward PDH process."

[5] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

The literature primarily focuses on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing various Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41, as a mesoporous silica-based material with high surface area and uniform pore size, is preferentially used as a support for catalyst preparation.

2. Catalytic behavior: The study reveals that isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, rather than Cr(III) species, lead to decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process. This contradicts previous assumptions about the role of Cr species in these catalysts.

3. Advantages: When good dispersion of Cr species is achieved (e.g., using a chromium column adsorption process), and isolated Cr(VI) species are absent, the catalyst shows high activity toward the PDH process.

4. Limitations: High Cr loadings can lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce and negatively impact catalyst performance.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is responsible for the activity of the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. Influence of lattice oxygen species: The study doesn't directly address this, but it mentions that the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g., Cr(VI)) seems necessary for producing active Cr sites.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed in terms of pretreatment, H2-TPR was used to characterize the catalysts and identify different Cr species.

8. Deactivation: The study notes that catalyst deactivation occurs within the initial 40 minutes of the reaction, attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation.

This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly regarding the role of isolated Cr(VI) species. However, it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other OMS catalysts or traditional metal oxide supports.

这项研究主要关注Cr/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而不是比较各种金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得出一些见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41作为一种具有高比表面积和均匀孔径的介孔二氧化硅基材料，被优先用作催化剂制备的载体。

2. 催化行为：研究表明，Cr/MCM-41催化剂中的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而不是Cr(III)物种，导致PDH过程中丙烷转化活性降低和C3H6选择性较低。这与之前对这些催化剂中Cr物种作用的假设相矛盾。

3. 优势：当实现了Cr物种的良好分散（例如，使用铬柱吸附过程），且不存在孤立的Cr(VI)物种时，催化剂对PDH过程表现出高活性。

4. 局限性：高Cr负载可能导致孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成，这些物种难以被还原，并对催化剂性能产生负面影响。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，活性Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环负责脱氢反应的活性。

6. 晶格氧物种的影响：研究没有直接讨论这一点，但提到高价态表面Cr物种（如Cr(VI)）的存在似乎对产生活性Cr位点是必要的。

7. H2预处理：虽然没有明确讨论预处理，但H2-TPR被用于表征催化剂并识别不同的Cr物种。

8. 失活：研究指出，催化剂失活发生在反应的最初40分钟内，这归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和积碳形成。

这项研究为理解Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的行为提供了宝贵的见解，特别是关于孤立Cr(VI)物种的作用。然而，它没有提供与其他OMS催化剂或传统金属氧化物载体的全面比较。
