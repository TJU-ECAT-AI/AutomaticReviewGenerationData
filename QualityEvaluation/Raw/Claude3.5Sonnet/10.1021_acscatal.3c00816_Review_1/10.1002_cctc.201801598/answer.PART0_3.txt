[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[3] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[4] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[5] "The high amount of OH groups allows us to expect a better stability of the catalyst by suppressing the coke deposition during the reaction."

The literature focuses specifically on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than providing a broad comparison of different metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support due to its high surface area and uniform pore size, which are advantageous for catalyst preparation.

2. Catalytic behavior: The performance of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions depends on the Cr loading. The 10Cr/MCM-41 catalyst showed the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour of reaction.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The study reveals that isolated Cr(VI) species, rather than Cr(III) species, are formed at high Cr loadings. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce and lead to decreased activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

4. Lattice oxygen species: The study does not directly address the role of lattice oxygen species. However, it mentions that the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups at high Cr loadings affects catalyst performance.

5. H2 pretreatment: While H2-TPR was used for characterization, the study does not discuss H2 pretreatment effects on catalyst performance.

6. Catalyst deactivation: The formation of coke deposits is mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst stability. Higher amounts of surface OH groups are associated with better catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition.

7. Advantages and limitations: MCM-41 supported Cr catalysts show good activity for PDH reactions at moderate Cr loadings. However, at high loadings, the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species limits catalyst performance.

The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly regarding the unexpected formation of isolated Cr(VI) species at high loadings and their impact on catalyst performance.

该文献特别关注了Cr/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而不是对不同金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂进行广泛比较。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41被用作支撑材料，因为它具有高比表面积和均匀的孔径，这对催化剂制备有利。

2. 催化行为：Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的性能取决于Cr的负载量。10Cr/MCM-41催化剂表现最佳，反应1小时后丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%。

3. 反应机理：研究发现，在高Cr负载时形成的是孤立的Cr(VI)物种，而不是Cr(III)物种。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种难以还原，导致PDH反应活性和选择性降低。

4. 晶格氧物种：研究没有直接讨论晶格氧物种的作用。但是，它提到高Cr负载时二氧化硅表面羟基基团的减少会影响催化剂性能。

5. H2预处理：虽然使用了H2-TPR进行表征，但研究没有讨论H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。

6. 催化剂失活：提到焦炭沉积是影响催化剂稳定性的一个因素。较高数量的表面OH基团与更好的催化剂稳定性相关，因为它可以抑制焦炭沉积。

7. 优势和局限性：在适度的Cr负载下，MCM-41负载的Cr催化剂对PDH反应表现出良好的活性。然而，在高负载时，孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成限制了催化剂的性能。

这项研究为Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的行为提供了宝贵的见解，特别是关于高负载时意外形成的孤立Cr(VI)物种及其对催化剂性能的影响。
