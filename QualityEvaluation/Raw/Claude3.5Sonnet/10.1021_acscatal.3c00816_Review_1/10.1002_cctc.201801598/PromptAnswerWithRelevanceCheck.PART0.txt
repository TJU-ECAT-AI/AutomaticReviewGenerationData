[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[3] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[4] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[5] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

The literature focuses specifically on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than comparing multiple Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with the best performance achieved by 10Cr/MCM-41 (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: The study identifies isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, which differs from the traditional understanding of Cr(III) species formation at high loadings.

3. Advantages: MCM-41 support allows for the preparation of Cr-based catalysts active in PDH reactions.

4. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings (15%) lead to decreased activity and selectivity, attributed to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species that are difficult to reduce.

5. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests a redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is responsible for catalytic activity.

6. Deactivation: Initial activity decrease is attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation.

The study does not directly compare Cr/MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment is not mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst performance. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Cr species in these catalysts for improving PDH performance.

这篇文献主要研究了Cr/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而不是比较多种金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂。但是，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 性能：Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出活性，其中10Cr/MCM-41表现最佳（1小时后丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%）。

2. 结构特性：研究在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中发现了孤立的Cr(VI)物种，这与传统认知中高负载时形成Cr(III)物种的观点不同。

3. 优势：MCM-41载体可用于制备在PDH反应中具有活性的Cr基催化剂。

4. 局限性：较高的Cr负载（15%）导致活性和选择性降低，这被归因于难以还原的孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环负责催化活性。

6. 失活：初始活性下降被归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和积碳形成。

这项研究没有直接将Cr/MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种的影响。H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响也未被提及。研究强调了理解这些催化剂中Cr物种性质对改善PDH性能的重要性。

The literature primarily focuses on Cr-modified MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing multiple metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts. However, we can analyze the performance of MCM-41 supported CrOx catalysts based on the provided information.

MCM-41 is preferred as a support due to its high surface area and uniform pore size, which allows for better dispersion of metal species. The Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions, with the 10Cr/MCM-41 sample achieving 40% propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour of reaction.

The catalytic behavior of Cr/MCM-41 is influenced by the redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species. This cycle is proposed to be responsible for the activity in dehydrogenation reactions. However, the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce, can cause decreased activity for the PDH process.

Structural properties of MCM-41, such as surface hydroxyl groups, play a crucial role in catalyst performance. A high amount of OH groups is associated with better catalyst stability and suppression of coke deposition during the reaction.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance. However, it is mentioned that the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings can lead to the formation of less active species, which affects catalyst performance.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions is partly attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation during the reaction. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups helps to mitigate this deactivation by suppressing coke deposition.

While the study doesn't extensively compare MCM-41 to other OMS catalysts like SBA-15 or traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that MCM-41-supported CrOx catalysts can be effective for PDH reactions when properly prepared and optimized.

该文献主要关注铬改性MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而不是比较多种金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂。但是，我们可以根据提供的信息分析MCM-41负载的CrOx催化剂的性能。

MCM-41作为载体受到青睐，因为它具有高比表面积和均匀的孔径，这有利于金属物种的更好分散。Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能，其中10Cr/MCM-41样品在反应1小时后达到40%的丙烷转化率和80%的丙烯选择性。

Cr/MCM-41的催化行为受Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环影响。这个循环被认为是脱氢反应活性的主要原因。然而，难以还原的孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成可能导致PDH过程活性降低。

MCM-41的结构特性，如表面羟基，在催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用。大量的OH基团与催化剂更好的稳定性和反应过程中焦炭沉积的抑制有关。

文献没有直接比较传统金属氧化物载体，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。然而，文中提到，在高铬负载时表面羟基的消耗可能导致活性较低的物种形成，从而影响催化剂性能。

PDH反应中催化剂失活部分归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和反应过程中的焦炭形成。表面羟基的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭沉积来减缓这种失活。

虽然该研究没有广泛比较MCM-41与其他OMS催化剂（如SBA-15）或传统金属氧化物载体，但它表明，当经过适当制备和优化时，MCM-41负载的CrOx催化剂可以在PDH反应中表现出良好的效果。

The literature primarily focuses on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing various Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41, as a mesoporous silica-based material with high surface area and uniform pore size, is preferentially used as a support for catalyst preparation.

2. Catalytic behavior: The study reveals that isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, rather than Cr(III) species, lead to decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process. This contradicts previous assumptions about the role of Cr species in these catalysts.

3. Advantages: When good dispersion of Cr species is achieved (e.g., using a chromium column adsorption process), and isolated Cr(VI) species are absent, the catalyst shows high activity toward the PDH process.

4. Limitations: High Cr loadings can lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce and negatively impact catalyst performance.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is responsible for the activity of the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. Influence of lattice oxygen species: The study doesn't directly address this, but it mentions that the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g., Cr(VI)) seems necessary for producing active Cr sites.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed in terms of pretreatment, H2-TPR was used to characterize the catalysts and identify different Cr species.

8. Deactivation: The study notes that catalyst deactivation occurs within the initial 40 minutes of the reaction, attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation.

This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly regarding the role of isolated Cr(VI) species. However, it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other OMS catalysts or traditional metal oxide supports.

5. 反应机理：研究表明，活性Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环负责脱氢反应的活性。

6. 晶格氧物种的影响：研究没有直接讨论这一点，但提到高价态表面Cr物种（如Cr(VI)）的存在似乎对产生活性Cr位点是必要的。

7. H2预处理：虽然没有明确讨论预处理，但H2-TPR被用于表征催化剂并识别不同的Cr物种。

8. 失活：研究指出，催化剂失活发生在反应的最初40分钟内，这归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和积碳形成。

这项研究为理解Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的行为提供了宝贵的见解，特别是关于孤立Cr(VI)物种的作用。然而，它没有提供与其他OMS催化剂或传统金属氧化物载体的全面比较。
