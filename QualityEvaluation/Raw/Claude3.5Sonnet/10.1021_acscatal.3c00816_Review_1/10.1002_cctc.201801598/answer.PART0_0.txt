[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[3] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[4] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[5] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

The literature focuses specifically on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than comparing multiple Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with the best performance achieved by 10Cr/MCM-41 (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: The study identifies isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, which differs from the traditional understanding of Cr(III) species formation at high loadings.

3. Advantages: MCM-41 support allows for the preparation of Cr-based catalysts active in PDH reactions.

4. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings (15%) lead to decreased activity and selectivity, attributed to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species that are difficult to reduce.

5. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests a redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is responsible for catalytic activity.

6. Deactivation: Initial activity decrease is attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation.

The study does not directly compare Cr/MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment is not mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst performance. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Cr species in these catalysts for improving PDH performance.

这篇文献主要研究了Cr/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而不是比较多种金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂。但是，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 性能：Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出活性，其中10Cr/MCM-41表现最佳（1小时后丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%）。

2. 结构特性：研究在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中发现了孤立的Cr(VI)物种，这与传统认知中高负载时形成Cr(III)物种的观点不同。

3. 优势：MCM-41载体可用于制备在PDH反应中具有活性的Cr基催化剂。

4. 局限性：较高的Cr负载（15%）导致活性和选择性降低，这被归因于难以还原的孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环负责催化活性。

6. 失活：初始活性下降被归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和积碳形成。

这项研究没有直接将Cr/MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种的影响。H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响也未被提及。研究强调了理解这些催化剂中Cr物种性质对改善PDH性能的重要性。
