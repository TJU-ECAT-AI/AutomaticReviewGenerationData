[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[4] "The high amount of OH groups allows us to expect a better stability of the catalyst by suppressing the coke deposition during the reaction."

[5] "Understanding and investigating the characters of the formed isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts can be used to realize its negative effect on catalytic activity for PDH process, which deserved significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst system."

The literature primarily focuses on Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with the 10Cr/MCM-41 sample demonstrating the best performance (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: MCM-41, as a mesoporous silica support, provides high surface area and uniform pore size, which is beneficial for catalyst preparation.

3. Catalytic behavior: The study reveals that isolated Cr(VI) species, particularly at higher Cr loadings, negatively impact catalytic performance by decreasing propane conversion and propene selectivity.

4. Advantages: MCM-41 supported catalysts offer good dispersion of active species at lower metal loadings.

5. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce and decrease catalytic activity.

6. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests a redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is responsible for PDH activity.

7. Lattice oxygen species: The presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence states (e.g., Cr(VI)) is necessary for producing active Cr sites.

8. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed, H2-TPR results indicate that reduction behavior varies with Cr loading and species distribution.

9. Catalyst deactivation: Coke deposition is mentioned as a factor in catalyst deactivation, with surface hydroxyl groups helping to suppress coke formation.

In conclusion, while the study doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of different OMS supports or VOx catalysts, it offers valuable insights into the behavior of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH reactions, emphasizing the importance of metal loading, species distribution, and support interactions in determining catalytic performance.

该文献主要关注Cr/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从研究中得出一些见解：

1. 性能：Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出活性，其中10Cr/MCM-41样品表现最佳（1小时后丙烷转化率40%，丙烯选择性80%）。

2. 结构特性：MCM-41作为介孔二氧化硅载体，提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔径，有利于催化剂制备。

3. 催化行为：研究表明，孤立的Cr(VI)物种，特别是在较高Cr负载量时，会通过降低丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性而对催化性能产生负面影响。

4. 优势：MCM-41负载的催化剂在较低金属负载量时能够实现活性物种的良好分散。

5. 局限性：较高的Cr负载量导致孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成，这些物种难以还原并降低催化活性。

6. 反应机理：研究表明Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环是PDH活性的原因。

7. 晶格氧物种：存在高价态的氧化表面Cr物种（如Cr(VI)）对于产生活性Cr位点是必要的。

8. H2预处理：虽然没有明确讨论，但H2-TPR结果表明还原行为随Cr负载量和物种分布而变化。

9. 催化剂失活：提到焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的一个因素，表面羟基有助于抑制焦炭形成。

总之，虽然该研究没有提供不同OMS载体或VOx催化剂的全面比较，但它为Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中的行为提供了宝贵的见解，强调了金属负载量、物种分布和载体相互作用在决定催化性能中的重要性。
