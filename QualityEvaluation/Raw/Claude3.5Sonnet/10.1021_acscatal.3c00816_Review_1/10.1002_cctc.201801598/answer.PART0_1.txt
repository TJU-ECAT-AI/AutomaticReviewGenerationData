The literature primarily focuses on Cr-modified MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing multiple metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts. However, we can analyze the performance of MCM-41 supported CrOx catalysts based on the provided information.

MCM-41 is preferred as a support due to its high surface area and uniform pore size, which allows for better dispersion of metal species. The Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show promising performance in PDH reactions, with the 10Cr/MCM-41 sample achieving 40% propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour of reaction.

The catalytic behavior of Cr/MCM-41 is influenced by the redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species. This cycle is proposed to be responsible for the activity in dehydrogenation reactions. However, the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce, can cause decreased activity for the PDH process.

Structural properties of MCM-41, such as surface hydroxyl groups, play a crucial role in catalyst performance. A high amount of OH groups is associated with better catalyst stability and suppression of coke deposition during the reaction.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance. However, it is mentioned that the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings can lead to the formation of less active species, which affects catalyst performance.

Catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions is partly attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation during the reaction. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups helps to mitigate this deactivation by suppressing coke deposition.

While the study doesn't extensively compare MCM-41 to other OMS catalysts like SBA-15 or traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that MCM-41-supported CrOx catalysts can be effective for PDH reactions when properly prepared and optimized.

该文献主要关注铬改性MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而不是比较多种金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂。但是，我们可以根据提供的信息分析MCM-41负载的CrOx催化剂的性能。

MCM-41作为载体受到青睐，因为它具有高比表面积和均匀的孔径，这有利于金属物种的更好分散。Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的性能，其中10Cr/MCM-41样品在反应1小时后达到40%的丙烷转化率和80%的丙烯选择性。

Cr/MCM-41的催化行为受Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环影响。这个循环被认为是脱氢反应活性的主要原因。然而，难以还原的孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成可能导致PDH过程活性降低。

MCM-41的结构特性，如表面羟基，在催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用。大量的OH基团与催化剂更好的稳定性和反应过程中焦炭沉积的抑制有关。

文献没有直接比较传统金属氧化物载体，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。然而，文中提到，在高铬负载时表面羟基的消耗可能导致活性较低的物种形成，从而影响催化剂性能。

PDH反应中催化剂失活部分归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和反应过程中的焦炭形成。表面羟基的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭沉积来减缓这种失活。

虽然该研究没有广泛比较MCM-41与其他OMS催化剂（如SBA-15）或传统金属氧化物载体，但它表明，当经过适当制备和优化时，MCM-41负载的CrOx催化剂可以在PDH反应中表现出良好的效果。
