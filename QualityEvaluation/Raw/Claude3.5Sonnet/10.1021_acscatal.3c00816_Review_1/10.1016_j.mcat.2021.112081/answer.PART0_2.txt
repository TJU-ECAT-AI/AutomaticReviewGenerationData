[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability"

The literature does not specifically discuss MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant information on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH reactions.

The document mentions that platinum-based catalysts supported on mesoporous molecular sieves show better performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports. This is attributed to the ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface area of mesoporous supports.

Among mesoporous materials, SBA-15 is particularly favored for catalysis due to its special pore structure and size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability compared to other materials like SBA-3 and MCM-41.

The literature does not provide specific information on VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 or SBA-15. However, it does mention that Cr/Al2O3 is used in the commercial Catofin process for propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It also does not provide detailed information on reaction mechanisms for these specific catalyst systems.

While the literature does not directly answer all aspects of the question, it suggests that metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts, particularly those based on SBA-15, have advantages over traditional supports for propane dehydrogenation reactions due to their structural properties.

该文献并未具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的应用。但是,它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂用于PDH反应的相关信息。

文献提到,与传统的Al2O3或SiO2载体相比,以介孔分子筛为载体的铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现更好。这归因于介孔载体的有序孔道结构、更高的热稳定性和更大的比表面积。

在介孔材料中,SBA-15由于其特殊的孔道结构和尺寸、更厚的孔壁以及更好的热稳定性,比其他材料如SBA-3和MCM-41更受青睐。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41或SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂的具体信息。但是,它确实提到Cr/Al2O3被用于商业Catofin工艺的丙烷脱氢过程中。

该文献没有讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。它也没有提供这些特定催化剂体系的详细反应机理信息。

虽然文献没有直接回答问题的所有方面,但它表明,由于结构特性的优势,金属有序介孔硅催化剂,特别是基于SBA-15的催化剂,在丙烷脱氢反应中比传统载体具有优势。
