Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. SBA-15 is especially favored due to its special pore structure, pore size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability.

The structural properties of these catalysts offer several advantages:

1. Large specific surface area, which facilitates the migration of carbon deposits and reduces coke formation on active metal sites, thus prolonging catalyst life.

2. Controlled pore size, which affects the redox properties and dispersion of active phases.

3. The ability to incorporate additives like Al to enhance strong acid sites and improve CH bond activation.

4. Support for promoters like Sn, which can prevent Pt nanoparticle aggregation and improve propylene selectivity.

The catalytic behavior of these materials is influenced by several factors:

1. Active phase size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to higher propane conversion rates, both initially and over time.

2. Pore size: It affects the redox properties and dispersion of active phases, with an optimal pore size balancing these factors.

3. Metal dispersion: Higher dispersion typically improves catalyst performance, but may also affect reducibility.

The main limitations and deactivation mechanisms include:

1. Sintering of active metal phases during reaction.
2. Coke deposition, which can be mitigated to some extent by the mesoporous structure.

While the provided literature does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on PDH reactions, it does highlight the importance of redox properties and metal dispersion, which could be affected by these factors. Further research would be needed to fully understand their impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。由于其特殊的孔结构、孔径、更厚的孔壁和更好的热稳定性，SBA-15尤其受青睐。

这些催化剂的结构特性提供了几个优势：

1. 大比表面积，有利于碳沉积物的迁移，减少活性金属位点上的积碳，从而延长催化剂寿命。

2. 可控的孔径，影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度。

3. 能够掺入Al等添加剂，增强强酸位点并改善CH键的活化。

4. 可支持Sn等助剂，防止Pt纳米颗粒聚集并提高丙烯选择性。

这些材料的催化行为受几个因素影响：

1. 活性相尺寸：较小的颗粒尺寸通常会导致更高的丙烷转化率，无论是初始还是长期。

2. 孔径：影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度，最佳孔径需平衡这些因素。

3. 金属分散度：较高的分散度通常能改善催化剂性能，但也可能影响还原性。

主要的局限性和失活机制包括：

1. 反应过程中活性金属相的烧结。
2. 积碳沉积，可通过介孔结构在一定程度上缓解。

虽然提供的文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应的影响，但确实强调了氧化还原性质和金属分散度的重要性，这些可能受到这些因素的影响。需要进一步研究以充分理解它们对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
