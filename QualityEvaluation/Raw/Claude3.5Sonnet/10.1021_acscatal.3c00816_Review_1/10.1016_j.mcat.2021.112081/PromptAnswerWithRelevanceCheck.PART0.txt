<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant information about metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and their performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports.

The document mentions that platinum-based catalysts supported on mesoporous molecular sieves show better performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports. This is attributed to the ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface area of mesoporous supports.

Among mesoporous materials, SBA-15 is favored over others like MCM-41 due to its special pore structure and size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability. These properties make SBA-15 a preferred support for PDH catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information about VOx and CrOx catalysts on OMS supports. However, it mentions that chromium-based catalysts (Cr/Al2O3) are used in commercial PDH processes, although they have lower activity and higher carbon deposition rates compared to platinum-based catalysts.

The document does not discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it does mention that coke deposition and sintering of active sites are major causes of catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions.

To fully answer the question, more specific information about VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports would be needed, as well as details about their reaction mechanisms, the role of lattice oxygen species, and the effects of H2 pretreatment.

该文献并未具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂及其在PDH反应中与传统载体相比的性能的相关信息。

文献提到，与传统的Al2O3或SiO2载体相比，负载在介孔分子筛上的铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现更好。这归因于介孔载体的有序孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更大的比表面积。

在介孔材料中，由于SBA-15具有特殊的孔结构和尺寸、更厚的孔壁以及更好的热稳定性，因此比其他材料（如MCM-41）更受欢迎。这些特性使SBA-15成为PDH催化剂的首选载体。

文献没有提供关于OMS载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂的具体信息。但是，它提到在商业PDH过程中使用铬基催化剂(Cr/Al2O3)，尽管与铂基催化剂相比，它们的活性较低，碳沉积率较高。

文献没有讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，它确实提到焦炭沉积和活性位点烧结是PDH反应中催化剂失活的主要原因。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于MCM-41和SBA-15载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂的具体信息，以及它们的反应机理、晶格氧物种的作用和H2预处理效果的详细信息。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. SBA-15 is especially favored due to its special pore structure, pore size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability.

The structural properties of these catalysts offer several advantages:

1. Large specific surface area, which facilitates the migration of carbon deposits and reduces coke formation on active metal sites, thus prolonging catalyst life.

2. Controlled pore size, which affects the redox properties and dispersion of active phases.

3. The ability to incorporate additives like Al to enhance strong acid sites and improve CH bond activation.

4. Support for promoters like Sn, which can prevent Pt nanoparticle aggregation and improve propylene selectivity.

The catalytic behavior of these materials is influenced by several factors:

1. Active phase size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to higher propane conversion rates, both initially and over time.

2. Pore size: It affects the redox properties and dispersion of active phases, with an optimal pore size balancing these factors.

3. Metal dispersion: Higher dispersion typically improves catalyst performance, but may also affect reducibility.

The main limitations and deactivation mechanisms include:

1. Sintering of active metal phases during reaction.
2. Coke deposition, which can be mitigated to some extent by the mesoporous structure.

While the provided literature does not directly address the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on PDH reactions, it does highlight the importance of redox properties and metal dispersion, which could be affected by these factors. Further research would be needed to fully understand their impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。由于其特殊的孔结构、孔径、更厚的孔壁和更好的热稳定性，SBA-15尤其受青睐。

这些催化剂的结构特性提供了几个优势：

1. 大比表面积，有利于碳沉积物的迁移，减少活性金属位点上的积碳，从而延长催化剂寿命。

2. 可控的孔径，影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度。

3. 能够掺入Al等添加剂，增强强酸位点并改善CH键的活化。

4. 可支持Sn等助剂，防止Pt纳米颗粒聚集并提高丙烯选择性。

这些材料的催化行为受几个因素影响：

1. 活性相尺寸：较小的颗粒尺寸通常会导致更高的丙烷转化率，无论是初始还是长期。

2. 孔径：影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度，最佳孔径需平衡这些因素。

3. 金属分散度：较高的分散度通常能改善催化剂性能，但也可能影响还原性。

主要的局限性和失活机制包括：

1. 反应过程中活性金属相的烧结。
2. 积碳沉积，可通过介孔结构在一定程度上缓解。

虽然提供的文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应的影响，但确实强调了氧化还原性质和金属分散度的重要性，这些可能受到这些因素的影响。需要进一步研究以充分理解它们对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。

The literature provides some insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but does not specifically compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, it does discuss some advantages of mesoporous molecular sieve supports over traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports.

Advantages of OMS supports for PDH catalysts include:
1. Ordered pore structure
2. Higher thermal stability 
3. Higher specific surface area

These properties contribute to better performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The literature focuses mainly on platinum-based catalysts supported on Sn-modified SBA-15 (SSF). It shows that pore size of the support affects:
1. Metal dispersion
2. Reducibility of metal species
3. Catalytic activity  
4. Catalyst deactivation

The optimal pore size was found to be around 8 nm, which provided the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9%. Larger pore sizes led to metal sintering and reduced catalytic performance.

Deactivation mechanisms identified include:
1. Sintering of active metal phase
2. Coke deposition

The literature does not directly discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance. However, it does mention that reduction behavior of the metal species is affected by pore size, which in turn impacts catalytic activity.

While this literature provides some useful insights on OMS-supported catalysts for PDH, it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx and CrOx catalysts or specific comparisons between MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports.

该文献为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂提供了一些见解，但没有具体比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，它确实讨论了介孔分子筛载体相对于传统Al2O3或SiO2载体的一些优势。

OMS载体用于PDH催化剂的优势包括：
1. 有序的孔结构
2. 更高的热稳定性
3. 更高的比表面积

这些特性有助于在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。

该文献主要关注负载在Sn改性SBA-15(SSF)上的铂基催化剂。它表明载体的孔径影响：
1. 金属分散度
2. 金属物种的可还原性
3. 催化活性
4. 催化剂失活

最佳孔径被发现约为8 nm，提供了46.9%的最高初始丙烷转化率。更大的孔径导致金属烧结和催化性能下降。

确定的失活机制包括：
1. 活性金属相的烧结
2. 积碳沉积

该文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。然而，它确实提到金属物种的还原行为受孔径影响，这反过来又影响催化活性。

虽然这篇文献为PDH反应中的OMS负载催化剂提供了一些有用的见解，但它并没有全面地解答问题的所有方面，特别是关于VOx和CrOx催化剂或MCM-41和SBA-15载体之间的具体比较。
