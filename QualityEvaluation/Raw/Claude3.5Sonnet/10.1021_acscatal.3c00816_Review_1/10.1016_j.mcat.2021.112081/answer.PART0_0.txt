[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability"

The literature does not specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant information about metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and their performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports.

The document mentions that platinum-based catalysts supported on mesoporous molecular sieves show better performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports. This is attributed to the ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface area of mesoporous supports.

Among mesoporous materials, SBA-15 is favored over others like MCM-41 due to its special pore structure and size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability. These properties make SBA-15 a preferred support for PDH catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information about VOx and CrOx catalysts on OMS supports. However, it mentions that chromium-based catalysts (Cr/Al2O3) are used in commercial PDH processes, although they have lower activity and higher carbon deposition rates compared to platinum-based catalysts.

The document does not discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. However, it does mention that coke deposition and sintering of active sites are major causes of catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions.

To fully answer the question, more specific information about VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports would be needed, as well as details about their reaction mechanisms, the role of lattice oxygen species, and the effects of H2 pretreatment.

该文献并未具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂及其在PDH反应中与传统载体相比的性能的相关信息。

文献提到，与传统的Al2O3或SiO2载体相比，负载在介孔分子筛上的铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现更好。这归因于介孔载体的有序孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更大的比表面积。

在介孔材料中，由于SBA-15具有特殊的孔结构和尺寸、更厚的孔壁以及更好的热稳定性，因此比其他材料（如MCM-41）更受欢迎。这些特性使SBA-15成为PDH催化剂的首选载体。

文献没有提供关于OMS载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂的具体信息。但是，它提到在商业PDH过程中使用铬基催化剂(Cr/Al2O3)，尽管与铂基催化剂相比，它们的活性较低，碳沉积率较高。

文献没有讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。然而，它确实提到焦炭沉积和活性位点烧结是PDH反应中催化剂失活的主要原因。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于MCM-41和SBA-15载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂的具体信息，以及它们的反应机理、晶格氧物种的作用和H2预处理效果的详细信息。
