The literature does not directly compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant information on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and traditional supports for PDH reactions:

Metal-OMS catalysts, particularly those based on SBA-15, show better performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports. This is attributed to their ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface area.

Among mesoporous materials, SBA-15 is preferred for catalysis due to its special pore structure and size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability compared to materials like SBA-3 and MCM-41.

The main catalysts discussed for commercial PDH processes are Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used due to their higher activity and lower carbon deposition rates compared to chromium-based catalysts, despite higher costs.

The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance. However, it mentions that catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by sintering of the active phase and coke deposition.

While the document does not provide direct comparisons of VOx and CrOx on MCM-41 and SBA-15 for PDH reactions, it suggests that SBA-15 supported catalysts may offer advantages in terms of stability and performance due to their superior structural properties.

该文献并未直接比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而,它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂和PDH反应传统载体的相关信息:

金属-OMS催化剂,特别是基于SBA-15的催化剂,在PDH反应中表现出比传统Al2O3或SiO2载体更好的性能。这归因于它们的有序孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更大的比表面积。

在介孔材料中,SBA-15因其特殊的孔结构和尺寸、更厚的孔壁以及比SBA-3和MCM-41等材料更好的热稳定性而在催化领域备受青睐。

文献讨论的主要商业PDH过程催化剂是Cr/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3。铂基催化剂因其较高的活性和较低的积碳速率而被广泛使用,尽管成本较高。

文献并未具体讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。然而,它提到催化剂失活主要是由活性相的烧结和积碳沉积造成的。

虽然该文档没有直接比较VOx和CrOx在MCM-41和SBA-15上用于PDH反应的性能,但它表明SBA-15负载的催化剂可能由于其优越的结构特性而在稳定性和性能方面提供优势。
