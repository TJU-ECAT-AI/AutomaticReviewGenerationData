[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Comparing with the bare supports, the lost surface area followed the decreasing order: PtIn/SSF#5 (9.7%) > PtIn/SSF#8 (6.0%) > PtIn/SSF#11 (4.0%) > PtIn/SSF#14 (0.5%)."

[6] "The highest initial propane conversion of 46.9% was achieved on PtSn/SSF#8. Additionally, the pore size of catalyst also showed its impacts on catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition."

The literature provides some insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but does not specifically compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. However, it does discuss some advantages of mesoporous molecular sieve supports over traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports.

Advantages of OMS supports for PDH catalysts include:
1. Ordered pore structure
2. Higher thermal stability 
3. Higher specific surface area

These properties contribute to better performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

The literature focuses mainly on platinum-based catalysts supported on Sn-modified SBA-15 (SSF). It shows that pore size of the support affects:
1. Metal dispersion
2. Reducibility of metal species
3. Catalytic activity  
4. Catalyst deactivation

The optimal pore size was found to be around 8 nm, which provided the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9%. Larger pore sizes led to metal sintering and reduced catalytic performance.

Deactivation mechanisms identified include:
1. Sintering of active metal phase
2. Coke deposition

The literature does not directly discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance. However, it does mention that reduction behavior of the metal species is affected by pore size, which in turn impacts catalytic activity.

While this literature provides some useful insights on OMS-supported catalysts for PDH, it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx and CrOx catalysts or specific comparisons between MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports.

该文献为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂提供了一些见解，但没有具体比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，它确实讨论了介孔分子筛载体相对于传统Al2O3或SiO2载体的一些优势。

OMS载体用于PDH催化剂的优势包括：
1. 有序的孔结构
2. 更高的热稳定性
3. 更高的比表面积

这些特性有助于在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更好的性能。

该文献主要关注负载在Sn改性SBA-15(SSF)上的铂基催化剂。它表明载体的孔径影响：
1. 金属分散度
2. 金属物种的可还原性
3. 催化活性
4. 催化剂失活

最佳孔径被发现约为8 nm，提供了46.9%的最高初始丙烷转化率。更大的孔径导致金属烧结和催化性能下降。

确定的失活机制包括：
1. 活性金属相的烧结
2. 积碳沉积

该文献没有直接讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响。然而，它确实提到金属物种的还原行为受孔径影响，这反过来又影响催化活性。

虽然这篇文献为PDH反应中的OMS负载催化剂提供了一些有用的见解，但它并没有全面地解答问题的所有方面，特别是关于VOx和CrOx催化剂或MCM-41和SBA-15载体之间的具体比较。
