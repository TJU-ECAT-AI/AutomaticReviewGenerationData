    "QuestionEnglish": "Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?",
    "QuestionChinese": "分析金属-有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。比较它们的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物载体的差异，讨论其优势、局限性和反应机理。诸如晶格氧物种和氢气预处理等因素如何影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活？"
