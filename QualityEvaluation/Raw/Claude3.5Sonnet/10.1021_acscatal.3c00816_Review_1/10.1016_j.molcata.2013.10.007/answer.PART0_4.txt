[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text only briefly mentions SBA-15 as one of the supports used for bimetallic PtSn catalysts, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts, MCM-41, or detailed comparisons with traditional metal oxide supports.

The document states that SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is described as disadvantageous to the reaction. However, it does not provide information on the specific advantages, limitations, or reaction mechanisms of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions.

The literature does not discuss factors such as lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment, nor does it provide information on catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions for the mentioned catalysts.

Given the limited relevant information in the provided text, a comprehensive analysis of OMS catalysts' performance in PDH reactions cannot be provided based solely on this literature.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现问题。文本仅简单提到SBA-15是用于双金属PtSn催化剂的支撑材料之一，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂、MCM-41，也没有详细比较传统金属氧化物支撑材料。

文献指出，SBA-15支撑材料导致金属颗粒的聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这被描述为对反应不利。然而，它没有提供OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的具体优势、局限性或反应机理的信息。

文献没有讨论晶格氧物种或氢气预处理等因素，也没有提供所提到的催化剂在PDH反应中的失活信息。

鉴于所提供文本中相关信息有限，仅基于这份文献无法提供OMS催化剂在PDH反应中性能的全面分析。
