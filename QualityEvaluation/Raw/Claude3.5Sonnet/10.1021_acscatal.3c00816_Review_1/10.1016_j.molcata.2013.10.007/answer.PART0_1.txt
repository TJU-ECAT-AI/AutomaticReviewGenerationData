[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke. Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

[3] "Mesoporous alumina supported catalyst exhibits the highest reaction stability and selectivity."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

From the limited information available, we can note that:

1. The study compared PtSn catalysts on different supports, including SBA-15, ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, and mesoporous alumina for propane dehydrogenation.

2. SBA-15 as a support led to agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which was considered disadvantageous for the reaction.

3. Mesoporous alumina supported catalyst showed the best performance in terms of reaction stability and selectivity.

4. Strong acid sites in ZSM-5 caused more cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increased coke accumulation.

The document does not provide information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions. It also lacks details on the advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。文本主要关注不同材料负载的双金属PtSn催化剂，包括SBA-15，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

从有限的可用信息中，我们可以注意到：

1. 该研究比较了不同载体（包括SBA-15、ZSM-5、γ-Al2O3和介孔氧化铝）上的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的表现。

2. SBA-15作为载体导致金属粒子团聚和锡物种容易还原，这被认为对反应不利。

3. 介孔氧化铝负载的催化剂在反应稳定性和选择性方面表现最佳。

4. ZSM-5中的强酸位导致更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性增加了积碳。

该文档没有提供关于MCM-41、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。它也缺乏OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体相比的优势和局限性的详细信息。
