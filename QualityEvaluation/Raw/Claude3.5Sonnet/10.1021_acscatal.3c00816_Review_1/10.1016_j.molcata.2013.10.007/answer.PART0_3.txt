[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

[3] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."

[4] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and VOx and CrOx supported on SBA-15, for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

The document mentions that the support material significantly influences the catalytic structure and performance. For SBA-15 specifically, it notes that this support leads to agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous for the reaction. This suggests potential limitations for SBA-15 as a support in PDH reactions.

The study emphasizes that the choice of support determines the porous character and acidic properties of the catalyst. It mentions that strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induce more cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases coke accumulation. These observations highlight how different supports can affect catalyst behavior and reaction pathways.

However, the literature does not provide information on lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH. It also does not compare the performance of OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports in detail. The study's focus is primarily on PtSn catalysts rather than VOx or CrOx catalysts.

Given the limited information provided in this specific literature, a comprehensive analysis of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly regarding their advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms compared to traditional supports, cannot be fully addressed.

该文献没有对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和负载在SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行全面分析。该研究主要关注负载在不同材料（包括SBA-15）上的双金属PtSn催化剂，但并未讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

文献提到，载体材料对催化剂结构和性能有显著影响。具体对于SBA-15，文献指出这种载体导致金属颗粒团聚和锡物种易还原，这对反应不利。这表明SBA-15作为PDH反应的载体可能存在一些局限性。

研究强调，载体的选择决定了催化剂的孔隙特性和酸性。它提到ZSM-5中的强酸性位会引起更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性会增加积炭。这些观察突出了不同载体如何影响催化剂行为和反应途径。

然而，该文献并未提供关于晶格氧物种、氢气预处理或PDH的具体反应机理的信息。它也没有详细比较OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体的性能。该研究主要关注PtSn催化剂，而非VOx或CrOx催化剂。

鉴于此特定文献提供的信息有限，无法全面回答关于OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的优势、局限性以及与传统载体相比的反应机理等问题。
