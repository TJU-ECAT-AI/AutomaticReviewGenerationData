[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

From the limited information provided, we can only state that SBA-15 was used as one of the supports for PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The use of SBA-15 as a support led to the agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which was found to be disadvantageous for the reaction. 

The document does not provide any information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions. It also does not offer a comparison between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports in terms of structural properties and catalytic behavior.

Given the limited relevant information in the provided literature, a comprehensive analysis of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions cannot be provided based solely on this document.

所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。该文档主要关注不同材料（包括SBA-15）支持的双金属PtSn催化剂，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

从有限的信息中，我们只能说SBA-15被用作丙烷脱氢反应中PtSn催化剂的支持材料之一。使用SBA-15作为支持材料导致金属颗粒的聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这被发现对反应不利。

该文档没有提供关于MCM-41、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的任何信息。它也没有提供OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物支持物在结构特性和催化行为方面的比较。

鉴于所提供文献中相关信息有限，仅基于该文档无法提供PDH反应中OMS催化剂的全面分析。
