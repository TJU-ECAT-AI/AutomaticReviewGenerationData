[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."

[3] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

The literature mentions that different supports, including SBA-15, influence the catalytic structure and reaction performance of PtSn catalysts. It states that the support determines the porous character and acidic properties of the catalyst. However, for SBA-15 specifically, the document notes that its use leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is described as disadvantageous to the reaction.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions. It also does not offer a comprehensive comparison between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions.

Given the limited relevant information in the provided literature, a complete analysis of OMS catalysts' performance in PDH reactions cannot be provided based solely on this document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现问题。该文档主要讨论了不同材料（包括SBA-15）负载的双金属PtSn催化剂，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

文献提到不同的载体，包括SBA-15，会影响PtSn催化剂的催化结构和反应性能。它指出载体决定了催化剂的孔隙特性和酸性。然而，对于SBA-15特别而言，文档指出其使用导致金属颗粒的聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这被描述为对反应不利。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。它也没有提供OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体在PDH反应中的全面比较。

鉴于所提供文献中相关信息有限，仅基于此文档无法提供OMS催化剂在PDH反应中性能的完整分析。

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

From the limited information available, we can note that:

1. The study compared PtSn catalysts on different supports, including SBA-15, ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, and mesoporous alumina for propane dehydrogenation.

2. SBA-15 as a support led to agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which was considered disadvantageous for the reaction.

3. Mesoporous alumina supported catalyst showed the best performance in terms of reaction stability and selectivity.

4. Strong acid sites in ZSM-5 caused more cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increased coke accumulation.

The document does not provide information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions. It also lacks details on the advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。文本主要关注不同材料负载的双金属PtSn催化剂，包括SBA-15，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

从有限的可用信息中，我们可以注意到：

1. 该研究比较了不同载体（包括SBA-15、ZSM-5、γ-Al2O3和介孔氧化铝）上的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的表现。

2. SBA-15作为载体导致金属粒子团聚和锡物种容易还原，这被认为对反应不利。

3. 介孔氧化铝负载的催化剂在反应稳定性和选择性方面表现最佳。

4. ZSM-5中的强酸位导致更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性增加了积碳。

该文档没有提供关于MCM-41、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。它也缺乏OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体相比的优势和局限性的详细信息。

The document focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

From the limited information provided, we can only state that SBA-15 was used as one of the supports for PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The use of SBA-15 as a support led to the agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which was found to be disadvantageous for the reaction. 

The document does not provide any information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and VOx and CrOx supported on SBA-15, for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

The document mentions that the support material significantly influences the catalytic structure and performance. For SBA-15 specifically, it notes that this support leads to agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous for the reaction. This suggests potential limitations for SBA-15 as a support in PDH reactions.

The study emphasizes that the choice of support determines the porous character and acidic properties of the catalyst. It mentions that strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induce more cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases coke accumulation. These observations highlight how different supports can affect catalyst behavior and reaction pathways.

However, the literature does not provide information on lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH. It also does not compare the performance of OMS catalysts to traditional metal oxide supports in detail. The study's focus is primarily on PtSn catalysts rather than VOx or CrOx catalysts.

Given the limited information provided in this specific literature, a comprehensive analysis of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly regarding their advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms compared to traditional supports, cannot be fully addressed.

该文献没有对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和负载在SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行全面分析。该研究主要关注负载在不同材料（包括SBA-15）上的双金属PtSn催化剂，但并未讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

文献提到，载体材料对催化剂结构和性能有显著影响。具体对于SBA-15，文献指出这种载体导致金属颗粒团聚和锡物种易还原，这对反应不利。这表明SBA-15作为PDH反应的载体可能存在一些局限性。

研究强调，载体的选择决定了催化剂的孔隙特性和酸性。它提到ZSM-5中的强酸性位会引起更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性会增加积炭。这些观察突出了不同载体如何影响催化剂行为和反应途径。

然而，该文献并未提供关于晶格氧物种、氢气预处理或PDH的具体反应机理的信息。它也没有详细比较OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体的性能。该研究主要关注PtSn催化剂，而非VOx或CrOx催化剂。

鉴于此特定文献提供的信息有限，无法全面回答关于OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的优势、局限性以及与传统载体相比的反应机理等问题。
