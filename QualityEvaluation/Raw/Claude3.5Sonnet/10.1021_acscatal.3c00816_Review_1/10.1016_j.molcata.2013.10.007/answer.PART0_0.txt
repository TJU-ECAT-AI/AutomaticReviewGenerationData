[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."

[2] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."

[3] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different materials, including SBA-15, but does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts.

The literature mentions that different supports, including SBA-15, influence the catalytic structure and reaction performance of PtSn catalysts. It states that the support determines the porous character and acidic properties of the catalyst. However, for SBA-15 specifically, the document notes that its use leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which is described as disadvantageous to the reaction.

The literature does not provide information on MCM-41, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or specific reaction mechanisms for PDH reactions. It also does not offer a comprehensive comparison between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions.

Given the limited relevant information in the provided literature, a complete analysis of OMS catalysts' performance in PDH reactions cannot be provided based solely on this document.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的表现问题。该文档主要讨论了不同材料（包括SBA-15）负载的双金属PtSn催化剂，但没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂。

文献提到不同的载体，包括SBA-15，会影响PtSn催化剂的催化结构和反应性能。它指出载体决定了催化剂的孔隙特性和酸性。然而，对于SBA-15特别而言，文档指出其使用导致金属颗粒的聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这被描述为对反应不利。

文献没有提供关于MCM-41、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或PDH反应的具体反应机理的信息。它也没有提供OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体在PDH反应中的全面比较。

鉴于所提供文献中相关信息有限，仅基于此文档无法提供OMS催化剂在PDH反应中性能的完整分析。
