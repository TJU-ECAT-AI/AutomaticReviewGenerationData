The provided literature does not contain information specifically about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on MCM-41 and Zr-modified MCM-41 for ethane dehydrogenation, rather than propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss VOx or CrOx catalysts, nor does it compare OMS supports to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions. The literature also does not address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided text, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation reactions or compare them to traditional metal oxide supports. The document does not contain the necessary information to address the specific aspects of the question, such as the advantages, limitations, reaction mechanisms, or the influence of factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

提供的文献中没有具体涉及金属有序介孔硅材料(OMS)催化剂,如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的信息。该文档主要讨论了MCM-41和Zr改性MCM-41负载的PtSn催化剂用于乙烷脱氢,而非丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论VOx或CrOx催化剂,也没有比较OMS支撑剂与传统金属氧化物支撑剂在PDH反应中的性能。文献也没有涉及晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。

鉴于所提供的文本中缺乏相关信息,我无法对金属有序介孔硅材料催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能提供全面的答复,也无法将其与传统金属氧化物支撑剂进行比较。该文档不包含回答问题所需的必要信息,如优势、局限性、反应机理,或诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
