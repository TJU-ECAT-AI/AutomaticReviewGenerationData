          "SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

"The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

"PtSn catalysts supported on various materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 have been extensively studied for dehydrogenation of propane"

"The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized."

"As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was more active and could more easily transfer to the support"

"The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support."

"It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and support."

"PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, the initial conversion of propane was 35.7% and then reduced to 27.2% after 6 h reaction."

"The catalytic activity and stability were clearly enhanced when 14 wt.% Mg was introduced into the catalysts."

"PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 prepared by one-pot method exhibited better catalytic activity than PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM."

"The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a maximum initial propane conversion of 43.0% among all the samples."

"Generally, M1 sites were connected with the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and coking, whereas the M2 sites were responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane."

          The literature primarily focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn about the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for stabilizing and dispersing metal nanoparticles like Pt. This helps prevent agglomeration and improves catalyst performance.

2. Advantages: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allows for higher dispersion of metal nanoparticles and better confinement, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional supports like Al2O3 and SiO2.

3. Catalyst performance: PtSn/SBA-15 catalysts show good initial activity for propane dehydrogenation, with conversions around 35-43% depending on the modification. The addition of Mg (1-4 wt%) to SBA-15 enhances catalytic activity and stability.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of Sn as a promoter in PtSn catalysts decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles through a geometric effect. This modification makes it more difficult for hydrocarbons to form multiple carbon-metal bonds, resulting in more active coke precursors that can easily transfer to the support.

5. Influence of support modification: Incorporating Mg into SBA-15 enhances the interaction between metal species (Pt, Sn) and the support, stabilizes the oxidation state of promoters (Sn), and improves overall catalytic performance. It also facilitates the formation of M2 sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Catalyst deactivation: Carbon deposition is a major cause of deactivation. The presence of Mg can facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

While the literature does not directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates the importance of support properties and modifications in influencing metal-support interactions, metal dispersion, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

          该文献主要关注以Mg改性SBA-15为载体的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH），而非MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中性能的见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15具有良好定义的有序介孔结构，适合稳定和分散如Pt等金属纳米粒子。这有助于防止团聚并提高催化剂性能。

2. 优势：SBA-15的有序介孔结构允许更高的金属纳米粒子分散度和更好的限制，与传统载体如Al2O3和SiO2相比，这导致了更好的催化活性和稳定性。

3. 催化剂性能：PtSn/SBA-15催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的初始活性，根据改性程度不同，转化率在35-43%左右。向SBA-15中添加Mg（1-4 wt%）可以提高催化活性和稳定性。

4. 反应机理：在PtSn催化剂中，Sn作为助剂通过几何效应减小了表面Pt集合体的尺寸。这种修饰使碳氢化合物更难形成多重碳-金属键，结果是生成更活跃的焦炭前体，可以容易地转移到载体上。

5. 载体改性的影响：将Mg引入SBA-15增强了金属物种（Pt，Sn）与载体之间的相互作用，稳定了助剂（Sn）的氧化态，并改善了整体催化性能。它还促进了负责丙烷脱氢的M2位点的形成。

6. 催化剂失活：碳沉积是失活的主要原因。Mg的存在可以促进碳沉积物从活性金属位点转移到载体上，可能改善催化剂寿命。

虽然文献没有直接涉及VOx和CrOx催化剂的晶格氧物种或H2预处理，但它证明了载体性质和改性在影响金属-载体相互作用、金属分散度和PDH反应中催化剂稳定性方面的重要性。
