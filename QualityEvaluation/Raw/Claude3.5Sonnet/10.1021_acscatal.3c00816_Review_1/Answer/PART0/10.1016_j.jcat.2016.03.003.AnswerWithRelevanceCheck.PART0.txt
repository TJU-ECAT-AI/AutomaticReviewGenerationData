          [1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Combining these results with the UVvis spectra in Fig. 1 we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al."

[5] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

[6] "Analyzing specific surface areas of the supports and V loading on the respective catalysts, one can notice that SiO2 with SBET of 900 m2 g1 anchored lower absolute amount of V than SiO2Al2O3 materials with SBET ranging between 255 and 475 m2 g1."

          The literature provides insights into the performance of VOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and other mesoporous materials for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed good activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions.

2. When extended to aluminosilicate supports, the catalysts achieved propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (only 25% lower).

3. The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization degree, with the order determined to be: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed higher initial propene selectivity (~90%) compared to VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports (<80%).

5. The high surface area of MCM-41 (900 m2/g) allowed for lower vanadium loading compared to SiO2-Al2O3 materials (255-475 m2/g), which may impact catalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, SBA-15 supports, the role of lattice oxygen species, or the effects of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

          该文献对VOx催化剂负载在MCM-41和其他介孔材料上用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的性能提供了一些见解：

1. 通过将钒酰乙酰丙酮接枝到MCM-41二氧化硅上制备的VOx/MCM-41催化剂在氧化和非氧化条件下都表现出良好的丙烷脱氢活性和选择性。

2. 当这种制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体时，得到的催化剂的丙烯产率接近工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂（仅低25%）。

3. VOx物种的聚合度影响催化剂性能。使用UV-vis和拉曼光谱来表征聚合度，确定的顺序为：V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al。

4. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，负载在二氧化硅(V/Si)和氧化铝(V/Al)上的VOx显示出较高的初始丙烯选择性(~90%)，而负载在SiO2-Al2O3载体上的VOx选择性较低(<80%)。

5. MCM-41的高比表面积（900 m2/g）允许更低的钒负载量，相比于SiO2-Al2O3材料（255-475 m2/g），这可能会影响催化行为。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx催化剂、SBA-15载体、晶格氧物种的作用，或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响等具体信息。需要进行更全面的研究才能充分解答这些问题的方面。
