          [1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."

[4] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[5] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[6] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

[8] "The high amount of OH groups allows us to expect a better stability of the catalyst by suppressing the coke deposition during the reaction."

          The literature primarily focuses on Cr-modified MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing multiple Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with 10Cr/MCM-41 demonstrating the best performance (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: MCM-41, characterized by high surface area and uniform pore size, is preferentially used as a support for catalyst preparation.

3. Catalytic behavior: Contrary to previous understanding, isolated Cr(VI) species, rather than Cr(III) species, were identified in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts. These Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce and lead to decreased activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

4. Reaction mechanism: A redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is proposed to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction activity.

5. Advantages: MCM-41 support allows for the preparation of active Cr-based catalysts for PDH reactions, with optimal performance at moderate Cr loadings.

6. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which negatively impact catalyst performance.

7. Deactivation: Initial activity decrease is attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation during the PDH reaction.

8. Stability: A high amount of surface OH groups is associated with better catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition during the reaction.

The study does not directly compare Cr/MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment is not mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst performance. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Cr species in these catalysts for improving PDH performance.

          这篇文献主要关注铬改性MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而不是比较多种金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂。然而，我们可以得出几个重要见解：

1. 性能：Cr/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出活性，其中10Cr/MCM-41表现最佳（1小时后丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%）。

2. 结构特性：MCM-41具有高比表面积和均匀的孔径，被优先用作催化剂制备的载体。

3. 催化行为：与之前的理解相反，在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中发现了孤立的Cr(VI)物种，而不是Cr(III)物种。这些Cr(VI)物种难以还原，导致PDH反应的活性和选择性降低。

4. 反应机理：活性Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的氧化还原循环被认为是脱氢反应活性的原因。

5. 优势：MCM-41载体可用于制备在PDH反应中具有活性的Cr基催化剂，在适度的Cr负载下表现最佳。

6. 局限性：较高的Cr负载导致孤立Cr(VI)物种的形成，这对催化剂性能产生负面影响。

7. 失活：初始活性下降被归因于活性Cr(VI)位点的转化和PDH反应过程中的积碳形成。

8. 稳定性：大量的表面OH基团与催化剂更好的稳定性相关，因为它可以抑制反应过程中的积碳沉积。

这项研究没有直接将Cr/MCM-41与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种的影响。H2预处理对催化剂性能的影响也未被提及。研究强调了理解这些催化剂中Cr物种性质对改善PDH性能的重要性。
