The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions shows several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Structural properties:
   - Ordered pore structure
   - Higher thermal stability
   - Higher specific surface area
   - SBA-15 is particularly favored due to its special pore structure, pore size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - Better performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports
   - Large specific surface area facilitates carbon deposit migration, reducing coke formation on active metal sites and prolonging catalyst life
   - Controlled pore size affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Ability to incorporate additives like Al to enhance strong acid sites and improve CH bond activation
   - Support for promoters like Sn, which can prevent Pt nanoparticle aggregation and improve propylene selectivity

3. Factors influencing performance:
   - Active phase size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to higher propane conversion rates
   - Pore size: Affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Metal dispersion: Higher dispersion typically improves catalyst performance

4. Limitations and deactivation mechanisms:
   - Sintering of active metal phases during reaction
   - Coke deposition, which can be mitigated to some extent by the mesoporous structure

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15 or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it suggests that OMS-supported catalysts, particularly those based on SBA-15, offer advantages in terms of stability and performance for PDH reactions due to their superior structural properties.

The literature primarily focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels. The incorporation of metal species (Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix does not significantly alter the mesoporous characteristics of the support.

2. Catalyst preparation: A one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating Sn into SBA-15 showed better performance compared to the traditional impregnation method. This resulted in stronger interactions between metal species and the support.

3. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH, with 43.8% propane conversion and 98.5% propene selectivity. This performance was superior to that of the traditionally impregnated catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM).

4. Advantages: Metal-OMS catalysts demonstrate improved metal dispersion, enhanced interactions between metal species and support, and better stabilization of active sites. These factors contribute to higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional supports.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests the presence of two types of active sites (M1 and M2) on the catalyst surface. M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.

6. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.

7. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation. Excessive Sn content decreased catalyst stability.

8. H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 at 500°C for 1 hour before the reaction, which likely affected the oxidation state of the metal species and their interactions with the support.

While the study does not directly address lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of metal species in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

The study primarily focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 and HMS supports demonstrated superior vanadia dispersion compared to SBA-15, with isolated monovanadates detected for V loadings up to 8 wt%.

2. Catalytic behavior: HMS and MCM-41 supported catalysts showed the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) with relatively high propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 supported catalysts exhibited lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion.

3. Advantages: High surface area mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS) allowed for highly dispersed monomeric VOx species, even at high V loadings, leading to very active catalysts.

4. Limitations: SBA-15 supported catalysts showed lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure during preparation, resulting in lower vanadia dispersion.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface was found to be the main determinant of catalytic activity towards propene production, rather than pore size, structure, acidity, or reducibility characteristics.

6. Performance: For low vanadium loadings (2-4 wt%), high propene yields of about 16-19% were obtained at 575-600°C, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts.

The study does not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, as it focused on oxidative dehydrogenation. The performance of CrOx catalysts was also not discussed in the provided information.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported CrOx show higher activity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these catalysts differ significantly:

1. Structural properties:
   - SBA-15 at low Cr loading (1 wt%): Contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination.
   - SBA-15 at high Cr loading (5 wt%): Forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles alongside some isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at low loading: Forms oligomers and isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at high loading: Mainly contains oligomers of varying nuclearity without Cr2O3 particles.

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - For SBA-15: Isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are more active, selective, and stable than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals.
   - For Al2O3: Oligomeric Cr species outperform isolated Cr sites in activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction mechanism:
   - Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction.
   - Cr is typically in the (III) oxidation state during the reaction.
   - Isolated Cr(VI) species are immediately reduced to Cr(III) upon interaction with propane, with an increase in coordination number.

4. Advantages of OMS catalysts:
   - Higher activity compared to traditional supports.
   - Ability to stabilize isolated Cr species at low loadings.

5. Limitations:
   - Formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15.

6. Alternative approaches:
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied to overcome challenges with traditional PDH, but has not achieved commercial viability.

The study emphasizes the importance of support nature and Cr loading in determining catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions. However, the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation is not directly addressed in the provided information.

The provided literature does not fully address the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

          Key findings from the study include:

          1. The preparation method and timing of Cr precursor addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance.
          2. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method showed that the Cr adding time affects Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance.
          3. Cr/MSS-2, where the Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity.
          4. In Cr/MSS-1, while showing good CrOx dispersion overall, some CrOx wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity.

          The study does not provide information on traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the specific advantages, limitations, or deactivation of these catalysts in PDH reactions, nor does it compare them to MCM-41 or SBA-15 supported catalysts or VOx-based systems.

The literature does not directly address the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows promising performance in PDH reactions, with a propane conversion of 40% and good stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations. This performance is superior to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation.

The improved stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. Strong bonding that inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic species
2. Stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate

The HMS support offers several advantages:
1. Thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) providing good thermal stability up to 1073 K
2. Short channel length allowing fast diffusion of products
3. Weak acidity promoting quick desorption of olefins, which reduces unwanted secondary reactions

While the literature doesn't discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts or traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that mesoporous silica materials can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The structural properties of HMS, such as its mesoporous nature and thick walls, play a crucial role in stabilizing the active metal species and improving catalytic behavior.

The document does not provide information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high specific surface areas (ca. 780 m2/g), allowing for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. This high dispersion contributes to their catalytic activity and stability.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3, OMS catalysts show several advantages:

1. Higher surface area and better metal dispersion
2. Improved stability and regenerability, especially for VOx/MCM-41
3. Reduced coke formation, leading to more stable performance over longer periods

VOx/MCM-41 exhibits superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3. Key advantages of VOx/MCM-41 include:

1. Excellent time-on-stream stability in multiple DH cycles
2. Full activity recovery through oxidative regeneration
3. Resistance to structural changes under reaction conditions

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species as active sites, with oxidized species being initially more active. Lattice oxygen participates in the early stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing metal oxide species. This slightly improves on-stream stability for VOx/MCM-41 and has a more pronounced effect on CrOx/MCM-41.

The main limitation for all catalysts in PDH reactions is deactivation due to coke deposition. However, OMS-supported catalysts, especially VOx/MCM-41, show better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional supports.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional supports, highlighting the potential of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for this application.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it offers insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly focusing on a novel support called dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs).

Mesoporous silica supports, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, are commonly used for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, high thermal stability, and weak acidity. DMSNs are highlighted as superior to traditional mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their unique central-radial pore structure, which provides:

1. Large pore entrances
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Better accessibility of active sites
5. Faster diffusion of reactants and products in interconnected mesopores

For Sn-based catalysts, DMSNs showed higher catalytic activity (measured by turnover frequency) compared to other silica supports. This was attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs.

The reaction mechanism described involves:
1. Interaction of surface Sn-O-Si bonds with adsorbed propane
2. Hydrogen abstraction by bridging oxygen active sites
3. Formation of isopropyl-Sn intermediates and surface silanol groups
4. β-hydrogen cleavage to produce propene
5. Generation of hydrogen molecules from silanol groups
6. Recovery of Sn-O-Si bonds

Highly dispersed metal oxide species (e.g., SnOx) are identified as more active for propane activation and propylene formation compared to polymeric or crystalline species. The metal-support interaction and local catalyst structure play important roles in performance, with reduction and reaction processes influencing these factors.

While not directly addressing VOx and CrOx catalysts, these insights suggest that the ordered mesoporous structure, metal dispersion, and metal-support interactions are key factors influencing PDH catalyst performance. The literature does not specifically discuss the roles of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for these systems.

The literature primarily focuses on Cr-modified MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing multiple Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with 10Cr/MCM-41 demonstrating the best performance (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: MCM-41, characterized by high surface area and uniform pore size, is preferentially used as a support for catalyst preparation.

3. Catalytic behavior: Contrary to previous understanding, isolated Cr(VI) species, rather than Cr(III) species, were identified in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts. These Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce and lead to decreased activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

4. Reaction mechanism: A redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is proposed to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction activity.

5. Advantages: MCM-41 support allows for the preparation of active Cr-based catalysts for PDH reactions, with optimal performance at moderate Cr loadings.

6. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which negatively impact catalyst performance.

7. Deactivation: Initial activity decrease is attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation during the PDH reaction.

8. Stability: A high amount of surface OH groups is associated with better catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition during the reaction.

The study does not directly compare Cr/MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment is not mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst performance. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Cr species in these catalysts for improving PDH performance.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their main advantages stem from their well-defined porous structure, large surface area, and ability to highly disperse active metal species.

Structural properties:
1. High surface area and well-defined pore structure
2. Better dispersion of active metal species
3. Enhanced stability due to the ordered mesoporous structure

Catalytic behavior:
1. CrOx/MCM-41: High Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to inactive Cr(III) species. Optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.
2. VOx/SiO2: Low polymeric VOx species act as the major active centers. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion are critical for excellent PDH performance.

Advantages over traditional supports:
1. Better control over metal dispersion and pore structure
2. Improved optimization of active site accessibility
3. Enhanced reactant/product diffusion

Limitations:
1. Potential pore blockage due to coke formation
2. Possible metal leaching under harsh reaction conditions
3. Need for careful optimization of metal loading and preparation methods

Reaction mechanism:
The mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of supported metal oxide species (V or Cr), with lattice oxygen participating in hydrogen abstraction from propane. Regeneration of reduced metal sites occurs through gas-phase oxygen or lattice oxygen migration.

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation:
1. Lattice oxygen species: Play a crucial role in the redox cycle and overall catalytic activity
2. H2 pretreatment: Can enhance metal-support interactions, improving stability and anti-coking properties
3. Surface acidity: Higher acidity leads to increased coking tendency
4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions enhance stability and resist sintering

Catalyst deactivation:
1. Primarily due to coke formation and sintering of active metal species
2. The ordered porous structure may help mitigate sintering to some extent
3. Controlling surface acidity and optimizing metal-support interactions are key to minimizing coke formation and maintaining long-term catalyst stability

In conclusion, while OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show great potential for PDH reactions, careful optimization of catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.

The literature primarily focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn about the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for stabilizing and dispersing metal nanoparticles like Pt. This helps prevent agglomeration and improves catalyst performance.

2. Advantages: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allows for higher dispersion of metal nanoparticles and better confinement, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional supports like Al2O3 and SiO2.

3. Catalyst performance: PtSn/SBA-15 catalysts show good initial activity for propane dehydrogenation, with conversions around 35-43% depending on the modification. The addition of Mg (1-4 wt%) to SBA-15 enhances catalytic activity and stability.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of Sn as a promoter in PtSn catalysts decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles through a geometric effect. This modification makes it more difficult for hydrocarbons to form multiple carbon-metal bonds, resulting in more active coke precursors that can easily transfer to the support.

5. Influence of support modification: Incorporating Mg into SBA-15 enhances the interaction between metal species (Pt, Sn) and the support, stabilizes the oxidation state of promoters (Sn), and improves overall catalytic performance. It also facilitates the formation of M2 sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Catalyst deactivation: Carbon deposition is a major cause of deactivation. The presence of Mg can facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

While the literature does not directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates the importance of support properties and modifications in influencing metal-support interactions, metal dispersion, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, it provides insights into the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support for cobalt catalysts, providing confined channels for metal species.

2. H2 pretreatment influence: Hydrogen prereduction significantly affects catalyst performance by tuning the interaction between metal species and the silica support. It causes multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species.

3. Catalyst performance: Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters in MCM-41 channels.

4. Deactivation: Higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition.

5. Reaction mechanism: The performance of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is determined by propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation, which are influenced by the metal-support interaction.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction can tune the interaction between metal species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in PDH reactions. This highlights the importance of optimizing pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired catalyst performance.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined structure of MCM-41 plays a role in the catalyst's performance by limiting the size of metal clusters and influencing metal-support interactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The main advantages include:

1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity, performing similarly to industrial CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Improved structural properties: MCM-41 allows for highly dispersed VOx species, which contributes to enhanced catalytic behavior.

3. Active sites: V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with Lewis acidity increasing as the number of V-O-V bonds decreases.

4. Resistance to deactivation: Isolated VOx species show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species.

The reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes at Lewis-acidic V atoms. Performance is influenced by several factors:

1. VOx site density and dispersion: Isolated VOx sites show higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species.

2. Reduction temperature: Increasing reduction and reaction temperatures lead to higher TOF values for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

3. Support effect: MCM-41, as an ordered mesoporous silica support, allows for better control of VOx site density and distribution compared to traditional supports.

Limitations include:

1. Formation of cracking products and coke, although in small amounts.
2. Lower selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation due to increased cracking and isomerization reactions, especially for isolated VOx sites.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites providing the best overall performance due to their higher intrinsic activity and resistance to deactivation.

While the provided answers do not specifically compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), they offer relevant insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: OMS supports like SBA-15 provide high surface area and uniform pore structure, allowing good dispersion of active sites.

2. Catalytic behavior: The nature of the support significantly affects catalytic activity and stability. Addition of promoters can influence reducibility, basicity, surface metal content, and stability of metal particles.

3. Advantages: OMS supports can provide better dispersion of active metal species compared to traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in activating C-H bonds in propane, leading to improved initial catalytic activity and propylene yield.

5. Factors influencing performance:
   - Redox properties
   - Resistance to sintering
   - Resistance to coke deposition
   - Lattice oxygen capacity
   - Acidity/basicity of the support

6. Deactivation: Main causes are sintering of active phases and coke deposition. Acidic supports are more prone to coke formation than neutral or basic ones.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed, catalyst reduction before reaction is mentioned, suggesting the importance of H2 pretreatment in activating the catalyst.

The studies demonstrate that tailoring the composition and properties of metal-OMS catalysts through promoter addition and support modification can significantly improve their performance and stability in PDH reactions.

The literature provides insights into the performance of VOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and other mesoporous materials for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed good activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions.

2. When extended to aluminosilicate supports, the catalysts achieved propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (only 25% lower).

3. The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization degree, with the order determined to be: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed higher initial propene selectivity (~90%) compared to VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports (<80%).

5. The high surface area of MCM-41 (900 m2/g) allowed for lower vanadium loading compared to SiO2-Al2O3 materials (255-475 m2/g), which may impact catalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, SBA-15 supports, the role of lattice oxygen species, or the effects of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity.

VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of a small amount of CO product in the initial 3 hours of reaction over as-prepared catalysts, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment.

As-prepared (oxidized) VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. This indicates that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in modifying catalyst behavior. It eliminates CO production and affects the oxidation state of the active species, which in turn influences catalyst activity and stability. The balance between high activity (associated with oxidized species) and improved stability (associated with reduced species) is a key consideration in optimizing these catalysts for PDH reactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency.

2. Uniform pore structure: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials has shown higher activity compared to bulk V2O5 or other traditional supports. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of VOx species on the high surface area of OMS supports, leading to a higher number of accessible active sites.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface. Different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, which can affect the overall catalytic performance.

For CrOx-based catalysts, similar principles apply, although the specific reaction mechanisms may differ slightly. The performance of CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is also generally superior to traditional supports like Al2O3.

One of the main limitations of VOx/OMS and CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions shows several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Structural properties:
   - Ordered pore structure
   - Higher thermal stability
   - Higher specific surface area
   - SBA-15 is particularly favored due to its special pore structure, pore size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - Better performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports
   - Large specific surface area facilitates carbon deposit migration, reducing coke formation on active metal sites and prolonging catalyst life
   - Controlled pore size affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Ability to incorporate additives like Al to enhance strong acid sites and improve CH bond activation
   - Support for promoters like Sn, which can prevent Pt nanoparticle aggregation and improve propylene selectivity

3. Factors influencing performance:
   - Active phase size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to higher propane conversion rates
   - Pore size: Affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Metal dispersion: Higher dispersion typically improves catalyst performance

4. Limitations and deactivation mechanisms:
   - Sintering of active metal phases during reaction
   - Coke deposition, which can be mitigated to some extent by the mesoporous structure

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15 or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it suggests that OMS-supported catalysts, particularly those based on SBA-15, offer advantages in terms of stability and performance for PDH reactions due to their superior structural properties.

The literature primarily focuses on Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels. The incorporation of metal species (Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix does not significantly alter the mesoporous characteristics of the support.

2. Catalyst preparation: A one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating Sn into SBA-15 showed better performance compared to the traditional impregnation method. This resulted in stronger interactions between metal species and the support.

3. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH, with 43.8% propane conversion and 98.5% propene selectivity. This performance was superior to that of the traditionally impregnated catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM).

4. Advantages: Metal-OMS catalysts demonstrate improved metal dispersion, enhanced interactions between metal species and support, and better stabilization of active sites. These factors contribute to higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional supports.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests the presence of two types of active sites (M1 and M2) on the catalyst surface. M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.

6. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.

7. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation. Excessive Sn content decreased catalyst stability.

8. H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 at 500°C for 1 hour before the reaction, which likely affected the oxidation state of the metal species and their interactions with the support.

While the study does not directly address lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of metal species in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

The study primarily focuses on vanadia (VOx) catalysts supported on various mesoporous silicas, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rather than propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 and HMS supports demonstrated superior vanadia dispersion compared to SBA-15, with isolated monovanadates detected for V loadings up to 8 wt%.

2. Catalytic behavior: HMS and MCM-41 supported catalysts showed the best performance, achieving high propane conversions (35-40%) with relatively high propene selectivities (35-47%). SBA-15 supported catalysts exhibited lower activity due to lower vanadia dispersion.

3. Advantages: High surface area mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, HMS) allowed for highly dispersed monomeric VOx species, even at high V loadings, leading to very active catalysts.

4. Limitations: SBA-15 supported catalysts showed lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure during preparation, resulting in lower vanadia dispersion.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface was found to be the main determinant of catalytic activity towards propene production, rather than pore size, structure, acidity, or reducibility characteristics.

6. Performance: For low vanadium loadings (2-4 wt%), high propene yields of about 16-19% were obtained at 575-600°C, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts.

The study does not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, as it focused on oxidative dehydrogenation. The performance of CrOx catalysts was also not discussed in the provided information.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported CrOx show higher activity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these catalysts differ significantly:

1. Structural properties:
   - SBA-15 at low Cr loading (1 wt%): Contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination.
   - SBA-15 at high Cr loading (5 wt%): Forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles alongside some isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at low loading: Forms oligomers and isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at high loading: Mainly contains oligomers of varying nuclearity without Cr2O3 particles.

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - For SBA-15: Isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are more active, selective, and stable than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals.
   - For Al2O3: Oligomeric Cr species outperform isolated Cr sites in activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction mechanism:
   - Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction.
   - Cr is typically in the (III) oxidation state during the reaction.
   - Isolated Cr(VI) species are immediately reduced to Cr(III) upon interaction with propane, with an increase in coordination number.

4. Advantages of OMS catalysts:
   - Higher activity compared to traditional supports.
   - Ability to stabilize isolated Cr species at low loadings.

5. Limitations:
   - Formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15.

6. Alternative approaches:
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied to overcome challenges with traditional PDH, but has not achieved commercial viability.

The study emphasizes the importance of support nature and Cr loading in determining catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions. However, the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation is not directly addressed in the provided information.

The provided literature does not fully address the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

          Key findings from the study include:

          1. The preparation method and timing of Cr precursor addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance.
          2. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method showed that the Cr adding time affects Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance.
          3. Cr/MSS-2, where the Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity.
          4. In Cr/MSS-1, while showing good CrOx dispersion overall, some CrOx wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity.

          The study does not provide information on traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the specific advantages, limitations, or deactivation of these catalysts in PDH reactions, nor does it compare them to MCM-41 or SBA-15 supported catalysts or VOx-based systems.

The literature does not directly address the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The Sn-HMS catalyst shows promising performance in PDH reactions, with a propane conversion of 40% and good stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations. This performance is superior to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation.

The improved stability of Sn-HMS is attributed to two factors:
1. Strong bonding that inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic species
2. Stabilization of Sn species by the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate

The HMS support offers several advantages:
1. Thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) providing good thermal stability up to 1073 K
2. Short channel length allowing fast diffusion of products
3. Weak acidity promoting quick desorption of olefins, which reduces unwanted secondary reactions

While the literature doesn't discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts or traditional metal oxide supports, it demonstrates that mesoporous silica materials can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The structural properties of HMS, such as its mesoporous nature and thick walls, play a crucial role in stabilizing the active metal species and improving catalytic behavior.

The document does not provide information on the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high specific surface areas (ca. 780 m2/g), allowing for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. This high dispersion contributes to their catalytic activity and stability.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3, OMS catalysts show several advantages:

1. Higher surface area and better metal dispersion
2. Improved stability and regenerability, especially for VOx/MCM-41
3. Reduced coke formation, leading to more stable performance over longer periods

VOx/MCM-41 exhibits superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3. Key advantages of VOx/MCM-41 include:

1. Excellent time-on-stream stability in multiple DH cycles
2. Full activity recovery through oxidative regeneration
3. Resistance to structural changes under reaction conditions

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species as active sites, with oxidized species being initially more active. Lattice oxygen participates in the early stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing metal oxide species. This slightly improves on-stream stability for VOx/MCM-41 and has a more pronounced effect on CrOx/MCM-41.

The main limitation for all catalysts in PDH reactions is deactivation due to coke deposition. However, OMS-supported catalysts, especially VOx/MCM-41, show better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional supports.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional supports, highlighting the potential of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for this application.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it offers insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly focusing on a novel support called dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs).

Mesoporous silica supports, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, are commonly used for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, high thermal stability, and weak acidity. DMSNs are highlighted as superior to traditional mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their unique central-radial pore structure, which provides:

1. Large pore entrances
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Better accessibility of active sites
5. Faster diffusion of reactants and products in interconnected mesopores

For Sn-based catalysts, DMSNs showed higher catalytic activity (measured by turnover frequency) compared to other silica supports. This was attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs.

The reaction mechanism described involves:
1. Interaction of surface Sn-O-Si bonds with adsorbed propane
2. Hydrogen abstraction by bridging oxygen active sites
3. Formation of isopropyl-Sn intermediates and surface silanol groups
4. β-hydrogen cleavage to produce propene
5. Generation of hydrogen molecules from silanol groups
6. Recovery of Sn-O-Si bonds

Highly dispersed metal oxide species (e.g., SnOx) are identified as more active for propane activation and propylene formation compared to polymeric or crystalline species. The metal-support interaction and local catalyst structure play important roles in performance, with reduction and reaction processes influencing these factors.

While not directly addressing VOx and CrOx catalysts, these insights suggest that the ordered mesoporous structure, metal dispersion, and metal-support interactions are key factors influencing PDH catalyst performance. The literature does not specifically discuss the roles of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for these systems.

The literature primarily focuses on Cr-modified MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than comparing multiple Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts. However, several insights can be drawn:

1. Performance: Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show activity in PDH reactions, with 10Cr/MCM-41 demonstrating the best performance (40% propane conversion, 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour).

2. Structural properties: MCM-41, characterized by high surface area and uniform pore size, is preferentially used as a support for catalyst preparation.

3. Catalytic behavior: Contrary to previous understanding, isolated Cr(VI) species, rather than Cr(III) species, were identified in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts. These Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce and lead to decreased activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

4. Reaction mechanism: A redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species is proposed to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction activity.

5. Advantages: MCM-41 support allows for the preparation of active Cr-based catalysts for PDH reactions, with optimal performance at moderate Cr loadings.

6. Limitations: Higher Cr loadings lead to the formation of isolated Cr(VI) species, which negatively impact catalyst performance.

7. Deactivation: Initial activity decrease is attributed to the conversion of active Cr(VI) sites and coke formation during the PDH reaction.

8. Stability: A high amount of surface OH groups is associated with better catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition during the reaction.

The study does not directly compare Cr/MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment is not mentioned as a factor affecting catalyst performance. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Cr species in these catalysts for improving PDH performance.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their main advantages stem from their well-defined porous structure, large surface area, and ability to highly disperse active metal species.

Structural properties:
1. High surface area and well-defined pore structure
2. Better dispersion of active metal species
3. Enhanced stability due to the ordered mesoporous structure

Catalytic behavior:
1. CrOx/MCM-41: High Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to inactive Cr(III) species. Optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.
2. VOx/SiO2: Low polymeric VOx species act as the major active centers. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion are critical for excellent PDH performance.

Advantages over traditional supports:
1. Better control over metal dispersion and pore structure
2. Improved optimization of active site accessibility
3. Enhanced reactant/product diffusion

Limitations:
1. Potential pore blockage due to coke formation
2. Possible metal leaching under harsh reaction conditions
3. Need for careful optimization of metal loading and preparation methods

Reaction mechanism:
The mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of supported metal oxide species (V or Cr), with lattice oxygen participating in hydrogen abstraction from propane. Regeneration of reduced metal sites occurs through gas-phase oxygen or lattice oxygen migration.

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation:
1. Lattice oxygen species: Play a crucial role in the redox cycle and overall catalytic activity
2. H2 pretreatment: Can enhance metal-support interactions, improving stability and anti-coking properties
3. Surface acidity: Higher acidity leads to increased coking tendency
4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions enhance stability and resist sintering

Catalyst deactivation:
1. Primarily due to coke formation and sintering of active metal species
2. The ordered porous structure may help mitigate sintering to some extent
3. Controlling surface acidity and optimizing metal-support interactions are key to minimizing coke formation and maintaining long-term catalyst stability

In conclusion, while OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show great potential for PDH reactions, careful optimization of catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.

The literature primarily focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on Mg-modified SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, some insights can be drawn about the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: SBA-15 has a well-defined and ordered mesoporous structure, making it suitable for stabilizing and dispersing metal nanoparticles like Pt. This helps prevent agglomeration and improves catalyst performance.

2. Advantages: The ordered mesoporous structure of SBA-15 allows for higher dispersion of metal nanoparticles and better confinement, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability compared to traditional supports like Al2O3 and SiO2.

3. Catalyst performance: PtSn/SBA-15 catalysts show good initial activity for propane dehydrogenation, with conversions around 35-43% depending on the modification. The addition of Mg (1-4 wt%) to SBA-15 enhances catalytic activity and stability.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of Sn as a promoter in PtSn catalysts decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles through a geometric effect. This modification makes it more difficult for hydrocarbons to form multiple carbon-metal bonds, resulting in more active coke precursors that can easily transfer to the support.

5. Influence of support modification: Incorporating Mg into SBA-15 enhances the interaction between metal species (Pt, Sn) and the support, stabilizes the oxidation state of promoters (Sn), and improves overall catalytic performance. It also facilitates the formation of M2 sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Catalyst deactivation: Carbon deposition is a major cause of deactivation. The presence of Mg can facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

While the literature does not directly address lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates the importance of support properties and modifications in influencing metal-support interactions, metal dispersion, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, it provides insights into the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support for cobalt catalysts, providing confined channels for metal species.

2. H2 pretreatment influence: Hydrogen prereduction significantly affects catalyst performance by tuning the interaction between metal species and the silica support. It causes multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species.

3. Catalyst performance: Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters in MCM-41 channels.

4. Deactivation: Higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition.

5. Reaction mechanism: The performance of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is determined by propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation, which are influenced by the metal-support interaction.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction can tune the interaction between metal species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in PDH reactions. This highlights the importance of optimizing pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired catalyst performance.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined structure of MCM-41 plays a role in the catalyst's performance by limiting the size of metal clusters and influencing metal-support interactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The main advantages include:

1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity, performing similarly to industrial CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Improved structural properties: MCM-41 allows for highly dispersed VOx species, which contributes to enhanced catalytic behavior.

3. Active sites: V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with Lewis acidity increasing as the number of V-O-V bonds decreases.

4. Resistance to deactivation: Isolated VOx species show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species.

The reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes at Lewis-acidic V atoms. Performance is influenced by several factors:

1. VOx site density and dispersion: Isolated VOx sites show higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species.

2. Reduction temperature: Increasing reduction and reaction temperatures lead to higher TOF values for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

3. Support effect: MCM-41, as an ordered mesoporous silica support, allows for better control of VOx site density and distribution compared to traditional supports.

Limitations include:

1. Formation of cracking products and coke, although in small amounts.
2. Lower selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation due to increased cracking and isomerization reactions, especially for isolated VOx sites.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites providing the best overall performance due to their higher intrinsic activity and resistance to deactivation.

While the provided answers do not specifically compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), they offer relevant insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: OMS supports like SBA-15 provide high surface area and uniform pore structure, allowing good dispersion of active sites.

2. Catalytic behavior: The nature of the support significantly affects catalytic activity and stability. Addition of promoters can influence reducibility, basicity, surface metal content, and stability of metal particles.

3. Advantages: OMS supports can provide better dispersion of active metal species compared to traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in activating C-H bonds in propane, leading to improved initial catalytic activity and propylene yield.

5. Factors influencing performance:
   - Redox properties
   - Resistance to sintering
   - Resistance to coke deposition
   - Lattice oxygen capacity
   - Acidity/basicity of the support

6. Deactivation: Main causes are sintering of active phases and coke deposition. Acidic supports are more prone to coke formation than neutral or basic ones.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed, catalyst reduction before reaction is mentioned, suggesting the importance of H2 pretreatment in activating the catalyst.

The studies demonstrate that tailoring the composition and properties of metal-OMS catalysts through promoter addition and support modification can significantly improve their performance and stability in PDH reactions.

The literature provides insights into the performance of VOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and other mesoporous materials for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed good activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions.

2. When extended to aluminosilicate supports, the catalysts achieved propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts (only 25% lower).

3. The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization degree, with the order determined to be: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed higher initial propene selectivity (~90%) compared to VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports (<80%).

5. The high surface area of MCM-41 (900 m2/g) allowed for lower vanadium loading compared to SiO2-Al2O3 materials (255-475 m2/g), which may impact catalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, SBA-15 supports, the role of lattice oxygen species, or the effects of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts include low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which contribute to better dispersion of reactive sites and improved anticoking capacity.

VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 demonstrate considerable propylene productivity in PDH reactions. However, they suffer from fast deactivation, which is a significant limitation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The reaction mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen species from as-prepared CrOx and VOx in the PDH reaction. This is evidenced by the detection of a small amount of CO product in the initial 3 hours of reaction over as-prepared catalysts, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment.

As-prepared (oxidized) VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. This indicates that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. However, the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for catalyst deactivation.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in modifying catalyst behavior. It eliminates CO production and affects the oxidation state of the active species, which in turn influences catalyst activity and stability. The balance between high activity (associated with oxidized species) and improved stability (associated with reduced species) is a key consideration in optimizing these catalysts for PDH reactions.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency.

2. Uniform pore structure: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials has shown higher activity compared to bulk V2O5 or other traditional supports. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of VOx species on the high surface area of OMS supports, leading to a higher number of accessible active sites.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface. Different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, which can affect the overall catalytic performance.

For CrOx-based catalysts, similar principles apply, although the specific reaction mechanisms may differ slightly. The performance of CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is also generally superior to traditional supports like Al2O3.

One of the main limitations of VOx/OMS and CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.
