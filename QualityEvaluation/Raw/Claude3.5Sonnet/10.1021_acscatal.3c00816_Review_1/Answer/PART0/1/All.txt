Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels.

M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.\n\n6. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.\n\n7. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation.

The performance of CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is also generally superior to traditional supports like Al2O3.\n\nOne of the main limitations of VOx/OMS and CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.", "Chinese": "金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更有前景的性能。由于其独特的结构特性，这些材料提供了几个优势：\n\n1. 更高的比表面积：OMS材料为活性位点分散提供了更大的表面积，可能会提高催化剂效率。\n\n2. 均匀的孔结构：MCM-41和SBA-15的有序介孔结构可以改善反应物和产物的扩散，可能会提高催化活性。\n\n3. 增强金属分散：OMS载体的均匀孔结构可以导致VOx和CrOx物种更好的分散，可能会增加活性位点的数量。\n\n4. 热稳定性：OMS材料通常表现出良好的热稳定性，这对于在高温下进行的PDH反应至关重要。\n\n在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx与体相V2O5或其他传统载体相比表现出更高的活性。这种增强的性能可以归因于VOx物种在OMS载体高比表面积上的更好分散，导致可接触的活性位点数量增加。\n\nVOx/OMS催化剂上PDH反应的机理涉及丙烷C-H键的活化，随后是丙烯的脱附。这些催化剂的活性和选择性受表面存在的V-O键性质的影响。不同的V-O键表现出不同的C-H活化和丙烯脱附能垒，这可能会影响整体催化性能。\n\n对于基于CrOx的催化剂，类似的原理也适用，尽管具体的反应机理可能略有不同。CrOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的性能通常也优于传统载体如Al2O3。\n\nVOx/OMS和CrOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的主要限制之一是它们倾向于形成焦炭沉积，导致失活。焦炭形成速率随VOx物种聚合度的增加而增加。这表明在OMS载体上保持VOx物种的高度分散对于延长催化剂寿命至关重要。", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
