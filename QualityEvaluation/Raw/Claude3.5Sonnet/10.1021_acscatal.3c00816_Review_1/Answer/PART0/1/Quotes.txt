[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability"

[6] "The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds"

[7] "Especially, the metal Sn was usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts as promotor, it could keep the Pt nanoparticles from aggregating and improve the propylene selectivity."

[8] "The support with a large specific surface area is in favor with the migration of carbon deposit, which could reduce the amount of coke on active metal and thus prolong the life of catalyst."

[9] "Pore size affected significantly the redox property of catalysts, PtSn/SSF#5 consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) although it exhibited the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), which was related to the particle size and specific surface area."

[10] "The essential factor to determine the propane conversion was the size of active phase, the smaller one was more conducive to convert propane whatever for the initial or final conversion."

[11] "Coke deposition was another factor causing the catalytic deactivation according to the Raman and TG analysis"

[12] "The catalytic deactivation was mainly caused by sintering of active phase and coke deposition which was identified and quantified by combining Raman and TG analysis."

[1] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2."

[2] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

[3] "The catalytic activity and stability of Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 were significantly better than those of Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM because of improved metal dispersion and enhanced interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support."

[4] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites. In this case, more stable M2 active sites are present in the Sn-incorporated catalyst and a better catalytic performance is obtained."

[5] "The amounts of coke deposited followed the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 (6.6%) < Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 (6.9%) < Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM (11.2%) < Pt/2Sn-SBA-15 (11.4%)."

[6] "A series of Sn-incorporated SBA-15 materials with high specific surface areas and highly ordered mesoporous structures were synthesized by a facile one-pot method and used as catalyst supports."

[7] "The incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, and these helped to maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction."

[8] "The shapes of the xSn-SBA-15 isotherms were similar to that of SBA-15, indicating that the characteristics of the mesoporous material were retained."

[9] "Confinement by the mesoporous structure helped to stabilize the metal particles, which enhanced the catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation"

[10] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support powder was impregnated with a H2PtCl6·6H2O precursor dissolved in deionized water."

[11] "Introduction of an excessive amount of Sn decreased the catalyst stability. The stabilities of the catalysts decreased in the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM > Pt/2Sn-SBA-15."

[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[4] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[5] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[6] "High propene yields about 1619% at 575600 C for low vanadium loadings (24 wt.%) were obtained, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts according to a recent review"

"Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

"At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (CrO4) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

"At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in CrO4 coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

"For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

"In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

"In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS."

"Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

          [2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

          [3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

          [4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

[1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

[5] "Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream"

[6] "Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22], [23], [26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."

[7] "VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles."

[8] "As evident from Fig. 3, both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream. Based on previous studies on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts as well as our UV/Vis and TPO results (Section 3.3), the activity decrease within one DH cycle must be related to deposition of carbonaceous species."

[9] "In the 1st DH cycle, the yields ratio for oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 was 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, that is, VOx/MCM-41 slightly improved its on-stream stability when used in a reduced form. The effect of H2 treatment on the propene formation over CrOx/MCM-41 was even higher: The corresponding values were 2.5 and 1.4."

"Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions, which has many advantages including high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability and weak acidity."

"Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

"It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

"Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s−1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

"The highly dispersed SnOx species rather than polymeric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species contribute to the activation of propane and formation of propylene."

"The reduction and reaction processes also influence the SnOSi bonds and local structure of catalysts, which induces the near-surface enrichment of SnOx species. It enhances the accessibility of the SnOx active sites."

"In the reaction process, the surface SnOSi bonds react with the adsorbed propane, the hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the methylene by the bridging oxygen active sites and then form the isopropyl-Sn intermediate species and the surface silanol groups. The isopropyl intermediate species are further abstracted by the β-hydrogen cleavage to yield propene, meanwhile, the hydrogen molecules is generated from the surface silanol groups and then SnOSi bonds are recovered"

[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."

[4] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[5] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[6] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

[8] "The high amount of OH groups allows us to expect a better stability of the catalyst by suppressing the coke deposition during the reaction."

[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[3] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

[4] "Sokolov et al. designed a series of supports with different acidity levels to support single layer VOx components for catalyzing the PDH reaction. The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst."

[5] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction."

"SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

"The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

"PtSn catalysts supported on various materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 have been extensively studied for dehydrogenation of propane"

"The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized."

"As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was more active and could more easily transfer to the support"

"The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support."

"It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and support."

"PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, the initial conversion of propane was 35.7% and then reduced to 27.2% after 6 h reaction."

"The catalytic activity and stability were clearly enhanced when 14 wt.% Mg was introduced into the catalysts."

"PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 prepared by one-pot method exhibited better catalytic activity than PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM."

"The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a maximum initial propane conversion of 43.0% among all the samples."

"Generally, M1 sites were connected with the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and coking, whereas the M2 sites were responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[1] "Co@MCM41 catalysts with and without hydrogen prereduction treatments are prepared for catalyzing nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene."

[2] "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."

[3] "The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and smallsize Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst."

[4] "A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."

[5] "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions."

"VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

"Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

"VOx/MCM-41, which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts"

"Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

"Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."

"Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

"For both propane and isobutane DH, an increase in TOF with increasing reduction and reaction temperature was observed"

"VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

"For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

"Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

"V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

"Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

"VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5"

"VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

"VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species"

"Isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activity in comparison with their oligomerized counterparts. However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions."

"The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."

"PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."

"The amorphous supports such as Al2O3 (2123) and SiO2, (24,25) the molecule sieves like ZSM-5, (2628) SBA-15, (2932) MCM-41, (33) and silicalite-1, (34,35) the mixed metal oxides like MgAlOx derived from the layered double hydroxides precursors (36,37) have been investigated."

"The results showed that the nature of support could significantly affect the catalytic activity and the catalytic stability, and the coke deposition was much easier to occur over the acidic supports rather than the neutral or basic ones."

"Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene"

"The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

"The introduction of promotors favored generation of more lattice oxygen which acted as the key role in activating the CH bonds in propane for the production of propylene, resulting in the improvements in initial catalytic activity and in the yield of desired product."

"Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation."

[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Combining these results with the UVvis spectra in Fig. 1 we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al."

[5] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

[6] "Analyzing specific surface areas of the supports and V loading on the respective catalysts, one can notice that SiO2 with SBET of 900 m2 g1 anchored lower absolute amount of V than SiO2Al2O3 materials with SBET ranging between 255 and 475 m2 g1."

[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."

[3] "The highest dehydrogenation barrier of 1.98 eV was found over V2O5H2 according to DFT calculation which corresponds to the lowest initial activity and the presence of surface VOH groups during the experiment."

[4] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[5] "The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr. This effect could be induced by the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2."

[6] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[7] "For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 16a, two typical Raman bands corresponding to coke deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1 band (1320 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibrations of defects and edges of the graphitic lattice."

[8] "Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers allowed gaining novel insight into coke formation by kinetic evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization of VOx species."

[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability"

[6] "The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds"

[7] "Especially, the metal Sn was usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts as promotor, it could keep the Pt nanoparticles from aggregating and improve the propylene selectivity."

[8] "The support with a large specific surface area is in favor with the migration of carbon deposit, which could reduce the amount of coke on active metal and thus prolong the life of catalyst."

[9] "Pore size affected significantly the redox property of catalysts, PtSn/SSF#5 consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) although it exhibited the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), which was related to the particle size and specific surface area."

[10] "The essential factor to determine the propane conversion was the size of active phase, the smaller one was more conducive to convert propane whatever for the initial or final conversion."

[11] "Coke deposition was another factor causing the catalytic deactivation according to the Raman and TG analysis"

[12] "The catalytic deactivation was mainly caused by sintering of active phase and coke deposition which was identified and quantified by combining Raman and TG analysis."

[1] "The catalytic performances of the samples were investigated using a quartz-tube fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (0.2 g) was placed at the center of the reactor and reduced in situ at 500 C for 1 h under H2."

[2] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."

[3] "The catalytic activity and stability of Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 were significantly better than those of Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM because of improved metal dispersion and enhanced interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support."

[4] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites. In this case, more stable M2 active sites are present in the Sn-incorporated catalyst and a better catalytic performance is obtained."

[5] "The amounts of coke deposited followed the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 (6.6%) < Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 (6.9%) < Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM (11.2%) < Pt/2Sn-SBA-15 (11.4%)."

[6] "A series of Sn-incorporated SBA-15 materials with high specific surface areas and highly ordered mesoporous structures were synthesized by a facile one-pot method and used as catalyst supports."

[7] "The incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, and these helped to maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction."

[8] "The shapes of the xSn-SBA-15 isotherms were similar to that of SBA-15, indicating that the characteristics of the mesoporous material were retained."

[9] "Confinement by the mesoporous structure helped to stabilize the metal particles, which enhanced the catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation"

[10] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support powder was impregnated with a H2PtCl6·6H2O precursor dissolved in deionized water."

[11] "Introduction of an excessive amount of Sn decreased the catalyst stability. The stabilities of the catalysts decreased in the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM > Pt/2Sn-SBA-15."

[1] "The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated."

[2] "The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion."

[3] "The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%)."

[4] "Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts."

[5] "The degree of dispersion of the V species on the catalyst surface and not the pore size and structure of the mesoporous support or the acidity/reducibility characteristics mainly determine the catalytic activity towards propene production."

[6] "High propene yields about 1619% at 575600 C for low vanadium loadings (24 wt.%) were obtained, ranking these catalysts among the best performing vanadia catalysts according to a recent review"

"Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

"At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (CrO4) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

"At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in CrO4 coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

"For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

"In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

"In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS."

"Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

          [2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

          [3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

          [4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."

[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

[1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

[5] "Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream"

[6] "Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22], [23], [26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."

[7] "VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles."

[8] "As evident from Fig. 3, both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream. Based on previous studies on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts as well as our UV/Vis and TPO results (Section 3.3), the activity decrease within one DH cycle must be related to deposition of carbonaceous species."

[9] "In the 1st DH cycle, the yields ratio for oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 was 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, that is, VOx/MCM-41 slightly improved its on-stream stability when used in a reduced form. The effect of H2 treatment on the propene formation over CrOx/MCM-41 was even higher: The corresponding values were 2.5 and 1.4."

"Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions, which has many advantages including high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability and weak acidity."

"Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

"It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

"Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s−1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

"The highly dispersed SnOx species rather than polymeric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species contribute to the activation of propane and formation of propylene."

"The reduction and reaction processes also influence the SnOSi bonds and local structure of catalysts, which induces the near-surface enrichment of SnOx species. It enhances the accessibility of the SnOx active sites."

"In the reaction process, the surface SnOSi bonds react with the adsorbed propane, the hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the methylene by the bridging oxygen active sites and then form the isopropyl-Sn intermediate species and the surface silanol groups. The isopropyl intermediate species are further abstracted by the β-hydrogen cleavage to yield propene, meanwhile, the hydrogen molecules is generated from the surface silanol groups and then SnOSi bonds are recovered"

[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[2] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."

[4] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."

[5] "In our present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR. These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."

[6] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction"

[8] "The high amount of OH groups allows us to expect a better stability of the catalyst by suppressing the coke deposition during the reaction."

[1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[3] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

[4] "Sokolov et al. designed a series of supports with different acidity levels to support single layer VOx components for catalyzing the PDH reaction. The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst."

[5] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction."

"SBA-15 shows its potential application in catalysis as well as in propane dehydrogenation thanks to the well defined and ordered mesoporous structure. Such unique features make SBA-15 very well suited as host for the confinement and stabilization of Pt nanoparticles, which is beneficial to obtaining higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and preventing particles from agglomeration"

"The confinement effect from the channel of the SBA-15 molecular sieve would help to stabilize the metallic particles and improve the sintering resistance, which could increase the catalytic stability during the propane dehydrogenation reaction"

"PtSn catalysts supported on various materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 have been extensively studied for dehydrogenation of propane"

"The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites. Consequently, more M2 sites were produced and better catalytic performance was realized."

"As known to all, the presence of Sn on Pt-Sn catalyst could decrease the size of the surface Pt ensembles (geometric effect), so that the hydrocarbon was unable to form the multiple carbon-metal bonds readily, then the coke precursor was more active and could more easily transfer to the support"

"The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support."

"It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and support."

"PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, the initial conversion of propane was 35.7% and then reduced to 27.2% after 6 h reaction."

"The catalytic activity and stability were clearly enhanced when 14 wt.% Mg was introduced into the catalysts."

"PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 prepared by one-pot method exhibited better catalytic activity than PtSn/2Mg/SBA-15-IM."

"The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a maximum initial propane conversion of 43.0% among all the samples."

"Generally, M1 sites were connected with the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and coking, whereas the M2 sites were responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[1] "Co@MCM41 catalysts with and without hydrogen prereduction treatments are prepared for catalyzing nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene."

[2] "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."

[3] "The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and smallsize Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst."

[4] "A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."

[5] "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions."

"VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

"Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

"VOx/MCM-41, which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts"

"Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

"Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."

"Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

"For both propane and isobutane DH, an increase in TOF with increasing reduction and reaction temperature was observed"

"VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

"For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

"Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

"V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

"Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

"VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5"

"VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

"VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species"

"Isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activity in comparison with their oligomerized counterparts. However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions."

"The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."

"PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."

"The amorphous supports such as Al2O3 (2123) and SiO2, (24,25) the molecule sieves like ZSM-5, (2628) SBA-15, (2932) MCM-41, (33) and silicalite-1, (34,35) the mixed metal oxides like MgAlOx derived from the layered double hydroxides precursors (36,37) have been investigated."

"The results showed that the nature of support could significantly affect the catalytic activity and the catalytic stability, and the coke deposition was much easier to occur over the acidic supports rather than the neutral or basic ones."

"Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene"

"The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

"The introduction of promotors favored generation of more lattice oxygen which acted as the key role in activating the CH bonds in propane for the production of propylene, resulting in the improvements in initial catalytic activity and in the yield of desired product."

"Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation."

[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Combining these results with the UVvis spectra in Fig. 1 we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al."

[5] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

[6] "Analyzing specific surface areas of the supports and V loading on the respective catalysts, one can notice that SiO2 with SBET of 900 m2 g1 anchored lower absolute amount of V than SiO2Al2O3 materials with SBET ranging between 255 and 475 m2 g1."

[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."

[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation"

[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."

[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."

[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

[1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."

[3] "The highest dehydrogenation barrier of 1.98 eV was found over V2O5H2 according to DFT calculation which corresponds to the lowest initial activity and the presence of surface VOH groups during the experiment."

[4] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[5] "The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr. This effect could be induced by the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2."

[6] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[7] "For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 16a, two typical Raman bands corresponding to coke deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1 band (1320 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibrations of defects and edges of the graphitic lattice."

[8] "Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers allowed gaining novel insight into coke formation by kinetic evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization of VOx species."
