          "Especially, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3"

"At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral (CrO4) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."

"At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in CrO4 coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

"For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

"In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state."

"In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS."

"Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability"

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported CrOx show higher activity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these catalysts differ significantly:

1. Structural properties:
   - SBA-15 at low Cr loading (1 wt%): Contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination.
   - SBA-15 at high Cr loading (5 wt%): Forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles alongside some isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at low loading: Forms oligomers and isolated species.
   - γ-Al2O3 at high loading: Mainly contains oligomers of varying nuclearity without Cr2O3 particles.

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - For SBA-15: Isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are more active, selective, and stable than surface Cr sites on Cr2O3 crystals.
   - For Al2O3: Oligomeric Cr species outperform isolated Cr sites in activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction mechanism:
   - Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction.
   - Cr is typically in the (III) oxidation state during the reaction.
   - Isolated Cr(VI) species are immediately reduced to Cr(III) upon interaction with propane, with an increase in coordination number.

4. Advantages of OMS catalysts:
   - Higher activity compared to traditional supports.
   - Ability to stabilize isolated Cr species at low loadings.

5. Limitations:
   - Formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15.

6. Alternative approaches:
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied to overcome challenges with traditional PDH, but has not achieved commercial viability.

The study emphasizes the importance of support nature and Cr loading in determining catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions. However, the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation is not directly addressed in the provided information.

          金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂如MCM-41和SBA-15负载的CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中显示出比传统金属氧化物载体如Al2O3更高的活性。这些催化剂的结构特性和催化行为有显著差异：

1. 结构特性：
   - SBA-15在低Cr负载量(1 wt%)时：含有四面体配位的孤立Cr(VI)物种。
   - SBA-15在高Cr负载量(5 wt%)时：形成晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒和一些孤立物种。
   - γ-Al2O3在低负载量时：形成低聚物和孤立物种。
   - γ-Al2O3在高负载量时：主要含有不同核数的低聚物，不形成Cr2O3颗粒。

2. 催化行为：
   - 对于SBA-15：配位数>4的孤立Cr(III)位比Cr2O3晶体表面的Cr位具有更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
   - 对于Al2O3：低聚Cr物种在活性和选择性方面优于孤立Cr位。

3. 反应机理：
   - 活性Cr位在反应过程中原位生成。
   - 在反应过程中，Cr通常处于(III)氧化态。
   - 孤立的Cr(VI)物种在与丙烷接触后立即还原为Cr(III)，同时配位数增加。

4. OMS催化剂的优势：
   - 比传统载体具有更高的活性。
   - 能够在低负载量时稳定孤立Cr物种。

5. 局限性：
   - 在SBA-15上高负载量时形成活性较低的Cr2O3颗粒。

6. 替代方法：
   - 研究了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服传统PDH挑战的方法，但尚未实现商业可行性。

该研究强调了载体性质和Cr负载量在决定PDH反应中催化剂结构和性能方面的重要性。然而，在提供的信息中没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。
