          [1] "Co@MCM41 catalysts with and without hydrogen prereduction treatments are prepared for catalyzing nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene."

[2] "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."

[3] "The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and smallsize Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst."

[4] "A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."

[5] "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions."

          The literature focuses on Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. However, it provides insights into the performance of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: MCM-41 is used as a support for cobalt catalysts, providing confined channels for metal species.

2. H2 pretreatment influence: Hydrogen prereduction significantly affects catalyst performance by tuning the interaction between metal species and the silica support. It causes multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species.

3. Catalyst performance: Catalysts reduced at 650-700°C show 2-3 times higher reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts, due to the presence of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters in MCM-41 channels.

4. Deactivation: Higher prereduction temperatures (750-800°C) lead to the formation of large Co particles, resulting in decreased reaction rates, lower propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition.

5. Reaction mechanism: The performance of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is determined by propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation, which are influenced by the metal-support interaction.

The study demonstrates that hydrogen prereduction can tune the interaction between metal species and the silica support, which in turn affects propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in PDH reactions. This highlights the importance of optimizing pretreatment conditions to achieve the desired catalyst performance.

While the study does not directly compare MCM-41 to traditional metal oxide supports, it suggests that the confined structure of MCM-41 plays a role in the catalyst's performance by limiting the size of metal clusters and influencing metal-support interactions.

          该文献主要关注Co@MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非VOx和CrOx负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的催化剂。然而，我们仍可以从中获得一些关于金属-有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 结构特性：MCM-41被用作钴催化剂的载体，为金属物种提供了受限的通道。

2. H2预处理的影响：氢气预还原通过调节金属物种与硅支撑体之间的相互作用，显著影响催化剂性能。它导致骨架Co2+向骨架外Co0物种的多阶段迁移。

3. 催化剂性能：在650-700°C下还原的催化剂显示出比未还原催化剂高2-3倍的反应速率，这是由于MCM-41通道中同时存在骨架Co2+离子和小尺寸Co0纳米簇。

4. 失活：更高的预还原温度（750-800°C）导致大颗粒Co的形成，resulting in反应速率降低、丙烯选择性降低和严重的积碳问题。

5. 反应机理：Co催化的PDH反应性能由丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成决定，这些过程受金属-载体相互作用的影响。

研究表明，氢气预还原可以调节金属物种与二氧化硅支撑体之间的相互作用，进而影响PDH反应中的丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和积碳形成。这突出了优化预处理条件以实现所需催化剂性能的重要性。

虽然该研究没有直接比较MCM-41与传统金属氧化物支撑体，但它表明MCM-41的受限结构通过限制金属簇的大小和影响金属-支撑体相互作用，在催化剂性能中发挥了作用。
