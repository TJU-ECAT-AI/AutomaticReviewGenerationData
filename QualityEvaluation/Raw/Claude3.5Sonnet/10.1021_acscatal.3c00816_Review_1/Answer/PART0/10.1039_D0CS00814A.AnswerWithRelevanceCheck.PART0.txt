          [1] "VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2."

[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."

[3] "The highest dehydrogenation barrier of 1.98 eV was found over V2O5H2 according to DFT calculation which corresponds to the lowest initial activity and the presence of surface VOH groups during the experiment."

[4] "When VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[5] "The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr. This effect could be induced by the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2."

[6] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[7] "For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 16a, two typical Raman bands corresponding to coke deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1 band (1320 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibrations of defects and edges of the graphitic lattice."

[8] "Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers allowed gaining novel insight into coke formation by kinetic evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization of VOx species."

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have shown promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties:

1. Higher surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency.

2. Uniform pore structure: The ordered mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures.

In terms of catalytic behavior, VOx supported on OMS materials has shown higher activity compared to bulk V2O5 or other traditional supports. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the better dispersion of VOx species on the high surface area of OMS supports, leading to a higher number of accessible active sites.

The reaction mechanism for PDH over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface. Different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, which can affect the overall catalytic performance.

For CrOx-based catalysts, similar principles apply, although the specific reaction mechanisms may differ slightly. The performance of CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is also generally superior to traditional supports like Al2O3.

One of the main limitations of VOx/OMS and CrOx/OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is their tendency to form coke deposits, leading to deactivation. The rate of coke formation has been found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. This suggests that maintaining a high dispersion of VOx species on the OMS support is crucial for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

          金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更有前景的性能。由于其独特的结构特性，这些材料提供了几个优势：

1. 更高的比表面积：OMS材料为活性位点分散提供了更大的表面积，可能会提高催化剂效率。

2. 均匀的孔结构：MCM-41和SBA-15的有序介孔结构可以改善反应物和产物的扩散，可能会提高催化活性。

3. 增强金属分散：OMS载体的均匀孔结构可以导致VOx和CrOx物种更好的分散，可能会增加活性位点的数量。

4. 热稳定性：OMS材料通常表现出良好的热稳定性，这对于在高温下进行的PDH反应至关重要。

在催化行为方面，负载在OMS材料上的VOx与体相V2O5或其他传统载体相比表现出更高的活性。这种增强的性能可以归因于VOx物种在OMS载体高比表面积上的更好分散，导致可接触的活性位点数量增加。

VOx/OMS催化剂上PDH反应的机理涉及丙烷C-H键的活化，随后是丙烯的脱附。这些催化剂的活性和选择性受表面存在的V-O键性质的影响。不同的V-O键表现出不同的C-H活化和丙烯脱附能垒，这可能会影响整体催化性能。

对于基于CrOx的催化剂，类似的原理也适用，尽管具体的反应机理可能略有不同。CrOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的性能通常也优于传统载体如Al2O3。

VOx/OMS和CrOx/OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的主要限制之一是它们倾向于形成焦炭沉积，导致失活。焦炭形成速率随VOx物种聚合度的增加而增加。这表明在OMS载体上保持VOx物种的高度分散对于延长催化剂寿命至关重要。

          [1] "Notably, when VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[2] "The incipient activity and deactivation rate turned out to be linearly relevant to the intensity of the VOH band which reflects the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. The presence of surface VOH decreases the desorption barrier of propylene and thus promotes the desorption of propylene and decreases the coke formation."

[3] "As a result, the H2 pretreatment time significantly influences the concentration of surface VOH and thus the initial activity and stability, where longer H2 pretreatment contributes to the lower deactivation rates despite the lower conversion."

[4] "By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance."

[5] "Additionally, cofeeding H2 can effectively tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene."

          Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. In OMS-supported catalysts, the interaction between lattice oxygen and the support structure may differ from traditional supports, potentially affecting catalyst performance.

H2 pretreatment has a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The presence of these hydroxyl groups decreases the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation.

The effect of H2 pretreatment is time-dependent, with longer pretreatment times contributing to lower deactivation rates but potentially lower initial conversion. This suggests a trade-off between activity and stability that needs to be optimized for each catalyst system.

The concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, as reflected by the intensity of the VOH band, has been found to have a linear relationship with the initial activity and deactivation rate of the catalyst. This provides a useful parameter for optimizing catalyst performance.

In addition to pretreatment, cofeeding H2 during the reaction can also be used to tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups and thus the desorption barrier of propylene. This offers another method for controlling catalyst selectivity and stability during operation.

These findings highlight the importance of surface hydroxyl groups in determining the performance of VOx-based catalysts in PDH reactions. By carefully controlling the formation and concentration of these groups through H2 pretreatment and cofeeding, it is possible to enhance propylene selectivity and improve catalyst stability against deactivation.

          晶格氧物种在PDH反应机理中起着关键作用。它们参与C-H键的活化，并可以影响催化剂的氧化还原性能。在OMS负载的催化剂中，晶格氧与载体结构的相互作用可能与传统载体不同，从而可能影响催化剂的性能。

H2预处理对PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。它导致表面VOH基团的形成，可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。这些羟基的存在降低了丙烯的脱附能垒，促进其释放并减少导致积碳的不需要的副反应。

H2预处理的效果是时间依赖的，较长的预处理时间有助于降低失活率，但可能降低初始转化率。这表明在活性和稳定性之间存在一个需要为每个催化剂系统优化的权衡。

表面羟基的浓度，如VOH带的强度所反映的，已被发现与催化剂的初始活性和失活率呈线性关系。这为优化催化剂性能提供了一个有用的参数。

除了预处理外，在反应过程中共进料H2也可以用来调节表面羟基的覆盖度，从而调节丙烯的脱附能垒。这为在操作过程中控制催化剂的选择性和稳定性提供了另一种方法。

这些发现强调了表面羟基在决定基于VOx的催化剂在PDH反应中的性能方面的重要性。通过仔细控制这些基团的形成和浓度，通过H2预处理和共进料，可以提高丙烯选择性并改善催化剂抗失活的稳定性。
