          [1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher"

[4] "It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area"

[5] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability"

[6] "The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds"

[7] "Especially, the metal Sn was usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts as promotor, it could keep the Pt nanoparticles from aggregating and improve the propylene selectivity."

[8] "The support with a large specific surface area is in favor with the migration of carbon deposit, which could reduce the amount of coke on active metal and thus prolong the life of catalyst."

[9] "Pore size affected significantly the redox property of catalysts, PtSn/SSF#5 consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) although it exhibited the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), which was related to the particle size and specific surface area."

[10] "The essential factor to determine the propane conversion was the size of active phase, the smaller one was more conducive to convert propane whatever for the initial or final conversion."

[11] "Coke deposition was another factor causing the catalytic deactivation according to the Raman and TG analysis"

[12] "The catalytic deactivation was mainly caused by sintering of active phase and coke deposition which was identified and quantified by combining Raman and TG analysis."

          The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions shows several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports:

1. Structural properties:
   - Ordered pore structure
   - Higher thermal stability
   - Higher specific surface area
   - SBA-15 is particularly favored due to its special pore structure, pore size, thicker pore walls, and better thermal stability

2. Catalytic behavior:
   - Better performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 supports
   - Large specific surface area facilitates carbon deposit migration, reducing coke formation on active metal sites and prolonging catalyst life
   - Controlled pore size affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Ability to incorporate additives like Al to enhance strong acid sites and improve CH bond activation
   - Support for promoters like Sn, which can prevent Pt nanoparticle aggregation and improve propylene selectivity

3. Factors influencing performance:
   - Active phase size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to higher propane conversion rates
   - Pore size: Affects redox properties and dispersion of active phases
   - Metal dispersion: Higher dispersion typically improves catalyst performance

4. Limitations and deactivation mechanisms:
   - Sintering of active metal phases during reaction
   - Coke deposition, which can be mitigated to some extent by the mesoporous structure

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 and SBA-15 or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it suggests that OMS-supported catalysts, particularly those based on SBA-15, offer advantages in terms of stability and performance for PDH reactions due to their superior structural properties.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的催化剂，相较于传统的金属氧化物载体展现出几个优势：

1. 结构特性：
   - 有序的孔结构
   - 更高的热稳定性
   - 更大的比表面积
   - SBA-15因其特殊的孔结构、孔径、更厚的孔壁和更好的热稳定性而特别受青睐

2. 催化行为：
   - 与传统的Al2O3或SiO2载体相比，在PDH反应中表现更佳
   - 大比表面积有利于碳沉积物的迁移，减少活性金属位点上的积碳，从而延长催化剂寿命
   - 可控的孔径影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度
   - 能够掺入Al等添加剂，增强强酸位点并改善CH键的活化
   - 可支持Sn等助剂，防止Pt纳米颗粒聚集并提高丙烯选择性

3. 影响性能的因素：
   - 活性相尺寸：较小的颗粒尺寸通常会导致更高的丙烷转化率
   - 孔径：影响活性相的氧化还原性质和分散度
   - 金属分散度：较高的分散度通常能改善催化剂性能

4. 局限性和失活机制：
   - 反应过程中活性金属相的烧结
   - 积碳沉积，可通过介孔结构在一定程度上缓解

虽然文献没有具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx催化剂，或晶格氧物种和H2预处理的影响，但它表明OMS负载的催化剂，特别是基于SBA-15的催化剂，由于其优越的结构特性，在PDH反应中在稳定性和性能方面提供了优势。
