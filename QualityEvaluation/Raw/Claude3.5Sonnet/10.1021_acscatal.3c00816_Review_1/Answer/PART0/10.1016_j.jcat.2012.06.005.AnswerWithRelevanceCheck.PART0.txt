          [1] "Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g1."

[2] "According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

[5] "Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream"

[6] "Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22], [23], [26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."

[7] "VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles."

[8] "As evident from Fig. 3, both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream. Based on previous studies on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts as well as our UV/Vis and TPO results (Section 3.3), the activity decrease within one DH cycle must be related to deposition of carbonaceous species."

[9] "In the 1st DH cycle, the yields ratio for oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 was 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, that is, VOx/MCM-41 slightly improved its on-stream stability when used in a reduced form. The effect of H2 treatment on the propene formation over CrOx/MCM-41 was even higher: The corresponding values were 2.5 and 1.4."

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts exhibit high specific surface areas (ca. 780 m2/g), allowing for highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. This high dispersion contributes to their catalytic activity and stability.

Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like Al2O3, OMS catalysts show several advantages:

1. Higher surface area and better metal dispersion
2. Improved stability and regenerability, especially for VOx/MCM-41
3. Reduced coke formation, leading to more stable performance over longer periods

VOx/MCM-41 exhibits superior performance compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3. Key advantages of VOx/MCM-41 include:

1. Excellent time-on-stream stability in multiple DH cycles
2. Full activity recovery through oxidative regeneration
3. Resistance to structural changes under reaction conditions

The reaction mechanism involves both oxidized and reduced metal oxide species as active sites, with oxidized species being initially more active. Lattice oxygen participates in the early stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts.

H2 pretreatment influences catalyst performance by reducing metal oxide species. This slightly improves on-stream stability for VOx/MCM-41 and has a more pronounced effect on CrOx/MCM-41.

The main limitation for all catalysts in PDH reactions is deactivation due to coke deposition. However, OMS-supported catalysts, especially VOx/MCM-41, show better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional supports.

In summary, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to CrOx/MCM-41 and traditional supports, highlighting the potential of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts for this application.

          金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。这些催化剂具有高比表面积（约780 m2/g），允许VOx和CrOx物种高度分散在表面上。这种高度分散性有助于提高其催化活性和稳定性。

与传统的金属氧化物载体（如Al2O3）相比，OMS催化剂显示出几个优势：

1. 更高的比表面积和更好的金属分散性
2. 改善的稳定性和再生能力，特别是VOx/MCM-41
3. 减少积碳形成，导致更长时间内的稳定性能

VOx/MCM-41相比CrOx/MCM-41和传统催化剂（如PtSn/Al2O3）表现出优越的性能。VOx/MCM-41的主要优势包括：

1. 在多个DH循环中表现出优异的时间稳定性
2. 通过氧化再生完全恢复活性
3. 在反应条件下抵抗结构变化

反应机理涉及氧化态和还原态金属氧化物物种作为活性位点，其中氧化态物种最初更活跃。晶格氧参与反应的早期阶段，特别是对于氧化态催化剂。

H2预处理通过还原金属氧化物物种影响催化剂性能。这略微改善了VOx/MCM-41的反应中稳定性，对CrOx/MCM-41的影响更为显著。

PDH反应中所有催化剂的主要限制是由于积碳导致的失活。然而，OMS负载的催化剂，特别是VOx/MCM-41，相比传统载体表现出更好的抗失活能力。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优于CrOx/MCM-41和传统载体的性能和稳定性，突显了金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂在这一应用中的潜力。
