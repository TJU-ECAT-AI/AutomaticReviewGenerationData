          [1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."

          [2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."

          [3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."

          [4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

          The provided literature does not fully address the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it focuses on CrOx-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

          Key findings from the study include:

          1. The preparation method and timing of Cr precursor addition significantly influence catalyst properties and performance.
          2. Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method showed that the Cr adding time affects Cr dispersion, surface physico-chemical properties, and catalytic performance.
          3. Cr/MSS-2, where the Cr precursor was added after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity.
          4. In Cr/MSS-1, while showing good CrOx dispersion overall, some CrOx wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres exhibited weaker catalytic activity.

          The study does not provide information on traditional metal oxide supports, lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the specific advantages, limitations, or deactivation of these catalysts in PDH reactions, nor does it compare them to MCM-41 or SBA-15 supported catalysts or VOx-based systems.

          提供的文献并未全面回答关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的问题。相反，它主要关注CrOx掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球(Cr/MSS-X)在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。

          研究的主要发现包括：

          1. 制备方法和Cr前驱体添加时间显著影响催化剂性能和特性。
          2. 通过溶胶-凝胶法制备的Cr/MSS-X催化剂表明，Cr添加时间影响Cr分散度、表面物理化学性质和催化性能。
          3. Cr/MSS-2（在正硅酸四乙酯TEOS之后添加Cr前驱体）展现了最佳催化活性。
          4. 在Cr/MSS-1中，虽然整体上显示出良好的CrOx分散性，但包裹在介孔二氧化硅球体中心的部分CrOx表现出较弱的催化活性。

          该研究未提供关于传统金属氧化物载体、晶格氧物种、H2预处理或详细反应机理的信息。它也没有讨论这些催化剂在PDH反应中的具体优势、局限性或失活情况，也没有将它们与MCM-41或SBA-15负载的催化剂或基于VOx的系统进行比较。
