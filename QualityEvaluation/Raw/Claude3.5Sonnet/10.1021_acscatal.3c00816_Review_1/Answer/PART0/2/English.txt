Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. They participate in the activation of C-H bonds and can influence the redox properties of the catalyst. In OMS-supported catalysts, the interaction between lattice oxygen and the support structure may differ from traditional supports, potentially affecting catalyst performance.

H2 pretreatment has a significant impact on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It leads to the formation of surface VOH groups, which can improve propylene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The presence of these hydroxyl groups decreases the desorption barrier of propylene, promoting its release and reducing unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation.

The effect of H2 pretreatment is time-dependent, with longer pretreatment times contributing to lower deactivation rates but potentially lower initial conversion. This suggests a trade-off between activity and stability that needs to be optimized for each catalyst system.

The concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, as reflected by the intensity of the VOH band, has been found to have a linear relationship with the initial activity and deactivation rate of the catalyst. This provides a useful parameter for optimizing catalyst performance.

In addition to pretreatment, cofeeding H2 during the reaction can also be used to tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups and thus the desorption barrier of propylene. This offers another method for controlling catalyst selectivity and stability during operation.

These findings highlight the importance of surface hydroxyl groups in determining the performance of VOx-based catalysts in PDH reactions. By carefully controlling the formation and concentration of these groups through H2 pretreatment and cofeeding, it is possible to enhance propylene selectivity and improve catalyst stability against deactivation.
