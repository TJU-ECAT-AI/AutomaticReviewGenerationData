[1] "Notably, when VOx catalysts were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface VOH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke amount could be decreased"

[2] "The incipient activity and deactivation rate turned out to be linearly relevant to the intensity of the VOH band which reflects the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. The presence of surface VOH decreases the desorption barrier of propylene and thus promotes the desorption of propylene and decreases the coke formation."

[3] "As a result, the H2 pretreatment time significantly influences the concentration of surface VOH and thus the initial activity and stability, where longer H2 pretreatment contributes to the lower deactivation rates despite the lower conversion."

[4] "By combining experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhibited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and anti-deactivation resistance."

[5] "Additionally, cofeeding H2 can effectively tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene."
