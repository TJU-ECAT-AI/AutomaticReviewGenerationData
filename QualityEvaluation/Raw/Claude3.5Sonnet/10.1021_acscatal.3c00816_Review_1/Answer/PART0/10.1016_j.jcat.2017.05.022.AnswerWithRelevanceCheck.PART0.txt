          "VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

"Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen"

"VOx/MCM-41, which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts"

"Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

"Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."

"Besides activity and selectivity, the rate of catalyst deactivation is also influenced by mean number of VOV bonds; deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with rising degree of aggregation of VOx species."

"For both propane and isobutane DH, an increase in TOF with increasing reduction and reaction temperature was observed"

"VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for their activity, selectivity, and onstream stability in the DH of propane and isobutane with the aim to study the influence of VOx site density on the catalytic performance."

"For propane DH, the selectivity to propene at propane conversion of about 12% is only marginal influenced by the number of VOV bonds. Besides propene, which was formed with a selectivity of about 90%, small amounts of cracking products (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and coke were also detected."

"Isolated VOx sites in VOx/MCM-41 catalysts were established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."

"V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites. Their Lewis acidity increases with decreasing number of VOV bonds around a central V cation which is the origin of higher activity of isolated VOx sites."

"Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species."

"VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5"

"VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

"VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species"

"Isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activity in comparison with their oligomerized counterparts. However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions."

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The main advantages include:

1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity, performing similarly to industrial CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Improved structural properties: MCM-41 allows for highly dispersed VOx species, which contributes to enhanced catalytic behavior.

3. Active sites: V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with Lewis acidity increasing as the number of V-O-V bonds decreases.

4. Resistance to deactivation: Isolated VOx species show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species.

The reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes at Lewis-acidic V atoms. Performance is influenced by several factors:

1. VOx site density and dispersion: Isolated VOx sites show higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to aggregated species.

2. Reduction temperature: Increasing reduction and reaction temperatures lead to higher TOF values for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

3. Support effect: MCM-41, as an ordered mesoporous silica support, allows for better control of VOx site density and distribution compared to traditional supports.

Limitations include:

1. Formation of cracking products and coke, although in small amounts.
2. Lower selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation due to increased cracking and isomerization reactions, especially for isolated VOx sites.

In conclusion, MCM-41 supported VOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions, with isolated VOx sites providing the best overall performance due to their higher intrinsic activity and resistance to deactivation.

          金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41负载的VOx，与传统的金属氧化物载体相比，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出良好的性能。主要优势包括：

1. 更高的活性和选择性：VOx/MCM-41催化剂表现出良好的在线稳定性和高选择性，性能类似于工业用CrOx/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂。

2. 改进的结构特性：MCM-41允许高度分散的VOx物种，这有助于增强催化行为。

3. 活性位点：V4+和V3+物种被确定为催化活性位点，随着V-O-V键数量的减少，其路易斯酸性增强。

4. 抗失活能力：与聚集态物种相比，孤立的VOx物种表现出更高的抗失活能力。

反应机理涉及在路易斯酸性V原子上活化烷烃。性能受几个因素影响：

1. VOx位点密度和分散度：与聚集态物种相比，孤立的VOx位点表现出更高的转化频率（TOF）。

2. 还原温度：提高还原和反应温度会导致丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的TOF值增加。

3. 载体效应：作为有序介孔二氧化硅载体，MCM-41与传统载体相比，能更好地控制VOx位点密度和分布。

局限性包括：

1. 形成裂解产物和焦炭，尽管数量较少。
2. 在异丁烷脱氢中选择性较低，由于增加了裂解和异构化反应，特别是对于孤立的VOx位点。

总之，MCM-41负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中在活性、选择性和稳定性方面具有优势，其中孤立VOx位点由于具有更高的本征活性和抗失活能力，提供了最佳的整体性能。
