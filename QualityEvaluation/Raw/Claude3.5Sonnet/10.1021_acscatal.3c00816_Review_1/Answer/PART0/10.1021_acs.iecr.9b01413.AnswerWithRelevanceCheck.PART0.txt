          "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."

"PtSn based catalysts could efficiently catalyze the direct dehydrogenation of propane, while the catalyst deactivation and the long-term stability issues are still the big challenges even for the aforementioned commercial catalysts."

"The amorphous supports such as Al2O3 (2123) and SiO2, (24,25) the molecule sieves like ZSM-5, (2628) SBA-15, (2932) MCM-41, (33) and silicalite-1, (34,35) the mixed metal oxides like MgAlOx derived from the layered double hydroxides precursors (36,37) have been investigated."

"The results showed that the nature of support could significantly affect the catalytic activity and the catalytic stability, and the coke deposition was much easier to occur over the acidic supports rather than the neutral or basic ones."

"Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene"

"The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

"The introduction of promotors favored generation of more lattice oxygen which acted as the key role in activating the CH bonds in propane for the production of propylene, resulting in the improvements in initial catalytic activity and in the yield of desired product."

"Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation."

          While the provided answers do not specifically compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), they offer relevant insights into metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts and PDH reactions:

1. Structural properties: OMS supports like SBA-15 provide high surface area and uniform pore structure, allowing good dispersion of active sites.

2. Catalytic behavior: The nature of the support significantly affects catalytic activity and stability. Addition of promoters can influence reducibility, basicity, surface metal content, and stability of metal particles.

3. Advantages: OMS supports can provide better dispersion of active metal species compared to traditional supports.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in activating C-H bonds in propane, leading to improved initial catalytic activity and propylene yield.

5. Factors influencing performance:
   - Redox properties
   - Resistance to sintering
   - Resistance to coke deposition
   - Lattice oxygen capacity
   - Acidity/basicity of the support

6. Deactivation: Main causes are sintering of active phases and coke deposition. Acidic supports are more prone to coke formation than neutral or basic ones.

7. H2 pretreatment: While not explicitly discussed, catalyst reduction before reaction is mentioned, suggesting the importance of H2 pretreatment in activating the catalyst.

The studies demonstrate that tailoring the composition and properties of metal-OMS catalysts through promoter addition and support modification can significantly improve their performance and stability in PDH reactions.

          尽管提供的答案没有具体比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现，但它们提供了关于金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂和PDH反应的相关见解：

1. 结构特性：SBA-15等OMS载体提供了高比表面积和均匀的孔结构，有利于活性位的良好分散。

2. 催化行为：载体的性质显著影响催化活性和稳定性。添加助剂可以影响可还原性、碱性、表面金属含量和金属粒子的稳定性。

3. 优势：与传统载体相比，OMS载体可以提供更好的活性金属物种分散。

4. 反应机理：晶格氧在活化丙烷的C-H键中起关键作用，从而提高初始催化活性和丙烯产率。

5. 影响性能的因素：
   - 氧化还原性能
   - 抗烧结能力
   - 抗积碳能力
   - 晶格氧容量
   - 载体的酸碱性

6. 失活：主要原因是活性相的烧结和积碳沉积。酸性载体比中性或碱性载体更容易形成积碳。

7. H2预处理：虽然没有明确讨论，但提到了反应前的催化剂还原，表明H2预处理对催化剂活化很重要。

这些研究表明，通过添加助剂和改性载体来调整金属-OMS催化剂的组成和性质，可以显著提高它们在PDH反应中的性能和稳定性。
