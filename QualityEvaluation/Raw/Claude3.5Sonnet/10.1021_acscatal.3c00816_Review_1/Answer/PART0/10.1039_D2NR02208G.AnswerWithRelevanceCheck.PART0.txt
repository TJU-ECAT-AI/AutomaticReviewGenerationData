          [1] "He and colleagues employed an MCM-41 support with different loadings of Cr to explore its influence on the PDH process. The obtained catalysts revealed high loading of Cr bringing about the reduction of SiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of the inactive Cr(iii) species."

[2] "Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis."

[3] "Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH."

[4] "Sokolov et al. designed a series of supports with different acidity levels to support single layer VOx components for catalyzing the PDH reaction. The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst."

[5] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction."

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their main advantages stem from their well-defined porous structure, large surface area, and ability to highly disperse active metal species.

Structural properties:
1. High surface area and well-defined pore structure
2. Better dispersion of active metal species
3. Enhanced stability due to the ordered mesoporous structure

Catalytic behavior:
1. CrOx/MCM-41: High Cr loading reduces surface hydroxyl groups, leading to inactive Cr(III) species. Optimal Cr loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.
2. VOx/SiO2: Low polymeric VOx species act as the major active centers. Adequate VOx loading and high dispersion are critical for excellent PDH performance.

Advantages over traditional supports:
1. Better control over metal dispersion and pore structure
2. Improved optimization of active site accessibility
3. Enhanced reactant/product diffusion

Limitations:
1. Potential pore blockage due to coke formation
2. Possible metal leaching under harsh reaction conditions
3. Need for careful optimization of metal loading and preparation methods

Reaction mechanism:
The mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of supported metal oxide species (V or Cr), with lattice oxygen participating in hydrogen abstraction from propane. Regeneration of reduced metal sites occurs through gas-phase oxygen or lattice oxygen migration.

Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation:
1. Lattice oxygen species: Play a crucial role in the redox cycle and overall catalytic activity
2. H2 pretreatment: Can enhance metal-support interactions, improving stability and anti-coking properties
3. Surface acidity: Higher acidity leads to increased coking tendency
4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions enhance stability and resist sintering

Catalyst deactivation:
1. Primarily due to coke formation and sintering of active metal species
2. The ordered porous structure may help mitigate sintering to some extent
3. Controlling surface acidity and optimizing metal-support interactions are key to minimizing coke formation and maintaining long-term catalyst stability

In conclusion, while OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show great potential for PDH reactions, careful optimization of catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.

          金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比传统金属氧化物载体更优越的性能。它们的主要优势源于其明确的多孔结构、大比表面积以及能够高度分散活性金属物种的能力。

结构特性：
1. 高比表面积和明确的孔结构
2. 更好地分散活性金属物种
3. 由于有序介孔结构而提高的稳定性

催化行为：
1. CrOx/MCM-41：高Cr负载量会减少表面羟基，导致形成不活性的Cr(III)物种。优化Cr负载量对于维持催化剂活性至关重要。
2. VOx/SiO2：低聚合度的VOx物种作为主要活性中心。适当的VOx负载量和VOx物种的高分散度对于获得优异的PDH性能至关重要。

相对于传统载体的优势：
1. 更好地控制金属分散和孔结构
2. 改善活性位点可及性的优化
3. 增强反应物/产物的扩散

局限性：
1. 由于积炭形成可能导致孔阻塞
2. 在苛刻的反应条件下金属可能流失
3. 需要仔细优化金属负载量和制备方法

反应机理：
机理可能涉及负载的金属氧化物物种（V或Cr）的氧化还原循环，晶格氧参与从丙烷中提取氢。还原的金属位点通过气相氧或晶格氧迁移进行再生。

影响催化剂性能和失活的因素：
1. 晶格氧物种：在氧化还原循环和整体催化活性中起关键作用
2. H2预处理：可以增强金属-载体相互作用，提高稳定性和抗积炭性能
3. 表面酸性：酸性越高，积炭倾向越大
4. 金属-载体相互作用：强相互作用增强稳定性并抵抗烧结

催化剂失活：
1. 主要由于积炭形成和活性金属物种的烧结
2. 有序的孔结构可能在一定程度上有助于减轻烧结
3. 控制表面酸性和优化金属-载体相互作用是最小化积炭形成和维持催化剂长期稳定性的关键

总之，虽然OMS负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中显示出巨大潜力，但仔细优化催化剂组成、制备方法和反应条件对于最大化其优势和克服局限性至关重要。
