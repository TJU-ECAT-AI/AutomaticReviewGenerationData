2. The degree of dispersion of V species on the catalyst surface mainly determines the catalytic activity towards propene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.05.024].
3. For VOx-based catalysts, different V-O bonds exhibit varying C-H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers [10.1039/D0CS00814A].

Advantages:
1. Higher activity and selectivity compared to traditional supports [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022].
2. Improved stability and regenerability, especially for VOx/MCM-41 [10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005].
3. Reduced coke formation, leading to more stable performance over longer periods [10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005].

Limitations and challenges:
1. Fast deactivation, especially for CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_1].
2. Formation of less active Cr2O3 particles at higher loadings on SBA-15 [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].
3. Potential pore blockage due to coke formation [10.1039/D2NR02208G].

Factors influencing performance and deactivation:
1. Metal loading and dispersion: Optimal metal loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity [10.1002/cctc.201801598].
2. Redox properties: The redox cycle between active metal species plays a role in catalytic activity [10.1002/cctc.201801598].
3. H2 pretreatment: Can enhance metal-support interactions, improving stability and anti-coking properties [10.1039/D2NR02208G].
4. Lattice oxygen capacity: Plays an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01413].

In conclusion, while OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show great potential for PDH reactions, careful optimization of catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions represents a significant advancement in catalysis research. The unique structural properties of OMS materials, combined with the catalytic activity of supported VOx and CrOx species, offer a promising avenue for improving PDH processes.

Future research directions may focus on:

1. Tailoring OMS structures: Developing novel OMS materials with optimized pore sizes, wall thicknesses, and surface properties to further enhance metal dispersion and stability.

2. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilizing in-situ and operando spectroscopic methods to gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites during PDH reactions.

3. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring the incorporation of additional promoters or co-catalysts to further improve activity, selectivity, and stability.

4. Catalyst regeneration strategies: Developing more efficient regeneration methods to prolong catalyst lifetime and reduce operational costs.

5. Theoretical modeling: Employing advanced computational techniques to predict catalyst behavior and guide rational catalyst design.

6. Scale-up and industrial implementation: Addressing challenges related to large-scale production and long-term stability of OMS-supported catalysts in industrial settings.

By addressing these areas, researchers can work towards developing next-generation PDH catalysts that overcome current limitations and potentially revolutionize propylene production processes.
