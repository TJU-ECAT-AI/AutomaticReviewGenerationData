Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts offer several advantages due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior.

Structural properties:
1. High surface area: OMS materials provide a larger surface area for active site dispersion, potentially increasing catalyst efficiency [10.1016/j.mcat.2021.112081].
2. Ordered pore structure: The well-defined mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, potentially improving catalytic activity [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62805-5].
3. Enhanced metal dispersion: The uniform pore structure of OMS supports can lead to better dispersion of VOx and CrOx species, potentially increasing the number of active sites [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.05.024].
4. Thermal stability: OMS materials generally exhibit good thermal stability, which is crucial for PDH reactions that occur at high temperatures [10.1016/j.mcat.2021.112081].

Catalytic behavior:
1. Higher activity and selectivity: VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit good on-stream stability and high selectivity, performing similarly to industrial CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022].
2. Active sites: For VOx catalysts, V4+ and V3+ species are identified as the catalytically active sites, with Lewis acidity increasing as the number of V-O-V bonds decreases [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022]. For CrOx catalysts, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3 [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].
3. Resistance to deactivation: Isolated VOx species show higher resistance to deactivation compared to aggregated species [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022].

Reaction mechanisms:
The PDH reaction over VOx/OMS catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the nature of the V-O bonds present on the surface [10.039/D0CS00814A]. For CrOx catalysts, active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, with Cr typically in the (III) oxidation state [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].

Factors influencing performance:
1. Metal loading and dispersion: Optimal metal loading is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity and stability [10.1002/cctc.201801598].
2. Lattice oxygen species: Play a crucial role in the redox cycle and overall catalytic activity [10.021/acscatal.3c00816\_1].
3. H2 pretreatment: Can enhance metal-support interactions, improving stability and anti-coking properties [10.039/D2NR02208G].
4. Support acidity: Lower acidity of OMS supports contributes to better anticoking capacity [10.021/acscatal.3c00816\_1].

Limitations and challenges:
1. Deactivation: The main causes are sintering of active phases and coke deposition [10.021/acs.iecr.9b01413].
2. Balance between activity and stability: Oxidized species are more active but less stable than reduced species [10.021/acscatal.3c00816\_1].

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer significant advantages in PDH reactions due to their structural properties and catalytic behavior. However, optimizing catalyst composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions is crucial to maximize their advantages and overcome limitations.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions represents a significant advancement in catalyst design. The unique structural properties of these materials, combined with the catalytic activity of supported VOx and CrOx species, offer a promising avenue for improving PDH processes.

Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Tailoring OMS structures: Developing novel OMS materials with optimized pore sizes, wall thicknesses, and surface properties to further enhance metal dispersion and catalyst stability.

2. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilizing in-situ and operando spectroscopic methods to gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites during PDH reactions.

3. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring the incorporation of additional promoters or co-catalysts within the OMS framework to create synergistic effects that enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.

4. Computational modeling: Employing advanced computational techniques to predict and design optimal catalyst compositions and structures for PDH reactions.

5. Sustainable catalyst production: Investigating eco-friendly synthesis methods for OMS catalysts to reduce the environmental impact of catalyst production.

6. Process intensification: Developing innovative reactor designs that capitalize on the unique properties of OMS catalysts to improve overall process efficiency and economics.

7. Regeneration strategies: Exploring novel approaches for in-situ catalyst regeneration to extend catalyst lifetime and reduce operational costs.

By addressing these areas, researchers can potentially overcome the current limitations of OMS-supported catalysts and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable PDH processes in the future.

Reaction Mechanisms:
The PDH reaction over VOx and CrOx catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, followed by the desorption of propylene. Lattice oxygen species participate in the initial stages of the reaction, particularly for oxidized catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_1].

Factors Influencing Performance:
1. Metal loading and dispersion: Optimal metal loading is crucial for maintaining high catalytic activity and stability [10.1002/cctc.201801598].
2. Redox properties: The reducibility of metal species affects catalyst performance [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01413].
3. Support acidity: Lower acidity of OMS supports contributes to reduced coke formation [10.1016/j.cej.2019.122423].
4. H2 pretreatment: Reduction of catalysts can affect the oxidation state of metal species and influence catalyst performance [10.1016/j.micromeso.2021.111187].

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer significant advantages in PDH reactions due to their structural properties and ability to highly disperse active metal species. However, challenges such as deactivation and optimal metal loading still need to be addressed for their widespread application.
