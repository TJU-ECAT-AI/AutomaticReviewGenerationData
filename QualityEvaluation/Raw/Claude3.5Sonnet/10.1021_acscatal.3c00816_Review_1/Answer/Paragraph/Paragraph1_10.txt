Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts have gained significant attention in the field of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural properties and enhanced catalytic performance. Among the various OMS materials, MCM-41 and SBA-15 have emerged as prominent support structures for active metal species such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and chromium oxide (CrOx). These catalysts offer several advantages, including high surface area, uniform pore distribution, and improved metal dispersion, which contribute to their superior activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The reaction mechanism typically involves the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface, followed by C-H bond activation and subsequent desorption of propylene. VOx-based catalysts generally exhibit higher initial activity, while CrOx catalysts often demonstrate better stability and resistance to deactivation. However, challenges persist, such as coke formation, sintering of metal particles, and maintaining long-term stability under industrial conditions. Comparative analysis of these catalysts reveals that the choice between MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports, as well as the selection of VOx or CrOx active species, depends on specific process requirements and desired performance characteristics. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing catalyst composition, improving regeneration strategies, and developing novel synthesis methods to enhance the overall efficiency and longevity of OMS catalysts in PDH applications.
