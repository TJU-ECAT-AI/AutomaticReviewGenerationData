However, some insights can be drawn regarding metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts in PDH reactions:\n\n1. Structural properties: SBA-15 supports offer high specific surface areas and well-ordered mesoporous structures, which can improve metal dispersion and confinement of metal particles within the channels. The incorporation of metal species (Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix does not significantly alter the mesoporous characteristics of the support.\n\n2. Catalyst preparation: A one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating Sn into SBA-15 showed better performance compared to the traditional impregnation method. This resulted in stronger interactions between metal species and the support.\n\n3. Catalytic behavior: The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent performance in PDH, with 43.8% propane conversion and 98.5% propene selectivity. This performance was superior to that of the traditionally impregnated catalyst (Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM).\n\n4. Advantages: Metal-OMS catalysts demonstrate improved metal dispersion, enhanced interactions between metal species and support, and better stabilization of active sites. These factors contribute to higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional supports.\n\n5. Reaction mechanisms: The study suggests the presence of two types of active sites (M1 and M2) on the catalyst surface. M2 sites, formed by Pt particles anchored on SnOx surfaces, are the main active sites for PDH and are promoted by the incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 structure.\n\n6. Influence of metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (Sn) and the support help maintain the oxidation states of the metal during the reaction, which is crucial for catalyst performance and stability.\n\n7. Deactivation: Coke formation was a major cause of catalyst deactivation. The Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts showed lower coke deposition compared to the impregnated catalyst, indicating better resistance to deactivation. Excessive Sn content decreased catalyst stability.\n\n8. H2 pretreatment: The catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 at 500°C for 1 hour before the reaction, which likely affected the oxidation state of the metal species and their interactions with the support.\n\nWhile the study does not directly address lattice oxygen species or compare performance to traditional metal oxide supports for PDH reactions, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and the oxidation states of metal species in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62805-5"},
