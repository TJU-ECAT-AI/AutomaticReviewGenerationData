The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for PDH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in comparison to traditional supports.

The document mentions that mesoporous silica is commonly used as a support for PDH catalysts. It highlights a novel type of support - dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) - which is described as superior to common mesoporous silica supports like HMS, MCM-41, and SBA-15. 

The advantages of DMSNs include:
1. Large pore entrance
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Good accessibility of active sites
5. Fast diffusion of reactants and products in large interconnected mesopores

The literature provides a comparison of Sn-DMSNs catalysts to Sn-HMS catalysts, showing that Sn-DMSNs have a significantly higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation. This is attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs compared to the small 3 nm pores of HMS.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the document briefly mentions the influence of Sn-O-Si bonds and local structure on catalyst performance. It notes that reduction and reaction processes can lead to near-surface enrichment of SnOx species, enhancing the accessibility of active sites.

The literature does not specifically discuss lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or deactivation mechanisms for VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 or SBA-15 supports in PDH reactions.

该文献并未对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能进行全面分析。但是,它确实讨论了金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂与传统载体相比的一些方面。

文献提到介孔二氧化硅常用作PDH催化剂的载体。它强调了一种新型载体 - 树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米粒子(DMSNs),被描述为优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体,如HMS、MCM-41和SBA-15。

DMSNs的优点包括:
1. 大孔入口
2. 均匀的单分散纳米粒子结构
3. 抗孔道堵塞
4. 活性位点可及性好
5. 在大的互连介孔中反应物和产物分子扩散快

文献对Sn-DMSNs催化剂和Sn-HMS催化剂进行了比较,表明Sn-DMSNs具有显著更高的丙烯生成转化频率(TOF)。这归因于DMSNs较大的孔径,相比之下HMS的孔径只有3纳米。

关于反应机理,文献简要提到了Sn-O-Si键和局部结构对催化剂性能的影响。它指出,还原和反应过程可导致SnOx物种在表面附近富集,增强了活性位点的可及性。

文献没有具体讨论MCM-41或SBA-15载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的晶格氧物种、H2预处理或失活机理。

文献没有直接比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，它确实讨论了介孔二氧化硅载体以及一种新型树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米粒子(DMSN)载体对PDH催化剂的一些优势。

MCM-41和SBA-15等介孔二氧化硅载体具有高比表面积、规则结构、相对较高的热稳定性和弱酸性等优点。这些特性使它们成为适合PDH催化剂的载体。

新型DMSN载体被描述为优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体，如MCM-41和SBA-15，这是由于其大孔入口和均匀的单分散纳米粒子结构。这种结构在反应过程中提供了更好的活性位点可及性和大互连介孔中反应物和产物的更快扩散。

对于基于Sn的催化剂，DMSN载体与其他二氧化硅载体（如Sn/SiO2和Sn-HMS）相比，显示出更高的催化活性（以转化频率衡量）。这被归因于DMSNs较大的孔径，相比HMS的小3 nm孔径。

文献没有讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂在这些载体上的具体反应机理、晶格氧物种的作用，或H2预处理的影响。它也没有详细讨论这些特定催化剂系统的失活机理。

The literature does not specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH reactions:

Mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 are commonly used for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, high thermal stability, and weak acidity. These properties make them advantageous compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

A novel type of mesoporous silica support - dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) - is highlighted as superior to common mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 and SBA-15. DMSNs have larger pore entrances and a uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, providing better accessibility to active sites and faster diffusion of reactants/products in the interconnected mesopores.

For Sn-based catalysts supported on DMSNs, highly dispersed SnOx species are identified as the active sites for propane activation and propylene formation, rather than polymeric or crystalline SnO2. The interaction between the metal and support (SnO-Si bonds) plays an important role in catalyst performance.

The reduction and reaction processes can modify the metal-support interaction and local catalyst structure, leading to near-surface enrichment of active metal species and enhanced accessibility of active sites.

While not directly addressing VOx and CrOx catalysts, these insights suggest that the ordered mesoporous structure, metal dispersion, and metal-support interactions are key factors influencing PDH catalyst performance. The literature does not discuss specific reaction mechanisms or the roles of lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment for these systems.

The literature does not provide a detailed comparison of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does discuss some advantages of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) over traditional ordered mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15.

DMSNs are reported to be superior to common mesoporous silica supports like HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their unique central-radial pore structure. This structure provides large pore entrances and a uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which improves accessibility of active sites and facilitates faster diffusion of reactants and products in the interconnected mesopores during reaction. The DMSNs are less prone to pore blockage compared to traditional supports.

In terms of catalytic performance, Sn-DMSNs catalysts showed higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation compared to Sn-HMS catalysts. The Sn-DMSNs catalyst achieved a TOF of 0.021 s^-1, which was significantly higher than Sn-HMS catalysts with high surface area but smaller pore diameters of 3 nm. 

The reaction mechanism described involves the interaction of surface Sn-O-Si bonds with adsorbed propane. Hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the propane by bridging oxygen active sites to form isopropyl-Sn intermediates and surface silanol groups. These intermediates then undergo β-hydrogen cleavage to produce propene, while hydrogen molecules are generated from the silanol groups and Sn-O-Si bonds are restored.

While the literature does not specifically discuss factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it does mention that the strength of metal-support interactions (e.g. Sn-O-Si bonds) and the generation of oxygen vacancies play important roles in catalyst performance for PDH reactions.

In summary, while direct comparisons to VOx and CrOx catalysts are not provided, the literature suggests that novel mesoporous silica supports like DMSNs can offer advantages over traditional ordered mesoporous silicas in terms of pore structure, accessibility, and catalytic performance for PDH reactions. However, more specific research would be needed to fully compare these different catalyst systems.

文献没有提供MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的详细比较。但是，它确实讨论了树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米颗粒(DMSNs)相对于传统有序介孔二氧化硅载体如MCM-41和SBA-15的一些优势。

据报道，DMSNs由于其独特的中心辐射孔结构，优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体，如HMS、MCM-41和SBA-15。这种结构提供了大孔入口和均匀的单分散纳米颗粒结构，改善了活性位点的可及性，并在反应过程中促进了反应物和产物在互连介孔中的快速扩散。与传统载体相比，DMSNs不易发生孔道堵塞。

在催化性能方面，Sn-DMSNs催化剂显示出比Sn-HMS催化剂更高的丙烯生成转换频率(TOF)。Sn-DMSNs催化剂达到了0.021 s^-1的TOF，这明显高于具有高比表面积但孔径较小(3 nm)的Sn-HMS催化剂。

所描述的反应机理涉及表面Sn-O-Si键与吸附丙烷的相互作用。氢原子被桥接氧活性位点从丙烷中抽离，形成异丙基-Sn中间体和表面硅醇基团。这些中间体随后经过β-氢裂解产生丙烯，同时从硅醇基团生成氢分子，并恢复Sn-O-Si键。

虽然文献没有具体讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂的晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素，但确实提到金属-载体相互作用（如Sn-O-Si键）的强度和氧空位的生成在PDH反应的催化剂性能中起重要作用。

总之，虽然没有提供与VOx和CrOx催化剂的直接比较，但文献表明，像DMSNs这样的新型介孔二氧化硅载体在孔结构、可及性和PDH反应的催化性能方面可以提供优于传统有序介孔二氧化硅的优势。然而，需要更具体的研究才能全面比较这些不同的催化剂系统。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for PDH reactions. However, it does offer some insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in general.

Mesoporous silica materials are commonly used as supports for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, and relatively high thermal stability. The novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) are highlighted as a potential superior support compared to traditional mesoporous silicas like HMS, MCM-41, and SBA-15.

The advantages of DMSNs include:
1. Large pore entrance
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Good accessibility of active sites
5. Fast diffusion of reactants and products in large interconnected mesopores

These properties contribute to improved catalytic performance. For example, Sn-DMSNs catalysts show higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation compared to Sn-HMS catalysts, despite the latter having a higher specific surface area. This is attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs (>3nm) compared to HMS (3nm).

The literature emphasizes that highly dispersed metal oxide species (e.g., SnOx) contribute more to propane activation and propylene formation than polymeric or crystalline species. This suggests that the support's ability to disperse and stabilize active metal species is crucial for catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

While the document does not directly address factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it implies that the interaction between metal species and the support, as well as the metal's oxidation state, play important roles in catalyst performance and stability.
