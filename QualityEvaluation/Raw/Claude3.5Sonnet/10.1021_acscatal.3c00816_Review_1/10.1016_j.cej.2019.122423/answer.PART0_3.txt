[1] "Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions"

[2] "Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

[3] "It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

[4] "Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

[5] "In the reaction process, the surface SnOSi bonds react with the adsorbed propane, the hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the methylene by the bridging oxygen active sites and then form the isopropyl-Sn intermediate species and the surface silanol groups. The isopropyl intermediate species are further abstracted by the β-hydrogen cleavage to yield propene, meanwhile, the hydrogen molecules is generated from the surface silanol groups and then SnOSi bonds are recovered"

The literature does not provide a detailed comparison of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does discuss some advantages of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) over traditional ordered mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15.

DMSNs are reported to be superior to common mesoporous silica supports like HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their unique central-radial pore structure. This structure provides large pore entrances and a uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which improves accessibility of active sites and facilitates faster diffusion of reactants and products in the interconnected mesopores during reaction. The DMSNs are less prone to pore blockage compared to traditional supports.

In terms of catalytic performance, Sn-DMSNs catalysts showed higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation compared to Sn-HMS catalysts. The Sn-DMSNs catalyst achieved a TOF of 0.021 s^-1, which was significantly higher than Sn-HMS catalysts with high surface area but smaller pore diameters of 3 nm. 

The reaction mechanism described involves the interaction of surface Sn-O-Si bonds with adsorbed propane. Hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the propane by bridging oxygen active sites to form isopropyl-Sn intermediates and surface silanol groups. These intermediates then undergo β-hydrogen cleavage to produce propene, while hydrogen molecules are generated from the silanol groups and Sn-O-Si bonds are restored.

While the literature does not specifically discuss factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts, it does mention that the strength of metal-support interactions (e.g. Sn-O-Si bonds) and the generation of oxygen vacancies play important roles in catalyst performance for PDH reactions.

In summary, while direct comparisons to VOx and CrOx catalysts are not provided, the literature suggests that novel mesoporous silica supports like DMSNs can offer advantages over traditional ordered mesoporous silicas in terms of pore structure, accessibility, and catalytic performance for PDH reactions. However, more specific research would be needed to fully compare these different catalyst systems.

文献没有提供MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的详细比较。但是，它确实讨论了树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米颗粒(DMSNs)相对于传统有序介孔二氧化硅载体如MCM-41和SBA-15的一些优势。

据报道，DMSNs由于其独特的中心辐射孔结构，优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体，如HMS、MCM-41和SBA-15。这种结构提供了大孔入口和均匀的单分散纳米颗粒结构，改善了活性位点的可及性，并在反应过程中促进了反应物和产物在互连介孔中的快速扩散。与传统载体相比，DMSNs不易发生孔道堵塞。

在催化性能方面，Sn-DMSNs催化剂显示出比Sn-HMS催化剂更高的丙烯生成转换频率(TOF)。Sn-DMSNs催化剂达到了0.021 s^-1的TOF，这明显高于具有高比表面积但孔径较小(3 nm)的Sn-HMS催化剂。

所描述的反应机理涉及表面Sn-O-Si键与吸附丙烷的相互作用。氢原子被桥接氧活性位点从丙烷中抽离，形成异丙基-Sn中间体和表面硅醇基团。这些中间体随后经过β-氢裂解产生丙烯，同时从硅醇基团生成氢分子，并恢复Sn-O-Si键。

虽然文献没有具体讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂的晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素，但确实提到金属-载体相互作用（如Sn-O-Si键）的强度和氧空位的生成在PDH反应的催化剂性能中起重要作用。

总之，虽然没有提供与VOx和CrOx催化剂的直接比较，但文献表明，像DMSNs这样的新型介孔二氧化硅载体在孔结构、可及性和PDH反应的催化性能方面可以提供优于传统有序介孔二氧化硅的优势。然而，需要更具体的研究才能全面比较这些不同的催化剂系统。
