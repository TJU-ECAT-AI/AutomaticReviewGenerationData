The literature does not specifically discuss VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide some relevant insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts for PDH reactions:

Mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 are commonly used for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, high thermal stability, and weak acidity. These properties make them advantageous compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

A novel type of mesoporous silica support - dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) - is highlighted as superior to common mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 and SBA-15. DMSNs have larger pore entrances and a uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, providing better accessibility to active sites and faster diffusion of reactants/products in the interconnected mesopores.

For Sn-based catalysts supported on DMSNs, highly dispersed SnOx species are identified as the active sites for propane activation and propylene formation, rather than polymeric or crystalline SnO2. The interaction between the metal and support (SnO-Si bonds) plays an important role in catalyst performance.

The reduction and reaction processes can modify the metal-support interaction and local catalyst structure, leading to near-surface enrichment of active metal species and enhanced accessibility of active sites.

While not directly addressing VOx and CrOx catalysts, these insights suggest that the ordered mesoporous structure, metal dispersion, and metal-support interactions are key factors influencing PDH catalyst performance. The literature does not discuss specific reaction mechanisms or the roles of lattice oxygen and H2 pretreatment for these systems.

该文献没有具体讨论MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。但是,它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂用于PDH反应的相关见解:

MCM-41和SBA-15等介孔二氧化硅载体由于具有高比表面积、规则结构、高热稳定性和弱酸性而常用于PDH催化剂。这些特性使它们比传统的金属氧化物载体更具优势。

文献强调了一种新型介孔二氧化硅载体 - 树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米颗粒(DMSNs) - 优于常见的介孔二氧化硅如MCM-41和SBA-15。DMSNs具有更大的孔道入口和均匀的单分散纳米颗粒结构,可以提供更好的活性位点可及性和反应物/产物在互连介孔中的更快扩散。

对于以DMSNs为载体的Sn基催化剂,高度分散的SnOx物种被确定为丙烷活化和丙烯形成的活性位点,而不是聚合物或晶态SnO2。金属与载体之间的相互作用(SnO-Si键)在催化剂性能中起重要作用。

还原和反应过程可以改变金属-载体相互作用和局部催化剂结构,导致活性金属物种在近表面富集,增强活性位点的可及性。

虽然没有直接讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂,但这些见解表明,有序介孔结构、金属分散度和金属-载体相互作用是影响PDH催化剂性能的关键因素。文献没有讨论这些体系的具体反应机理或晶格氧和H2预处理的作用。
