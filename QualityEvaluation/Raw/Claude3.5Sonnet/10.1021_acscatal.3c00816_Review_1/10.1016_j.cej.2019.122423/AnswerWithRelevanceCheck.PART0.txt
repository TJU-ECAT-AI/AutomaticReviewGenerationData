          "Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions, which has many advantages including high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability and weak acidity."

"Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

"It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

"Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s−1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

"The highly dispersed SnOx species rather than polymeric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species contribute to the activation of propane and formation of propylene."

"The reduction and reaction processes also influence the SnOSi bonds and local structure of catalysts, which induces the near-surface enrichment of SnOx species. It enhances the accessibility of the SnOx active sites."

"In the reaction process, the surface SnOSi bonds react with the adsorbed propane, the hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the methylene by the bridging oxygen active sites and then form the isopropyl-Sn intermediate species and the surface silanol groups. The isopropyl intermediate species are further abstracted by the β-hydrogen cleavage to yield propene, meanwhile, the hydrogen molecules is generated from the surface silanol groups and then SnOSi bonds are recovered"

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it offers insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly focusing on a novel support called dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs).

Mesoporous silica supports, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, are commonly used for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, high thermal stability, and weak acidity. DMSNs are highlighted as superior to traditional mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their unique central-radial pore structure, which provides:

1. Large pore entrances
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Better accessibility of active sites
5. Faster diffusion of reactants and products in interconnected mesopores

For Sn-based catalysts, DMSNs showed higher catalytic activity (measured by turnover frequency) compared to other silica supports. This was attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs.

The reaction mechanism described involves:
1. Interaction of surface Sn-O-Si bonds with adsorbed propane
2. Hydrogen abstraction by bridging oxygen active sites
3. Formation of isopropyl-Sn intermediates and surface silanol groups
4. β-hydrogen cleavage to produce propene
5. Generation of hydrogen molecules from silanol groups
6. Recovery of Sn-O-Si bonds

Highly dispersed metal oxide species (e.g., SnOx) are identified as more active for propane activation and propylene formation compared to polymeric or crystalline species. The metal-support interaction and local catalyst structure play important roles in performance, with reduction and reaction processes influencing these factors.

While not directly addressing VOx and CrOx catalysts, these insights suggest that the ordered mesoporous structure, metal dispersion, and metal-support interactions are key factors influencing PDH catalyst performance. The literature does not specifically discuss the roles of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment for these systems.

          该文献没有针对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中进行全面分析。然而，它提供了关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂的见解，特别关注了一种称为树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米颗粒(DMSNs)的新型载体。

介孔二氧化硅载体（包括MCM-41和SBA-15）由于具有高比表面积、规则结构、高热稳定性和弱酸性而常用于PDH催化剂。DMSNs被强调为优于传统介孔二氧化硅（如MCM-41和SBA-15），这是由于其独特的中心辐射孔结构，提供了：

1. 大孔入口
2. 均匀的单分散纳米颗粒结构
3. 抗孔道堵塞
4. 更好的活性位点可及性
5. 反应物和产物在互连介孔中的更快扩散

对于Sn基催化剂，DMSNs显示出比其他二氧化硅载体更高的催化活性（以转化频率衡量）。这归因于DMSNs较大的孔径。

描述的反应机理包括：
1. 表面Sn-O-Si键与吸附丙烷的相互作用
2. 桥接氧活性位点进行氢抽提
3. 形成异丙基-Sn中间体和表面硅醇基团
4. β-氢裂解产生丙烯
5. 从硅醇基团生成氢分子
6. 恢复Sn-O-Si键

高度分散的金属氧化物物种（如SnOx）被确定为比聚合物或晶态物种更活跃于丙烷活化和丙烯形成。金属-载体相互作用和局部催化剂结构在性能中起重要作用，还原和反应过程会影响这些因素。

虽然没有直接讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂，但这些见解表明，有序介孔结构、金属分散度和金属-载体相互作用是影响PDH催化剂性能的关键因素。文献没有具体讨论这些体系中晶格氧物种或H2预处理的作用。
