[1] "Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions"

[2] "Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

[3] "It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

[4] "Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s−1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

[5] "The reduction and reaction processes also influence the Sn−O−Si bonds and local structure of catalysts, which induces the near-surface enrichment of SnOx species. It enhances the accessibility of the SnOx active sites."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for PDH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in comparison to traditional supports.

The document mentions that mesoporous silica is commonly used as a support for PDH catalysts. It highlights a novel type of support - dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) - which is described as superior to common mesoporous silica supports like HMS, MCM-41, and SBA-15. 

The advantages of DMSNs include:
1. Large pore entrance
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Good accessibility of active sites
5. Fast diffusion of reactants and products in large interconnected mesopores

The literature provides a comparison of Sn-DMSNs catalysts to Sn-HMS catalysts, showing that Sn-DMSNs have a significantly higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation. This is attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs compared to the small 3 nm pores of HMS.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the document briefly mentions the influence of Sn-O-Si bonds and local structure on catalyst performance. It notes that reduction and reaction processes can lead to near-surface enrichment of SnOx species, enhancing the accessibility of active sites.

The literature does not specifically discuss lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, or deactivation mechanisms for VOx and CrOx catalysts on MCM-41 or SBA-15 supports in PDH reactions.

该文献并未对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能进行全面分析。但是,它确实讨论了金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂与传统载体相比的一些方面。

文献提到介孔二氧化硅常用作PDH催化剂的载体。它强调了一种新型载体 - 树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米粒子(DMSNs),被描述为优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体,如HMS、MCM-41和SBA-15。

DMSNs的优点包括:
1. 大孔入口
2. 均匀的单分散纳米粒子结构
3. 抗孔道堵塞
4. 活性位点可及性好
5. 在大的互连介孔中反应物和产物分子扩散快

文献对Sn-DMSNs催化剂和Sn-HMS催化剂进行了比较,表明Sn-DMSNs具有显著更高的丙烯生成转化频率(TOF)。这归因于DMSNs较大的孔径,相比之下HMS的孔径只有3纳米。

关于反应机理,文献简要提到了Sn-O-Si键和局部结构对催化剂性能的影响。它指出,还原和反应过程可导致SnOx物种在表面附近富集,增强了活性位点的可及性。

文献没有具体讨论MCM-41或SBA-15载体上VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的晶格氧物种、H2预处理或失活机理。
