[1] "Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions"

[2] "Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

[3] "It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

[4] "Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s−1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

[5] "The highly dispersed SnOx species rather than polymeric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species contribute to the activation of propane and formation of propylene."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for PDH reactions. However, it does offer some insights on metal-ordered mesoporous silica catalysts in general.

Mesoporous silica materials are commonly used as supports for PDH catalysts due to their high surface area, regular structure, and relatively high thermal stability. The novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) are highlighted as a potential superior support compared to traditional mesoporous silicas like HMS, MCM-41, and SBA-15.

The advantages of DMSNs include:
1. Large pore entrance
2. Uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure
3. Resistance to pore blocking
4. Good accessibility of active sites
5. Fast diffusion of reactants and products in large interconnected mesopores

These properties contribute to improved catalytic performance. For example, Sn-DMSNs catalysts show higher turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene formation compared to Sn-HMS catalysts, despite the latter having a higher specific surface area. This is attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs (>3nm) compared to HMS (3nm).

The literature emphasizes that highly dispersed metal oxide species (e.g., SnOx) contribute more to propane activation and propylene formation than polymeric or crystalline species. This suggests that the support's ability to disperse and stabilize active metal species is crucial for catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

While the document does not directly address factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, it implies that the interaction between metal species and the support, as well as the metal's oxidation state, play important roles in catalyst performance and stability.

该文献并未对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能进行全面分析。但是，它确实提供了一些关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂的见解。

介孔二氧化硅材料由于其高比表面积、规则结构和较高的热稳定性，常被用作PDH催化剂的载体。新型的树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米粒子(DMSNs)被强调为可能优于传统介孔二氧化硅如HMS、MCM-41和SBA-15的载体。

DMSNs的优点包括：
1. 大孔入口
2. 均匀的单分散纳米粒子结构
3. 不易发生孔道堵塞
4. 活性位点可及性好
5. 大的互连介孔中反应物和产物分子的快速扩散

这些特性有助于提高催化性能。例如，Sn-DMSNs催化剂显示出比Sn-HMS催化剂更高的丙烯生成转化频率(TOF)，尽管后者具有更高的比表面积。这归因于DMSNs较大的孔径(>3nm)，相比HMS的3nm。

文献强调，高度分散的金属氧化物物种（如SnOx）比聚合物或晶态物种对丙烷活化和丙烯生成的贡献更大。这表明载体分散和稳定活性金属物种的能力对PDH反应的催化性能至关重要。

虽然文档没有直接讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素，但它暗示了金属物种与载体之间的相互作用，以及金属的氧化态在催化剂性能和稳定性中起着重要作用。
