[1] "Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions, which has many advantages including high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability and weak acidity."

[2] "Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts"

[3] "It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction."

[4] "Compared with the Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS catalysts applied in the PDH reaction, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts also show high TOF of propylene formation with 0.021s1 (2.5Sn-DMSNs, φ=1.25). This is significantly larger than that of Sn-HMS catalysts which possess very high specific surface area but small pore diameter of 3nm."

The literature does not directly compare MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does discuss some advantages of mesoporous silica supports and a novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) support for PDH catalysts.

Mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer advantages including high surface area, regular structure, relatively high thermal stability, and weak acidity. These properties make them suitable supports for PDH catalysts.

The novel DMSN support is described as superior to common mesoporous silica supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to its large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure. This structure provides better accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of reactants and products in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction.

For Sn-based catalysts, the DMSN support showed higher catalytic activity (measured by turnover frequency) compared to other silica supports like Sn/SiO2 and Sn-HMS. This was attributed to the larger pore diameter of DMSNs compared to the small 3 nm pores of HMS.

The literature does not discuss specific reaction mechanisms, the role of lattice oxygen species, or the effects of H2 pretreatment for VOx and CrOx catalysts on these supports. It also does not address deactivation mechanisms in detail for these specific catalyst systems.

文献没有直接比较MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，它确实讨论了介孔二氧化硅载体以及一种新型树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米粒子(DMSN)载体对PDH催化剂的一些优势。

MCM-41和SBA-15等介孔二氧化硅载体具有高比表面积、规则结构、相对较高的热稳定性和弱酸性等优点。这些特性使它们成为适合PDH催化剂的载体。

新型DMSN载体被描述为优于常见的介孔二氧化硅载体，如MCM-41和SBA-15，这是由于其大孔入口和均匀的单分散纳米粒子结构。这种结构在反应过程中提供了更好的活性位点可及性和大互连介孔中反应物和产物的更快扩散。

对于基于Sn的催化剂，DMSN载体与其他二氧化硅载体（如Sn/SiO2和Sn-HMS）相比，显示出更高的催化活性（以转化频率衡量）。这被归因于DMSNs较大的孔径，相比HMS的小3 nm孔径。

文献没有讨论VOx和CrOx催化剂在这些载体上的具体反应机理、晶格氧物种的作用，或H2预处理的影响。它也没有详细讨论这些特定催化剂系统的失活机理。
