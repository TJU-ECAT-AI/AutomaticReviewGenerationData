[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

The literature provides some insights on VOx supported on MCM-41 and other mesoporous supports for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but does not contain comprehensive information to fully answer the question. 

VOx/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed good activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions. When this preparation method was extended to aluminosilicate supports, the resulting catalysts achieved propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance, as characterized by UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy. VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed higher initial propene selectivity (~90%) compared to VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports (<80%) in propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, SBA-15 supports, the role of lattice oxygen species, or the effects of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献对VOx负载于MCM-41和其他介孔载体上用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)提供了一些见解,但不包含全面回答问题所需的完整信息。

通过将钒酰乙酰丙酮接枝到MCM-41二氧化硅上制备的VOx/MCM-41催化剂在氧化和非氧化条件下都表现出良好的丙烷脱氢活性和选择性。当这种制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体时,得到的催化剂的丙烯产率接近工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。

VOx物种的聚合度影响催化剂性能,这可以通过紫外-可见光谱和拉曼光谱进行表征。在丙烷脱氢反应中,负载在二氧化硅(V/Si)和氧化铝(V/Al)上的VOx显示出较高的初始丙烯选择性(~90%),而负载在SiO2-Al2O3载体上的VOx选择性较低(<80%)。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx催化剂、SBA-15载体、晶格氧物种的作用,或氢气预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响等具体信息。需要进行更全面的研究才能充分解答这些问题的方面。

The literature provides limited information specifically about MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts:

VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation under both O2-lean and non-oxidative conditions. 

When this preparation method was extended to aluminosilicate supports, the resulting catalysts achieved propene yields only 25% lower than industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

The degree of polymerization of VOx species was found to be an important factor influencing catalyst performance. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization degree, with the order determined to be: V/Si < V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al.

The degree of VOx polymerization, along with surface acidity, were identified as essential properties affecting isobutene isomerization and thus indirectly impacting selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, the advantages of OMS supports over traditional metal oxides, or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现提供了有限的信息。但是,它确实讨论了VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一些方面:

通过将钒酰乙酰丙酮grafting到MCM-41二氧化硅上制备的VOx/MCM-41在贫氧和非氧化条件下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性。

当这种制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体时,所得催化剂的丙烯产率仅比工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂低25%。

VOx物种的聚合度被发现是影响催化剂性能的一个重要因素。使用UV-vis和拉曼光谱来表征聚合度,确定的顺序为:V/Si < V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al。

VOx的聚合度以及表面酸度被确定为影响异丁烯异构化从而间接影响选择性的关键性质。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx催化剂、OMS载体相对于传统金属氧化物载体的优势,或者晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的具体信息。要完整回答这个问题,需要从其他来源获取额外信息。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions as requested. However, some relevant insights can be extracted:

The study mentions that VOx supported on MCM-41 silica was active and selective in both isobutane and propane dehydrogenation under various conditions. This suggests that OMS materials like MCM-41 can be effective supports for VOx catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

The researchers extended their catalyst preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, achieving propene yields close to those of industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that OMS-supported catalysts can potentially compete with traditional metal oxide supports in terms of catalytic performance.

The distribution of VOx species and acidic properties were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. This suggests that the structural properties of the catalysts, including those supported on OMS materials, play a crucial role in their catalytic behavior.

The study investigated the effect of conversion on product selectivity by varying reaction conditions. This approach could be applied to better understand the reaction mechanisms and performance of OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions.

However, the literature does not provide specific comparisons between OMS-supported catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports, nor does it discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance in PDH reactions. More targeted research would be needed to address these aspects comprehensively.

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，可以提取一些相关的见解：

研究提到，负载在MCM-41硅胶上的VOx在各种条件下对异丁烷和丙烷脱氢都表现出活性和选择性。这表明像MCM-41这样的OMS材料可以作为脱氢反应中VOx催化剂的有效载体。

研究人员将他们的催化剂制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体上，获得的丙烯产率接近工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这表明OMS负载的催化剂在催化性能方面可能与传统的金属氧化物载体相媲美。

研究使用各种光谱技术表征了VOx物种的分布和酸性质。这表明催化剂的结构特性，包括那些负载在OMS材料上的催化剂，在其催化行为中起着至关重要的作用。

研究通过改变反应条件来研究转化率对产品选择性的影响。这种方法可以用来更好地理解OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的反应机理和性能。

然而，这篇文献没有提供OMS负载催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体之间的具体比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。需要进行更有针对性的研究才能全面解决这些方面的问题。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relevant insights can be drawn:

VOx supported on MCM-41 silica was found to be active and selective for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions. This suggests that OMS supports like MCM-41 can be effective for PDH reactions.

The preparation method using vanadyl acetylacetonate grafting was extended to aluminosilicate supports, resulting in catalysts with propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that the grafting method can produce highly active catalysts on various supports, including OMS materials.

The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance. The polymerization degree varied across different supports, with V/Si (likely MCM-41) showing the lowest degree of polymerization.

In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed high initial selectivity to propene (around 90%), while VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports were less selective (<80%). This suggests that the support material significantly impacts catalyst selectivity in PDH reactions.

The literature does not discuss specific advantages, limitations, or reaction mechanisms for OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions. It also does not mention the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation.

文献并未提供全面的信息来完整回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的问题。然而，可以得出一些相关的见解：

支持在MCM-41硅胶上的VOx被发现在氧化和非氧化条件下对丙烷脱氢都具有活性和选择性。这表明像MCM-41这样的OMS载体可能对PDH反应有效。

使用钒酰乙酰丙酮酯接枝的制备方法被扩展到铝硅酸盐载体上，产生的催化剂的丙烯产率接近工业PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这表明接枝方法可以在各种载体上产生高活性催化剂，包括OMS材料。

VOx物种的聚合度影响催化剂性能。不同载体上的聚合度各不相同，其中V/Si（可能是MCM-41）显示出最低的聚合度。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，负载在硅胶（V/Si）和氧化铝（V/Al）上的VOx显示出较高的初始丙烯选择性（约90%），而负载在SiO2-Al2O3载体上的VOx选择性较低（<80%）。这表明载体材料显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的选择性。

文献没有讨论OMS支持的催化剂在PDH反应中的具体优势、局限性或反应机理。也没有提到晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。
