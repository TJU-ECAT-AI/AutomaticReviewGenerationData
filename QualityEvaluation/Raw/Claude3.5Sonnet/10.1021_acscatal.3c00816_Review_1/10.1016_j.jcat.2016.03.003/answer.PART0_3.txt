[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Combining these results with the UVvis spectra in Fig. 1 we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si ≪ V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al."

[5] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relevant insights can be drawn:

VOx supported on MCM-41 silica was found to be active and selective for propane dehydrogenation under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions. This suggests that OMS supports like MCM-41 can be effective for PDH reactions.

The preparation method using vanadyl acetylacetonate grafting was extended to aluminosilicate supports, resulting in catalysts with propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that the grafting method can produce highly active catalysts on various supports, including OMS materials.

The degree of polymerization of VOx species influences catalyst performance. The polymerization degree varied across different supports, with V/Si (likely MCM-41) showing the lowest degree of polymerization.

In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed high initial selectivity to propene (around 90%), while VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports were less selective (<80%). This suggests that the support material significantly impacts catalyst selectivity in PDH reactions.

The literature does not discuss specific advantages, limitations, or reaction mechanisms for OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions. It also does not mention the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation.

文献并未提供全面的信息来完整回答关于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的问题。然而，可以得出一些相关的见解：

支持在MCM-41硅胶上的VOx被发现在氧化和非氧化条件下对丙烷脱氢都具有活性和选择性。这表明像MCM-41这样的OMS载体可能对PDH反应有效。

使用钒酰乙酰丙酮酯接枝的制备方法被扩展到铝硅酸盐载体上，产生的催化剂的丙烯产率接近工业PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这表明接枝方法可以在各种载体上产生高活性催化剂，包括OMS材料。

VOx物种的聚合度影响催化剂性能。不同载体上的聚合度各不相同，其中V/Si（可能是MCM-41）显示出最低的聚合度。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，负载在硅胶（V/Si）和氧化铝（V/Al）上的VOx显示出较高的初始丙烯选择性（约90%），而负载在SiO2-Al2O3载体上的VOx选择性较低（<80%）。这表明载体材料显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的选择性。

文献没有讨论OMS支持的催化剂在PDH反应中的具体优势、局限性或反应机理。也没有提到晶格氧物种或H2预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响。
