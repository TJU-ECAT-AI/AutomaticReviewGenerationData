[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "Analyzing specific surface areas of the supports and V loading on the respective catalysts, one can notice that SiO2 with SBET of 900 m2 g1 anchored lower absolute amount of V than SiO2Al2O3 materials with SBET ranging between 255 and 475 m2 g1."

[4] "Comparing the trends in selectivity of the same VOx-based catalysts tested previously in DH of propane [15] to the trends in the present study in isobutane DH, one sees remarkable differences. In the former reaction, the initial selectivity to propene over V/Si and V/Al was ca. 90%, whereas VOx supported on various SiO2Al2O3 were less selective (<80%)."

The literature provides limited information specifically about Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relevant insights can be drawn:

VOx supported on MCM-41 silica was found to be active and selective for propane dehydrogenation under both O2-lean and non-oxidative conditions. This suggests that OMS materials like MCM-41 can be effective supports for VOx catalysts in PDH reactions.

When the VOx preparation method was extended to aluminosilicate supports, the resulting catalysts showed good performance, with propene yields only 25% lower than industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that OMS-supported VOx catalysts can potentially compete with traditional metal oxide supports in PDH reactions.

Structural properties play a role in catalyst performance. The high surface area of MCM-41 (900 m2/g) allowed for lower vanadium loading compared to SiO2-Al2O3 materials, which may impact catalytic behavior.

In propane dehydrogenation, VOx supported on silica (V/Si) and alumina (V/Al) showed high initial selectivity to propene (around 90%), outperforming VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 supports (< 80% selectivity). This suggests that the support material significantly influences catalyst selectivity in PDH reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions for OMS-supported catalysts. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用提供了有限的信息。然而，可以得出一些相关见解：

VOx负载在MCM-41硅胶上的催化剂在贫氧和无氧条件下都表现出对丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性。这表明像MCM-41这样的OMS材料可以作为PDH反应中VOx催化剂的有效载体。

当VOx制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体时，所得催化剂表现出良好的性能，丙烯产率仅比工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂低25%。这表明OMS负载的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中可能与传统金属氧化物载体相媲美。

结构特性在催化剂性能中起着重要作用。MCM-41的高比表面积（900 m2/g）允许更低的钒负载量，相比于SiO2-Al2O3材料，这可能会影响催化行为。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，负载在硅胶（V/Si）和氧化铝（V/Al）上的VOx表现出较高的初始丙烯选择性（约90%），优于负载在SiO2-Al2O3上的VOx（选择性<80%）。这表明载体材料显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的选择性。

文献没有提供关于晶格氧物种或H2预处理对OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活影响的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些问题。
