[1] "Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14]."

[2] "Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15]."

[3] "To shed more light on the nature of supported VOx species and especially on their degree of polymerization we characterized selected catalysts strongly differing in their UVvis spectra by Raman spectroscopy."

[4] "Combining these results with the UVvis spectra in Fig. 1 we can arrange our catalysts with respect to the degree of polymerization of VOx species as follows: V/Si  V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1  V/Al."

[5] "The degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity are viewed to be essential catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of isobutene and thus indirectly affecting its selectivity."

The literature provides limited information specifically about MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts:

VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica showed activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation under both O2-lean and non-oxidative conditions. 

When this preparation method was extended to aluminosilicate supports, the resulting catalysts achieved propene yields only 25% lower than industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

The degree of polymerization of VOx species was found to be an important factor influencing catalyst performance. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization degree, with the order determined to be: V/Si < V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al.

The degree of VOx polymerization, along with surface acidity, were identified as essential properties affecting isobutene isomerization and thus indirectly impacting selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on CrOx catalysts, the advantages of OMS supports over traditional metal oxides, or the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献对MCM-41和SBA-15负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的表现提供了有限的信息。但是,它确实讨论了VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一些方面:

通过将钒酰乙酰丙酮grafting到MCM-41二氧化硅上制备的VOx/MCM-41在贫氧和非氧化条件下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性。

当这种制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体时,所得催化剂的丙烯产率仅比工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂低25%。

VOx物种的聚合度被发现是影响催化剂性能的一个重要因素。使用UV-vis和拉曼光谱来表征聚合度,确定的顺序为:V/Si < V/S40 < V/S70 < V/S10 < V/S1 ≈ V/Al。

VOx的聚合度以及表面酸度被确定为影响异丁烯异构化从而间接影响选择性的关键性质。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx催化剂、OMS载体相对于传统金属氧化物载体的优势,或者晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的具体信息。要完整回答这个问题,需要从其他来源获取额外信息。
