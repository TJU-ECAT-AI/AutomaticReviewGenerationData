The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions as requested. However, some relevant insights can be extracted:

The study mentions that VOx supported on MCM-41 silica was active and selective in both isobutane and propane dehydrogenation under various conditions. This suggests that OMS materials like MCM-41 can be effective supports for VOx catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

The researchers extended their catalyst preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, achieving propene yields close to those of industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that OMS-supported catalysts can potentially compete with traditional metal oxide supports in terms of catalytic performance.

The distribution of VOx species and acidic properties were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. This suggests that the structural properties of the catalysts, including those supported on OMS materials, play a crucial role in their catalytic behavior.

The study investigated the effect of conversion on product selectivity by varying reaction conditions. This approach could be applied to better understand the reaction mechanisms and performance of OMS-supported catalysts in PDH reactions.

However, the literature does not provide specific comparisons between OMS-supported catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports, nor does it discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance in PDH reactions. More targeted research would be needed to address these aspects comprehensively.

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析金属有序介孔硅(OMS)催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，可以提取一些相关的见解：

研究提到，负载在MCM-41硅胶上的VOx在各种条件下对异丁烷和丙烷脱氢都表现出活性和选择性。这表明像MCM-41这样的OMS材料可以作为脱氢反应中VOx催化剂的有效载体。

研究人员将他们的催化剂制备方法扩展到铝硅酸盐载体上，获得的丙烯产率接近工业用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这表明OMS负载的催化剂在催化性能方面可能与传统的金属氧化物载体相媲美。

研究使用各种光谱技术表征了VOx物种的分布和酸性质。这表明催化剂的结构特性，包括那些负载在OMS材料上的催化剂，在其催化行为中起着至关重要的作用。

研究通过改变反应条件来研究转化率对产品选择性的影响。这种方法可以用来更好地理解OMS负载催化剂在PDH反应中的反应机理和性能。

然而，这篇文献没有提供OMS负载催化剂与传统金属氧化物载体之间的具体比较，也没有讨论晶格氧物种或H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。需要进行更有针对性的研究才能全面解决这些方面的问题。
