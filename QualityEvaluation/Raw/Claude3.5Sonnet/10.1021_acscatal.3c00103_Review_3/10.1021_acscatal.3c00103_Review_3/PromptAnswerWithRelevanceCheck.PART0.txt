The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing abundant hydroxyl groups that act as anchoring sites. This method allows for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds onto the support surface, enabling the fabrication of well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties.

The approach involves grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests, which promotes the incorporation of active metal sites into the support framework. This is particularly effective in zeolites, where the existence of hydroxyl groups during the formation process can enhance the integration of metal sites into the zeolite structure.

By using this method, highly dispersed and stabilized metal species can be constructed on the support surface. For example, in dealuminated Beta zeolites, hydroxyl nests provide an anchoring effect for metal species like Zn, which can then serve as anchoring sites for other metals such as Pt.

The implications of this method for enhancing metal-support interactions are significant. It allows for better control over the dispersion and stability of active metal compounds, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The strong metal-support interactions created through this method can result in catalysts with higher performance, better durability, and enhanced resistance to deactivation during reactions.

羟基锚定法通过提供大量羟基作为锚定位点，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许将金属位点接枝或将金属化合物锚定到支撑体表面，从而能够制造出具有各种催化性能的精调材料。

该方法涉及在孤立的羟基和/或羟基巢上接枝或限制活性位点，这促进了活性金属位点掺入到支撑体框架中。这在沸石中特别有效，其中在形成过程中存在的羟基可以增强金属位点与沸石结构的整合。

通过使用这种方法，可以在支撑体表面构建高度分散和稳定的金属物种。例如，在脱铝的Beta沸石中，羟基巢为金属物种（如Zn）提供了锚定效应，然后这些金属物种可以作为其他金属（如Pt）的锚定位点。

这种方法对增强金属-支撑体相互作用的影响是显著的。它允许更好地控制活性金属化合物的分散和稳定性，从而提高固-气非均相催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过这种方法创造的强金属-支撑体相互作用可以产生性能更高、耐久性更好、在反应过程中抗失活能力增强的催化剂。
