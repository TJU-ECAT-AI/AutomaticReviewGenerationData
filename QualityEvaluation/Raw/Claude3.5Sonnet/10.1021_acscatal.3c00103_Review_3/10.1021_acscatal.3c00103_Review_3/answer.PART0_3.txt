[1] "Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties."

[2] "Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."

[3] "The existence of hydroxyl groups during the zeolite formation process can promote the incorporation of active metal sites into the zeolite framework."

[4] "The hydroxyl nests on the zeolite framework derived from the dealumination of Beta zeolite provided an anchoring effect to construct highly dispersed and stabilized Zn species that served as the anchoring sites for the Pt species."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing specific sites for grafting or anchoring metal species. This approach allows for precise placement of metal sites on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests on the support surface. 

The method has significant implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It enables the fabrication of well-tuned materials with tailored catalytic properties.

2. It promotes the incorporation of active metal sites directly into zeolite frameworks during synthesis.

3. It allows for highly dispersed and stabilized metal species to be constructed on the support.

4. It can create anchoring sites for additional metal species, enabling controlled synthesis of bimetallic catalysts.

By providing strong anchoring points for metal species, this method enhances the interaction between the metal and support. This leads to improved stability of the active sites, preventing sintering and agglomeration during reactions. The controlled dispersion and stabilization of metal species also contributes to higher catalytic activity and selectivity. Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring approach enables the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior performance and longevity for solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

羟基锚定方法通过提供特定位点来嫁接或锚定金属物种，从而促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许在支撑体表面的孤立羟基或羟基巢上精确放置金属位点。

该方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有重要影响：

1. 它能够制造具有定制催化性能的精调材料。

2. 它促进了活性金属位点在沸石合成过程中直接掺入框架结构。

3. 它允许在载体上构建高度分散和稳定的金属物种。

4. 它可以为额外的金属物种创造锚定位点，从而实现双金属催化剂的可控合成。

通过为金属物种提供强锚定点，这种方法增强了金属与载体之间的相互作用。这导致活性位点稳定性的提高，防止了反应过程中的烧结和聚集。金属物种的可控分散和稳定化也有助于提高催化活性和选择性。总的来说，羟基锚定方法使得可以设计出具有优越性能和长寿命的非均相催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢等固-气反应。
