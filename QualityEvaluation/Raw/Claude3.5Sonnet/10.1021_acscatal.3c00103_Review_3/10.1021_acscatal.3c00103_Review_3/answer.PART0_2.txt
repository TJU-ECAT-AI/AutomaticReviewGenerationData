The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It provides a suitable environment for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds onto crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups.

2. It allows for precise control over the incorporation of active compounds by grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests.

3. It enables the generation of highly dispersed metal oxide species through selective reactions between hydroxyl groups on tailored supports and specific thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures.

4. In zeolite synthesis, the presence of hydroxyl groups promotes the incorporation of active metal sites directly into the zeolite framework.

5. For dealuminated zeolites, hydroxyl nests can be used to anchor bimetallic alloys.

These mechanisms enhance metal-support interactions by creating strong chemical bonds between the metal compounds and the support material. This results in improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions due to:

1. Better dispersion of active metal species on the support surface.
2. Formation of well-defined and uniform active sites.
3. Increased resistance to sintering and agglomeration of metal particles.
4. Enhanced stability of the active metal species under reaction conditions.
5. Improved control over the electronic and geometric properties of the active sites.

By utilizing the hydroxyl anchoring method, researchers can design catalysts with optimized performance characteristics for specific reactions, leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in various applications, including propane dehydrogenation.

羟基锚定法通过以下几种机制促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 它为在具有丰富羟基的晶体材料上接枝金属位点或锚定金属化合物提供了合适的环境。

2. 它通过在孤立的羟基或羟基巢上接枝或限制活性位点，实现了对活性化合物掺入的精确控制。

3. 它通过在高温下使定制载体上的羟基与特定的热解分子前驱体进行选择性反应，实现了高度分散的金属氧化物物种的生成。

4. 在沸石合成中，羟基的存在促进了活性金属位点直接掺入沸石骨架。

5. 对于脱铝沸石，羟基巢可用于锚定双金属合金。

这些机制通过在金属化合物和载体材料之间创建强化学键来增强金属-载体相互作用。这导致了固-气异相催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面的改善，原因如下：

1. 活性金属物种在载体表面上的分散性更好。
2. 形成了明确定义的均匀活性位点。
3. 金属颗粒的烧结和团聚能力增强。
4. 活性金属物种在反应条件下的稳定性增加。
5. 对活性位点的电子和几何特性的控制能力增强。

通过利用羟基锚定法，研究人员可以设计出针对特定反应优化性能特征的催化剂，从而在各种应用中（包括丙烷脱氢）实现更高效、更可持续的催化过程。
