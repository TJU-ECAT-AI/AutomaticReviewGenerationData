[1] "Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties."

[2] "Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."

[3] "Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated."

[4] "The existence of hydroxyl groups during the zeolite formation process can promote the incorporation of active metal sites into the zeolite framework."

[5] "The hydroxyl nests on the dealuminated zeolite can be utilized for anchoring bimetallic PtM alloys."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It provides a suitable environment for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds onto crystal materials rich in hydroxyl groups.

2. It allows for precise control over the incorporation of active compounds by either grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests.

3. It enables the generation of highly dispersed metal oxide species through selective reactions between hydroxyl groups on tailored supports and specific thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures.

4. In zeolite synthesis, the presence of hydroxyl groups promotes the incorporation of active metal sites directly into the zeolite framework.

5. For dealuminated zeolites, hydroxyl nests can be used to anchor bimetallic alloys.

These mechanisms enhance metal-support interactions by creating strong chemical bonds between the metal compounds and the support material. This results in improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions due to:

1. Better dispersion and stabilization of active metal sites
2. Prevention of metal sintering or agglomeration during reactions
3. Creation of unique electronic and geometric environments around the active sites
4. Improved resistance to deactivation and coking
5. Enhanced control over the size and distribution of metal particles or clusters

Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring method allows for precise design and tailoring of catalysts at the molecular level, leading to superior catalytic performance in various applications, including propane dehydrogenation reactions.

羟基锚定方法通过以下几种机制促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入：

1. 它为在富含羟基的晶体材料上嫁接金属位点或锚定金属化合物提供了合适的环境。

2. 它通过在孤立的羟基或羟基巢上嫁接或限制活性位点，实现了对活性化合物掺入的精确控制。

3. 它通过在高温下使定制支撑物上的羟基与特定的热解分子前驱体进行选择性反应，能够生成高度分散的金属氧化物物种。

4. 在沸石合成中，羟基的存在促进了活性金属位点直接掺入沸石骨架。

5. 对于脱铝沸石，羟基巢可用于锚定双金属合金。

这些机制通过在金属化合物和支撑材料之间创建强化学键来增强金属-支撑相互作用。这导致固-气反应中异相催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性得到改善，原因如下：

1. 更好地分散和稳定活性金属位点
2. 防止反应过程中金属烧结或聚集
3. 在活性位点周围创造独特的电子和几何环境
4. 提高对失活和结焦的抗性
5. 增强对金属颗粒或簇的尺寸和分布的控制

总的来说，羟基锚定方法允许在分子水平上精确设计和调整催化剂，从而在各种应用中实现优越的催化性能，包括丙烷脱氢反应。
