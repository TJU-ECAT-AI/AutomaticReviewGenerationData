[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

[2] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

[3] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This anchoring approach enhances metal-support interactions by stabilizing small metal clusters through bonding with oxygen atoms in the zeolite structure. 

The implications for heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant:

1. Improved activity: The method allows for incorporation of subnanometer and even atomically dispersed metal species, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The confinement of metal species within zeolite channels can promote shape selectivity and prevent unwanted side reactions.

3. Increased stability: The strong metal-support interactions inhibit sintering and migration of metal species, leading to excellent long-term stability and regeneration performance.

4. Tunable properties: By controlling the type and amount of metal species incorporated, catalyst properties can be fine-tuned for specific reactions.

Additionally, the introduction of promoters like Cs+ ions can further improve catalyst stability by inhibiting metal migration and aggregation during regeneration cycles.

[2] "To further demonstrate that all metal species are confined within the zeolite matrix rather than on the outer surface of crystals, shape-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitro-o-xylene reactions were performed by using the ammonia borane as a reductant at room temperature over Pt@S-1-H and commercial Pt/C catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing the H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This creates strong metal-support interactions by anchoring the metal species directly to the zeolite structure.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Improved confinement of metal species within the zeolite matrix rather than on external surfaces, as demonstrated by shape-selective catalysis experiments.

2. Stabilization of small metal clusters through bonding with framework oxygen atoms.

3. Preservation of the intact zeolite framework structure after metal incorporation.

These enhanced metal-support interactions lead to improved activity, selectivity and stability in heterogeneous catalysis by:

1. Maintaining small, well-dispersed metal clusters resistant to sintering.

2. Providing a confined reaction environment within zeolite pores.

3. Allowing tuning of electronic properties of metal sites through interactions with the support.

4. Preventing leaching or migration of metal species during reactions.

Overall, this method enables precise control over the location, size, and electronic properties of active metal sites within zeolite crystals, resulting in catalysts with superior performance and longevity for solid-gas reactions.

3. Stability: Strong anchoring to the framework and confinement within zeolite pores inhibits metal aggregation, improving long-term stability.

4. Metal-support interactions: Direct bonding between metal species and the zeolite framework creates strong interactions that can modify catalytic properties.

The method enables precise control over metal incorporation and distribution, allowing for tuning of catalyst properties. By avoiding conventional high-temperature calcination, it prevents sintering and maintains small cluster sizes. Overall, this approach produces highly stable and active catalysts with enhanced metal-support interactions for improved performance in solid-gas reactions.
