[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

[2] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

[3] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This anchoring approach enhances metal-support interactions by stabilizing small metal clusters through bonding with oxygen atoms in the zeolite structure. 

The implications for heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant:

1. Improved activity: The method allows for incorporation of subnanometer and even atomically dispersed metal species, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The confinement of metal species within zeolite channels can promote shape selectivity and prevent unwanted side reactions.

3. Increased stability: The strong metal-support interactions inhibit sintering and migration of metal species, leading to excellent long-term stability and regeneration performance.

4. Tunable properties: By controlling the type and amount of metal species incorporated, catalyst properties can be fine-tuned for specific reactions.

Additionally, the introduction of promoters like Cs+ ions can further improve catalyst stability by inhibiting metal migration and aggregation during regeneration cycles.

羟基锚定法通过用金属物种替换沸石骨架中缺陷位点的Si-OH基团的H原子,从而促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种锚定方法通过与沸石结构中的氧原子键合来稳定小金属簇,从而增强了金属-载体相互作用。

这种方法对固-气反应中的多相催化剂有重要影响:

1. 提高活性:该方法允许亚纳米甚至原子分散的金属物种的掺入,增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

2. 提高选择性:金属物种在沸石孔道内的限制可以促进形状选择性并防止不必要的副反应。

3. 增加稳定性:强金属-载体相互作用抑制了金属物种的烧结和迁移,导致优异的长期稳定性和再生性能。

4. 可调性能:通过控制掺入的金属物种的类型和数量,可以为特定反应精细调节催化剂性能。

此外,引入Cs+等助剂可以进一步抑制金属在再生循环过程中的迁移和聚集,从而提高催化剂稳定性。
