[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites (FigureS9)."

[2] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

[3] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This anchoring approach enhances metal-support interactions by stabilizing small metal clusters through bonding with oxygen atoms in the zeolite structure. 

The implications for heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions include:

1. Improved activity: Anchoring enables formation of small, well-dispersed metal clusters with high surface area.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Strong metal-support interactions can modify electronic properties of metal species.

3. Increased stability: Anchoring prevents sintering and migration of metal species, maintaining catalytic performance over time.

4. Better regeneration: Anchored metals are less prone to aggregation during regeneration cycles.

5. Tunable properties: The zeolite support and anchoring sites can be modified (e.g. with Cs+ ions) to further enhance stability and performance.

Overall, this approach allows for precise control over the size, distribution and properties of active metal species, leading to catalysts with superior performance and longevity for reactions like propane dehydrogenation.
