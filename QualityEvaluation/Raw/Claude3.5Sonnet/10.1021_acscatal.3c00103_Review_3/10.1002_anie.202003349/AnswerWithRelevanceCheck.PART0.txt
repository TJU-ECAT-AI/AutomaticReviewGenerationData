          "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

"The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

"Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

"To further demonstrate that all metal species are confined within the zeolite matrix rather than on the outer surface of crystals, shape-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitro-o-xylene reactions were performed by using the ammonia borane as a reductant at room temperature over Pt@S-1-H and commercial Pt/C catalysts."

"Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry."

"Significantly, avoiding the conventional calcination process and employing direct reduction method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Pt species."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This creates strong metal-support interactions by anchoring metal species directly to the zeolite structure through bonding with framework oxygen atoms.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions include:

1. Improved activity: The method allows for incorporation of small, well-dispersed metal clusters, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The confinement of metal species within zeolite channels can promote shape selectivity and prevent unwanted side reactions.

3. Increased stability: Strong anchoring to the framework and confinement within zeolite pores inhibits metal sintering, migration, and aggregation, leading to excellent long-term stability and regeneration performance.

4. Tunable properties: By controlling the type and amount of metal species incorporated, as well as modifying the zeolite support (e.g., with Cs+ ions), catalyst properties can be fine-tuned for specific reactions.

5. Improved metal-support interactions: Direct bonding between metal species and the zeolite framework creates strong interactions that can modify catalytic properties and stabilize small metal clusters.

6. Better regeneration ability: The confinement effect of the zeolite and the introduction of promoters like Cs+ ions can inhibit metal migration and aggregation during regeneration cycles.

7. Preservation of zeolite structure: The method maintains the intact zeolite framework after metal incorporation.

Overall, this approach enables precise control over the location, size, distribution, and electronic properties of active metal sites within zeolite crystals, resulting in catalysts with superior performance and longevity for solid-gas reactions such as propane dehydrogenation.

          羟基锚定法通过用金属物种替换沸石骨架缺陷位点上Si-OH基团的H原子,实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法通过将金属物种直接锚定到沸石结构上,与骨架氧原子成键,创造了强烈的金属-载体相互作用。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善固-气反应中的多相催化剂的影响包括:

1. 提高活性:该方法允许掺入小而分散均匀的金属簇,增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

2. 提高选择性:金属物种在沸石孔道内的限制可以促进形状选择性并防止不必要的副反应。

3. 增加稳定性:与骨架的强锚定作用和在沸石孔道内的限制作用抑制了金属的烧结、迁移和聚集,导致优异的长期稳定性和再生性能。

4. 可调性能:通过控制掺入的金属物种的类型和数量,以及修饰沸石载体(如添加Cs+离子),可以为特定反应精细调节催化剂性能。

5. 改善金属-载体相互作用:金属物种与沸石骨架之间的直接成键创造了强相互作用,可以改变催化性质并稳定小金属簇。

6. 提高再生能力:沸石的限域效应和引入Cs+等助剂可以抑制再生循环过程中的金属迁移和聚集。

7. 保持沸石结构:该方法在金属掺入后保持完整的沸石骨架结构。

总的来说,这种方法能够精确控制沸石晶体内活性金属位点的位置、尺寸、分布和电子性质,从而制备出在丙烷脱氢等固-气反应中具有优异性能和长寿命的催化剂。
