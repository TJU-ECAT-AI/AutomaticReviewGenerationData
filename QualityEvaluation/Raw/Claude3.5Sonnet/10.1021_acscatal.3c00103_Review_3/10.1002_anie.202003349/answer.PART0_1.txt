[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

[2] "To further demonstrate that all metal species are confined within the zeolite matrix rather than on the outer surface of crystals, shape-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitro-o-xylene reactions were performed by using the ammonia borane as a reductant at room temperature over Pt@S-1-H and commercial Pt/C catalysts."

[3] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing the H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This creates strong metal-support interactions by anchoring the metal species directly to the zeolite structure.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Improved confinement of metal species within the zeolite matrix rather than on external surfaces, as demonstrated by shape-selective catalysis experiments.

2. Stabilization of small metal clusters through bonding with framework oxygen atoms.

3. Preservation of the intact zeolite framework structure after metal incorporation.

These enhanced metal-support interactions lead to improved activity, selectivity and stability in heterogeneous catalysis by:

1. Maintaining small, well-dispersed metal clusters resistant to sintering.

2. Providing a confined reaction environment within zeolite pores.

3. Allowing tuning of electronic properties of metal sites through interactions with the support.

4. Preventing leaching or migration of metal species during reactions.

Overall, this method enables precise control over the location, size, and electronic properties of active metal sites within zeolite crystals, resulting in catalysts with superior performance and longevity for solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定法通过用金属物种替换沸石骨架缺陷位点上Si-OH基团的H原子,实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法通过将金属物种直接锚定到沸石结构上,创造了强烈的金属-载体相互作用。

增强金属-载体相互作用的影响包括:

1. 改善金属物种在沸石基质内部而非外表面的限制,这可以通过形状选择性催化实验来证明。

2. 通过与骨架氧原子键合来稳定小金属簇。

3. 在金属掺入后保持完整的沸石骨架结构。

这些增强的金属-载体相互作用通过以下方式提高了多相催化的活性、选择性和稳定性:

1. 维持抗烧结的小而分散均匀的金属簇。

2. 在沸石孔道内提供受限的反应环境。

3. 通过与载体的相互作用调节金属位点的电子性质。

4. 防止反应过程中金属物种的流失或迁移。

总的来说,这种方法能够精确控制沸石晶体内活性金属位点的位置、尺寸和电子性质,从而制备出在固-气反应中具有优异性能和长寿命的催化剂。
