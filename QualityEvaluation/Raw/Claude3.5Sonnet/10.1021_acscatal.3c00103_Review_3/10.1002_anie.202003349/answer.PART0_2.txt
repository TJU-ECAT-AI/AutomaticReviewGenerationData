[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

[2] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

[3] "Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry."

[4] "Significantly, avoiding the conventional calcination process and employing direct reduction method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Pt species."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This approach enhances metal-support interactions by stabilizing small metal clusters through bonding with framework oxygen atoms. It improves catalyst performance in several ways:

1. Activity: It allows for incorporation of small, well-dispersed metal clusters, providing more active sites.

2. Selectivity: The zeolite framework can impart shape selectivity and influence product distribution.

3. Stability: Strong anchoring to the framework and confinement within zeolite pores inhibits metal aggregation, improving long-term stability.

4. Metal-support interactions: Direct bonding between metal species and the zeolite framework creates strong interactions that can modify catalytic properties.

The method enables precise control over metal incorporation and distribution, allowing for tuning of catalyst properties. By avoiding conventional high-temperature calcination, it prevents sintering and maintains small cluster sizes. Overall, this approach produces highly stable and active catalysts with enhanced metal-support interactions for improved performance in solid-gas reactions.
