[1] "29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

[2] "The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

[3] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by replacing H atoms of Si-OH groups with metal species at defect sites in the zeolite framework. This creates strong metal-support interactions by bonding metal clusters to oxygen atoms in the framework. 

The implications for enhancing catalysts include:

1. Improved stability - Metal species are anchored firmly in the zeolite, preventing sintering and migration.

2. Higher activity - Small, well-dispersed metal clusters provide more active sites.

3. Better selectivity - The zeolite framework can impart shape selectivity.

4. Enhanced regeneration ability - The confinement effect of the zeolite inhibits metal aggregation during regeneration cycles.

5. Tunable properties - Different metal species and zeolite frameworks allow customization.

This method enables creation of highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for solid-gas reactions by precisely controlling the size, dispersion, and interactions of metal species within zeolite crystals.

羟基锚定法通过用金属物种替换沸石骨架缺陷位点上Si-OH基团的H原子,从而实现活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这通过将金属簇与骨架中的氧原子键合,创造了强大的金属-载体相互作用。

这种方法对增强催化剂的影响包括:

1. 提高稳定性 - 金属物种牢固地锚定在沸石中,防止烧结和迁移。

2. 更高活性 - 小而分散均匀的金属簇提供更多活性位点。

3. 更好的选择性 - 沸石骨架可以赋予形状选择性。

4. 增强再生能力 - 沸石的限域效应抑制了再生循环过程中的金属聚集。

5. 可调性能 - 不同的金属物种和沸石骨架允许定制。

这种方法通过精确控制沸石晶体内金属物种的尺寸、分散度和相互作用,能够创造出高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的固-气反应催化剂。
