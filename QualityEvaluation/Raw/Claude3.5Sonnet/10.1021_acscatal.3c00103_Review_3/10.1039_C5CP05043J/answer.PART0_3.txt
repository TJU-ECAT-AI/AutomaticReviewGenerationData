[1] "Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "This unique deposition pattern effectively avoids channel blocking in porous systems and ensures excellent film uniformity on almost any substrate."

[4] "Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; in subsequent ALD cycles Zn species are grafted through the hydroxyl groups formed in the previous deposition cycle."

[5] "Since the catalytic activity of ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite mostly comes from the incorporated ZnO, the enhanced conversion with the increased number of ALD cycles is probably a reflection of the increased number of active sites which is obviously related to the higher loading of ZnO."

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise deposition at the atomic scale. This method involves alternating pulses of gaseous precursors that react with surface functional groups, creating a cycle-by-cycle deposition process.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Improved uniformity: ALD ensures excellent film uniformity on various substrates, including porous systems, without channel blocking.

2. Precise control: The cycle-by-cycle nature of ALD allows for atomic-scale precision in depositing active metal species.

3. Strong anchoring: In the first ALD cycle, metal species (e.g., Zn(OH)+) are anchored to the support through lattice oxygen, creating a strong metal-support interaction.

4. Gradual growth: Subsequent ALD cycles allow for controlled growth of metal species through newly formed hydroxyl groups.

5. Increased active sites: The number of active sites can be precisely controlled by adjusting the number of ALD cycles, directly impacting catalyst activity.

These features of the hydroxyl anchoring method in ALD contribute to improved activity, selectivity, and potentially stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by allowing precise control over the size, distribution, and interaction of active metal species with the support material.

原子层沉积（ALD）中的羟基锚定方法通过允许在原子尺度上精确沉积，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法涉及交替脉冲气态前驱体，与表面官能团反应，创建了一个逐周期的沉积过程。

对增强金属-载体相互作用的影响包括：

1. 改善均匀性：ALD确保在各种基底上实现优秀的薄膜均匀性，包括多孔系统，而不会堵塞通道。

2. 精确控制：ALD的逐周期特性允许在沉积活性金属物种时达到原子尺度的精度。

3. 强锚定：在第一个ALD周期中，金属物种（如Zn(OH)+）通过晶格氧锚定到载体上，创建了强金属-载体相互作用。

4. 逐步生长：后续的ALD周期允许通过新形成的羟基控制金属物种的生长。

5. 增加活性位点：可以通过调整ALD周期数精确控制活性位点的数量，直接影响催化剂活性。

ALD中羟基锚定方法的这些特征通过允许精确控制活性金属物种的尺寸、分布和与载体材料的相互作用，有助于提高固-气反应中异相催化剂的活性、选择性和潜在的稳定性。
