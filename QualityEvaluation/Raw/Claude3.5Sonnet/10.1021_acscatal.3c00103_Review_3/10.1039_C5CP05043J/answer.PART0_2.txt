[1] "Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "This unique deposition pattern effectively avoids channel blocking in porous systems and ensures excellent film uniformity on almost any substrate."

[4] "According to the scheme of the ZnO ALD reaction described in eqn (1) and (2), isolated Zn(OH)+ species are produced during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; with the increasing number of ALD cycles the oxide clusters will gradually grow larger"

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a precise, self-limiting deposition process. This method allows for atomic-scale control over the deposition of metal species, ensuring uniform distribution and avoiding channel blocking in porous systems.

ALD enhances metal-support interactions by producing isolated metal hydroxide species (e.g., Zn(OH)+) that are strongly anchored to the support surface through chemical bonds. As more ALD cycles are performed, these isolated species can grow into larger oxide clusters, allowing for fine control over the size and distribution of active sites.

This controlled incorporation has several implications for improving catalyst performance:

1. Improved activity: The highly dispersed, isolated metal species created by ALD can provide a large number of accessible active sites.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The ability to control the size and distribution of active sites can allow for tuning of catalyst selectivity.

3. Better stability: Strong metal-support interactions created by the hydroxyl anchoring method can improve catalyst stability by preventing sintering and agglomeration of active sites.

4. Optimized pore utilization: The self-limiting nature of ALD reactions helps prevent pore blocking, allowing for efficient use of internal surface area in porous materials.

Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring method in ALD provides a powerful tool for designing and optimizing heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions by allowing precise control over the incorporation and distribution of active metal species.

原子层沉积(ALD)中的羟基锚定方法通过精确的自限性沉积过程促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许对金属物种的沉积进行原子尺度的控制，确保均匀分布并避免多孔系统中的通道堵塞。

ALD通过产生与支撑表面通过化学键强烈锚定的孤立金属羟基物种(如Zn(OH)+)来增强金属-支撑相互作用。随着更多ALD循环的进行，这些孤立物种可以生长成更大的氧化物簇，从而可以对活性位点的大小和分布进行精细控制。

这种可控掺入对改善催化剂性能有几个影响：

1. 提高活性：ALD创建的高度分散的孤立金属物种可以提供大量可接触的活性位点。

2. 增强选择性：控制活性位点大小和分布的能力可以允许调整催化剂选择性。

3. 更好的稳定性：羟基锚定方法创建的强金属-支撑相互作用可以通过防止活性位点烧结和聚集来提高催化剂稳定性。

4. 优化孔利用：ALD反应的自限性有助于防止孔堵塞，允许多孔材料内表面积的有效利用。

总的来说，ALD中的羟基锚定方法通过允许精确控制活性金属物种的掺入和分布，为固-气反应的异相催化剂的设计和优化提供了一个强大的工具。
