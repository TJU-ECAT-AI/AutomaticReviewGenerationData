[1] "Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."

[4] "In principle, the ZnO cluster size can be precisely tailored by adjusting the number of ALD cycles."

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a self-limiting surface reaction process. This method involves alternating pulses of gaseous precursors that react with surface functional groups, allowing for precise control over the deposition at an atomic scale.

In the case of ZnO ALD on zeolites, the process begins with a reaction similar to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using diethyl zinc. However, instead of high-temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced in the second half of the reaction. This converts surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups, which serve as reaction sites for the next deposition cycle.

This controlled process has several implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. Precise control: The size of ZnO clusters can be tailored by adjusting the number of ALD cycles, allowing for optimization of the active sites.

2. Uniform distribution: ALD ensures a more uniform distribution of the active metal compound throughout the support material, potentially leading to improved catalytic activity.

3. Improved metal-support interaction: The hydroxyl anchoring method creates a strong chemical bond between the metal and the support, which can enhance the stability of the catalyst.

4. Controlled loading: The self-limiting nature of ALD allows for precise control over the amount of metal loaded onto the support, which can be crucial for optimizing selectivity in catalytic reactions.

5. Preservation of support structure: The gentle nature of ALD helps preserve the structure of the support material, maintaining important features like surface area and pore structure.

These advantages can lead to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by creating well-defined, highly dispersed active sites with strong interactions with the support material.

原子层沉积(ALD)中的羟基锚定方法通过自限性表面反应过程实现了在晶体材料中对活性金属化合物的可控引入。这种方法涉及交替脉冲气相前驱体，与表面官能团反应，从而实现原子尺度上的精确沉积控制。

在沸石上进行ZnO ALD的情况下，该过程始于类似于使用二乙基锌的化学气相沉积(CVD)的反应。但是，不同于高温还原或氧化，在反应的后半部分引入水蒸气。这将表面乙基转化为羟基，作为下一个沉积循环的反应位点。

这种可控过程对增强金属-载体相互作用和提高催化剂性能有几个重要影响：

1. 精确控制：可以通过调整ALD循环次数来调整ZnO簇的大小，从而优化活性位点。

2. 均匀分布：ALD确保活性金属化合物在整个载体材料中更均匀分布，可能导致催化活性的提高。

3. 改善金属-载体相互作用：羟基锚定方法在金属和载体之间创造了强化学键，可以增强催化剂的稳定性。

4. 可控负载：ALD的自限性允许精确控制负载到载体上的金属量，这对于优化催化反应的选择性至关重要。

5. 保持载体结构：ALD的温和性有助于保持载体材料的结构，维持重要特征如比表面积和孔结构。

这些优势可以通过创造与载体材料有强相互作用的明确定义、高度分散的活性位点，从而提高固-气反应中异相催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
