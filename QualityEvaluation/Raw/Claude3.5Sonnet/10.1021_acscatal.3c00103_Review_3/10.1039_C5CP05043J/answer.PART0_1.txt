[1] "Besides these aqueous solution based methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has also been employed to introduce Zn species into zeolites. Zn2+ ions have been incorporated into HZSM-5 by chemical reaction between zinc vapor and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) of the zeolite at high temperatures."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."

[4] "Based on the scheme of the ALD reaction, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; in subsequent ALD cycles Zn species are grafted through the hydroxyl groups formed in the previous deposition cycle."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a two-step atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. In the first step, metal precursors react with surface functional groups (e.g. Brønsted acid sites) to form metal-oxygen bonds. In the second step, water vapor converts remaining organic groups to hydroxyl groups, which serve as anchoring sites for the next deposition cycle.

This method allows precise control over the amount and dispersion of metal species incorporated. The strong metal-support interactions created through direct bonding to the crystal lattice can enhance stability. The ability to tune the size and distribution of metal clusters or isolated sites by controlling the number of ALD cycles allows optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity.

For solid-gas reactions, the highly dispersed nature of the metal sites produced by this method can increase the number of active sites accessible to reactants. The strong anchoring to the support may also improve thermal stability and resistance to sintering under reaction conditions. Overall, this technique enables the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced performance and durability for a variety of applications.

羟基锚定法通过两步原子层沉积（ALD）过程实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。第一步，金属前驱体与表面官能团（如Brønsted酸位点）反应形成金属-氧键。第二步，水蒸气将剩余的有机基团转化为羟基，这些羟基作为下一个沉积循环的锚定位点。

这种方法允许精确控制所掺入金属物种的数量和分散度。通过与晶格直接键合而创建的强金属-载体相互作用可以增强稳定性。通过控制ALD循环次数来调节金属簇或孤立位点的大小和分布的能力，使得催化活性和选择性的优化成为可能。

对于固-气反应，这种方法产生的高度分散的金属位点可以增加反应物可接触的活性位点数量。与载体的强锚定作用也可能提高催化剂在反应条件下的热稳定性和抗烧结性。总的来说，这种技术使得可以合理设计具有增强性能和耐久性的多种应用的非均相催化剂。
