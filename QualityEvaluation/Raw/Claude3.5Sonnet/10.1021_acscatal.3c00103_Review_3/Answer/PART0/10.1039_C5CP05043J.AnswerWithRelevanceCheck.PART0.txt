          [1] "Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."

[4] "This unique deposition pattern effectively avoids channel blocking in porous systems and ensures excellent film uniformity on almost any substrate."

[5] "Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; in subsequent ALD cycles Zn species are grafted through the hydroxyl groups formed in the previous deposition cycle."

[6] "Since the catalytic activity of ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite mostly comes from the incorporated ZnO, the enhanced conversion with the increased number of ALD cycles is probably a reflection of the increased number of active sites which is obviously related to the higher loading of ZnO."

[7] "Based on these findings we conclude that the deactivation of the Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO catalyst is due to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a precise, self-limiting deposition process. This method involves alternating pulses of gaseous precursors that react with surface functional groups, allowing for atomic-scale control over the deposition of metal species.

Key aspects of this method include:

1. Precise control: ALD allows for atomic-scale precision in depositing active metal species, with the ability to control cluster size by adjusting the number of ALD cycles.

2. Uniform distribution: The process ensures excellent film uniformity on various substrates, including porous systems, without channel blocking.

3. Strong metal-support interactions: In the first ALD cycle, metal species (e.g., Zn(OH)+) are anchored to the support through lattice oxygen, creating a strong bond.

4. Gradual growth: Subsequent ALD cycles allow for controlled growth of metal species through newly formed hydroxyl groups.

5. Increased active sites: The number of active sites can be precisely controlled by adjusting the number of ALD cycles, directly impacting catalyst activity.

Implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance include:

1. Improved activity: The highly dispersed, isolated metal species created by ALD can provide a large number of accessible active sites, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The ability to control the size and distribution of active sites allows for tuning of catalyst selectivity.

3. Better initial stability: Strong metal-support interactions created by the hydroxyl anchoring method can improve initial catalyst stability by preventing sintering and agglomeration of active sites.

4. Optimized pore utilization: The self-limiting nature of ALD reactions helps prevent pore blocking, allowing for efficient use of internal surface area in porous materials.

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of long-term stability. The literature indicates that deactivation can still occur due to factors such as coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of metal species (e.g., ZnO). This suggests that while the hydroxyl anchoring method can enhance initial catalyst performance, further research is needed to address long-term stability issues in certain applications.

          原子层沉积(ALD)中的羟基锚定方法通过精确的自限性沉积过程促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法涉及交替脉冲气相前驱体，与表面官能团反应，从而实现原子尺度上的精确沉积控制。

该方法的关键方面包括：

1. 精确控制：ALD允许在沉积活性金属物种时达到原子尺度的精度，通过调整ALD循环次数可以控制簇的大小。

2. 均匀分布：该过程确保在各种基底上实现优秀的薄膜均匀性，包括多孔系统，而不会堵塞通道。

3. 强金属-载体相互作用：在第一个ALD周期中，金属物种（如Zn(OH)+）通过晶格氧锚定到载体上，创建了强化学键。

4. 逐步生长：后续的ALD周期允许通过新形成的羟基控制金属物种的生长。

5. 增加活性位点：可以通过调整ALD周期数精确控制活性位点的数量，直接影响催化剂活性。

增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能的影响包括：

1. 提高活性：ALD创建的高度分散的孤立金属物种可以提供大量可接触的活性位点，可能增加催化活性。

2. 增强选择性：控制活性位点大小和分布的能力允许调整催化剂选择性。

3. 更好的初始稳定性：羟基锚定方法创建的强金属-载体相互作用可以通过防止活性位点烧结和聚集来提高催化剂的初始稳定性。

4. 优化孔利用：ALD反应的自限性有助于防止孔堵塞，允许多孔材料内表面积的有效利用。

然而，挑战仍然存在，特别是在长期稳定性方面。文献表明，由于焦炭形成、催化相的烧结或结晶以及金属物种（如ZnO）的蒸发等因素，仍可能发生失活。这表明，虽然羟基锚定方法可以提高催化剂的初始性能，但在某些应用中仍需要进一步研究以解决长期稳定性问题。
