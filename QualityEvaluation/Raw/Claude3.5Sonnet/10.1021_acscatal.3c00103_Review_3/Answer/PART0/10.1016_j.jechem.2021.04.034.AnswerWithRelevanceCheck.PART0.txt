          [1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

          [2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

          [3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

          [4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). That is, the isolated zinc species could be efficiently stabilized by S-1 zeolite in Zn-4@S-1 during the processes of PDH reaction as well as catalyst regeneration even under harsh conditions."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using Si-OH groups to trap and stabilize metal cations, such as zinc, in zeolites through in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. This approach enables highly dispersed and isolated metal species to be incorporated into the zeolite structure.

          The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance are significant:

          1. Improved dispersion and stability: The method allows for uniform distribution of metal species throughout the zeolite, preventing aggregation. The strong interaction between metal cations and Si-OH groups stabilizes the active sites, improving catalyst durability even under harsh reaction conditions and multiple regeneration cycles.

          2. Controlled incorporation: The approach enables precise control over metal loading and distribution, as evidenced by the gradual decrease in Si-OH groups with increasing zinc content.

          3. Enhanced activity and selectivity: The highly dispersed, isolated metal sites can lead to improved catalytic performance, providing a high number of accessible active sites and promoting uniform catalytic behavior.

          4. Improved stability and regenerability: The strong metal-support interaction prevents sintering and aggregation, leading to improved catalyst longevity and allowing for easy regeneration without significant loss of metal dispersion or activity.

          These improvements in metal-support interactions contribute to creating more efficient, selective, and stable heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation, potentially leading to better performance in industrial applications.

          羟基锚定方法通过利用Si-OH基团捕获和稳定金属阳离子（如锌），通过原位水热合成在沸石中实现活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这种方法使高度分散和孤立的金属物种能够被掺入沸石结构中。

          这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能的影响是显著的：

          1. 改善分散性和稳定性：该方法允许金属物种在沸石中均匀分布，防止聚集。金属阳离子与Si-OH基团之间的强相互作用稳定了活性位点，即使在苛刻的反应条件和多次再生循环下也能提高催化剂的耐久性。

          2. 可控掺入：这种方法允许精确控制金属负载量和分布，这从锌含量增加时Si-OH基团逐渐减少的现象中可以看出。

          3. 提高活性和选择性：高度分散的孤立金属位点可以带来更好的催化性能，提供大量可接触的活性位点，促进均匀的催化行为。

          4. 提高稳定性和再生能力：强金属-载体相互作用防止烧结和聚集，从而提高催化剂的寿命，并允许在不显著损失金属分散度或活性的情况下轻松再生。

          这些金属-载体相互作用的改善有助于创造更高效、更选择性和更稳定的固-气反应（如丙烷脱氢）异相催化剂，可能会在工业应用中带来更好的性能。
