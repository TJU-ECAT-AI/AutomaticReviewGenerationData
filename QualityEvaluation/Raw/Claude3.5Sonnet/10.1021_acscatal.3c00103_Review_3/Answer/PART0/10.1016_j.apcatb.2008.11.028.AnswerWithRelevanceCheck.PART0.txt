          "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively."

"XRD, DR UVvis and XAS results show that for low Co content cobalt is incorporated into the BEA lattice as tetrahedral Co(II) species (Scheme 1, reaction (2)). For much higher Co content (11 wt%), mainly octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear in extra-lattice position."

"These results show that the tetrahedral Co(II) species are responsible for the activity in SCR of NO by ethanol and selectivity toward N2 while octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides present in Co11SiBEA are detrimental for the N2 selectivity."

"To obtain samples with 0.8 and 11 Co wt%, 2 g of siliceous BEA zeolite (Si/Al > 1300), obtained by treatment of a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) BEA zeolite (Si/Al = 11) in a 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution (4 h, 353 K), were stirred for 24 h at 298 K in aqueous solutions containing 1.2 × 103 or 18 × 103 mol L1 of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O."

"The incorporation of Co into SiBEA zeolite leading to Co0.8SiBEA induces a reduction of intensity of these bands, in particular that at 3520 cm1 corresponding to H-bonded SiOH groups as shown in Fig. 1, in the same way as observed earlier for the incorporation of V into SiBEA, suggesting that silanol groups are consumed in the reaction with cobalt precursor and a tetrahedral Co(II) species are formed"

"We suggest, that the decrease of selectivity toward N2 at higher temperature particularly on catalysts containing mainly extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides (Co11SiBEA sample) is related to the depletion of organic mild oxidation products in the reaction zone as a result of full oxidation of ethanol by O2."

"The less NO oxidation is favored, the more SCR of NO toward N2 on CoSiBEA occurs. According to our previous work and literature data, it is likely that the reaction mechanism involves the preliminary adsorption of NO that is oxidized by O2 forming an adsorbed NOx species (x = 2,3) bound to Co(II) center. Lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species present in Co0.8SiBEA zeolite could activate ethanol by a abstracting a hydrogen atom and then forming an oxygenated intermediate."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It utilizes vacant T-sites in the zeolite framework, allowing metal ions (e.g., Co) to be incorporated into specific lattice positions.
2. The method involves reaction between metal precursors and silanol groups on the zeolite surface, enabling precise anchoring of metal species.
3. It allows control over metal loading by adjusting the concentration of metal precursor solution used.
4. The technique results in formation of isolated metal sites, such as tetrahedral Co(II) species, rather than larger metal oxide clusters.

This controlled incorporation enhances metal-support interactions by creating well-dispersed, framework-bound metal sites. It improves catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions by:

1. Generating isolated active sites with specific coordination environments (e.g., tetrahedral Co(II) species)
2. Preventing formation of larger metal oxide particles that can lead to deactivation
3. Creating strong metal-support bonds that improve thermal stability
4. Allowing fine-tuning of metal loading and distribution to optimize catalytic performance

In the specific case of CoSiBEA catalysts for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol:

1. Low Co content (0.8 wt%) results in predominantly tetrahedral Co(II) species incorporated into the zeolite lattice, which are highly active and selective for N2 production.
2. Higher Co content (11 wt%) leads to formation of extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides, which are detrimental to N2 selectivity.
3. The tetrahedral Co(II) species can activate both NO and ethanol in a controlled manner, promoting the SCR pathway and enhancing N2 selectivity.

Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring approach enables precise engineering of active sites in zeolite catalysts, leading to enhanced performance in heterogeneous catalysis applications, particularly in solid-gas reactions like SCR of NO.

          羟基锚定方法通过以下几种机制促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入：

1. 它利用沸石框架中的空缺T位点，允许金属离子（如Co）被掺入特定的晶格位置。
2. 该方法涉及金属前驱体与沸石表面硅羟基的反应，实现金属物种的精确锚定。
3. 通过调整所用金属前驱体溶液的浓度，可以控制金属负载量。
4. 该技术形成孤立的金属位点，如四面体Co(II)物种，而不是较大的金属氧化物簇。

这种受控掺入通过创建分散良好的、与框架结合的金属位点来增强金属-载体相互作用。它通过以下方式改善催化剂在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性：

1. 生成具有特定配位环境的孤立活性位点（如四面体Co(II)物种）
2. 防止形成可能导致失活的较大金属氧化物颗粒
3. 创建强金属-载体键，提高热稳定性
4. 允许对金属负载和分布进行微调，以优化催化性能

在CoSiBEA催化剂用于乙醇选择性催化还原(SCR)NO的特定情况下：

1. 低Co含量（0.8 wt%）主要形成掺入沸石晶格的四面体Co(II)物种，这些物种对N2生成具有高活性和选择性。
2. 较高的Co含量（11 wt%）导致额外晶格八面体Co(II)物种和/或钴氧化物的形成，这对N2选择性不利。
3. 四面体Co(II)物种可以以可控方式同时活化NO和乙醇，促进SCR途径并增强N2选择性。

总的来说，羟基锚定方法能够精确地设计沸石催化剂中的活性位点，从而在多相催化应用中获得更好的性能，尤其是在NO的SCR等固-气反应中。
