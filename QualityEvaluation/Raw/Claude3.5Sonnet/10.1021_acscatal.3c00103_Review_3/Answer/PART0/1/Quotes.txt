[1] "Grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 on SiO2700 followed by a thermal treatment at 600 C yielded ZnII/SiO2 as a white solid that contains ZnII single sites (1.73 wt% Zn to 0.80 Zn per nm2), free of organic ligands along with isolated OH sites (0.66 OH per nm2)"

[2] "In the next step, [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] (1.2 equiv./OH) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was grafted onto the surface OH groups of ZnII/SiO2"

[3] "The material was subsequently treated under H2 at 600 C for 8 h yielding a black material  Pt0Znδ+/SiO2  suggesting the formation of particles (3.05 wt% Pt, 1.54 wt% Zn). HAADF-STEM images of Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 confirmed the formation of well-dispersed and narrowly distributed sub-nanometric particles (0.8  0.2 nm)"

[4] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

[5] "The combined results of the CO and pyridine IR studies suggest the formation of an alloyed PtZn material along with residual surface ZnII sites."

[1] "Originally based on CVD, in recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."

[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."

[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."

[4] "This unique deposition pattern effectively avoids channel blocking in porous systems and ensures excellent film uniformity on almost any substrate."

[5] "Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite during the first cycle of ZnO ALD; in subsequent ALD cycles Zn species are grafted through the hydroxyl groups formed in the previous deposition cycle."

[6] "Since the catalytic activity of ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite mostly comes from the incorporated ZnO, the enhanced conversion with the increased number of ALD cycles is probably a reflection of the increased number of active sites which is obviously related to the higher loading of ZnO."

[7] "Based on these findings we conclude that the deactivation of the Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO catalyst is due to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO."

[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

          [2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

          [3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

          [4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). That is, the isolated zinc species could be efficiently stabilized by S-1 zeolite in Zn-4@S-1 during the processes of PDH reaction as well as catalyst regeneration even under harsh conditions."

"29Si and 1H-29Si CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses reveal that the zeolite framework remains intact after the introduction of metal species and that the metal species replace the H atoms of Si-OH groups and are anchored on the defect sites of the zeolites"

"The above results can be attributed to the fact that the small Pt clusters tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."

"Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions located inside the zeolite channels can effectively inhibit metal migrations to the outer surface of zeolite crystals, avoid the severe aggregation of metal species due to the loss of confinement effect of zeolites, and improve the regeneration stability of catalysts."

"To further demonstrate that all metal species are confined within the zeolite matrix rather than on the outer surface of crystals, shape-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 4-nitro-o-xylene reactions were performed by using the ammonia borane as a reductant at room temperature over Pt@S-1-H and commercial Pt/C catalysts."

"Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry."

"Significantly, avoiding the conventional calcination process and employing direct reduction method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Pt species."

[1] "Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties."

[2] "Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."

[3] "Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated."

[4] "The existence of hydroxyl groups during the zeolite formation process can promote the incorporation of active metal sites into the zeolite framework."

[5] "The hydroxyl nests on the dealuminated zeolite can be utilized for anchoring bimetallic PtM alloys."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups on the zeolite support can provide a unique electronic and geometric ambiance, facilitating the anchoring of active compounds and inhibiting catalytic deactivation."

"The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively."

"XRD, DR UVvis and XAS results show that for low Co content cobalt is incorporated into the BEA lattice as tetrahedral Co(II) species (Scheme 1, reaction (2)). For much higher Co content (11 wt%), mainly octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear in extra-lattice position."

"These results show that the tetrahedral Co(II) species are responsible for the activity in SCR of NO by ethanol and selectivity toward N2 while octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides present in Co11SiBEA are detrimental for the N2 selectivity."

"To obtain samples with 0.8 and 11 Co wt%, 2 g of siliceous BEA zeolite (Si/Al > 1300), obtained by treatment of a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) BEA zeolite (Si/Al = 11) in a 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution (4 h, 353 K), were stirred for 24 h at 298 K in aqueous solutions containing 1.2 × 103 or 18 × 103 mol L1 of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O."

"The incorporation of Co into SiBEA zeolite leading to Co0.8SiBEA induces a reduction of intensity of these bands, in particular that at 3520 cm1 corresponding to H-bonded SiOH groups as shown in Fig. 1, in the same way as observed earlier for the incorporation of V into SiBEA, suggesting that silanol groups are consumed in the reaction with cobalt precursor and a tetrahedral Co(II) species are formed"

"We suggest, that the decrease of selectivity toward N2 at higher temperature particularly on catalysts containing mainly extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides (Co11SiBEA sample) is related to the depletion of organic mild oxidation products in the reaction zone as a result of full oxidation of ethanol by O2."

"The less NO oxidation is favored, the more SCR of NO toward N2 on CoSiBEA occurs. According to our previous work and literature data, it is likely that the reaction mechanism involves the preliminary adsorption of NO that is oxidized by O2 forming an adsorbed NOx species (x = 2,3) bound to Co(II) center. Lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species present in Co0.8SiBEA zeolite could activate ethanol by a abstracting a hydrogen atom and then forming an oxygenated intermediate."

[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

[1] "Through the selective reaction of homoleptic metal siloxides, hydrocarbyls, alkoxides and aluminates with hydroxyl groups found on the surface of oxides (henceforth described as grafting), it has been possible to generate isolated surface species which can be subsequently thermally treated, under reduced pressure, inert or even reactive conditions (e.g. synthetic air), to generate well-defined surface sites of known oxidation state, geometry and nuclearity"

[2] "This approach has been widely exploited for an array of transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) as well as Cu, Zn, main group elements (Al, Ga, etc.) and lanthanides, where the strong MO bonds allow grafting and retention of highly dispersed metal sites."

[3] "The materials generated can be considered surface-doped oxide materials, with effective metal utilization (Msurface = 100%)."

[4] "Materials can be exhaustively characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques (IR, SS-NMR, XAS), electron microscopy, and traditional reactivity studies (catalyst evaluation, chemisorption, kinetics), where the numbers of active sites are known, and rates can be ascertained with a greater degree of accuracy."

[5] "This approach is particularly powerful to interrogate the structure of active sites and reaction mechanism"

[6] "The precise molecular control conferred by this approach enables explicit study of the interplay between structure and activity, complementing, and deconvoluting, experimental observations from more complex materials synthesized using traditional synthetic approaches."

[7] "These uniform materials, as model catalysts, are appealing as reference systems for ab initio modelling studies due to their well-defined nature, and the low nuclearity of the nanoparticles formed (in the case of late transition metals)."

[1] "Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

[2] "The partial substitution of metal cations M2+/M3+ with two different kinds of metal ions could also produce a bimetallic catalyst with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between Pt and supports."

[3] "For example, a zinc-containing support substantially modifies the formation of supported platinum particles together with the adsorption and catalytic properties of platinum."

"The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."

[1] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[2] "Silanols were analyzed in the hydroxyl vibration region of the DRIFT spectra of the selected catalysts presented in Fig. 3 b. The band at 3730 cm1 in all samples is assigned to the fundamental OH stretching vibration of isolated external silanols, and the band at 3600 cm1 shown in the AlBeta sample corresponds to the bridging hydroxyl groups (AlOHSi)"

[3] "The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols"

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

[5] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[6] "The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH."

[7] "Therefore, it can be inferred that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
