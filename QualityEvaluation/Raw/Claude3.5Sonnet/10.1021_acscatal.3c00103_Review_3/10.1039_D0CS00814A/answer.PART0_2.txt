The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal structure. This allows for the formation of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on thermally and chemically stable oxide supports upon calcination and reduction. 

The method enables partial substitution of metal cations with different metal ions, producing bimetallic catalysts with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys. This modulates the interaction between the active metal (e.g. Pt) and the support. For example, incorporating zinc into the support modifies the formation of supported platinum particles as well as their adsorption and catalytic properties.

By enabling precise control over metal incorporation and dispersion, this approach enhances metal-support interactions. This in turn can improve the activity, selectivity and stability of the resulting heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation. The well-defined, highly dispersed active sites and tuned metal-support interactions help optimize catalytic performance and durability.

羟基锚定方法通过使用在定义明确的晶体结构中均匀分布的可交换金属阳离子的矿物型前驱体，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这使得在焙烧和还原后，可以在热稳定和化学稳定的氧化物载体上形成高度分散的金属纳米粒子。

该方法允许部分替换金属阳离子与不同的金属离子，生成具有高度分散的金属/金属合金的双金属催化剂。这调节了活性金属（如Pt）和载体之间的相互作用。例如，将锌掺入到载体中会改变负载铂颗粒的形成以及它们的吸附和催化性质。

通过实现对金属掺入和分散的精确控制，这种方法增强了金属-载体相互作用。这反过来可以提高所得异相催化剂在固-气反应（如丙烷脱氢）中的活性、选择性和稳定性。定义明确、高度分散的活性位点和调谐的金属-载体相互作用有助于优化催化性能和耐久性。
