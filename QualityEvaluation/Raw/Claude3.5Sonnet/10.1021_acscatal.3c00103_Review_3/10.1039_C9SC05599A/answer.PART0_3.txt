[1] "Grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 on SiO2700 followed by a thermal treatment at 600 C yielded ZnII/SiO2 as a white solid that contains ZnII single sites (1.73 wt% Zn to 0.80 Zn per nm2), free of organic ligands along with isolated OH sites (0.66 OH per nm2)"

[2] "In the next step, [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] (1.2 equiv./OH) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was grafted onto the surface OH groups of ZnII/SiO2"

[3] "The material was subsequently treated under H2 at 600 C for 8 h yielding a black material  Pt0Znδ+/SiO2  suggesting the formation of particles (3.05 wt% Pt, 1.54 wt% Zn). HAADF-STEM images of Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 confirmed the formation of well-dispersed and narrowly distributed sub-nanometric particles (0.8  0.2 nm)"

[4] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a stepwise process:

1. First, zinc single sites are grafted onto the silica support through surface OH groups.

2. Then, platinum precursors are grafted onto the remaining OH groups of the zinc-modified silica. 

3. Finally, hydrogen treatment generates well-dispersed, sub-nanometric PtZn alloy particles.

This approach allows precise control over the metal loading, distribution, and particle size. It enhances metal-support interactions by creating intimate contact between the metals and the support surface. The resulting catalysts show improved activity, selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions compared to conventional impregnation methods. The narrow particle size distribution and presence of remaining zinc sites on the support surface likely contribute to the high stability by preventing sintering.

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the synthesis of tailored bimetallic catalysts with controlled interfaces, allowing systematic study of composition, size, and support effects on catalytic performance. This provides a powerful tool for developing structure-activity relationships in complex multimetallic catalyst systems.

羟基锚定法通过分步过程促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入：

1. 首先，将锌单原子位点通过表面羟基接枝到二氧化硅载体上。

2. 然后，将铂前驱体接枝到锌改性二氧化硅的剩余羟基上。

3. 最后，氢气处理生成分散均匀的亚纳米级PtZn合金颗粒。

这种方法可以精确控制金属负载量、分布和颗粒大小。它通过在金属和载体表面之间创造紧密接触来增强金属-载体相互作用。与传统浸渍法相比，所得催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。窄粒径分布和载体表面残留的锌位点可能通过防止烧结而有助于高稳定性。

羟基锚定法能够合成具有可控界面的定制双金属催化剂，允许系统研究组成、尺寸和载体效应对催化性能的影响。这为开发复杂多金属催化剂系统的结构-活性关系提供了强有力的工具。
