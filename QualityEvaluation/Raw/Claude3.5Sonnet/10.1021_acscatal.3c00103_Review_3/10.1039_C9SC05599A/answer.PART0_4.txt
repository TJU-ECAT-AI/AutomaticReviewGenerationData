[1] "Grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 on SiO2700 followed by a thermal treatment at 600 C yielded ZnII/SiO2 as a white solid that contains ZnII single sites (1.73 wt% Zn to 0.80 Zn per nm2), free of organic ligands along with isolated OH sites (0.66 OH per nm2)"

[2] "In the next step, [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] (1.2 equiv./OH) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was grafted onto the surface OH groups of ZnII/SiO2"

[3] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

[4] "The combined results of the CO and pyridine IR studies suggest the formation of an alloyed PtZn material along with residual surface ZnII sites."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several key mechanisms:

1. It allows for stepwise introduction of specific metal elements via grafting onto surface OH groups. This enables precise control over the metal composition and distribution.

2. It generates well-dispersed single metal sites initially, which can then be used as building blocks to form small, narrowly distributed alloy nanoparticles. 

3. It creates controlled interfaces between the metal particles and the support material.

This approach has important implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It allows formation of small, subnanometric alloy particles with narrow size distribution, which can lead to high catalytic activity and stability.

2. It enables tailoring of the metal-support interface, which can stabilize the metal particles and prevent sintering.

3. It can create residual metal sites on the support surface (e.g. ZnII sites), which may further stabilize the catalyst and influence its properties.

4. The high degree of control over particle size, composition and metal-support interactions allows for optimizing catalyst activity, selectivity and stability for specific reactions.

Overall, this controlled synthesis approach provides a powerful tool for developing highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts with tailored properties for solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

羟基锚定方法通过以下几个关键机制促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入：

1. 它允许通过在表面羟基上接枝来逐步引入特定的金属元素。这使得对金属成分和分布的精确控制成为可能。

2. 它最初生成分散良好的单金属位点，然后可以将其用作构建块来形成小而窄分布的合金纳米粒子。

3. 它在金属粒子和载体材料之间创建了受控的界面。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有重要影响：

1. 它允许形成小的、亚纳米级的合金粒子，具有窄的粒径分布，这可以导致高催化活性和稳定性。

2. 它能够调整金属-载体界面，这可以稳定金属粒子并防止烧结。

3. 它可以在载体表面创建残余金属位点（例如ZnII位点），这可能进一步稳定催化剂并影响其性质。

4. 对粒子大小、成分和金属-载体相互作用的高度控制允许为特定反应优化催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性。

总的来说，这种受控合成方法为开发高效稳定的异相催化剂提供了一个强大的工具，可以为丙烷脱氢等固-气反应量身定制催化剂性能。
