          [1] "Grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 on SiO2700 followed by a thermal treatment at 600 C yielded ZnII/SiO2 as a white solid that contains ZnII single sites (1.73 wt% Zn to 0.80 Zn per nm2), free of organic ligands along with isolated OH sites (0.66 OH per nm2)"

[2] "In the next step, [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] (1.2 equiv./OH) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was grafted onto the surface OH groups of ZnII/SiO2"

[3] "The material was subsequently treated under H2 at 600 C for 8 h yielding a black material  Pt0Znδ+/SiO2  suggesting the formation of particles (3.05 wt% Pt, 1.54 wt% Zn). HAADF-STEM images of Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 confirmed the formation of well-dispersed and narrowly distributed sub-nanometric particles (0.8  0.2 nm)"

[4] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

[5] "The combined results of the CO and pyridine IR studies suggest the formation of an alloyed PtZn material along with residual surface ZnII sites."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a stepwise process:

1. Initial grafting of metal precursors (e.g., Zn) onto surface hydroxyl groups of the support material (SiO2), creating single-site metal species.
2. Thermal treatment to remove organic ligands while maintaining metal single sites and some isolated hydroxyl groups.
3. Grafting of additional metal precursors (e.g., Pt) onto the remaining hydroxyl groups.
4. Final hydrogen treatment at high temperature to form small, narrowly distributed alloy nanoparticles.

This method has significant implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. Precise control over metal loading and distribution on the support surface.
2. Formation of small, subnanometric alloyed particles with narrow size distribution.
3. Creation of strong metal-support interactions through the grafting process.
4. Generation of residual surface metal sites (e.g., ZnII) that can further stabilize the catalyst.
5. Ability to tailor catalyst composition and structure at the molecular level.

These features result in improved activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation. The method allows for systematic study of composition, size, and support effects on catalytic performance, providing a powerful tool for developing structure-activity relationships in complex multimetallic catalyst systems.

          羟基锚定法通过以下步骤过程促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 将金属前体（如Zn）最初接枝到支撑材料（SiO2）的表面羟基上，创建单点金属物种。
2. 热处理去除有机配体，同时保持金属单点和一些孤立的羟基。
3. 将额外的金属前体（如Pt）接枝到剩余的羟基上。
4. 最后在高温下进行氢气处理，形成小而分布均匀的合金纳米粒子。

这种方法对增强金属-支撑体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有重要影响：

1. 精确控制金属在支撑体表面的负载和分布。
2. 形成小的、亚纳米级的合金粒子，具有窄的粒径分布。
3. 通过接枝过程创造强金属-支撑体相互作用。
4. 生成残余表面金属位点（如ZnII），可以进一步稳定催化剂。
5. 能够在分子水平上定制催化剂组成和结构。

这些特性导致在固-气反应（如丙烷脱氢）中改善了活性、选择性和稳定性。该方法允许系统研究组成、尺寸和载体效应对催化性能的影响，为开发复杂多金属催化剂系统的结构-活性关系提供了强有力的工具。
