[1] "Grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 on SiO2700 followed by a thermal treatment at 600 C yielded ZnII/SiO2 as a white solid that contains ZnII single sites (1.73 wt% Zn to 0.80 Zn per nm2), free of organic ligands along with isolated OH sites (0.66 OH per nm2)"

[2] "In the next step, [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] (1.2 equiv./OH) (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was grafted onto the surface OH groups of ZnII/SiO2"

[3] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

[4] "The material was subsequently treated under H2 at 600 C for 8 h yielding a black material  Pt0Znδ+/SiO2  suggesting the formation of particles"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several key steps:

1. It allows for the initial grafting of metal precursors (like Zn) onto surface hydroxyl groups of the support material (SiO2), creating single-site metal species.

2. Subsequent thermal treatment removes organic ligands while maintaining the metal single sites and some isolated hydroxyl groups.

3. These remaining hydroxyl groups then serve as anchoring points for grafting additional metal precursors (like Pt).

4. Final hydrogen treatment at high temperature leads to the formation of small, narrowly distributed alloy nanoparticles.

This method has important implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It enables precise control over metal loading and distribution on the support surface.

2. The stepwise introduction of different metals allows for the formation of well-defined bimetallic or multimetallic systems.

3. The resulting catalysts have small, homogeneous particle sizes, which can lead to improved activity and selectivity.

4. Strong metal-support interactions, facilitated by the grafting process, can enhance catalyst stability and resistance to sintering.

5. The ability to tailor the catalyst composition and structure at the molecular level allows for optimizing performance for specific reactions.

In solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation, these features translate to high productivity, selectivity, and stability compared to catalysts prepared by conventional methods.

羟基锚定法通过以下几个关键步骤促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 它允许将金属前体（如Zn）最初接枝到支撑材料（SiO2）的表面羟基上，创建单点金属物种。

2. 随后的热处理去除有机配体，同时保持金属单点和一些孤立的羟基。

3. 这些剩余的羟基随后作为锚定点，用于接枝额外的金属前体（如Pt）。

4. 最后在高温下进行氢气处理，导致形成小而分布均匀的合金纳米粒子。

这种方法对增强金属-支撑体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有重要影响：

1. 它能够精确控制金属在支撑体表面的负载和分布。

2. 不同金属的逐步引入允许形成明确定义的双金属或多金属系统。

3. 所得到的催化剂具有小而均匀的粒径，这可以导致改善的活性和选择性。

4. 通过接枝过程促进的强金属-支撑体相互作用可以增强催化剂的稳定性和抗烧结性。

5. 在分子水平上定制催化剂组成和结构的能力允许优化特定反应的性能。

在固-气反应（如丙烷脱氢）中，这些特性转化为与传统方法制备的催化剂相比更高的生产力、选择性和稳定性。
