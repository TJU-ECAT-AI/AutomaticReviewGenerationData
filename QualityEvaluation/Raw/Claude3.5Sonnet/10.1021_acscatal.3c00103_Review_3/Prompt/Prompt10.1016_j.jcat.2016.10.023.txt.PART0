Early stages in the formation and burning of graphene on a Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst: A temperature- and time-resolved study
Highlights
•
Graphene-like coke forms on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox during C3H8 dehydrogenation and blocks unselective sites.
•
Coke precursors migrate from active Pt sites toward the sites of graphene assembly.
•
Burning kinetics of coke is complex due to the mobility of surface species.
•
Partial oxidation of coke at mild temperatures recovers most active Pt sites.
Abstract
Deposition of graphene-like coke during non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation was investigated on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst. The initial blocking of Pt sites by graphene plays an important role in establishing the excellent steady-state selectivity of Pt-based catalysts toward propylene. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) pulse-response experiments was used to demonstrate that during the initial nucleation of graphene-like coke, the blocked active sites are spontaneously recovered on the timescale of minutes after the dosing of the feed is discontinued. These observations suggest that an additional transport process is involved between the generation of coke precursors on Pt dehydrogenation sites and their subsequent assimilation into the growing graphene sheet. After continued exposure to the propane feed under atmospheric pressure flow conditions, extensive deposits of deformed graphene are formed on small Pt nanoparticles and shifted onto the support. Multiple layers of graphite are also formed on large nanoparticles. During subsequent oxidative catalyst regeneration (burning), some of these carbonaceous deposits are readily oxidized in air already at 650 K, leading to significant recovery of Pt sites. However, those carbonaceous deposits that are less accessible to activated oxygen resist oxidation up to 800 K. Ex situ TEM characterization of incompletely burned samples and isothermal pulsed oxidation provided evidence that transport phenomena on the surface determine the accessibility of graphene-like coke for oxidation at a given temperature.

1. Introduction
Coke formation is ubiquitous in catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons and plays a decisive role in determining catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity
[1]
,
[2]
. Coke deposition within catalytic pellets not only hinders catalytic activity by permanently blocking active sites, but also causes adverse downstream effects including decreased energy- and atom-efficiency, catalyst degradation during regeneration cycles, and increased emissions of pollutants
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. However, coking effects are not exclusively detrimental. Some degree of coking can improve catalytic selectivity by hindering non-selective reactions to a greater extent than selective reactions. Coke can be catalytically active itself
[6]
,
[7]
and it has been shown to positively influence reactions on host catalytic surfaces
[8]
,
[9]
. While it is unlikely that coking can be completely avoided in any (if not all) non-oxidative hydrocarbon reactions, rationally managed coking can provide additional tools for process optimization
[10]
. The diversity and significance of coking effects in heterogeneous catalysis strongly motivate extensive investigation of coke deposition as well as the regeneration processes by which it can be removed. In addition, the same elementary processes involved in coke formation on metal catalysts are also important for manufacturing functional nanomaterials based on carbon allotropes such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
[11]
and graphene
[12]
.
The formation of coke on supported transition metal nanoparticles, which are widely used for industrial hydrocarbon processing, generally proceeds through the following consecutive steps
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
: (i) generation of deeply dehydrogenated surface species from the hydrocarbon feed by step-wise dehydrogenation and CC bond scission, (ii) transport of these species to coke-forming sites, (iii) their assimilation into growing coke deposits, and possibly (iv) shifting of the growing coke deposits away from the metal onto the catalyst support. These metal-mediated processes can also be accompanied by parallel processes of coke formation on the support materials, for example, via oligomerization and cyclization of unsaturated species on acidic sites. On transition metals with significant carbon solubility, such as Pd, Co, Ni, and Fe, coke grows via a dissolution/precipitation mechanism
[11]
,
[17]
,
[18]
in which step (ii) is mediated by the bulk of the metal: elemental carbon formed from the hydrocarbon feed first dissolves into the nanoparticles and then segregates into carbonaceous layers or filaments. The mechanism is different on transition metals with limited carbon solubility, such as Pt which destabilizes subsurface absorption of carbon relative to surface adsorption
[19]
: elemental carbon remains on the surface during the transport step (ii) and the assimilation step (iii). In their seminal contributions, Land et al. (see
[20]
and references therein) have directly observed this surface-mediated process by STM on Pt single-crystal surfaces. During the annealing of ethylene-covered Pt surface, dissociatively adsorbed ethylene was first dehydrogenated into ethylidyne which then decomposed into C1 fragments. These coke precursors in the form of monomers and dimers migrated toward coke nucleation sites, where they were incorporated into the growing graphene islands.
The coking/regeneration behavior of industrially-relevant supported catalysts may substantially differ from the behavior of structurally simple single crystals, although the overall sequence of steps is expected to be similar. In addition to the intrinsic properties of the metal, the coking behavior of supported nanoparticles is also affected by a number of factors related to the catalysts structural and electronic features. The finite size of metal nanoparticles alters their electronic makeup, which may drastically change the rates of the reaction steps involved in coking and coke burn-off. Nanoparticles expose a large fraction of undercoordinated atoms which provide structurally-diverse active sites for hydrocarbon reactions
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
and coke nucleation, as established in extensive studies of coking on Pt black by e.g. Paal and Schlgl
[24]
,
[25]
. In situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, environmental TEM, and other advanced characterization techniques have demonstrated
[26]
in recent years that metal nanoparticles can dynamically restructure in reactive environments and form completely new types of exposed metal sites. Moreover, the support itself can play an important role in stabilizing the metal nanoparticles, by giving raise to the adlineation sites along the metal-support interface, and possibly by mediating the transport of coke precursors or activated oxidant species. Despite many years of research efforts devoted to the study of coking in catalysis and the more recent wave of studies inspired by the discovery of graphene, many aspects of coke generation by this surface-mediated mechanism and of coke removal from supported metal catalysts remain poorly characterized.
The influence of finite particle size on coking behavior was investigated by Peng et al.
[27]
who employed high-resolution ex situ and in situ TEM to study coke formation on MgO-supported size-controlled Pt nanoparticles upon exposure to either isobutene or ethane. Coke deposits on these catalysts consist exclusively of graphene sheets that form on the stepped Pt surfaces. For Pt particles <6 nm, the graphene sheets shift onto the support surface and Pt particles >6 nm are encapsulated by the sheets. The resulting morphology of deposited graphene is controlled by the ability of nanoparticles to accommodate the strain energy generated by the growing carbon deposits and by the strength of carbon-metal bonding. Importantly, the authors decisively conclude that graphene is formed on supported Pt nanoparticles via the surface-mediated mechanism rather than the absorption/segregation mechanism based on the observed invariance of Pt lattice parameters in their experiments. The same group has recently shown by environmental TEM
[28]
that Pt nanoparticles undergo extensive restructuring during carbon deposition, which leads to circularity (rounding) of the nanoparticles due to the formation of new stepped surfaces. The same process explains the parallel formation of multiple encapsulating layers of carbon on >6 nm particles via continuous nucleation and shift of graphene sheets together with Pt atoms to which they remain attached. The entire surface of the nanoparticles appears to be in a state of constant atomic flux at the reaction conditions. The atomic details of this surface-mediated mechanism remain largely unknown, especially at the early stages of graphene nucleation on small nm-sized particles.
Herein, formation of graphene-like coke is investigated on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst closely related to the MgO-supported catalyst studied by Peng and co-authors
[27]
. The investigated catalyst was selected as a model material for a number of reasons. It belongs to a family of catalysts derived from Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) which have recently attracted considerable academic and industrial interest. Collapsed LDHs are thermally-stable materials with a high surface area that can be used as precursors for mono- and polymetallic catalysts with excellent dispersion characteristics and improved control over the degree of metal alloying.

LDH-derived catalysts have demonstrated that coking, which always occurs during the initial period of alkane dehydrogenation, plays a critical role in determining the steady-state activity and selectivity of these catalysts. The amount of coke formed always exceeds the stoichiometric amount of available Pt sites, suggesting that at least part of the coke is shifted onto the LDH-derived support (see
Fig. 2
). Dopants such as Ga and In are believed to facilitate the desorption of olefins from the surface, thus hindering secondary side reactions leading to coke. Dopants also assist in shifting the growing carbon deposits from the metallic nanoparticles. These observations invite further investigation of coking behavior on LDH-derived Pt as well as Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.
In addition to their industrial relevance, these catalysts provide a convenient model for characterizing chemically-homogeneous carbon deposits. Like pristine MgO, collapsed LDHs (Mg(Al)Ox) are slightly alkaline support materials that do not form significant amounts of coke in the absence of catalytically-active metal nanoparticles. We hypothesized that the 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst should produce exclusively graphene-like carbonaceous deposits, as observed by Peng et al.
[27]
, which can be characterized in isolation from other types of coke. Chemical homogeneity of coke deposits on the investigated material was necessary in this study, and facilitated a novel interpretation of the complex carbon oxidation kinetics.
Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) is widely employed for coke characterization on supported metal catalysts. During a TPO measurement, several peaks of CO2 typically evolve from the catalyst upon gradual heating in oxygen flow. When two clearly distinguished CO2 peaks are observed on supported Pt catalysts, their assignment in the literature commonly follows an established pattern: the lower temperature peak is assigned to the coke located on the metal sites and the higher temperature peak is assigned to the coke located on the support
[38]
,
[39]
. This simplistic picture necessitates substantial refinement to enable rational strategies of coke management and to advance TPO as a characterization method. As a rule, the first CO2 peak is comparable (by area) to the second peak. The assignment of these two peaks to metal and support sites, respectively, clearly contradicts the carbon-to-surface-metal ratios on coked catalysts that are usually much larger than one. To reconcile this discrepancy, it may be argued that the two TPO peaks correspond to chemically distinct coke. For example, it is plausible that acidic supports such as Al2O3 are reactive toward unsaturated bonds and form carbonaceous deposits which are chemically distinct from those on the metal sites. Coke on the acidic sites can form either directly from gaseous species or from the species that spill over onto the support from the metal. However, the fact that multiple TPO peaks are also observed on the inert and basic supports suggests that multiplicity of TPO peaks can result from other factors such as the mobility of the surface species that participate in coke formation and oxidation.
In this study, a supported Pt catalyst that is expected to form exclusively graphene-like coke was used as a model to exclude the influence of other types of coke. The mobility of surface species during the formation and burning of graphene was revealed using a combination of temperature- and time-resolved experiments, TEM imaging of coked and partially regenerated catalysts, as well as ab initio DFT modeling of relevant elementary steps. Unlike previous reports focusing primarily on fully-formed graphene deposits, this study also characterizes the initial stages of carbon deposition and burning in order to elucidate the mobility of surface species in more detail.
2. Experimental and theoretical methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation and ex situ characterization
A 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation of toluene Pt(acac)2 solution onto calcined Mg(Al)Ox support, which in turn was prepared by co-precipitation of Mg and Al salts. The catalyst used in this study contained 0.48% Pt, as determined by ICP, and had a BET specific area of 150 m2/g measured using a Micromeritics Gemini V automated system. Prior to the measurement of the surface area the samples were degassed at 573 K for 3 h. A sieve fraction of 250 < d < 450 μm was used in all experiments reported. The details of the catalyst preparation method and additional XRD, XAS, and TEM characterizations of similar catalysts can be found in earlier publications
[33]
,
[40]
,
[41]
. For the catalysts employed in this study, the Pt particle dispersion was determined by H2 chemisorption as 63%, which corresponded well to the most abundant particle size (1.5 nm, 60% particle dispersion) according to TEM.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used for structural analysis of (i) coked catalytic samples after propane dehydrogenation and (ii) coked samples that subsequently underwent partial oxidative regeneration (one-peak burn-off). A JEOL JEM-2200FS FEG TEM, equipped with spherical aberration corrector of objective lens (Cs corrector, CETCOR by CEOS-GmbH) operated at 200 kV was used. Aberration corrected TEM allows electron wave amplitude contrast regime instead of phase contrast and, thus cancels contrast delocalization, typical for non-corrected HRTEMs (superposition of ghost images of the lattice fringes and atomic columns, requiring mandatory computer aided contrast simulation for physically relevant interpretation of experimental images). Cs-corrected TEM allows direct measurements of interplanar and interatomic distances. In amplitude contrast regime dark areas represent distribution of crystal potential and bright areas  incident electron beam channeling through the potential. Spatial resolution of the TEM approaches information transfer limit and equals 0.13 nm. Actual atomic resolution on the images was limited predominantly by random orientation of crystals (atomic columns are not collinear with an incident electron beam). TEM samples were prepared by the immersion of lacey carbon film on a copper support grid into catalyst powders. Raman analysis of the fresh, coked, and partially regenerated samples was performed on a RXN1 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems) fitted with a 532 nm laser operating at 40 mW and a 5 m optical probe.
2.2. Flow experiments
Coking and coke burn-off flow experiments were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer equipped with an internal TCD detector, the effluent of which was connected to an external Pfeiffer Quadstar MS. All gases were purchased from Air Liquid. For each experiment, 0.2 g of the catalyst sample (sieve fraction 250 < d < 500 μm) was placed inside a U-shaped quartz reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The catalyst was heated to 923 K in 60 cm3/min flow of 5% H2 (N40) diluted in Ar (N46). Several reduction/oxidation cycles were performed at this temperature prior to the coking experiment in order to stabilize the catalyst. Then, to produce coke on the catalyst surface, the flow was switched to 2.25 μmol/s of C3H8 (60 Ncm3/min of 5% C3H8 (N35) diluted in α1-He) for 15 min. Propane, propylene, methane, hydrogen, and helium responses were monitored by MS at 29, 41, 16, 2, and 4 amu, respectively. These responses are reported as Site Time Yields (STY, mol s1 molPt,s1) calculated as the difference in the inlet and outlet molar flow rates, as measured relative to an internal standard (Ar) using an online quadrupole mass spectrometer, i.e. Yi = (F0,i  Fi)/NPt,s, where Fi (mol s1) is the molar flow rate of component i, and NPt,s, (molPt,s) is the amount of exposed (surface) Pt atoms in the sample. The catalyst was subsequently cooled to room temperature in He, after which the flow was switched to 45 μmol/s of pure O2 (60 Ncm3/min of α1-O2) for the TPO measurement. Then, the temperature was linearly increased at 5 K/min up to 923 K, while monitoring the CO2 signal at 44 amu.
Fully coked samples for TEM imaging were prepared using a similar coking procedure (15 min in 5% C3H8 flow at 923 K). To prepare partially regenerated samples, the coking was followed by an incomplete TPO treatment that was interrupted when the first CO2 peak was already complete (700 K), and before the emergence of the second CO2 peak. After the first CO2 peak, the catalyst was rapidly quenched in ice water to prevent coke degradation. The quenched samples were either extracted for ex situ TEM imaging or reduced in H2 and then subjected to another C3H8 treatment in order to reveal their dehydrogenation activity.
2.3. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) pulse-response experiments
Pulse-response TAP measurements were performed in a TAP-3E instrument (Mithra Technologies, St. Louis, USA) equipped with an Extrel Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS). The details of TAP experiments, typically performed under the Knudsen transport regime, and the corresponding data analysis can be found in Gleaves et al.
[42]
. In brief, 15 mg (250 < d < 500 μm sieve fraction) of the calcined 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst was loaded into a stainless steel microreactor (4 mm) as a thin-zone
[43]
of 1.5 mm in length, which was located between two inert beds of acid-washed quartz particles (same sieve fraction). The temperature of the catalyst was measured by a K-type thermocouple housed inside a steel well in the middle of the catalytic zone. Prior to the low pressure pulse-response experiments, the catalyst was heated to 923 K in a 15 μmol/s flow of pure H2 (N40, 20 Ncm3/min, 101.325 kPa). After 15 min at the target temperature, the flow was switched to 3 μmol/s of O2 (20% α1-O2 in N2, 20 Ncm3/min, 101.325 kPa) for 15 min, which was followed by another 15 min reductive treatment in H2. After a reduction/oxidation flow treatment, the microreactor was evacuated to the background pressure of 106 torr and maintained at 923 K for 30 min to desorb the remaining hydrogen from the surface.
The prepared reduced catalyst was subjected to a series of 400 small (5 · 109 mol) pulses consisting of 25% C3H8 (N35) and 75% He (α2), while the following masses were monitored by QMS, one amu per pulse: 2, 16, 29, 41, and 4. Data were recorded with millisecond time resolution for 10 s within each pulse. Additionally, amu 26 and 30 were recorded during some experiments in order to assess the presence of C2 products, but no surplus C2 was detected above the level of impurities in the feed mixture. C3H8, C3H6, CH4, H2, and He were also pulsed over the inert quartz bed for calibration.
Two types of experiments were performed immediately after this coking pretreatment. In the time-delay experiments, the same C3H8/He mixture was pulsed in shorter (4050 pulses) sequences with an increasing time delay between the end of the preceding sequence and the beginning of the new sequence. The time delay between the last pulse of the preceding sequence and the first pulse of the new sequence was varied between 11 s and 610 s. In the coke burn-off experiments, a sequence of synthetic air pulses was admitted into the microreactor while monitoring the CO2 signal at amu 44. The burn-off sequence proceeded until CO2 no longer evolved from the catalyst (100 pulses).
2.4. DFT calculations
Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[44]
. Geometries and electronic energies of adsorbed species and transition states were calculated at 0 K. Thermochemical values were calculated based on vibrational analyses in the harmonic oscillator approximation at 900 K, which can accurately be applied in the temperature range of 850 K to 950 K. The non-local optPBE vdw-DF functional
[45]
was used for DFT calculations. This functional takes into account non-local interactions, such as van der Waals forces, in contrast to the regularly applied GGA-PBE or PW91 functionals which were used in earlier studies on propane dehydrogenation
[46]
,
[47]
. DFT calculations were performed with the projector augmented wave method (PAW)
[48]
and a 400 eV plane-wave cutoff kinetic energy. The first-order Methfessel Paxton method and a smearing width of 0.2 eV were used to describe the partial occupancies close to the Fermi level.
The Pt(1 1 1) surface was represented using a 4 × 2 unit cell that consists of four Pt-layers in the c-direction, with a vacuum layer of 12 Å between the slabs. Brillouin zone integration for surface slab calculations on Pt(1 1 1) utilized a 3 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid
[49]
. The Pt lattice parameter of 2.82 Å was obtained from a bulk optimization of an fcc unit cell using the optPBE vdw-DF functional at an increased energy cutoff of 520 eV and on a 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst-Pack grid. The Pt(2 1 1) surface was represented using a 3 × 2 unit cell and a vacuum layer of 12 Å. The unit cell consisted of 4 Pt-layers in the c-direction, and the undercoordinated site (step) was located in the a-direction. Finally, the Pt(1 1 1) + Graphene surface was constructed by adsorbing a one-dimensional graphene ribbon on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which is possible since the graphene ribbon has similar lattice parameters as the 4 × 2 unit cell for Pt(1 1 1) (vacuum layer of 12 Å). The graphene ribbon on the surface results in a limited number of Pt surface atoms available for adsorption. Gas-phase calculations were performed in a 20 × 20 × 20 unit cell, considering only the Γ point in reciprocal space.
The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method
[50]
was used to calculate the minimum energy path between optimized reactants and products. The approximate geometry of the saddle point resulting from a rough NEB calculation was further refined in a Dimer calculation, which is an effective method to find the energy and configuration of the transition state
[51]
. Vibrational analyses were used to verify the validity of the transition states, with a single imaginary frequency in the spectrum, and to calculate activation enthalpies and entropies. Based on these calculations, rate and diffusion coefficients were obtained from the Transition State Theory (see SI) at a temperature of 923 K.
3. Results
3.1. Coke formation and oxidation in flow experiments
Upon exposure of the freshly reduced 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst to the C3H8/Ar flow at 923 K, the outlet stream contained C3H6, H2, CH4, and unreacted C3H8. Transient responses (
Fig. 1
a) exhibited an initial unselective period of methane and hydrogen generation lasting 1 min, which was followed by a sharp decline in CH4 generation and a gradual increase in selectivity toward C3H6.

Fig. 1. Flow experiments with 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox: (a) C3H8 dehydrogenation (coking) over fresh catalyst, CH4 (solid), H2 (dashed), C3H6 (dash-dot); (b) complete TPO of the coked catalyst, CO2 response (arbitrary units); (c) C3H8 dehydrogenation over completely regenerated catalyst; (d) partial TPO of the coked catalyst, CO2 response; (e) C3H8 dehydrogenation over partially regenerated catalyst. Dehydrogenation conditions: 923 K, 20 mg cat., 2.5 μmol/s of C3H8 (5% in He) for 15 min, 101.3 kPa. TPO conditions: 5 K/min ramp, 45 μmol/s of pure O2.
The propane feed was then discontinued after 20 min on stream, and the catalyst was cooled in He to room temperature, after which the carbonaceous deposits were subjected to O2 TPO. In one set of experiments, the temperature was linearly raised to 923 K at a rate of 5 K/min, while flowing O2. CO2 evolved in two distinct peaks with maximums at 646 and 797 K (
Fig. 1
b). It should be noted that the CO2 that was pre-adsorbed on the catalyst from the air was completely removed during the high-temperature reductive pretreatment, and all CO2 evolving from the catalyst during TPO was ascribed to the oxidation of carbon deposits. After TPO, the catalyst was reduced in H2 at 923 K, and another C3H8 treatment was performed to determine whether the catalytic activity was restored by the TPO/reduction cycle. The resulting transients (
Fig. 1
c) demonstrated that the activity and the characteristic selectivity pattern of the fresh catalyst were indeed mostly restored by the regeneration. In another set of experiments, the temperature ramp was stopped at 700 K, after the evolution of the first CO2 peak, but before the start of the second peak (
Fig. 1
d). The subsequent C3H8 treatment produced the transients depicted in
Fig. 1
e, which indicate that a significant portion of the catalytic activity and the selectivity patterns were restored even by the incomplete TPO treatment.
3.2. Ex situ characterization of carbonaceous deposits
The nanostructure of coked Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst is shown on HRTEM images in
Fig. 2
. Three morphological features are clearly distinguished. Firstly, the underlying support appears as platelets with pronounced crystallinity, which is ascribed to distorted cubic MgO
[27]
(
Fig. 2
a). Secondly, individual Pt nanoparticles of various sizes are visible as highly crystalline, dark, globular features (
Fig. 2
a and b). The distribution of particle size is dominated by small 1.52 nm particles, but a few elongated particles approximately 5 nm in cross section and 15 nm in length are also present (
Fig. 2
e). It should be noted that these larger particles exhibit a relatively high aspect ratio compared to the more spherical 2050 nm particles reported in Redekop et al.
[33]
who examined similar catalysts with 5 wt.% Pt loading. The large particles with low aspect ratio in the reported 5 wt.% Pt samples originated from the crystallites of dried Pt precursor remaining after the synthesis procedure. The longer particles observed here could instead result from the preferential growth of Pt along defects in the crystal lattice of the underlying support, such as the interlayer faults of the original LDH framework.

Fig. 2. Ex situ TEM of 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst coked in flow experiments. (a) Lattice planes (see lower-right inset) of the support are separated by 0.21 nm (see upper-left inset), characteristic of a distorted cubic MgO lattice
[27]
; (b) small (ca. 1.5 nm) Pt nanoparticles surrounded by highly-deformed graphene sheets; (c) an individual conglomerate of graphene sheets with a characteristic interplanar distance of graphite; (d) transition of graphene sheets originating on Pt nanoparticles onto the support surface, as indicated by the arrows; (e) graphitic layers surrounding a larger (>5 nm) Pt nanoparticle.
The third type of morphology in
Fig. 2
is composed of carbonaceous deposits that are spread over the catalyst surface. These deposits have a multilayered structure comprised of extended, highly defective graphene sheets. The sheets located in the vicinity of small Pt nanoparticles are attached to the Pt surface at one end, while the rest of their mass extends further onto the support surface (see
Fig. 2
d). On the support, the sheets are folded into rippled, highly entangled conglomerates such as those in
Fig. 2
c. In these images the carbonaceous deposits covering the support surface appear to be very irregular. Nevertheless, we assign such deposits primarily to graphitic carbon rather than amorphous coke on the basis of several considerations. First, multiple representative images demonstrate continuous transition of flat graphene sheets originating on Pt particles into entangled deposits located further away on the support, as indicated by the arrows in
Fig. 2
d. It is unlikely that the deposits lose their local graphene structure (hexagonal honeycomb lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms) during this gradual shift onto the support, although their extended well-ordered nature is clearly lost. Second, the inter-layer distance of 0.366 nm between these entangled sheets (see
Fig. 2
c) was within the expected range of {0 0 2} interlayer spacing in pristine graphite (0.335 nm)
[54]
. Finally, the parallel formation of amorphous coke on the support is unlikely due to the overall basicity of the MgO-dominated lattice, although the presence of more acidic Al-enriched regions cannot be excluded. Overall, the coke morphology was consistent with deformed graphene sheets, which will be referenced to as graphene-like coke. The sheets located in the vicinity of larger Pt nanoparticles form an onion-like structure of stacked layers which completely encapsulate the host Pt nanoparticles (
Fig. 2
e). The interlayer distance of 0.355 nm between these encapsulating sheets is slightly smaller compared to the distance of 0.366 nm between the entangled sheets originating from smaller Pt nanoparticles.
The assignment of carbonaceous deposits to graphene is further substantiated by a Raman analysis presented in
Fig. 3
. The spectrum corresponding to the coked sample exhibits two intense peaks at 1340 and 1600 cm1 which can be attributed to the characteristic D- and G-bands of graphene
[55]
, respectively. The approximate ratio of integrated intensities amounts to ID/IG  1.5 (see
SI, Fig. S5
).

The same morphological features (support platelets, Pt nanoparticles, and graphene sheets) appear on the partially regenerated catalyst samples collected after incomplete TPO treatments (see
Fig. 3
). However, when compared to the fully coked samples, several pronounced differences should be noted. The graphene sheets previously extending from the small Pt particles are mostly absent (
Fig. 4
b), except for isolated packets of entangled conglomerates that remain in certain areas (
Fig. 4
c). The encapsulating graphitic layers around larger Pt nanoparticles appear practically intact (
Fig. 3
d). The size distribution of Pt particles has shifted slightly upward at the expense of small 1.5 nm particles which now reach 23 nm on average. TEM images of the completely regenerated sample were very similar to the carbon-free areas of the partially regenerated sample (see
Fig. S1
), except that no carbon deposits could be found on the inspected Pt particles and the support surface. The average diameter of Pt nanoparticles increased to 34 nm.

3.3. TAP experiments
3.3.1. Pulsed coking with C3H8
The initial stages of coke formation during propane dehydrogenation and subsequent oxidative regeneration of 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox were characterized using isothermal TAP pulse-response experiments. To produce coke, a pretreated fresh catalyst was heated to the target temperature of 923 K and was subjected to a series of C3H8/Ar pulses (
Fig. 5
ad). The exit-flow rates of propane, propylene, hydrogen, and methane exhibited rapid changes during the initial 400 pulses, until all responses became stable and did not change from one pulse to the next. C3H8 conversion and the yields of C3H6, H2, and CH4 (per molecule of C3H8 converted) are plotted in
Fig. 5
e as functions of the number of injected C3H8/He pulses. Propane was almost completely converted at the beginning of the sequence, but then the conversion decreased and plateaued around 510% by the end of the sequence. During the initial pulses, C3H8 was converted mostly into hydrogen (
Fig. 5
c) and methane (
Fig. 5
d), but there was no propylene egressing from the reactor. C3H6 selectivity gradually increased toward the end of the sequence until it was the only carbon-containing product observed (
Fig. 5
b). After the deactivation of active sites, the residual dehydrogenation activity toward propylene in TAP experiments was very low in comparison with flow experiments. Concurrently, methane generation sharply declined and ceased completely by pulse 200. Hydrogen generation also declined after passing through an initial maximum and then stabilized by the end of the pulse sequence. The combined estimated amount of hydrogen atoms in H2, CH4, and C3H6 exceeded the amount of hydrogen atoms in converted C3H8. This discrepancy can be attributed to poor quantification of H2 by the QMS. Carbon-containing species were quantified more reliably (within 10% error). The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface was evaluated by calculating the residual between the amount of carbon delivered to the catalyst by converted C3H8 and the combined amount of carbon which has left the catalyst with methane and propylene.

3.3.2. Variable delay between C3H8 pulsing sequences
Having established that the catalyst activity toward propane decomposition is effectively suppressed by the buildup of graphene-like coke on the catalyst, it was possible to use this highly structure-sensitive side reaction as a probe to assess the availability of Pt sites that remained uncovered by graphene-like coke or by its precursors. In the next set of experiments, sequential series of several C3H8/Ar pulses were separated by a time delay which was varied between several seconds and several minutes. In
Fig. 6
the results of the time-delay experiments are presented in chronological order from left to right. Unlike in
Fig. 5
ad, the time axis is now contiguous instead of being stacked in the third dimension of individual pulse-periods. Only those signals that exhibited pronounced changes in this experiment, namely C3H8 (amu 29) and H2 (amu 2), are shown. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that the same four mass fragments were recorded in total as in the previous experiment (see Section
2.3
). At the far left, the pretreatment coking sequence is shown as a dense, compressed collection of responses. This sequence was described in the previous section and is not discussed here in detail (see
Fig. 5
ad). The exit-flow rates of C3H8 and H2 leveled out by the end of the pretreatment sequence due to partial coking, indicating that the pretreatment resulted in a coked catalyst state with residual low activity toward propane decomposition and dehydrogenation, as discussed previously.

The first delayed sequence commenced only 1 s after the end of the initial propane sequence in which the coked catalyst state was prepared. Thus, the total delay between pulses was only 11 s. The exit flow rates of both C3H8 and H2 remained unchanged compared to the end of this initial propane sequence. When the separation between the consecutive sequences was increased to 40 s, the first H2 response clearly exceeded the plateau, but the excess decayed before the second recorded H2 response. Evidently, the catalyst state had been altered in between the two pulse sequences, and for a short period of time it was more active toward propane. It can be noted that the first recorded C3H8 response within the same sequence (Δt = 40 s) did not demonstrate deviations from the previously observed plateau level. This first C3H8 response was recorded during the third pulse of the sequence, after H2 and He responses, because only one amu per pulse can be detected by a QMS. Thus, the catalyst state that caused the surplus H2 production during the first pulse had decayed by the third pulse in the sequence. Further increase in the inter-sequence delay to 130 s led not only to a pronounced over-production of hydrogen during the first pulse, but also to a decrease in the amount of egressing propane during the third pulse. The decay of the initial catalyst activity back to the plateau occurred in this sequence only by the fourth recorded H2 response (pulse 13). Similar results, but with much longer activity decay were observed after a 610 s inter-sequence pause. On the far right of
Fig. 6
, the gradual decay in activity is visible in both H2 and C3H8 responses. Methane generation was also observed during the first few pulses, but it was insignificant compared to methane generation on the fresh catalyst, suggesting that the uncoordinated sites and large Pt ensembles required for hydrogenolysis remained blocked by previously deposited coke. For each inter-sequence delay, the amount of surface Pt that was uncovered can be evaluated from the amount of carbon deposited within the following pulse sequence until propane consumption decayed again. As shown in
Fig. 7
, the amount of uncovered Pt sites increased nonlinearly with the increasing delay and trended toward a limiting value.

3.3.3. Isothermal pulsed oxidation of coke with O2
After the catalyst was coked by a C3H8/Ar sequence of 400 pulses, a series of pulses containing synthetic air was admitted at 923 K to burn off the carbon deposits. The emitted CO2 was monitored at amu 44 (see
Fig. 8
). The CO2 response during the very first oxygen pulse was dominated by a peak with a sharp maximum emerging at around 0.5 s, but it also exhibited a shoulder emerging 0.5 s later. As more oxygen pulses were admitted into the microreactor, the main peak appeared at an approximately constant time, but with gradually decreasing intensity. The shoulder, on the contrary, shifted to progressively later times, as shown in
Fig. 8
b. This shoulder had a slowly decaying tail, which by the 6th pulse in the sequence became so long that it could not be fully egressed within a maximal possible inter-pulse collection time of 20 s (limited by the data acquisition software). In fact, the ever increasing delay between the incoming oxygen pulse and the emergence of the shoulder eventually led to an apparent overlap between the delayed tail of the shoulder from a previous pulse and the newly generated main peak of the following pulse. The intensity of the shoulder gradually fell beyond the limit of detection after the admission of 20 oxygen pulses, while small amounts of CO2 in the main peak continued to emerge at a constant time for another 100 oxygen pulses. Attempts were made to systematically repeat the isothermal pulsed oxidation at various temperatures in order to evaluate characteristic activation energies for the main peak and the shoulder, but no meaningful parameters could be estimated due to the sporadic rate at which the shoulder shifted in time and the irreproducible ratio between the relative amounts of CO2 produced in the main peak and the shoulder. Nevertheless, the presence of the shoulder and the temporal behavior of CO2 were always qualitatively reproducible.

3.4. DFT calculations
Partial coking of the catalytic surface clearly has a profound effect on the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Time-delay TAP experiments demonstrated that this partial coking may be spontaneously alleviated by uncovering of active sites during the initial stages (see
Fig. 6
). Several candidate pathways were evaluated using periodic DFT to clarify the mechanism of the spontaneous uncovering of Pt sites that were blocked during C3H8 dehydrogenation. The site-blocking species were presupposed to consist of propylidyne (C3H5), adsorbed product (C3H6), or C1 species. In the absence of gaseous reagents, site-blocking C3H5 could eventually hydrogenate into C3H6 which could, in turn, either desorb into the gas phase as propylene or decompose into C1 fragments. The characteristic timescales for these processes were estimated based on the DFT-derived rate coefficients. These estimated timescales were compared to the experimentally observed timescale of site release in time-delay TAP experiments in order to determine which process was more likely to control the release of active sites (see Section
4
). Preliminary DFT and microkinetic calculations were used to estimate the timescale for the complex reaction network of C3-to-C1 conversion. The estimated timescale of this C3-to-C1 process is briefly discussed in relation to other timescales.
3.4.1. Propylidyne hydrogenation into propylene
A two-step conversion of site-blocking propylidyne into adsorbed propylene on the Pt(1 1 1) surface in the presence of surface hydrogen was considered (
Fig. 9
): a first step hydrogenates propylidyne to 1-propylidene and a second step converts 1-propylidene into its isomer propylene. The calculated activation energies and rate coefficients for these reactions are reported in
Table 1
. In the worst case scenario of very low local hydrogen coverage (0.01), the first step will be rate determining with a characteristic timescale of τ  2.5 · 105 s, where τ  1/(k · θH). In the best case scenario of high local hydrogen coverage, the second step will be rate determining with a characteristic timescale of τ  1 · 106 s.

3.4.2. Propylene desorption
Propylene adsorption was evaluated on three different Pt surfaces: Pt(1 1 1), Pt(2 1 1), and Pt(1 1 1) pre-covered with graphene. In agreement with Zaera and Chrysostomou
[56]
, calculations suggest that propylene adsorbs in a di-σ configuration (
Fig. 10
). Calculated adsorption energies are listed in
Table 2
. Propylene binds more strongly to the step atoms of the Pt(2 1 1) surface, 25 kJ/mol stronger than on Pt(1 1 1), while the close proximity of a graphene ribbon weakens propylene adsorption significantly in comparison with Pt(1 1 1). Therefore, propylene desorption from the Pt(2 1 1) surface provides an upper bound for estimating the timescale of desorption. The timescale of the 1st-order propylene desorption can be estimated as τdes  1/kdes, where kdes (1/s) is the desorption rate coefficient given for non-activated adsorption by kdes = k0exp((ΔEads)/RT)
[57]
. The desorption rate coefficient at 923 K was calculated to be 11.4 · 103 (1/s) (see SI), resulting in a desorption timescale of 104 (s).

3.4.3. Surface diffusion of C1 species
Diffusion pathways of two C1 species, CH2Pt2 and CPt4, were approximated by their hopping between two stable positions on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The minimum energy pathways between the two stable states were obtained using the NEB method. The starting point for each species was the most stable adsorption state, and species were allowed to move to the closest metastable position: CH2Pt hopped from the bridge position to the top position and CPt4 hopped from the fcc position, through the bridge, to the hcp position. From these metastable sites, the adsorbed species can directly migrate further to the next stable site on the surface, and therefore the studied minimum energy pathways allow the study of diffusion over the surface. For the two species, the diffusion barriers from the stable to the metastable site were, calculated using the NEB method, to be 75 and 70 kJ/mol, respectively, which translated to an approximated surface diffusion coefficient of 6.36.6 · 1012 m2/s at 923 K (see
SI, Table S1, and Fig. S7
). For a single diffusive jump between the sites of 1 · 1010 m, the approximate timescale of diffusion amounts to less than 108 s based on the Einstein equation
. One or several such jump events should be enough to free the active Pt site initially occupied by a C1 fragment. Based on these simple estimations, it can be concluded that C1 diffusion across an empty Pt(1 1 1) surface is rather fast and cannot account for the minute-long uncovering of Pt sites observed in TAP experiments. We expect the diffusion on the Pt(2 1 1) surface to be slightly slower due to stronger binding of C1 fragments, but not slow enough to affect the overall conclusions. However, surface coverage by other intermediates and by pre-formed carbon deposits may significantly hinder diffusion due to steric limitations and, therefore, increase the role of C1 diffusion in determining the rate of site-uncovering. More accurate modeling of such processes on densely covered surfaces, e.g. via a combination of ab initio and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, would provide a valuable extension of the present work, but it was outside the scope of this paper.
4. Discussion
In agreement with previous studies
[33]
, the concentration transients at atmospheric pressure (
Fig. 1
a) and the TAP exit-flow rates (
Fig. 5
ad) indicate that the buildup of coke on the 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst results in sequential hindering of catalytic reactions: first hydrogenolysis of C3H8 into CH4, then C3H8 dehydrogenation into C3H6, and finally decomposition of C3H8 into coke and H2. An extrinsic relaxation period can be clearly distinguished in the beginning of these transient experiments, i.e. when the catalyst changes in response to the reaction environment
[58]
. These transients are consistent with the following overall mechanism of propane dehydrogenation. The cascade of reactions is initiated by dissociative chemisorption and stepwise dehydrogenation of C3H8 into C3Hn species (n = 37). The overall selectivity of the process is determined by the competition between desorption of the partially dehydrogenated C3H6 species as gas-phase propylene  the target product  and deeper dehydrogenation of C3H6. These reactions are accompanied by CC bond scission giving rise to C1 and C2 species. C1 species may form gas-phase CH4 or participate in further reactions on the surface. C2 species may desorb as C2H6 or C2H4. The absence of these products in the experiments reported here can be attributed to their rapid secondary hydrogenolysis and decomposition. Concurrent side reactions of C13 species lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits which gradually deactivate the catalyst by blocking the active sites. Some of the aforementioned reactions, such as CC scission, are highly structure-sensitive, while others, like dehydrogenation
[52]
,
[53]
, are less structure-sensitive. Consequently, the balance between these reactions is affected by the relative populations of various types of Pt sites exposed by faceted nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. These changes are reflected in
Fig. 1
a by the selectivity shift during the extrinsic relaxation period from hydrogenolysis to dehydrogenation.
Low-coordinated Pt sites, such as corners, edges, and kinks, are very active in CC scission. But these sites also bind deeply dehydrogenated carbonaceous species stronger than the highly-coordinated Pt sites typically found on terraces. Therefore, these low-coordinated sites are most probably poisoned first, increasing C3H6 selectivity. As the coke deposits grow, the average size of exposed Pt ensembles on the atomic steps and terraces must also decrease, further hindering unselective CC scission. Eventually, methane generation stops completely as a result of coking. However, the deposition of carbon continues, albeit at a slower rate, as evidenced by continuing generation of extra-stoichiometric hydrogen and by previously reported data on the amount of deposited coke vs. time-on-stream
[29]
. TEM images in
Fig. 2
clearly demonstrate that carbonaceous deposits continue to grow well beyond a C/Pt ratio of 1 by shifting onto the support surface. These observations corroborate the classical results of Boudart et al.
[16]
, Sinfelt
[17]
, and Somorjai and Blakely
[14]
which differentiated the structure sensitivities of hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation. The residual activity of the coked catalyst can be tentatively attributed to a small population of Pt sites which are still accessible to the gas reagents despite extensive coking. Although we did not obtain clear evidence of such sites in TEM images, their presence was demonstrated in the literature
[27]
on small nm and sub-nm particles.
The present results complement the studies by Peng et al.
[27]
and Wu et al.
[28]
by examining coking behavior at very early as well as more mature stages of the dehydrogenation process. Very early stages of coking were characterized by TAP pulse-response experiments which elucidated the C3H8 interaction with the freshly reduced catalyst on a much shorter (<1 s) timescale and with better control over the amount of coke deposited per pulse than in conventional flow experiments. TAP experiments reproduced the selectivity behavior during the onset of coking, i.e. the extinction of methane generation and the increase in propylene production (
Fig. 5
ad). The pulse-wise gradual coking of Pt sites in TAP experiments is analogous to the kinetic studies by Menon et al.
[59]
and Shum et al.
[60]
in which Pt sites were gradually poisoned by sulfur, leading to the hindrance of hydrogenolysis and selectivity enhancements.
TAP experiments were also able to capture the dynamic processes involving carbon and Pt atoms on the catalytic surface in the absence of gaseous reagents (
Fig. 6
). When the delay between sequential pulse sequences was longer than a few seconds, the first several pulses of the resumed sequence demonstrated increased C3H8 consumption and extra-stoichiometric H2 release in comparison with the last pulses of the preceding interrupted sequence. This suggests that previously blocked Pt sites responsible for unselective reactions were spontaneously uncovered or otherwise regenerated during the inter-sequence pause. Several hypotheses can be put forth to explain the observed uncovering of unselective Pt sites: (i) desorption of site-blocking species into the gas-phase, (ii) dissolution of site-blocking carbon atoms into Pt nanoparticles, (iii) migration of coke precursors away from the active sites, (iv) detachment and migration of the entire graphene sheet away from Pt sites, and (v) formation of new Pt sites due to surface restructuring.
The desorption of propylene into the gas phase, which according to DFT calculations (see Section
3.4
) occurs on a timescale of 104 s, cannot explain the uncovering of active sites between interrupted pulsing sequences that occur on a timescale of minutes. In agreement with these estimates, the tail of the propylene signal in the TAP experiments (see
SI, Fig. S3
) did not display any signs of continuing slow desorption beyond the collection time of a single pulse. If the sites were blocked by more dehydrogenated species such as propylidyne, these site-blocking species could be slowly converted back to propylene by hydrogenation and would subsequently desorb, uncovering the sites. However, DFT results exclude this possibility, since propylidyne hydrogenation is also predicted to proceed on a sub-second timescale.
An alternative mechanism of the uncovering of active sites involves the conversion of C3 species into C1 species that leave the active sites either via dissolution into the deeper layers of Pt nanoparticles or via surface diffusion away from the active sites. The migration of elemental carbon into a Pt subsurface is unlikely based on its limited solubility. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that coke precursors migrate away from the active Pt sites, where they originate from the site-blocking C3 species, to a nearby site of graphene assembly. This hypothesis is supported by low-temperature STM studies of carbon CVD on Pt(1 1 1)
[20]
and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces
[61]
, which clearly demonstrated that a wide variety of coke precursors, including single carbon atoms, dimers, rectangles, and zig-zag chains, may exist on the surface as mobile species prior to their incorporation into graphene. Similarly, Loginova et al.
[62]
concluded that on Ru(0 0 0 1) surfaces graphene grows by the attachment of carbon pentamers rather than individual adatoms. It remains unclear whether the migrating species in our case are C1 or higher fragments. DFT estimations (see Section
3.4.3
) predict the timescale of C1 hopping between two adjacent Pt sites to be <108 s. Although these calculations do not take into account significant coverage of the surface by preexisting graphene sheets, which can introduce additional transport limitations, the hopping of C1 alone appears to be fast and cannot explain the overall timescale of site-uncovering. Preliminary DFT-based microkinetic calculations predict the timescale of decomposition of dehydrogenated C3 into dehydrogenated C1 species to be 1 min, suggesting that C3 to C1 conversion is the rate-determining step of this mechanism. This timescale closely matches the observed timescale of spontaneous site-uncovering in TAP experiments. It is also possible that the actual entities that migrate away from the active sites and later incorporate into the graphene sheet are not C1, but are more slowly diffusing C2 or C3 species. This interpretation would be consistent with the calculations showing that C1 must cross a higher barrier for their incorporation into graphene than dimers or trimers
[63]
,
[64]
.
The fourth hypothesis that could explain the uncovering of active sites is the continuous migration of entire graphene sheets away from the active sites. Graphene may grow from some Pt sites while reactants are continuously supplied from the gas phase. It may then detach and shift to the support when the pulsing is stopped. Numerous studies
[65]
,
[66]
have shown that peripheral carbon atoms at the edges of graphene islands and nanotubes attach very firmly to metal surfaces. It is unlikely that spontaneous migration of entire graphene sheets away from Pt surfaces could generate significant energy gain to enable rupture of the PtC bonds.
Finally, the peripheral Pt atoms with the graphene sheet still attached may shift with respect to the underlying layer of Pt atoms as part of surface restructuring, since PtPt bonds within small nanoparticles may be weaker than PtC bonds at their surfaces
[67]
,
[68]
. In situ TEM studies
[69]
,
[28]
have indicated that Pt and Pt-based alloyed nanocrystals assume a liquid-like state at elevated temperatures and undergo extensive restructuring. If such shifts of Pt layers indeed occur, they may lead to the formation of new Pt sites that account for the renewed catalytic activity after the pulsing pause in TAP experiments. Indirect evidence of the formation of new Pt sites due to surface restructuring can be gleaned from the quantitative analysis of coke deposition during pulse-delay TAP experiments. It took 400 pulses in the initial catalyst deactivation sequence (
Fig. 5
) to hinder C3H8 conversion from nearly one to nearly zero, during which 2.5 molC/molPt,s was deposited. The amount of Pt sites that were spontaneously uncovered in the inter-pulsing pauses can be approximated to the first order by the amount of carbon that these uncovered sites later retained in the subsequent short pulse sequences (
Fig. 7
). The uncovered carbon sinks grew as a function of inter-sequence delay, but their capacity remained an order of magnitude lower (0.16 molC/molPt,s after 610 s delay) than the carbon capacity filled during the initial 400 pulse sequence. Yet, the uncovered Pt sites surprisingly exhibited nearly complete C3H8 conversion during the first few pulses. It then took less than 50 pulses to diminish this regained activity back to the same stable (<10%) residual conversion (
Fig. 6
). It is reasonable to suggest that the Pt sites that were made available (e.g. by surface restructuring) during the inter-sequence delays differed in nature and activity from the sites originally present on the fresh catalyst.
Some of the hypothetical mechanisms discussed above cannot be ruled out completely based on our data alone, motivating further time-resolved studies of coke deposition on suitable materials in order to facilitate kinetic and/or spectroscopic elucidation of relevant reaction steps. Based on limited data, we conclude that the C3-to-C1 conversion, followed by surface mobility of graphene precursors before they can assimilate into the growing graphene sheet, is the most likely explanation of the observed uncovering of Pt sites between delayed consecutive pulse sequences. This mechanistic proposal is in agreement with several theoretical
[22]
,
[63]
and experimental
[70]
studies which confirm the prevalence of small carbon clusters as precursors to graphene on Pt surfaces. Another factor that most probably contributes to the observed uncovering of Pt sites is significant restructuring of Pt surfaces caused by the interactions with carbon deposits. This conclusion lends additional experimental evidence to the earlier proposal by Feng et al.
[71]
that for practical materials such as Pt nanoparticles used in alkane dehydrogenation, coking processes likely will cause restructuring of the nanoparticles, with important implications for catalytic activity.
Significantly later stages of carbon deposition were investigated by ex situ TEM of thoroughly coked catalysts. The coke morphology (
Fig. 2
b) can be described as graphene sheets growing from small Pt nanoparticles onto the support or encapsulating large nanoparticles in multilayered graphite-like structures. This is in agreement with Peng et al.
[27]
, Wu et al.
[28]
, and Biris et al.
[72]
who studied carbon deposition on the MgO support with similar basicity. The graphene that shifts onto the support undergoes severe deformation resulting in highly rippled and entangled conglomerates with no apparent long-range order, but the local structure and interlayer spacing of the original graphene sheets are likely to be preserved. The carbonaceous deposits seen in TEM images may also include carbon nanotubes such as those that were observed by Peng et al.
[27]
and Biris et al.
[72]
. The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see
Fig. 3
). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene
[63]
. It should be noted that some of the deformed graphene-like coke agglomerates in
Fig. 2
are morphologically similar to the Type 1 growth morphology and turbostratic CNTs identified by Kudo et al. on the surface of zirconia nanoparticles
[73]
. Analogously to Pt nanoparticles investigated here, Kudo at al. concluded that these morphologies are characteristic of the surface-mediated mechanism of carbon deposition.
Temperature-resolved oxidation of coked catalysts provided additional insights into the differentiation of carbonaceous deposits resulting from their different locations on the catalyst surface. Two well-separated CO2 peaks centered at 650 K and 800 K were observed in TPO experiments (
Fig. 1
b). Despite substantial morphology deformations, coke deposits on Mg(Al)Ox-supported materials are exclusively graphene-like due to the mildly basic nature of Mg(Al)Ox which precludes the formation of coke via propylene oligomerization. Therefore, both CO2 TPO peaks originate from graphene. A temperature ramps up to an intermediate temperature followed by rapid quenching was used to isolate the catalyst state after the first of the two TPO peaks. According to ex situ TEM (see
Fig. 4
), the graphene sheets in the vicinity of small Pt nanoparticles were readily oxidized (burned) at much lower temperatures than the multilayered deposits encapsulating larger nanoparticles and the entangled graphene sheets located in certain areas of the support surface. To interpret these differences, we must consider the mechanism of coke oxidation on supported metal catalysts. The activated oxygen required for coke burning originates on Pt nanoparticles. Additional TPO experiments with pure graphite confirmed that in the absence of Pt, graphitic carbon deposits burn at the much higher temperature of 1073 K (see
SI, Fig. S6
). Therefore, it is likely that the spillover and surface-mediated transport of activated oxygen species are involved. We considered two potential mechanisms that may be responsible for coke differentiation upon oxidation: (i) surface mobility of activated oxygen species, and (ii) mobility of Pt nanoparticles. Based on our data alone, we could not exclude either of these mechanisms.
The first mechanism begins by O2 dissociation on those few Pt sites that remain exposed to the gas after deactivation. The same sites are probably responsible for the residual C3H8 conversion. The active oxygen species resulting from O2 dissociation begin to burn graphene on the surrounding Pt surface. As graphene is burned off, more Pt sites become available for oxygen activation. Graphene in the immediate vicinity of Pt nanoparticles is also rapidly oxidized by the spilled-over activated oxygen species
[74]
. However, with gradually increasing distance between oxygen-dissociating Pt nanoparticles and available carbon on the support surface, the transport of oxidizing species begins to play a more prominent role in determining the overall rate. For yet unidentified reasons, certain locations on the support surface even remain inaccessible for the spilled-over oxidant, which would explain the remaining graphene agglomerates seen in
Fig. 4
c. The encapsulating layers around larger Pt nanoparticles survive oxidation at lower temperature (
Fig. 4
d) because they completely block the access of gas phase oxygen to the Pt surface. Diffusion limitations are alleviated at higher temperatures, allowing the remaining coke to burn. According to this mechanism, it can be concluded that a double-peak TPO feature resulted from spatially non-isotropic surface transport of activated oxygen toward the receding front of burning carbon.
Isothermal pulsed oxidation in the TAP reactor further substantiates the involvement of surface mobility in coke oxidation, which results in the appearance of the CO2 shoulder and its rapid shift toward later egress (
Fig. 8
). As discussed in Section
3.3
, only the very early stages of carbon deposits were investigated in these experiments. The increasing delay of the CO2 shoulder suggests that even at these early stages the deposited carbon extends away from the Pt surface. The shifting of the CO2 shoulder could have been explained by an additional post-oxidation process on the catalyst surface involving generated CO2, such as reversible adsorption on the support. However, the responses of separately pulsed CO2 (see
SI, Fig. S4
) over the catalyst did not show any signs of such additional processes, confirming that the evolution of the shoulder is related to transient processes on the catalyst surface during CO2 formation. The surface transport, in this case, is clearly manifested in time and is not obscured by other phenomena as it is in atmospheric-flow TPO experiments. Theofanidis et al.
[75]
observed similar phenomena during isothermal (TAP) pulsed oxidation of coke from Ni/Fe catalysts supported on MgAl2O4. In addition to the shifting of the CO2 shoulder, they were able to distinguish the induction period of oxygen consumption without significant CO2 formation which they attributed to the oxidation of Ni and Fe nanoparticles. In our case, no induction period was observed indicating that the oxidizing species are surface-bound rather than incorporated into an oxide.
It was previously shown that important kinetic features of carbon oxidation may be overlooked when using standard TPO analysis, and it has been suggested that a combination of temperature-resolved and time-resolved methods is beneficial for coke characterization
[76]

[77]
. Instead of a continuous temperature ramp until all coke deposits are burned, a method of partial burning developed by Querini and Fung
[76]
involves a rapid initial ramp to an intermediate value followed by prolonged burning of coke at a constant temperature. These data provided additional information on the morphology of coke by elucidating how the reaction order with respect to coke changes as function of coke conversion. In their experiments, the time-dependent CO2 generation during the isothermal burn-off period also appears as a shoulder, but any analogy with the shoulder in
Fig. 8
is coincidental. Unlike the combined procedure of incomplete ramping to an intermediate temperature and isothermal burning applied by Querini and Fung, we applied these two procedures separately as a partial TPO and an isothermal pulsed oxidation. Combined, the results derived from these experiments re-affirm the complementarity of T- and t-resolved methods for oxidative coke characterization and demonstrate that chemical diversity is not necessary for carbon deposits to exhibit complex oxidation behavior.
The second, radically different, mechanism that could explain the pulsed oxidation results and coke differentiation upon oxidation involves the migration of Pt nanoparticles over the support surface. The migrating particles serve the role of moving sources of dissociated oxygen species. Evidence of such a mechanism is offered in the literature based on remarkable developments in the Environmental TEM (ETEM) technology and its recent applications for in situ imaging during the carbon burn-off process on transition metal nanoparticles. For example, Booth et al.
[78]
and Gardini et al.
[79]
have demonstrated that metal nanoparticles may engage in transport through the layers of carbon deposits during carbon burn-off. This, in fact, elaborates on the much earlier studies of Pt and other metals burning through graphite
[80]
. The surface mobility of nanoparticles may provide an alternative explanation for the time-dependent CO2 evolution that was observed during the TAP experiments, in agreement with Theofanidis et al.
[75]
, although the hypothetical surface mobility of Pt nanoparticles is expected to be inhibited by strong stabilization provided by the Mg(Al)Ox support
[41]
. Overall, the experimental results reported here further substantiate the emerging view that catalytic processes occurring under realistic conditions are highly-dynamic processes involving multiple, often structure-altering, phenomena.
5. Conclusions
Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments. In agreement with the literature, these experiments suggest that non-selective Pt sites that are responsible for hydrogenolysis and decomposition of propane are partially blocked during the initial stages of coke formation, leading to the increase in selectivity toward propylene. Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes. DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites. It can be surmised that TAP or TAP-inspired methodologies can offer promising tools for tracking the migration of carbon precursors on a substrate and their assimilation into growing carbon deposits in the context of CVD graphene growth.
According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support. On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes. Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al.
[27]
. Most of the coke deposits blocking the active sites on small nanoparticles can be removed and a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by partial oxidation at relatively mild conditions (up to 700 K), without burning off all of the carbon deposits from larger particles and support.
Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface. The involvement of surface transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts. In fact, both of those peaks may contain the coke located on the support material, but some of these coke deposits may be more accessible for the oxidizing species due to additional transport processes on the surface. These TPO peaks should not be prematurely assigned to distinct forms or location of carbon without additional considerations involving complex transport-chemistry interactions. Time-resolved isothermal oxidation should be used in conjunction with temperature-resolved oxidation in order to elucidate such interactions. Based on limited data, we could not unambiguously distinguish between the surface mobility of activated oxygen species or Pt nanoparticles as sources of the observed behavior.
The conclusions of this study exemplify how time-resolved kinetic characterization using small perturbations (e.g. TAP) can offer a sensitive probe for the subtle details of catalytic reactions, CVD, ALD, solid-phase transitions, and other surface-mediated processes. Similar experiments with time-delay can be made even more powerful by using isotopic labeling of gases and by coupling pulse-response techniques with simultaneous surface-sensitive spectroscopy.
