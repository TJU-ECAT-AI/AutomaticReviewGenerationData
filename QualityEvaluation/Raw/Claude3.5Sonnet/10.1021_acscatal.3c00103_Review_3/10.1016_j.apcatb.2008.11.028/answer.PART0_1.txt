[1] "To obtain samples with 0.8 and 11 Co wt%, 2 g of siliceous BEA zeolite (Si/Al > 1300), obtained by treatment of a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) BEA zeolite (Si/Al = 11) in a 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution (4 h, 353 K), were stirred for 24 h at 298 K in aqueous solutions containing 1.2 × 103 or 18 × 103 mol L1 of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O."

[2] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively. It does not generate acidic Brnsted sites as shown by FTIR of pyridine adsorption."

[3] "XRD, DR UVvis and XAS results show that for low Co content cobalt is incorporated into the BEA lattice as tetrahedral Co(II) species"

[4] "Zeolite with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species is active in SCR of NO by ethanol with selectivity towards N2 exceeding 85% for NO conversion from 30 to 70%."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a two-step post-synthesis process. First, the zeolite is dealuminated to create vacant T-sites and silanol groups. Then, cobalt ions are introduced by stirring the dealuminated zeolite in an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate.

This method allows for precise control over the metal content and its distribution within the zeolite structure. For low cobalt content (0.8 wt%), the metal is predominantly incorporated as isolated tetrahedral Co(II) species in lattice positions. This results in strong metal-support interactions without generating acidic Brønsted sites.

The implications for heterogeneous catalysts are significant:

1. Enhanced activity: The tetrahedral Co(II) species in lattice positions are highly active for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol.

2. Improved selectivity: Catalysts with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species show high selectivity towards N2 (>85%) in the SCR reaction.

3. Better stability: The strong metal-support interactions likely contribute to improved catalyst stability, although this is not explicitly stated in the given text.

By controlling the metal incorporation process, this method allows for the design of catalysts with specific active sites tailored for particular reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic processes in solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定法通过两步后合成过程促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。首先，沸石经过脱铝处理以创造空缺的T位点和硅羟基。然后，通过将脱铝的沸石在硝酸钴水溶液中搅拌来引入钴离子。

这种方法可以精确控制金属含量及其在沸石结构中的分布。对于低钴含量（0.8 wt%），金属主要以孤立的四面体Co(II)物种的形式掺入晶格位置。这在不产生酸性Brønsted位点的情况下形成了强金属-载体相互作用。

这对于多相催化剂的影响是显著的：

1. 增强活性：晶格位置的四面体Co(II)物种对乙醇选择性催化还原（SCR）NO具有高活性。

2. 提高选择性：含有晶格四面体Co(II)物种的催化剂在SCR反应中对N2表现出高选择性（>85%）。

3. 提高稳定性：强金属-载体相互作用可能有助于提高催化剂稳定性，尽管给定文本中并未明确说明这一点。

通过控制金属掺入过程，这种方法允许设计具有特定活性位点的催化剂，针对特定反应进行定制，潜在地可以在固-气反应中实现更高效和选择性的催化过程。
