[1] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively. It does not generate acidic Brnsted sites as shown by FTIR of pyridine adsorption."

[2] "We suggest, that the decrease of selectivity toward N2 at higher temperature particularly on catalysts containing mainly extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides (Co11SiBEA sample) is related to the depletion of organic mild oxidation products in the reaction zone as a result of full oxidation of ethanol by O2."

[3] "The less NO oxidation is favored, the more SCR of NO toward N2 on CoSiBEA occurs. According to our previous work and literature data, it is likely that the reaction mechanism involves the preliminary adsorption of NO that is oxidized by O2 forming an adsorbed NOx species (x = 2,3) bound to Co(II) center. Lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species present in Co0.8SiBEA zeolite could activate ethanol by a abstracting a hydrogen atom and then forming an oxygenated intermediate."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing metal ions to react with silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the zeolite structure. This creates isolated metal species integrated into the zeolite framework, rather than forming bulk metal oxides.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Formation of well-dispersed, isolated metal sites strongly bound to the support
2. Prevention of metal agglomeration and sintering
3. Creation of unique metal coordination environments

This leads to improved catalyst performance in several ways:

1. Higher activity due to increased number of accessible active sites
2. Enhanced selectivity from the unique electronic/geometric properties of isolated sites
3. Improved stability from stronger metal-support interactions preventing sintering

Specifically for CoSiBEA in NO reduction, the isolated tetrahedral Co(II) sites showed higher selectivity for N2 production compared to octahedral/oxide species. The tetrahedral sites can activate both NO and ethanol in a controlled manner to promote the selective catalytic reduction pathway.

羟基锚定方法通过允许金属离子与沸石结构中空缺T位的硅羟基反应,促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法创造了集成到沸石骨架中的孤立金属物种,而不是形成大块的金属氧化物。

增强金属-载体相互作用的影响包括:

1. 形成分散良好的、与载体强烈结合的孤立金属位点
2. 防止金属团聚和烧结
3. 创造独特的金属配位环境

这导致了催化剂性能的改善,主要体现在以下几个方面:

1. 由于可接触活性位点数量增加而提高活性
2. 由于孤立位点独特的电子/几何特性而提高选择性
3. 由于更强的金属-载体相互作用防止烧结而提高稳定性

特别是对于CoSiBEA在NO还原中,与八面体/氧化物物种相比,孤立的四面体Co(II)位点表现出更高的N2生成选择性。四面体位点可以以可控方式同时活化NO和乙醇,从而促进选择性催化还原途径。
