[1] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively."

[2] "To check the acidity of Co0.8SiBEA, pyridine is adsorbed on the dehydrated sample at room temperature and FTIR spectra recorded after desorption of pyridine at different temperatures (Fig. 2). The pyridinium cations IR bands are not observed on the dehydrated Co0.8SiBEA, indicating that Brnsted acidic sites are not present."

[3] "XRD, DR UVvis and XAS results show that for low Co content cobalt is incorporated into the BEA lattice as tetrahedral Co(II) species (Scheme 1, reaction (2)). For much higher Co content (11 wt%), mainly octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear in extra-lattice position."

[4] "These results show that the tetrahedral Co(II) species are responsible for the activity in SCR of NO by ethanol and selectivity toward N2 while octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides present in Co11SiBEA are detrimental for the N2 selectivity."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing metal ions to react with silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the zeolite framework. This leads to the formation of isolated tetrahedral metal species incorporated into the lattice structure at low metal loadings.

The method has several implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It allows precise control over the nature and distribution of metal species. At low loadings, isolated tetrahedral species can be achieved, while higher loadings lead to extra-lattice octahedral species.

2. It preserves the zeolite structure while incorporating the metal, maintaining crystallinity.

3. It creates well-dispersed, isolated metal sites strongly anchored to the support.

4. It avoids the formation of Brønsted acid sites, allowing control of catalyst acidity.

5. The isolated tetrahedral species formed show superior activity and selectivity for certain reactions like selective catalytic reduction of NO, compared to octahedral or oxide species.

6. It improves stability by anchoring metal species to the support framework rather than as loosely bound clusters.

Overall, this method enables fine-tuning of the metal species nature, distribution, and interactions with the support, allowing optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions. The isolated, framework-incorporated metal sites often exhibit unique catalytic properties compared to traditional impregnated catalysts.

羟基针定法通过允许金属离子与分子筛骨架中空缺T位的硅羟基反应,从而促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这导致了在低金属负载量时,形成了掺入晶格结构中的孤立四面体金属物种。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有几个影响:

1. 它允许精确控制金属物种的性质和分布。在低负载量时,可以获得孤立的四面体物种,而高负载量会导致额外晶格八面体物种的形成。

2. 在掺入金属的同时保持了分子筛结构,维持了结晶度。

3. 它创造了分散良好的、与载体强烈针定的孤立金属位点。

4. 它避免了Brønsted酸位的形成,允许控制催化剂的酸性。

5. 形成的孤立四面体物种对某些反应(如NO的选择性催化还原)表现出优越的活性和选择性,相比于八面体或氧化物物种。

6. 它通过将金属物种针定到载体骨架上而不是作为松散结合的团簇,从而提高了稳定性。

总的来说,这种方法能够对金属物种的性质、分布和与载体的相互作用进行精细调节,从而允许针对特定反应优化催化剂性能。孤立的、掺入骨架的金属位点通常表现出独特的催化性能,相比于传统的浸渍催化剂。
