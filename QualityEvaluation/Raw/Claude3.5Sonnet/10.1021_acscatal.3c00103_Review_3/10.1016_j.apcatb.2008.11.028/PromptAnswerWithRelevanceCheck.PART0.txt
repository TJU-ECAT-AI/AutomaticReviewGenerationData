[1] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively."

[2] "To check the acidity of Co0.8SiBEA, pyridine is adsorbed on the dehydrated sample at room temperature and FTIR spectra recorded after desorption of pyridine at different temperatures (Fig. 2). The pyridinium cations IR bands are not observed on the dehydrated Co0.8SiBEA, indicating that Brnsted acidic sites are not present."

[3] "XRD, DR UVvis and XAS results show that for low Co content cobalt is incorporated into the BEA lattice as tetrahedral Co(II) species (Scheme 1, reaction (2)). For much higher Co content (11 wt%), mainly octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear in extra-lattice position."

[4] "These results show that the tetrahedral Co(II) species are responsible for the activity in SCR of NO by ethanol and selectivity toward N2 while octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides present in Co11SiBEA are detrimental for the N2 selectivity."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing metal ions to react with silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the zeolite framework. This leads to the formation of isolated tetrahedral metal species incorporated into the lattice structure at low metal loadings.

The method has several implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It allows precise control over the nature and distribution of metal species. At low loadings, isolated tetrahedral species can be achieved, while higher loadings lead to extra-lattice octahedral species.

2. It preserves the zeolite structure while incorporating the metal, maintaining crystallinity.

3. It creates well-dispersed, isolated metal sites strongly anchored to the support.

4. It avoids the formation of Brønsted acid sites, allowing control of catalyst acidity.

5. The isolated tetrahedral species formed show superior activity and selectivity for certain reactions like selective catalytic reduction of NO, compared to octahedral or oxide species.

6. It improves stability by anchoring metal species to the support framework rather than as loosely bound clusters.

Overall, this method enables fine-tuning of the metal species nature, distribution, and interactions with the support, allowing optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions. The isolated, framework-incorporated metal sites often exhibit unique catalytic properties compared to traditional impregnated catalysts.

2. 在掺入金属的同时保持了分子筛结构,维持了结晶度。

3. 它创造了分散良好的、与载体强烈针定的孤立金属位点。

4. 它避免了Brønsted酸位的形成,允许控制催化剂的酸性。

5. 形成的孤立四面体物种对某些反应(如NO的选择性催化还原)表现出优越的活性和选择性,相比于八面体或氧化物物种。

6. 它通过将金属物种针定到载体骨架上而不是作为松散结合的团簇,从而提高了稳定性。

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a two-step post-synthesis process. First, the zeolite is dealuminated to create vacant T-sites and silanol groups. Then, cobalt ions are introduced by stirring the dealuminated zeolite in an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate.

This method allows for precise control over the metal content and its distribution within the zeolite structure. For low cobalt content (0.8 wt%), the metal is predominantly incorporated as isolated tetrahedral Co(II) species in lattice positions. This results in strong metal-support interactions without generating acidic Brønsted sites.

The implications for heterogeneous catalysts are significant:

1. Enhanced activity: The tetrahedral Co(II) species in lattice positions are highly active for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol.

2. Improved selectivity: Catalysts with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species show high selectivity towards N2 (>85%) in the SCR reaction.

3. Better stability: The strong metal-support interactions likely contribute to improved catalyst stability, although this is not explicitly stated in the given text.

By controlling the metal incorporation process, this method allows for the design of catalysts with specific active sites tailored for particular reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic processes in solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定法通过两步后合成过程促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。首先，沸石经过脱铝处理以创造空缺的T位点和硅羟基。然后，通过将脱铝的沸石在硝酸钴水溶液中搅拌来引入钴离子。

这种方法可以精确控制金属含量及其在沸石结构中的分布。对于低钴含量（0.8 wt%），金属主要以孤立的四面体Co(II)物种的形式掺入晶格位置。这在不产生酸性Brønsted位点的情况下形成了强金属-载体相互作用。

这对于多相催化剂的影响是显著的：

1. 增强活性：晶格位置的四面体Co(II)物种对乙醇选择性催化还原（SCR）NO具有高活性。

2. 提高选择性：含有晶格四面体Co(II)物种的催化剂在SCR反应中对N2表现出高选择性（>85%）。

3. 提高稳定性：强金属-载体相互作用可能有助于提高催化剂稳定性，尽管给定文本中并未明确说明这一点。

通过控制金属掺入过程，这种方法允许设计具有特定活性位点的催化剂，针对特定反应进行定制，潜在地可以在固-气反应中实现更高效和选择性的催化过程。

The hydroxyl anchoring method described in this literature uses a two-step postsynthesis approach to incorporate cobalt into BEA zeolite as isolated tetrahedral Co(II) species. This method facilitates controlled incorporation by allowing cobalt ions to react with silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the zeolite structure. 

The implications of this method for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance include:

1. Better dispersion and isolation of active metal species in the zeolite framework
2. Formation of specific tetrahedral Co(II) sites without generating unwanted Brønsted acid sites
3. Improved activity and selectivity in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol, with high N2 selectivity
4. Enhanced stability of the metal species within the zeolite structure

This controlled incorporation method allows for the creation of well-defined active sites, which can lead to improved catalytic performance in solid-gas reactions compared to traditional impregnation methods that may result in less controlled metal species distribution.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It utilizes vacant T-sites in the zeolite framework, allowing metal ions to be incorporated into specific lattice positions.

2. The method involves reaction between metal precursors and silanol groups on the zeolite surface, enabling precise anchoring of metal species.

3. It allows control over metal loading by adjusting the concentration of metal precursor solution used.

4. The technique results in formation of isolated metal sites, such as tetrahedral Co(II) species, rather than larger metal oxide clusters.

This controlled incorporation enhances metal-support interactions by creating well-dispersed, framework-bound metal sites. It improves catalyst activity, selectivity and stability in solid-gas reactions by:

1. Generating isolated active sites with specific coordination environments 
2. Preventing formation of larger metal oxide particles that can lead to deactivation
3. Creating strong metal-support bonds that improve thermal stability
4. Allowing fine-tuning of metal loading and distribution to optimize catalytic performance

Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring approach enables precise engineering of active sites in zeolite catalysts, leading to enhanced performance in heterogeneous catalysis applications.

[1] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively. It does not generate acidic Brnsted sites as shown by FTIR of pyridine adsorption."

[2] "We suggest, that the decrease of selectivity toward N2 at higher temperature particularly on catalysts containing mainly extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides (Co11SiBEA sample) is related to the depletion of organic mild oxidation products in the reaction zone as a result of full oxidation of ethanol by O2."

[3] "The less NO oxidation is favored, the more SCR of NO toward N2 on CoSiBEA occurs. According to our previous work and literature data, it is likely that the reaction mechanism involves the preliminary adsorption of NO that is oxidized by O2 forming an adsorbed NOx species (x = 2,3) bound to Co(II) center. Lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species present in Co0.8SiBEA zeolite could activate ethanol by a abstracting a hydrogen atom and then forming an oxygenated intermediate."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing metal ions to react with silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the zeolite structure. This creates isolated metal species integrated into the zeolite framework, rather than forming bulk metal oxides.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Formation of well-dispersed, isolated metal sites strongly bound to the support
2. Prevention of metal agglomeration and sintering
3. Creation of unique metal coordination environments

This leads to improved catalyst performance in several ways:

1. Higher activity due to increased number of accessible active sites
2. Enhanced selectivity from the unique electronic/geometric properties of isolated sites
3. Improved stability from stronger metal-support interactions preventing sintering

Specifically for CoSiBEA in NO reduction, the isolated tetrahedral Co(II) sites showed higher selectivity for N2 production compared to octahedral/oxide species. The tetrahedral sites can activate both NO and ethanol in a controlled manner to promote the selective catalytic reduction pathway.

羟基锚定方法通过允许金属离子与沸石结构中空缺T位的硅羟基反应,促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法创造了集成到沸石骨架中的孤立金属物种,而不是形成大块的金属氧化物。

增强金属-载体相互作用的影响包括:

1. 形成分散良好的、与载体强烈结合的孤立金属位点
2. 防止金属团聚和烧结
3. 创造独特的金属配位环境

这导致了催化剂性能的改善,主要体现在以下几个方面:

1. 由于可接触活性位点数量增加而提高活性
2. 由于孤立位点独特的电子/几何特性而提高选择性
3. 由于更强的金属-载体相互作用防止烧结而提高稳定性

特别是对于CoSiBEA在NO还原中,与八面体/氧化物物种相比,孤立的四面体Co(II)位点表现出更高的N2生成选择性。四面体位点可以以可控方式同时活化NO和乙醇,从而促进选择性催化还原途径。
