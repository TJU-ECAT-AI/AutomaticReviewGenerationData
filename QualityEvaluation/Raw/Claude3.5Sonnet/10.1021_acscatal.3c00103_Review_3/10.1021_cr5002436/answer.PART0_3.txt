[1] "The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds by using surface OH groups as anchoring sites for metal precursors. This allows for a well-dispersed catalyst. The method likely enhances metal-support interactions by providing specific binding sites on the support surface. While not explicitly stated, this controlled dispersion and enhanced interaction could improve catalyst activity, selectivity and stability by creating more uniform active sites and preventing sintering. However, the passage does not provide direct evidence of improved catalytic performance from this method.

羟基锚定方法通过使用表面OH基团作为金属前体的锚定位点来促进活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这允许获得分散良好的催化剂。该方法可能通过在支撑表面提供特定的结合位点来增强金属-支撑相互作用。虽然没有明确说明，但这种受控分散和增强的相互作用可能通过创造更均匀的活性位点和防止烧结来提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，这段文字并没有提供这种方法能改善催化性能的直接证据。
