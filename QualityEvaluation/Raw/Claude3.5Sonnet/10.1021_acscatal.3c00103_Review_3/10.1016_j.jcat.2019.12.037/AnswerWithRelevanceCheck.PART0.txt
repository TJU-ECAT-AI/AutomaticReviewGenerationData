          [1] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[2] "Silanols were analyzed in the hydroxyl vibration region of the DRIFT spectra of the selected catalysts presented in Fig. 3 b. The band at 3730 cm1 in all samples is assigned to the fundamental OH stretching vibration of isolated external silanols, and the band at 3600 cm1 shown in the AlBeta sample corresponds to the bridging hydroxyl groups (AlOHSi)"

[3] "The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols"

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

[5] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[6] "The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH."

[7] "Therefore, it can be inferred that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. Dealumination of zeolites creates T-vacant sites with silanols, providing anchoring points for metal species.
2. The created silanols act as confined spaces to host and stabilize metal species like cobalt.
3. This confinement leads to highly dispersed, small metal particles strongly interacting with the support.
4. The controlled incorporation results in well-defined single-site or small cluster active species.
5. Strong metal-support interactions are promoted through anchoring to silanols.

The implications for enhancing catalytic performance in solid-gas reactions include:

1. Improved metal dispersion and stability against sintering.
2. Tunable electronic properties of metal sites through support interactions.
3. Confined environments that can influence reactant activation and product selectivity.
4. Enhanced resistance to coking and deactivation.
5. Ability to create uniform, well-defined active sites for improved activity and selectivity.
6. Formation of easily reducible metal oxide species confined in the created T-sites.
7. Generation of small metallic particles upon reduction, which act as highly active and selective catalytic sites.
8. Improved reusability and stability of the catalyst over multiple cycles.

Overall, this method allows precise control over the active site structure and properties, enabling the design of high-performance catalysts with optimized activity, selectivity and stability for various heterogeneous reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

          羟基锚定方法通过以下几种机制促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 沸石的脱铝形成含有硅羟基的T空位，为金属物种提供锚定点。
2. 形成的硅羟基作为约束空间来容纳和稳定如钴等金属物种。
3. 这种约束导致高度分散的、与载体强相互作用的小金属颗粒。
4. 受控掺入产生明确定义的单点或小簇活性物种。
5. 通过锚定到硅羟基上促进了强金属-载体相互作用。

对固-气反应中催化性能的影响包括：

1. 改善金属分散度和抗烧结稳定性。
2. 通过与载体的相互作用调节金属位点的电子性质。
3. 约束环境可以影响反应物活化和产物选择性。
4. 增强抗积炭和失活能力。
5. 能够创建均匀、明确定义的活性位点，以提高活性和选择性。
6. 在创建的T位点中形成易还原的金属氧化物物种。
7. 还原时生成小金属颗粒，作为高活性和高选择性的催化位点。
8. 提高催化剂在多个循环中的可重复使用性和稳定性。

总的来说，这种方法允许精确控制活性位点结构和性质，使得能够设计出具有优化活性、选择性和稳定性的高性能催化剂，适用于各种多相反应，如丙烷脱氢（PDH）。
