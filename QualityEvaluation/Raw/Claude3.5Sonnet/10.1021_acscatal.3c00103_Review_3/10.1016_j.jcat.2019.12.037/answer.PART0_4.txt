[1] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[2] "SiBeta solid was excessively impregnated with calculated cobalt nitrate solution (1 g of SiBeta in 20 mL of solution) and stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The impregnated samples were dried at 80 C for 8 h and then calcined at 600 C for 6 h in air with a heating rate of 10 C min1."

[3] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several steps:

1. Dealumination of the zeolite creates vacant T-sites with silanols. 

2. The dealuminated zeolite is impregnated with a metal precursor solution.

3. Subsequent drying and high-temperature calcination leads to the formation of metal species confined in the silanol sites.

This method enhances metal-support interactions by confining the metal species within the zeolite structure. The confined metal species are highly dispersed and easily reducible, which improves their catalytic activity. The confinement also helps maintain high dispersion and prevents sintering, enhancing stability. The modified zeolite structure with low acidity is beneficial for selectivity in many reactions.

This approach allows for precise control over the metal loading and distribution, resulting in catalysts with improved activity, selectivity and stability for solid-gas reactions compared to conventional impregnation methods. The confined metal species can maintain high dispersion even under harsh reaction conditions.

羟基锚定法通过以下几个步骤促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 沸石的脱铝创造了带有硅醇的空T位。

2. 将脱铝后的沸石浸渍在金属前驱体溶液中。

3. 随后的干燥和高温煅烧导致金属物种被限制在硅醇位点中。

这种方法通过将金属物种限制在沸石结构内来增强金属-载体相互作用。被限制的金属物种高度分散且易于还原，从而提高了它们的催化活性。这种限制还有助于保持高度分散并防止烧结，提高稳定性。改性后的沸石结构具有低酸性，有利于许多反应中的选择性。

与传统浸渍方法相比，这种方法可以精确控制金属负载量和分布，从而得到具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的固-气反应催化剂。即使在苛刻的反应条件下，被限制的金属物种也能保持高度分散。
