[1] "To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates. Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts"

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing vacant T-sites with silanols created through dealumination treatment. These silanols provide suitable conditions for confining cobalt species, leading to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment. 

This method enhances metal-support interactions by anchoring Co(II) ions in the silanols, although only a small amount is anchored. The confined nature of the cobalt species improves their dispersion and prevents aggregation.

For heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH), this method has several implications:

1. Improved activity: The confined small metallic Co particles formed from reduction of confined CoOx are catalytically active for PDH.

2. Enhanced selectivity: At low Co loadings, the confined CoOx species lead to high propylene selectivity.

3. Better stability: The confined nature of the cobalt species helps prevent sintering and maintains catalyst performance over multiple cycles.

4. Control over active site formation: The method allows for controlled formation of small metallic Co particles, which are identified as the active sites showing great catalytic activity and high product selectivity.

Overall, this hydroxyl anchoring approach enables the creation of highly dispersed, confined metal species that exhibit superior catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for reactions like PDH.

羟基锚定方法通过脱铝处理创造具有硅醇基的空T位来促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入。这些硅醇基为限制钴物种提供了适当的条件，从而在高温处理后形成受限的钴物种。

这种方法通过将Co(II)离子锚定在硅醇基中来增强金属-载体相互作用，尽管只有少量被锚定。钴物种的受限性质改善了它们的分散性并防止聚集。

对于固-气反应中的多相催化剂（如丙烷脱氢（PDH）），这种方法有几个影响：

1. 提高活性：由受限CoOx还原形成的受限小型金属Co颗粒对PDH具有催化活性。

2. 增强选择性：在低Co负载量时，受限的CoOx物种导致高丙烯选择性。

3. 更好的稳定性：钴物种的受限性质有助于防止烧结，并在多个循环中保持催化剂性能。

4. 对活性位点形成的控制：该方法允许控制形成小型金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒被识别为具有优异催化活性和高产物选择性的活性位点。

总的来说，这种羟基锚定方法能够创造高度分散的、受限的金属物种，在PDH等反应中表现出优越的催化性能，包括活性、选择性和稳定性。

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through dealumination of zeolites like Beta, which creates vacant T-sites associated with silanols. This process modifies the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite, creating low acidity and T-vacant sites that are beneficial for catalytic reactions. 

The method allows for anchoring of metal ions like Co(II) to the created silanol groups, though in small amounts. This controlled incorporation enhances metal-support interactions by confining the metal species within the zeolite structure.

The implications for catalytic performance are significant. By allowing for highly dispersed and confined metal species, this method can lead to improved activity, selectivity and stability in solid-gas reactions. The confined metal species are less prone to sintering and can maintain high dispersion under reaction conditions. Additionally, the modified acidity and structural properties of the support can further tune the catalytic behavior.

In the case study presented, the CoSiBeta catalyst prepared using this method showed excellent performance for propane dehydrogenation, with high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and reusability - matching or exceeding commercial catalysts. This demonstrates how the hydroxyl anchoring approach can be used to develop green, low-cost catalysts with superior performance for industrially relevant reactions.

在所介绍的案例研究中,使用这种方法制备的CoSiBeta催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能,具有高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和可重复使用性 - 与商业催化剂相当或超过。这表明羟基锚定法可用于开发绿色、低成本的催化剂,在工业相关反应中具有卓越的性能。

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several steps:

1. Dealumination of the zeolite creates vacant T-sites with silanols. 

2. The dealuminated zeolite is impregnated with a metal precursor solution.

3. Subsequent drying and high-temperature calcination leads to the formation of metal species confined in the silanol sites.

This method enhances metal-support interactions by confining the metal species within the zeolite structure. The confined metal species are highly dispersed and easily reducible, which improves their catalytic activity. The confinement also helps maintain high dispersion and prevents sintering, enhancing stability. The modified zeolite structure with low acidity is beneficial for selectivity in many reactions.

This approach allows for precise control over the metal loading and distribution, resulting in catalysts with improved activity, selectivity and stability for solid-gas reactions compared to conventional impregnation methods. The confined metal species can maintain high dispersion even under harsh reaction conditions.

羟基锚定法通过以下几个步骤促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 沸石的脱铝创造了带有硅醇的空T位。

2. 将脱铝后的沸石浸渍在金属前驱体溶液中。

3. 随后的干燥和高温煅烧导致金属物种被限制在硅醇位点中。

这种方法通过将金属物种限制在沸石结构内来增强金属-载体相互作用。被限制的金属物种高度分散且易于还原，从而提高了它们的催化活性。这种限制还有助于保持高度分散并防止烧结，提高稳定性。改性后的沸石结构具有低酸性，有利于许多反应中的选择性。

与传统浸渍方法相比，这种方法可以精确控制金属负载量和分布，从而得到具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的固-气反应催化剂。即使在苛刻的反应条件下，被限制的金属物种也能保持高度分散。
