[1] "The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols"

[2] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

[3] "The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH."

[4] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the forms of confined CoOx for a low Co loading and bulk Co3O4 for a high Co loading in CoSiBeta catalysts."

[5] "Therefore, it can be inferred that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing vacant T-sites with silanols created through dealumination treatment. These silanols provide suitable conditions for confining cobalt species, leading to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment. 

This method enhances metal-support interactions by anchoring Co(II) ions in the silanols, although only a small amount is anchored. The confined nature of the cobalt species improves their dispersion and prevents aggregation.

For heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH), this method has several implications:

1. Improved activity: The confined small metallic Co particles formed from reduction of confined CoOx are catalytically active for PDH.

2. Enhanced selectivity: At low Co loadings, the confined CoOx species lead to high propylene selectivity.

3. Better stability: The confined nature of the cobalt species helps prevent sintering and maintains catalyst performance over multiple cycles.

4. Control over active site formation: The method allows for controlled formation of small metallic Co particles, which are identified as the active sites showing great catalytic activity and high product selectivity.

Overall, this hydroxyl anchoring approach enables the creation of highly dispersed, confined metal species that exhibit superior catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for reactions like PDH.

羟基锚定方法通过脱铝处理创造具有硅醇基的空T位来促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入。这些硅醇基为限制钴物种提供了适当的条件，从而在高温处理后形成受限的钴物种。

这种方法通过将Co(II)离子锚定在硅醇基中来增强金属-载体相互作用，尽管只有少量被锚定。钴物种的受限性质改善了它们的分散性并防止聚集。

对于固-气反应中的多相催化剂（如丙烷脱氢（PDH）），这种方法有几个影响：

1. 提高活性：由受限CoOx还原形成的受限小型金属Co颗粒对PDH具有催化活性。

2. 增强选择性：在低Co负载量时，受限的CoOx物种导致高丙烯选择性。

3. 更好的稳定性：钴物种的受限性质有助于防止烧结，并在多个循环中保持催化剂性能。

4. 对活性位点形成的控制：该方法允许控制形成小型金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒被识别为具有优异催化活性和高产物选择性的活性位点。

总的来说，这种羟基锚定方法能够创造高度分散的、受限的金属物种，在PDH等反应中表现出优越的催化性能，包括活性、选择性和稳定性。
