[1] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[2] "Silanols were analyzed in the hydroxyl vibration region of the DRIFT spectra of the selected catalysts presented in Fig. 3 b. The band at 3730 cm−1 in all samples is assigned to the fundamental OH stretching vibration of isolated external silanols, and the band at 3600 cm−1 shown in the AlBeta sample corresponds to the bridging hydroxyl groups (Al–OH–Si)"

[3] "Upon dealumination treatment, the band at 3730 cm−1 is well reserved, while the 3600 cm−1 band disappears due to the removal of lattice Al atoms. Simultaneously, a broad new band appears at 3440 cm−1, revealing the presence of vacant T-sites associated with silanols as reported in previous studies"

[4] "The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm−1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through dealumination of zeolites like Beta, which creates vacant T-sites associated with silanols. This process modifies the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite, creating low acidity and T-vacant sites that are beneficial for catalytic reactions. 

The method allows for anchoring of metal ions like Co(II) to the created silanol groups, though in small amounts. This controlled incorporation enhances metal-support interactions by confining the metal species within the zeolite structure.

The implications for catalytic performance are significant. By allowing for highly dispersed and confined metal species, this method can lead to improved activity, selectivity and stability in solid-gas reactions. The confined metal species are less prone to sintering and can maintain high dispersion under reaction conditions. Additionally, the modified acidity and structural properties of the support can further tune the catalytic behavior.

In the case study presented, the CoSiBeta catalyst prepared using this method showed excellent performance for propane dehydrogenation, with high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and reusability - matching or exceeding commercial catalysts. This demonstrates how the hydroxyl anchoring approach can be used to develop green, low-cost catalysts with superior performance for industrially relevant reactions.

羟基锚定法通过对Beta等沸石进行脱铝来促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入,这一过程创造了与硅羟基相关的空缺T位点。这一过程改变了沸石的结构和酸性质,创造了低酸度和T空位,这对催化反应有利。

该方法允许将Co(II)等金属离子锚定到所创造的硅羟基上,虽然数量较少。这种可控的掺入通过将金属物种限制在沸石结构内来增强金属-载体相互作用。

这对催化性能的影响是显著的。通过实现高度分散和限制的金属物种,该方法可以提高固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。受限的金属物种不易烧结,并能在反应条件下保持高度分散。此外,载体改性后的酸度和结构特性可以进一步调节催化行为。

在所介绍的案例研究中,使用这种方法制备的CoSiBeta催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能,具有高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和可重复使用性 - 与商业催化剂相当或超过。这表明羟基锚定法可用于开发绿色、低成本的催化剂,在工业相关反应中具有卓越的性能。
