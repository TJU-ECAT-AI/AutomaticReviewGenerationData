[1] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[2] "Silanols were analyzed in the hydroxyl vibration region of the DRIFT spectra of the selected catalysts presented in Fig. 3 b. The band at 3730 cm1 in all samples is assigned to the fundamental OH stretching vibration of isolated external silanols, and the band at 3600 cm1 shown in the AlBeta sample corresponds to the bridging hydroxyl groups (AlOHSi)"

[3] "The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols"

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. Dealumination of zeolites creates T-vacant sites with silanols, providing anchoring points for metal species.

2. The created silanols act as confined spaces to host and stabilize metal species like cobalt.

3. This confinement leads to highly dispersed, small metal particles strongly interacting with the support.

4. The controlled incorporation results in well-defined single-site or small cluster active species.

5. Strong metal-support interactions are promoted through anchoring to silanols.

The implications for enhancing catalytic performance include:

1. Improved metal dispersion and stability against sintering.

2. Tunable electronic properties of metal sites through support interactions.

3. Confined environments that can influence reactant activation and product selectivity.

4. Enhanced resistance to coking and deactivation.

5. Ability to create uniform, well-defined active sites for improved activity and selectivity.

Overall, this method allows precise control over the active site structure and properties, enabling the design of high-performance catalysts with optimized activity, selectivity and stability for various heterogeneous reactions.
