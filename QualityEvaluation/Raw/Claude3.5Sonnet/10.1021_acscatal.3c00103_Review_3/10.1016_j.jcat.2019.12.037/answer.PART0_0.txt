[1] "To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates. Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts"

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[4] "Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It creates vacant T-sites with silanols in the zeolite structure through dealumination, which provide anchoring points for metal species.

2. These created silanols allow for confinement and high dispersion of metal oxide species like CoOx within the zeolite framework. 

3. The confined metal species have strong interactions with the zeolite support, leading to high stability.

4. It allows for downsizing of metal catalysts into nanoparticulate form while stabilizing them on the zeolite substrate.

5. The adjustable inner environment of the zeolite can be used to modify the surrounding of the metal catalysts.

This method has important implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It enables creation of highly dispersed, confined metal active sites.

2. The strong metal-support interaction improves catalyst stability under harsh reaction conditions.

3. The confinement effect can lead to formation of small metal nanoparticles upon reduction, which can enhance activity and selectivity.

4. The modified acidity and porosity of the zeolite support can further tune catalytic properties.

5. Overall, it allows for precise control over the metal active sites at the molecular level, enabling design of high-performance catalysts with improved activity, selectivity and stability for reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

羟基锚定法通过以下几种机制促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入：

1. 它通过脱铝在沸石结构中创造了带有硅羟基的空缺T位，为金属物种提供了锚定点。

2. 这些创造的硅羟基允许金属氧化物物种（如CoOx）在沸石骨架内被限制和高度分散。

3. 被限制的金属物种与沸石载体有强烈的相互作用，导致高稳定性。

4. 它允许将金属催化剂缩小到纳米颗粒形式，同时将它们稳定在沸石基底上。

5. 沸石的可调内部环境可用于修改金属催化剂的周围环境。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能有重要影响：

1. 它能够创造高度分散、受限的金属活性位点。

2. 强金属-载体相互作用提高了催化剂在苛刻反应条件下的稳定性。

3. 限制效应可导致还原时形成小金属纳米粒子，从而提高活性和选择性。

4. 沸石载体的改性酸度和孔隙度可进一步调节催化性能。

5. 总的来说，它允许在分子水平上精确控制金属活性位点，从而设计出具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的高性能催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢等反应。
