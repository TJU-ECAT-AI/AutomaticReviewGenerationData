[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

[3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

[4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using Si-OH groups to trap and stabilize metal cations. In this case, zinc cations are trapped and stabilized by Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites through an in-situ hydrothermal synthesis process. This method allows for highly dispersed metal species throughout the zeolite structure.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance are significant:

1. Improved dispersion: The metal species are well-dispersed and isolated, preventing aggregation and maintaining a high surface area of active sites.

2. Enhanced stability: The strong interaction between metal cations and Si-OH groups helps maintain the dispersion of active sites even under harsh reaction conditions and multiple regeneration cycles.

3. Controlled incorporation: The method allows for precise control over metal loading, as evidenced by the gradual decrease in Si-OH groups with increasing zinc content.

4. Improved activity and selectivity: The highly dispersed, isolated metal sites can lead to improved catalytic performance, as demonstrated by the good dehydrogenation activity and high propylene selectivity of the Zn@S-1 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Regeneration capability: The strong metal-support interaction allows for easy regeneration of the catalyst without significant loss of dispersion or activity.

These improvements in metal-support interactions contribute to creating more efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions, potentially leading to better performance in industrial applications.

羟基锚定方法通过使用Si-OH基团捕获和稳定金属阳离子，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入。在这种情况下，锌阳离子通过原位水热合成过程被S-1分子筛中的Si-OH基团捕获并稳定。这种方法允许金属物种在分子筛结构中高度分散。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能的影响是显著的：

1. 改善分散性：金属物种高度分散且相互隔离，防止聚集并保持活性位点的高比表面积。

2. 增强稳定性：金属阳离子和Si-OH基团之间的强相互作用有助于在苛刻的反应条件和多次再生循环下维持活性位点的分散性。

3. 受控掺入：该方法允许精确控制金属负载量，这从锌含量增加时Si-OH基团逐渐减少的现象中可以看出。

4. 提高活性和选择性：高度分散的孤立金属位点可以带来更好的催化性能，这从Zn@S-1催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出的良好脱氢活性和高丙烯选择性中得到了证明。

5. 再生能力：强金属-载体相互作用使催化剂易于再生，且不会显著损失分散性或活性。

这些金属-载体相互作用的改善有助于创造更高效、更稳定的固-气反应异相催化剂，可能会在工业应用中带来更好的性能。
