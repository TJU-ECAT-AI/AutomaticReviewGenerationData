[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm−1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

[3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

[4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7(b). That is, the isolated zinc species could be efficiently stabilized by S-1 zeolite in Zn-4@S-1 during the processes of PDH reaction as well as catalyst regeneration even under harsh conditions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using Si-OH groups to trap and stabilize metal cations. This approach enables highly dispersed and isolated metal species to be incorporated into the zeolite structure. 

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance are significant:

1. It allows for uniform distribution of metal species throughout the zeolite, preventing aggregation.

2. The strong interaction between metal cations and Si-OH groups stabilizes the active sites, improving catalyst durability even under harsh reaction conditions.

3. It maintains high dispersion of metal species during reactions and regeneration cycles, preserving catalyst activity and stability over multiple uses.

4. The isolated nature of the metal sites likely contributes to high selectivity by providing uniform active centers.

5. This method enables precise control over metal loading and distribution, allowing for optimization of catalyst composition.

Overall, the hydroxyl anchoring approach results in well-defined single-site catalysts with enhanced metal-support interactions, leading to improvements in activity, selectivity, and stability for heterogeneous catalysis applications.

羟基锚定方法通过使用Si-OH基团捕获和稳定金属阳离子，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法使高度分散和孤立的金属物种能够被掺入沸石结构中。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用和改善催化剂性能的影响是显著的：

1. 它允许金属物种在沸石中均匀分布，防止聚集。

2. 金属阳离子与Si-OH基团之间的强相互作用稳定了活性位点，即使在harsh反应条件下也能提高催化剂的耐久性。

3. 在反应和再生循环过程中保持金属物种的高度分散，保持催化剂在多次使用中的活性和稳定性。

4. 金属位点的孤立性质可能通过提供均匀的活性中心来贡献高选择性。

5. 这种方法能够精确控制金属负载量和分布，从而优化催化剂组成。

总的来说，羟基锚定方法产生了具有增强的金属-载体相互作用的良好定义的单位点催化剂，从而在多相催化应用中提高了活性、选择性和稳定性。
