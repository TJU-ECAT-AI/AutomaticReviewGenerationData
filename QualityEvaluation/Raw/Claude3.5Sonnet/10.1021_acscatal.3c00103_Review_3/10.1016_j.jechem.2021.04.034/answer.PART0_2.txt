[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

[3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

[4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed"

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using Si-OH groups to trap and stabilize metal cations. In this case, zinc cations were successfully trapped and stabilized by Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites through in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. 

This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating well-isolated and highly dispersed metal species within the zeolite structure. The strong interaction between the metal and support prevents aggregation, even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

The implications for catalytic performance are significant:

1. Improved activity: Well-dispersed active sites increase the number of accessible catalytic centers.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Isolated metal species can provide uniform active sites, potentially improving reaction selectivity.

3. Better stability: Strong metal-support interactions prevent sintering and aggregation, leading to improved catalyst longevity.

4. Regeneration capability: The anchoring method allows for easy regeneration without loss of metal dispersion.

These benefits make the hydroxyl anchoring method a promising approach for designing more effective heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

羟基锚定法通过使用Si-OH基团捕获和稳定金属阳离子,促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控引入。在这个案例中,锌阳离子通过原位水热合成成功地被S-1沸石中的Si-OH基团捕获和稳定。

这种方法通过在沸石结构中创建良好分散的金属物种来增强金属-载体相互作用。金属和载体之间的强相互作用可以防止聚集,即使经过多次反应-再生循环后也是如此。

对催化性能的影响是显著的:

1. 提高活性:良好分散的活性位点增加了可接触的催化中心数量。

2. 增强选择性:孤立的金属物种可以提供均匀的活性位点,有可能提高反应选择性。

3. 更好的稳定性:强金属-载体相互作用防止烧结和聚集,从而提高催化剂的寿命。

4. 再生能力:锚定方法允许在不损失金属分散度的情况下轻松再生。

这些优势使羟基锚定法成为设计更有效的固-气反应(如丙烷脱氢)异相催化剂的有前景的方法。
