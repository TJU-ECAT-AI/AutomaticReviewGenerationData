[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups."

[3] "That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route."

[4] "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). That is, the isolated zinc species could be efficiently stabilized by S-1 zeolite in Zn-4@S-1 during the processes of PDH reaction as well as catalyst regeneration even under harsh conditions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using Si-OH groups to trap and stabilize metal cations. This approach enables highly dispersed and isolated metal species to be incorporated into the zeolite structure via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. 

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions are significant. The strong interaction between the metal species and the hydroxyl groups of the support prevents aggregation and maintains good dispersion, even under harsh reaction conditions and after multiple regeneration cycles. 

This improved metal-support interaction has positive effects on catalyst performance. It leads to better activity by providing a high number of accessible active sites. The high dispersion and isolation of metal species also contributes to improved selectivity by promoting uniform catalytic behavior. Additionally, the strong anchoring of metal species to the support enhances catalyst stability, allowing it to maintain performance over extended periods and through multiple regeneration cycles.

In the context of solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation, this method produces catalysts with good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration capability, demonstrating the potential for industrial applications.

羟基锚定方法通过利用Si-OH基团捕获和稳定金属阳离子，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法使高度分散和孤立的金属物种能够通过原位水热合成被掺入沸石结构中。

这种方法对增强金属-载体相互作用的影响是显著的。金属物种与载体羟基之间的强相互作用防止了聚集，并在苛刻的反应条件下以及多次再生循环后仍能保持良好的分散性。

这种改进的金属-载体相互作用对催化剂性能有积极影响。它通过提供大量可接触的活性位点来提高活性。金属物种的高度分散和孤立也通过促进均匀的催化行为来提高选择性。此外，金属物种与载体的强锚定增强了催化剂的稳定性，使其能够在长期使用和多次再生循环中保持性能。

在丙烷脱氢等固-气反应中，这种方法产生的催化剂具有良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和优异的再生能力，展示了其在工业应用中的潜力。
