[1] "Through the selective reaction of homoleptic metal siloxides, hydrocarbyls, alkoxides and aluminates with hydroxyl groups found on the surface of oxides (henceforth described as grafting), it has been possible to generate isolated surface species which can be subsequently thermally treated, under reduced pressure, inert or even reactive conditions (e.g. synthetic air), to generate well-defined surface sites of known oxidation state, geometry and nuclearity"

[2] "This approach has been widely exploited for an array of transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) as well as Cu, Zn, main group elements (Al, Ga, etc.) and lanthanides, where the strong MO bonds allow grafting and retention of highly dispersed metal sites."

[3] "The materials generated can be considered surface-doped oxide materials, with effective metal utilization (Msurface = 100%)."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through selective grafting of metal precursors onto surface hydroxyl groups. This approach enables the generation of isolated, well-defined surface sites with known oxidation state, geometry, and nuclearity. 

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance include:

1. Ability to create highly dispersed metal sites with strong metal-oxide bonds, preventing sintering and improving stability.

2. 100% surface metal utilization, maximizing the number of active sites.

3. Precise control over the oxidation state and coordination environment of metal centers, allowing tuning of catalytic properties.

4. Formation of uniform isolated sites or small clusters, which can exhibit unique reactivity compared to bulk materials.

5. Suppression of side reactions by eliminating spectator species typically present in traditional catalysts.

6. Enhanced understanding of structure-activity relationships by creating well-defined model systems.

Overall, this method enables the design of more active, selective, and stable heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions by providing molecular-level control over the active sites and metal-support interface.
