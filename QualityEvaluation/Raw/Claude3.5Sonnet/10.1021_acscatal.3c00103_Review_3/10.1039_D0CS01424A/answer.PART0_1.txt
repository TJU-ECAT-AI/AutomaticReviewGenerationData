[1] "Through the selective reaction of homoleptic metal siloxides, hydrocarbyls, alkoxides and aluminates with hydroxyl groups found on the surface of oxides (henceforth described as grafting), it has been possible to generate isolated surface species which can be subsequently thermally treated, under reduced pressure, inert or even reactive conditions (e.g. synthetic air), to generate well-defined surface sites of known oxidation state, geometry and nuclearity"

[2] "This approach has been widely exploited for an array of transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) as well as Cu, Zn, main group elements (Al, Ga, etc.) and lanthanides, where the strong MO bonds allow grafting and retention of highly dispersed metal sites."

[3] "Materials can be exhaustively characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques (IR, SS-NMR, XAS), electron microscopy, and traditional reactivity studies (catalyst evaluation, chemisorption, kinetics), where the numbers of active sites are known, and rates can be ascertained with a greater degree of accuracy."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through several mechanisms:

1. It enables selective grafting of metal precursors onto surface hydroxyl groups, generating isolated surface species.

2. Subsequent thermal treatments under controlled conditions allow formation of well-defined surface sites with known oxidation state, geometry and nuclearity. 

3. This approach can be used for a wide range of transition metals, main group elements, and lanthanides, creating strong metal-oxygen bonds that retain highly dispersed metal sites.

4. It allows precise control over the number and nature of active sites.

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance include:

1. Ability to create uniform, well-dispersed active sites with known characteristics.

2. Strong metal-support bonding that can improve stability.

3. Precise control over active site density and distribution.

4. Ability to thoroughly characterize materials and correlate structure to performance.

5. More accurate determination of intrinsic activity by knowing the number of active sites.

Overall, this approach enables the rational design of catalysts with optimized metal-support interactions and improved activity, selectivity and stability for solid-gas reactions. The molecular-level control and characterization facilitate understanding structure-property relationships to guide catalyst development.
