[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using silanol groups created from zeolite framework dealumination as anchoring sites. This approach enables highly dispersed and stabilized metal species on the support. The method has several implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving catalyst performance:

1. It ensures homogeneous dispersion of metal species across the support surface.

2. It promotes close contact between different metal species (e.g. Pt and Zn).

3. It enables electronic interactions between the metal species and support.

4. It results in robust catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

5. It allows for precise control over metal loading and distribution.

Overall, this method creates well-defined active sites with strong metal-support interactions, leading to catalysts with enhanced performance characteristics for solid-gas reactions compared to conventional impregnation methods.
