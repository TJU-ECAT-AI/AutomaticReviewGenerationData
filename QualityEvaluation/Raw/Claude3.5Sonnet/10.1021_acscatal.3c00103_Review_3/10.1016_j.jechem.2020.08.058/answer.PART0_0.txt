[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using silanol groups created from framework dealumination as anchoring sites. This method allows for highly dispersed and homogeneous distribution of metal species like Zn and Pt on the zeolite support. 

The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions include:

1. Improved dispersion and stabilization of metal species
2. Close contact between different metal species (e.g. Pt and Zn)
3. Enhanced electronic interactions between metals and support

These factors contribute to improving the activity, selectivity and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation. The controlled anchoring enables formation of well-dispersed bimetallic species with optimized electronic properties, leading to robust catalytic performance.

羟基锚定方法通过利用骨架脱铝产生的硅醇基团作为锚定位点，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许金属物种（如锌和铂）在沸石载体上高度分散和均匀分布。

增强金属-载体相互作用的影响包括：

1. 改善金属物种的分散和稳定性
2. 不同金属物种之间（如铂和锌）的紧密接触
3. 增强金属与载体之间的电子相互作用

这些因素有助于提高固-气反应（如丙烷脱氢）中异相催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。可控锚定使得具有优化电子性质的分散良好的双金属物种得以形成，从而导致稳健的催化性能。
