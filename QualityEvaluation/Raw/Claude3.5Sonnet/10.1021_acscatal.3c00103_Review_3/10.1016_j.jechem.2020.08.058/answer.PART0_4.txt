[1] "Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using silanol groups created from framework dealumination as anchoring sites. This approach enables homogeneous dispersion of metal species like Zn and Pt on the zeolite support. The close contact and electronic interactions between the anchored metal species enhance metal-support interactions. This results in improved activity, selectivity and stability of the heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions like propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, the Pt-Zn species anchored on Si-Beta zeolite demonstrate robust catalytic performance due to their controlled dispersion and interactions enabled by this method.

羟基锚定方法通过利用骨架脱铝产生的硅羟基作为锚定位点，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法使得锌和铂等金属物种能够均匀分散在沸石载体上。锚定金属物种之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用增强了金属-载体相互作用。这导致了多相催化剂在丙烷脱氢等固-气反应中活性、选择性和稳定性的提高。具体而言，锚定在Si-Beta沸石上的Pt-Zn物种由于这种方法实现的可控分散和相互作用，表现出了强大的催化性能。
