          [1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The weak binding of intermediates offered by Cu(111) led to the selective hydrogenation of both styrene and acetylene, as demonstrated by STM and temperature programmed desorption and reaction (TPD/R) spectroscopy studied under UHV conditions."

[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."

[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."

[6] "It was determined that in the single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd coverage increases, due to surface strain."

[7] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place. In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reactants by larger Pd ensembles."

          Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation and spillover: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface. This allows the Cu surface to participate in hydrogenation reactions while maintaining its inherent selectivity.

2. Improved activity: PdCu nanoparticles show significantly higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation compared to monometallic Cu catalysts, demonstrating the synergistic effect of the SAA.

3. Enhanced selectivity: The weak binding of intermediates on the Cu surface leads to selective hydrogenation. PdCu SAA catalysts maintain high selectivity to styrene (>94%) over extended periods, even at high conversion rates.

4. Breaking scaling rules: By separating the sites for hydrogen activation (Pd) and selective hydrogenation (Cu), SAAs overcome limitations of conventional catalysts.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Precise control of atomic dispersion: Ensuring isolated Pd atoms are embedded in the Cu surface to maintain the SAA structure. The optimal Pd coverage should be below 0.1 ML to ensure single atom regime.

2. Optimized metal ratios: Using trace amounts of Pd to activate the Cu surface without compromising selectivity, while maximizing the total Cu surface area for selective reactions.

3. Controlled synthesis: Using methods like physical vapor deposition or galvanic replacement to deposit Pd exclusively on Cu surfaces.

4. Reaction conditions: Operating at conditions that maintain the SAA structure and favor the desired reaction pathway.

Advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include:

1. Higher selectivity and activity compared to monometallic catalysts.
2. Efficient use of precious metals, with only trace amounts needed to enhance performance.
3. Ability to overcome activity-selectivity trade-offs observed in conventional catalysts.
4. Potential for broader applications by extending the SAA concept to other metal combinations and reaction systems.

          单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入铜表面的钯原子通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢活化和溢出：孤立的钯原子作为氢解离和溢出到原本惰性铜表面的位点。这使得铜表面能够参与加氢反应，同时保持其固有的选择性。

2. 提高活性：PdCu纳米粒子与单金属Cu催化剂相比，对苯乙炔加氢的活性显著提高，展示了SAA的协同效应。

3. 增强选择性：Cu表面对中间体的弱结合导致选择性加氢。PdCu SAA催化剂在长时间内保持对苯乙烯的高选择性（>94%），即使在高转化率下也是如此。

4. 打破定标规则：通过分离氢活化位点（Pd）和选择性加氢位点（Cu），SAAs克服了常规催化剂的局限性。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 精确控制原子分散：确保孤立的Pd原子嵌入Cu表面以保持SAA结构。最佳Pd覆盖率应低于0.1 ML，以确保单原子状态。

2. 优化金属比例：使用微量Pd来活化Cu表面，而不影响选择性，同时最大化Cu表面面积以进行选择性反应。

3. 受控合成：使用物理气相沉积或镀层置换等方法，将Pd专门沉积在Cu表面上。

4. 反应条件：在维持SAA结构并有利于所需反应途径的条件下操作。

SAA催化剂相比传统催化剂的优势包括：

1. 与单金属催化剂相比，具有更高的选择性和活性。
2. 高效利用贵金属，只需微量即可提高性能。
3. 能够克服常规催化剂中观察到的活性-选择性权衡。
4. 通过将SAA概念扩展到其他金属组合和反应系统，具有更广泛应用的潜力。
