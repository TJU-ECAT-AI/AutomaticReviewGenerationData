[1] "To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."

          [2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."

          [3] "Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene were demonstrated successfully in order to illustrate the advantageous catalytic properties of the Pd@Cu SSA."

          [4] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."

          [5] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."

          [6] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

[1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The weak binding of intermediates offered by Cu(111) led to the selective hydrogenation of both styrene and acetylene, as demonstrated by STM and temperature programmed desorption and reaction (TPD/R) spectroscopy studied under UHV conditions."

[4] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."

[5] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."

[6] "It was determined that in the single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd coverage increases, due to surface strain."

[7] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place. In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reactants by larger Pd ensembles."

[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."

[2] "Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the more active of the two components (in our case Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at very low concentrations [0.01 monolayer (ML)] and (ii) atoms of the more active component (Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers or trimers are present at low coverage."

[3] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[4] "Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu surface. The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[5] "Inspired by this vastly different energetic landscape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption, we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations by using two probe molecules: styrene and acetylene."

[6] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

[7] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."

[8] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."

[9] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."
