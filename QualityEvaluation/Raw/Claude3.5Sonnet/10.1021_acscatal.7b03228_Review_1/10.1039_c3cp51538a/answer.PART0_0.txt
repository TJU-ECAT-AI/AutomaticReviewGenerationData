[1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."

[4] "Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shows significantly higher selectivity to styrene than either monometallic catalyst at comparative conversions."

[5] "Based on model catalyst studies, is expected to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the Cu host, where selective hydrogenation can take place."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake and dissociation, which is often the rate-limiting step in hydrogenation reactions.

2. Hydrogen spillover: The dissociated hydrogen atoms spill over onto the surrounding Cu surface, which is otherwise inert to hydrogen activation.

3. Selective hydrogenation: The Cu surface provides sites for selective hydrogenation, as it binds reactants and intermediates more weakly than Pd.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentration of active metal: Only trace amounts of Pd (e.g., 0.18 at%) are needed to activate the Cu surface.

2. Proper preparation method: Galvanic replacement can be used to add Pd atoms exclusively to the surface of Cu nanoparticles.

3. Reaction conditions: Mild conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and moderate H2 pressure) are sufficient for these catalysts to perform effectively.

4. Metal properties: The active metal (Pd) should have a low barrier for hydrogen dissociation, while the host metal (Cu) should provide selectivity through weaker binding of intermediates.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAA catalysts show higher selectivity to desired products (e.g., styrene in phenylacetylene hydrogenation) compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Efficient use of precious metals: Only trace amounts of Pd are needed to activate the Cu surface, reducing catalyst cost.

3. Breaking scaling rules: SAAs can overcome the typical trade-off between activity and selectivity observed in many catalytic systems.

4. Versatility: The SAA concept can be applied to various catalyst systems, potentially improving selectivity across a range of hydrogenation reactions.

单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢活化：孤立的Pd原子作为氢气吸收和解离的位点，这通常是加氢反应的限速步骤。

2. 氢溢出：解离的氢原子溢出到周围的Cu表面，而Cu表面本身对氢活化是惰性的。

3. 选择性加氢：Cu表面提供了选择性加氢的位点，因为它与反应物和中间体的结合比Pd更弱。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 活性金属的低浓度：只需少量的Pd（如0.18原子%）就能活化Cu表面。

2. 适当的制备方法：可以使用置换反应将Pd原子专门添加到Cu纳米颗粒的表面。

3. 反应条件：这些催化剂在温和条件下（如环境温度和适中的H2压力）就能有效工作。

4. 金属性质：活性金属（Pd）应具有较低的氢解离能垒，而宿主金属（Cu）应通过与中间体较弱的结合提供选择性。

相比传统催化剂的优势：

1. 提高选择性：SAA催化剂与单金属催化剂相比，对目标产物（如苯乙炔加氢中的苯乙烯）表现出更高的选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用：只需少量的Pd就能活化Cu表面，降低了催化剂成本。

3. 打破定标规则：SAAs可以克服许多催化系统中常见的活性和选择性之间的权衡。

4. 通用性：SAA概念可应用于各种催化剂系统，有潜力提高各种加氢反应的选择性。
