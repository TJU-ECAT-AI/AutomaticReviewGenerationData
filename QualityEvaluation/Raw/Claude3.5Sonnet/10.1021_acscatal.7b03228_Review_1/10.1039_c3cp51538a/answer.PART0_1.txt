[1] "We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions. PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."

[2] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."

[3] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[4] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."

[5] "Based on a combination of surface science studies and heterogeneous catalyst performance measured at near ambient conditions, we propose that the high selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing isolated sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. This allows for increased activity compared to monometallic Cu catalysts while maintaining high selectivity.

The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentrations of the active metal (Pd) on the host metal (Cu) surface
2. A method to exchange host metal atoms with active metal atoms (e.g., galvanic replacement)
3. Reaction conditions that allow for hydrogen spillover (e.g., near ambient conditions)

The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include:

1. Higher activity than monometallic host metal catalysts
2. Improved selectivity compared to monometallic active metal catalysts
3. Ability to maintain high selectivity over extended periods at high conversion

SAA catalysts can potentially break scaling rules by separating the sites for hydrogen activation (Pd atoms) from the sites for selective hydrogenation (Cu surface). This approach can be applied to various catalyst systems by carefully selecting appropriate metal combinations and synthesis methods to create isolated active sites on otherwise inert surfaces.

单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入铜表面的钯原子通过提供孤立的氢气吸收、解离和溢出到周围铜表面的位点，增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能。这使得催化剂的活性比单金属铜催化剂高，同时保持了高选择性。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 活性金属（钯）在主体金属（铜）表面上的低浓度
2. 用于交换主体金属原子与活性金属原子的方法（例如，电镀置换）
3. 允许氢气溢出的反应条件（例如，接近环境条件）

SAA催化剂相对于传统催化剂的具体优势包括：

1. 比单金属主体金属催化剂具有更高的活性
2. 比单金属活性金属催化剂具有更好的选择性
3. 能够在高转化率下长时间保持高选择性

SAA催化剂可能通过将氢活化位点（钯原子）与选择性加氢位点（铜表面）分离来打破定标规则。这种方法可以通过仔细选择适当的金属组合和合成方法，在其他惰性表面上创建孤立的活性位点，从而应用于各种催化剂系统。
