[1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The strategy for translating the architecture of this model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms are exchanged with Pd atoms."

[4] "Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shows significantly higher selectivity to styrene than either monometallic catalyst at comparative conversions."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake and dissociation, which is often the rate-limiting step in hydrogenation reactions.

2. Hydrogen spillover: The dissociated hydrogen atoms spill over onto the surrounding Cu surface, which is otherwise inert to hydrogen activation.

3. Selective hydrogenation: The Cu surface provides sites for selective hydrogenation, as it binds reactants and intermediates more weakly than Pd.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentration of active metal: Only trace amounts of Pd (e.g., 0.18 at%) are needed to activate the Cu surface.

2. Proper preparation method: Galvanic replacement can be used to add Pd atoms exclusively to the surface of Cu nanoparticles.

3. Reaction conditions: Mild conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and moderate H2 pressure) are sufficient for these catalysts to perform effectively.

4. Metal properties: The active metal (Pd) should have a low barrier for hydrogen dissociation, while the host metal (Cu) should provide selectivity through weaker binding of intermediates.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAA catalysts show higher selectivity to desired products (e.g., styrene in phenylacetylene hydrogenation) compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Efficient use of precious metals: Only trace amounts of Pd are needed to activate the Cu surface, reducing catalyst cost.

3. Breaking scaling rules: SAAs can overcome the typical trade-off between activity and selectivity observed in many catalytic systems.

4. Versatility: The SAA concept can be applied to various catalyst systems, potentially improving selectivity across a range of hydrogenation reactions.

单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢活化：孤立的Pd原子作为氢气吸收和解离的位点，这通常是加氢反应的限速步骤。

2. 氢溢出：解离的氢原子溢出到周围的Cu表面，而Cu表面本身对氢活化是惰性的。

3. 选择性加氢：Cu表面提供了选择性加氢的位点，因为它与反应物和中间体的结合比Pd更弱。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 活性金属的低浓度：只需少量的Pd（如0.18原子%）就能活化Cu表面。

2. 适当的制备方法：可以使用置换反应将Pd原子专门添加到Cu纳米颗粒的表面。

3. 反应条件：这些催化剂在温和条件下（如环境温度和适中的H2压力）就能有效工作。

4. 金属性质：活性金属（Pd）应具有较低的氢解离能垒，而宿主金属（Cu）应通过与中间体较弱的结合提供选择性。

相比传统催化剂的优势：

1. 提高选择性：SAA催化剂与单金属催化剂相比，对目标产物（如苯乙炔加氢中的苯乙烯）表现出更高的选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用：只需少量的Pd就能活化Cu表面，降低了催化剂成本。

3. 打破定标规则：SAAs可以克服许多催化系统中常见的活性和选择性之间的权衡。

4. 通用性：SAA概念可应用于各种催化剂系统，有潜力提高各种加氢反应的选择性。

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing isolated sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. This allows for increased activity compared to monometallic Cu catalysts while maintaining high selectivity.

The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentrations of the active metal (Pd) on the host metal (Cu) surface
2. A method to exchange host metal atoms with active metal atoms (e.g., galvanic replacement)
3. Reaction conditions that allow for hydrogen spillover (e.g., near ambient conditions)

The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include:

1. Higher activity than monometallic host metal catalysts
2. Improved selectivity compared to monometallic active metal catalysts
3. Ability to maintain high selectivity over extended periods at high conversion

SAA catalysts can potentially break scaling rules by separating the sites for hydrogen activation (Pd atoms) from the sites for selective hydrogenation (Cu surface). This approach can be applied to various catalyst systems by carefully selecting appropriate metal combinations and synthesis methods to create isolated active sites on otherwise inert surfaces.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation and spillover: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface. This allows the Cu surface to participate in hydrogenation reactions while maintaining its inherent selectivity.

[2] "It was determined that in the single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd coverage increases, due to surface strain."

[3] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place. In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reactants by larger Pd ensembles."
