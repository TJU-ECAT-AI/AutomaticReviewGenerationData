[1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The weak binding of intermediates offered by Cu(111) led to the selective hydrogenation of both styrene and acetylene, as demonstrated by STM and temperature programmed desorption and reaction (TPD/R) spectroscopy studied under UHV conditions."

[4] "Nanoparticle catalysts were prepared by depositing small amounts of Pd exclusively onto the surface of pre-formed Cu nanoparticles by the galvanic replacement (GR) reaction."

[5] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."

[6] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake and dissociation on the otherwise inert Cu surface.

2. Hydrogen spillover: The dissociated hydrogen atoms can spill over from Pd sites onto the surrounding Cu surface.

3. Selective hydrogenation: The Cu surface provides weak binding of intermediates, leading to selective hydrogenation of target molecules.

4. Improved activity: PdCu SAA catalysts show significantly higher activity compared to monometallic Cu catalysts.

5. Enhanced selectivity: SAA catalysts maintain high selectivity to desired products (e.g., styrene) over extended periods and at high conversions.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Careful control of active metal (Pd) concentration to ensure isolated atom dispersion.

2. Selection of an appropriate host metal (Cu) that is relatively inert but can facilitate spillover.

3. Suitable preparation methods (e.g., galvanic replacement) to achieve selective deposition of the active metal.

4. Reaction conditions that capitalize on the unique properties of SAAs (e.g., ambient temperature, moderate pressures).

SAA catalysts offer advantages over traditional catalysts by:

1. Breaking scaling relationships between activity and selectivity.
2. Achieving high selectivity with minimal use of precious metals.
3. Enabling tunable catalytic properties through precise control of active site structure.

These benefits make SAA catalysts promising for various selective hydrogenation reactions across different catalyst systems.

单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入铜表面的钯原子通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢气活化：孤立的钯原子作为氢气吸附和解离的位点，在原本惰性的铜表面上发挥作用。

2. 氢原子溢出：解离的氢原子可以从钯位点溢出到周围的铜表面上。

3. 选择性加氢：铜表面对中间体的弱结合作用，导致目标分子的选择性加氢。

4. 提高活性：PdCu SAA催化剂与单金属铜催化剂相比，显示出显著更高的活性。

5. 增强选择性：SAA催化剂在长时间和高转化率下保持对目标产物（如苯乙烯）的高选择性。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 精确控制活性金属（钯）浓度，以确保原子分散为孤立状态。

2. 选择合适的宿主金属（铜），该金属相对惰性但可以促进氢原子溢出。

3. 采用适当的制备方法（如镀层置换法）来实现活性金属的选择性沉积。

4. 选择能够充分发挥SAAs独特性质的反应条件（如室温、中等压力）。

SAA催化剂相比传统催化剂具有以下优势：

1. 打破活性和选择性之间的线性关系。
2. 使用极少量的贵金属即可实现高选择性。
3. 通过精确控制活性位点结构，实现可调的催化性能。

这些优势使SAA催化剂在各种催化体系的选择性加氢反应中展现出广阔的应用前景。
