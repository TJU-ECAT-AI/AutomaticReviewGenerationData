[1] "We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111) surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by physical vapor deposition."

[2] "Individual, isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface."

[3] "The weak binding of intermediates offered by Cu(111) led to the selective hydrogenation of both styrene and acetylene, as demonstrated by STM and temperature programmed desorption and reaction (TPD/R) spectroscopy studied under UHV conditions."

[4] "Here, we report for the first time the application of the SAA strategy to preparing heterogeneous PdCu alloy nanoparticles for selective hydrogenation catalysis."

[5] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."

[6] "Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation and spillover: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise inert Cu surface. This allows the Cu surface to participate in hydrogenation reactions while maintaining its inherent selectivity.

2. Improved activity: PdCu nanoparticles show significantly higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation compared to monometallic Cu catalysts, demonstrating the synergistic effect of the SAA.

3. Enhanced selectivity: The weak binding of intermediates on the Cu surface leads to selective hydrogenation. PdCu SAA catalysts maintain high selectivity to styrene (>94%) over extended periods, even at high conversion rates.

4. Bridging the activity-selectivity gap: SAAs combine the high activity of Pd for hydrogen activation with the selectivity of Cu, overcoming limitations of traditional monometallic catalysts.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Precise control of atomic dispersion: Ensuring isolated Pd atoms are embedded in the Cu surface to maintain the SAA structure.

2. Optimized metal ratios: Using trace amounts of Pd (e.g., 0.18 at%) to activate the Cu surface without compromising selectivity.

3. Appropriate reaction conditions: Considering temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations that favor the desired reaction pathway.

4. Suitable support materials: Selecting supports that stabilize the SAA structure and enhance catalytic performance.

SAA catalysts offer specific advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Breaking scaling rules: By separating the sites for hydrogen activation (Pd) and selective hydrogenation (Cu), SAAs overcome limitations of conventional catalysts.

2. Improved atom efficiency: Using trace amounts of precious metals (e.g., Pd) to activate larger quantities of more abundant metals (e.g., Cu).

3. Tunable selectivity: The ability to fine-tune catalyst performance by adjusting the ratio and distribution of active sites.

4. Potential for broader applications: The SAA concept can be extended to other metal combinations and reaction systems, offering a versatile approach to catalyst design for various selective transformations.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下几种机制提高了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢活化和溢出：孤立的Pd原子作为氢解离和溢出到原本惰性Cu表面的位点。这使得Cu表面能够参与加氢反应，同时保持其固有的选择性。

2. 提高活性：PdCu纳米粒子与单金属Cu催化剂相比，对苯乙炔加氢的活性显著提高，展示了SAA的协同效应。

3. 增强选择性：Cu表面对中间体的弱结合导致选择性加氢。PdCu SAA催化剂在长时间内保持对苯乙烯的高选择性（>94%），即使在高转化率下也是如此。

4. 弥合活性-选择性差距：SAAs结合了Pd对氢活化的高活性和Cu的选择性，克服了传统单金属催化剂的局限性。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 精确控制原子分散：确保孤立的Pd原子嵌入Cu表面以保持SAA结构。

2. 优化金属比例：使用微量Pd（如0.18 at%）来活化Cu表面，而不影响选择性。

3. 适当的反应条件：考虑有利于所需反应途径的温度、压力和反应物浓度。

4. 合适的载体材料：选择能稳定SAA结构并增强催化性能的载体。

SAA催化剂相比传统催化剂具有以下特定优势：

1. 打破定标规则：通过分离氢活化位点（Pd）和选择性加氢位点（Cu），SAAs克服了常规催化剂的局限性。

2. 提高原子效率：使用微量贵金属（如Pd）来活化更大量的丰产金属（如Cu）。

3. 可调选择性：通过调整活性位点的比例和分布，能够微调催化剂性能。

4. 更广泛应用的潜力：SAA概念可以扩展到其他金属组合和反应系统，为各种选择性转化提供了一种多功能的催化剂设计方法。
