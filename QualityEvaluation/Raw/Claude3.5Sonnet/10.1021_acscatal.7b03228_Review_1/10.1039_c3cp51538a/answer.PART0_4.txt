[1] "We have previously shown that the Cu(111) surface is inactive towards hydrogen dissociation and uptake, and that small amounts of Pd alloy into the surface layer of Cu(111) as individual, isolated atoms that can act as entry and exit sites for hydrogen dissociation and recombination, respectively."

[2] "It was determined that in the single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd coverage increases, due to surface strain."

[3] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place. In addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reactants by larger Pd ensembles."

[4] "Fig. 7 demonstrates that Pd0.18/Al2O3 catalyst has very poor selectivity to styrene as the product distribution consists completely of ethyl benzene when the reaction reaches 100% conversion. However, Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 has a styrene selectivity of approximately 94% when the reaction reaches 90% conversion"

[5] "Based on a combination of surface science studies and heterogeneous catalyst performance measured at near ambient conditions, we propose that the high selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) of Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Hydrogen activation: Isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen dissociation and recombination on the otherwise inactive Cu surface.

2. Hydrogen spillover: Dissociated hydrogen atoms can spill over from Pd sites onto the surrounding Cu surface, enabling selective hydrogenation reactions.

3. Improved selectivity: The Cu surface provides weak binding of intermediates, leading to higher selectivity compared to pure Pd catalysts.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low Pd coverage: Maintaining Pd coverage below 0.1 ML ensures isolated Pd atoms and prevents formation of larger Pd ensembles.

2. Optimized active metal loading: Balancing Pd content for hydrogen activation while maximizing Cu surface area for selective reactions.

3. Controlled synthesis: Using methods like galvanic replacement to deposit Pd exclusively on Cu nanoparticle surfaces.

4. Mild reaction conditions: Operating at near-ambient temperatures and pressures to maintain SAA structure.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Higher selectivity: SAAs can achieve significantly higher product selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Improved activity: SAAs activate otherwise inert surfaces (e.g., Cu) for hydrogenation reactions.

3. Reduced precious metal usage: Only trace amounts of Pd are needed to enhance catalytic performance.

4. Breaking scaling relationships: SAAs can potentially overcome limitations in activity-selectivity trade-offs observed in conventional catalysts.

单原子合金（SAAs）中嵌入铜表面的钯原子通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 氢气活化：孤立的钯原子作为在其他惰性铜表面上氢气解离和重组的位点。

2. 氢溢流：解离的氢原子可以从钯位点溢出到周围的铜表面，从而实现选择性加氢反应。

3. 提高选择性：铜表面对中间体的结合较弱，与纯钯催化剂相比，可以获得更高的选择性。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 低钯覆盖率：保持钯覆盖率低于0.1 ML，确保钯原子是孤立的，防止形成更大的钯集合体。

2. 优化活性金属负载：平衡钯含量以实现氢气活化，同时最大化铜表面面积以进行选择性反应。

3. 受控合成：使用诸如置换反应等方法，将钯专门沉积在铜纳米颗粒表面上。

4. 温和反应条件：在接近环境温度和压力下操作，以维持SAA结构。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 更高的选择性：与单金属催化剂相比，SAAs可以实现显著更高的产品选择性。

2. 提高活性：SAAs可以激活原本惰性的表面（如铜）进行加氢反应。

3. 减少贵金属用量：只需微量的钯就能提高催化性能。

4. 打破定标关系：SAAs有可能克服传统催化剂中观察到的活性-选择性权衡限制。
