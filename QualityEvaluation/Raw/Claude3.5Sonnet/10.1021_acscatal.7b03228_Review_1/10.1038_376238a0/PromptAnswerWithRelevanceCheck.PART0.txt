Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about single-atom alloys (SAAs), Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, or selective hydrogenation reactions. The text focuses on the nobility of gold and its reactivity compared to other metals like copper, nickel, and platinum. It does not discuss the design criteria for SAA catalysts, reaction conditions, or advantages over traditional catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献没有包含关于单原子合金（SAAs）、嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子或选择性加氢反应的任何信息。该文本主要关注金的高贵性及其与其他金属如铜、镍和铂相比的反应性。它没有讨论SAA催化剂的设计标准、反应条件或相对于传统催化剂的优势。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
