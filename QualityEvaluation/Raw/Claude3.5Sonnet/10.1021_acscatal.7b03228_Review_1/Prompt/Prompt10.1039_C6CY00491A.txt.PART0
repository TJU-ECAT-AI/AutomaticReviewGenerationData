selective ethane dehydrogenation catalysts

Silica supported Pd and PdIn catalysts with different In : Pd atomic ratios and similar particle size (2 nm)
were tested for ethane dehydrogenation at 600 C. For a monometallic Pd catalyst, at 15% conversion, the
dehydrogenation selectivity and initial turnover rate (TOR, per surface Pd site) were 53% and 0.03 s1, re-
spectively. Addition of In to Pd increased the dehydrogenation selectivity to near 100% and the initial
TOR to 0.26 s1. Carbon monoxide IR, in situ synchrotron XAS and XRD analysis showed that for PdIn cat-
alysts with increasing In loading, different bimetallic structures were formed: at low In loading a fraction of
the nanoparticle surface was transformed into PdIn intermetallic compound (IMC, also known as interme-
tallic alloy) with a cubic CsCl structure; at higher In loading, a Pd-core/PdIn-shell structure was formed
and at high In loading the nanoparticles were pure PdIn IMC. While a Pd metal surface binds CO predomi-
nantly in a bridge fashion, the PdIn IMC predominantly binds CO linearly. Formation of the PdIn IMC struc-
ture on the catalyst surface geometrically isolates the Pd catalytic sites by non-catalytic, metallic In neigh-
bors, which is suggested to be responsible for the high olefin selectivity. Concomitant electronic effect due
to PdIn bond formation likely leads to the increase in TOR. Though multiple IMC structures with different
atomic ratios are possible for the PdIn binary system, only a cubic PdIn IMC with CsCl structure was ob-
served, implying a kinetically controlled solid state IMC formation mechanism.
1 Introduction
The past decades have witnessed a steady growth in the de-
mand of light olefins, one of the most important chemical
building
blocks.
Conventional
light
olefin
production
methods include steam cracking and fluidized catalytic crack-
ing (FCC). The recent shale gas boom and corresponding de-
crease in light alkane prices make on-purpose olefin produc-
tion
via
catalytic
light
alkane
dehydrogenation
(LAD)
economically competitive.1 Today, several new LAD installa-
tions are being built or planned.2
Selectivity control is critical for catalytic light alkane dehy-
drogenation.3 Under typical reaction condition, noble metal
catalysts produce methane in high yield and concomitant
production of coke leads to rapid deactivation. Pt is the only
noble metal used for LAD catalysts due to its intrinsic selec-
tivity favoring CH bond activation over CC bond activa-
tion.2 Commercially supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are
used, in which the promoter Sn reduces side reactions and
coke formation.25
It is believed that Sn
modifies the
electronic structure of Pt by transferring electrons to its va-
lence band. Dissociative adsorption of alkanes is suppressed
and olefin desorption is enhanced, leading to less hydro-
genolysis and coking.4,69 A geometric effect for Sn promo-
tion has also been proposed wherein Sn reduces the Pt en-
semble size by alloying with Pt or covering Pt sites with low
coordination.3,10 However, the exact structure of the modified
surface sites has seldom been investigated in very small
nanoparticles characteristic of commercial catalysts.
Recently, a selective propane dehydrogenation catalyst
comprised of a Pd containing intermetallic compound (IMC)
was reported.11,12 Monometallic Pd was poorly selective
(<10%) to propylene; however, when Zn was added, the dehy-
drogenation selectivity increased to greater than 98%. The
pronounced selectivity change was attributed to formation of
a β1-PdZn IMC (tetragonal, CuTi type structure) on the cata-
lyst surface. In this crystal structure, all of the first nearest
neighbors of Pd were Zn. No PdPd surface ensemble sites

remained, which effectively turned off the structure-sensitive
pathway for hydrogenolysis. This work suggested that specific
intermetallic compound structure could play a crucial role in
determining the selectivity of LAD catalysts. Although mono-
metallic Pd catalysts are typically non-selective for LAD, cer-
tain Pd IMC structures may be selective catalysts.
Indium has also been reported as a promoter for Pt based
bimetallic light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.1315 How-
ever, the exact structure of the bimetallic particles and their
influence on catalyst function have not been studied. Studies
on PdZn propane dehydrogenation catalysts suggest that
intermetallic compound structures may also play an impor-
tant role in these In promoted LAD catalysts.11,12 In and Pd
can form 6 PdIn IMC phases with different stoichiometries
at 600 C (Fig. 1).16 The ordered arrays of two different atom
types over specific crystallographic sites characteristic of
IMCs give rise to Pd active sites with specific geometric coor-
dination, which is in contrast to alloys where the metal
atoms randomly substitute in solid solutions.17 IMCs formed
by In with Pd and other noble metals have recently been
reported to exhibit improved catalytic properties in methanol
steam reforming and amination of alcohols.1820
Determining the crystal structure of supported catalyst
nanoparticles is, however, challenging. The small particle size
(<3 nm), low metal loading (<5 wt%) and large background
from typical amorphous catalyst supports (SiO2 and γ-Al2O3)
usually make detection of nanoparticle structure using labo-
ratory XRD instruments very difficult. Gallagher et al. recently
showed that resolving the broadened diffraction peaks of 2
nm monometallic Pt nanoparticles required in situ measure-
ments under H2 flow and a high signal-to-noise ratio only ob-
tainable from synchrotron radiation.27 For bimetallic parti-
cles,
the
problem
is
further
complicated
since
several
structures may be present,12,28 resulting in overlapping of
multiple broad diffraction peaks. In addition, the diffraction
peaks of some IMCs show up at 2θ values very close to those
of the parent metals or the other IMCs, for which high spatial
resolution of diffraction peaks is required.
Here, we report on the synthesis, testing and characteriza-
tion of silica supported Pd and PdIn nanoparticle catalysts
with different In : Pd ratios and similar particle size of about
2 nm. The catalysts were characterized by scanning transmis-
sion electron microscopy (STEM), infrared spectroscopy of
adsorbed CO (CO IR), in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (in situ XAS) and in situ synchrotron X-ray dif-
fraction (in situ XRD). The ethane dehydrogenation reaction
was used to evaluate the influence of In on the catalysts' per-
formance. Detailed crystal structure and particle geometry
were determined for the nanoparticles with mixed metal and
intermetallic compound phases. Their relation with catalyst
function is further discussed, suggesting the role of In as
both a geometric and an electronic promoter.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
A monometallic Pd catalyst (2 wt% Pd supported on Davisil
636 silica gel from Sigma-Aldrich, 480 m2 g1 and 0.75 mL
g1 pore volume) was synthesized using the incipient wetness
impregnation (IWI) method. 2.81 g of 10% PdNH3)4(NO3)2
solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 1.5 mL of H2O.
30% ammonium hydroxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was then
added to the solution until the pH reached 11. The obtained
Pd precursor was added dropwise to 5 g of silica and stirred.
After drying overnight at 125 C, the sample was calcined at
500 C for 3 h and reduced at 200 C in 5% H2/N2 at 100 cm3
min1 for 30 minutes.
A series of PdIn bimetallic catalysts with target Pd load-
ing of 2 wt% and In loading of 1, 3, 6 wt% were synthesized
by sequential incipient wetness impregnation (s-IWI) under
controlled pH conditions. Various amounts of InNO3)2 hy-
drate (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in about 8 mL of H2O.
Citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to this solution with a
molar ratio of 1 : 3 to the In in the solution. About 5 mL of
30% ammonium hydroxide solution was then added to this
solution to initially form a white precipitate which dissolved
later when additional ammonium hydroxide solution was
added. The obtained solution at pH = 11 was added dropwise
to 15 g of silica and stirred. The obtained In/SiO2 catalyst pre-
cursors were dried overnight at 125 C and then calcined at
600 C for 3 h. 3.37 g of 10% Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution were
dissolved in ammonia and then added dropwise to 6 g of the
obtained In/SiO2. This catalyst was then dried overnight at
125 C, calcined at 200 C for 3 h, reduced at 200 C in 5%
H2/N2 at 100 cm3 min1 for 30 min, and then reduced at 600
C in 5% H2/N2 at 100 cm3 min1 for 30 minutes. These sam-
ples are named after the atomic ratio of In : Pd determined by
atomic absorption spectroscopy (Table 1).

2.2 Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
The elemental loadings of Pd and In in the catalyst samples
were measured using a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 300 atomic ab-
sorption spectrometer. Approximately 40 mg of each sample
were dissolved in 2 ml HF (48 wt%, Macron chemicals) over-
night followed by the addition of about 50 ml D.I. water to di-
lute the concentrated acid solution. AAS standards for Pd and
In (Fluka) were diluted to within the linear detection range
and used for calibrating the instrument. Weight percentages
of Pd and In were calculated from the average absorbance
value of two repeat measurements and the atomic ratios of
Pd
to
In
were
calculated
from
the
obtained
weight
percentage.
2.3 Scanning transmission electron microscopy
The STEM images were taken at Birck Nanotechnology Center
at Purdue University using the FEI Titan Scanning Transmis-
sion Electron Microscope (80300 kV, 1 nm spatial resolution
in STEM). Samples were ground to fine powders and dis-
persed in isopropyl alcohol. Three drops of the solution were
added onto an ultrathin carbon film-Au TEM ready grid
(TedPella) and dried on a hot plate at 80 C. STEM images
were taken using the high angle annular dark field (HAADF)
detector at 300 kV and particle size was counted using the
ImageJ program.29 A minimum of 200 particles were counted
to obtain the size distribution for each catalyst.
2.4 CO chemisorption
The CO chemisorption measurements on PdIn catalysts
were conducted using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 chemisorp-
tion instrument. Around 0.1 g of each catalyst was loaded
into a U-shaped quartz reactor tube. The catalysts were re-
duced in 50 cm3 min1 of 5% H2/He at 600 C for 0.5 h and
cooled to RT under the same atmosphere. The sample was
then flushed for 30 minutes in He before evacuation and
measurements. Difference analysis of the chemisorption
curve was used to obtain the catalyst dispersion. A stoichiom-
etry of CO : Pd = 1 : 1 was assumed in order to estimate the
lower bound of dispersion value for PdIn catalysts.
2.5 Ethane dehydrogenation kinetics
Ethane dehydrogenation kinetics measurements were carried
out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 3/8-inch ID. The weight
of the catalysts used ranged from 0.2 g to 0.65 g. A thermo-
couple within a quartz thermocouple well was placed at the
bottom center of the catalyst bed to measure the reaction
temperature inside the bed. The products were analyzed with
Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Before each test,
the catalyst was first reduced under 40 cm3 min1 5% H2/N2
while the temperature was raised to 600 C and held at 600
C for 30 minutes. For selectivity comparison at 15% conver-
sion at 600 C, a reaction atmosphere of 5% C2H6, 6% H2 bal-
anced in N2 with a total flow rate of 50 cm3 min1 was used.
When measuring the dehydrogenation turnover rate (TOR,
per surface Pd site) at 600 C and the activation energy, the
reaction mixture was 5% C2H6, 2% H2, 0.5% C2H4, 43.2% He,
and balance N2 at a total flow rate of 150 cm3 min1. Co-
feeding both hydrogen and ethylene helped make sure that
the reactor was operated under differential condition, which
was typically not considered in previous works on light al-
kane dehydrogenation kinetics.2,3,14 Approach to equilibrium
was also considered for the calculation of TOR following the
work of Koryabkina et al.30 The rate expression is as below,
where kf is the forward rate constant, K is the equilibrium
constant and β is the approach to equilibrium index. The
value of β was found to be always smaller than 0.17, indicat-
ing the reaction was run far from equilibrium. Apparent acti-
vation energy was measured at 4 different temperatures be-
tween 570 and 600
C after the
catalyst stabilized at
conversions below 10%.

spectrometer equipped with a HgCdTe (MCT, cooled to

Catalysts were diluted with SiO2 (Davisil 636 silica gel from
Sigma-Aldrich, 480 m2 g1 and 0.75 mL g1 pore volume) with
a catalyst to silica mass ratio of 1 : 3. The diluted samples
were ground to a fine powder and pressed to form a self-
supporting wafer (0.02 g cm2). The wafer was sealed in a
specially designed quartz cell with CaF2 windows. Two K-type
thermocouples (Omega) were placed 2 mm from the wafer on
each side to measure wafer temperatures. The cell was
surrounded by a mineral-insulated resistive heating coil (ARi
Industries), and both the cell and coil were encased in an

alumina silicate ceramic chamber (Purdue Research Machin-
ing Services). A custom glass manifold was connected to the
cell to control the gas for pretreatment and the amount of
CO introduced. The cell was first purged with He, and then
the sample was reduced with 10% H2 in balance He while
the temperature was increased to 600 C and held for 30 mi-
nutes. After reduction, the wafer was cooled to 30 C in the
same gas environment. The wafer was then exposed to dy-
namic vacuum (Alcatel 2008A rotary vane rough pump, <0.1
Torr) for 15 minutes at 30 C, and a background scan was
recorded, which was averaged over 64 scans with 2 cm1 reso-
lution. The sample was then exposed to 20 kPa CO in sequen-
tial doses over 30 minutes followed by dynamic vacuum
for 30 minutes to remove gas-phase and weakly adsorbed
CO before final IR scan was collected.
2.7 In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements at the Pd K (24
350 eV) edge and In K edge (27 940 eV) were made on the 10-
BM bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Col-
laborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon
Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Measurements
were taken in transmission mode. A palladium foil spectrum
was acquired through a third ion chamber simultaneously
with each measurement for energy calibration. Samples were
prepared by grinding the catalysts into fine powders and
pressing them into a cylindrical sample holder to form a self-
supported wafer. Before the XAS spectra were obtained, the
catalysts were reduced at 600 C in a 4% H2/He mixture at 50
cm3 min1 flow rate. After reduction, the samples were
purged with He at 100 cm3 min1 and cooled to room temper-
ature. Trace oxidants in He were removed by passing through
a Matheson PUR-Gas Triple Purifier Cartridge containing a
Cu trap. All spectra were obtained at room temperature in
He.
WINXAS 3.1 software31 was used to fit the XAS data. The
EXAFS coordination parameters were obtained by a least-
squares fit in R-space of the k2-weighted Fourier transform
data from Δk = 3.0 to 12.0 Å1. The first shell fit of the magni-
tude and imaginary parts were performed between ΔR = 1.6
to 2.9 Å for the Pd edge. At the In edge, the first shell fit was
performed from ΔR = 1.8 to 2.8 Å. An average coordination
number and bond distance were determined for PdPd and
PdIn scattering at Pd edge and InPd scattering at In edge
by fitting with the experimental phase shift and back scatter-
ing amplitude of PdPd scattering extracted from Pd foil XAS
data (12 PdPd at 2.75 Å). Such treatment was rationalized
based on the small difference in phase shift and amplitude
between PdPd and PdIn scattering due to the close atomic
number of Pd and In. While fitting the data with both PdPd
and PdIn scattering path was possible, the similarity be-
tween these two paths results in varied fitting parameters giv-
ing similar fits. Fits were performed by refinement of the co-
ordination number (CN), bond distance (R), and energy
shift (E0). The Δσ2 value was kept constant for all of the sam-
ples through all fits, and CN and R were allowed to vary in
turn to determine the correct fit.
2.8 In situ X-ray diffraction
In situ XRD measurements were performed at the 11-ID-C
beamline at the APS, Argonne National Laboratory. Data was
acquired in transmission mode using X-rays at 105.091 keV
(λ = 0.11798 Å) and a PerkinElmer large area detector. Sam-
ples were pressed into a thin pellet and loaded into a Linkam
Thermal Stage which allowed reactant gas flow during the in
situ XRD measurements. The reactor was first purged with Ar
for 5 minutes before a flow of 3% H2/Ar at 50 cm3 min1 was
introduced and the temperature was ramped to 600 C. After
reducing at 600 C for 20 minutes, diffraction patterns were
taken for all the samples. Then the reactor was cooled to
room temperature in the same atmosphere and diffraction
patterns were taken again for all the samples now without
thermal-induced lattice distortion and strain. The bare SiO2
support, in addition to the empty cell, were treated with the
same procedure and corresponding reference measurements
were taken at the same conditions. The 2-D diffraction pat-
terns were integrated and converted to the conventional 1-D
diffraction data using the Fit2D software32 to obtain plots of
intensity versus 2θ. The diffraction patterns of possible PdIn
alloy phases were simulated based on the known structures2226
by MAUD (Materials Analysis Using Diffraction)33 and used as
standards to determine the phase obtained.
3 Results
3.1 Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
The Pd and PdIn catalysts were prepared by impregnation
and pre-reduced at 600 C before catalyst testing and charac-
terization. It was found that initial reduction of PdIn cata-
lysts at 600 C deposited a yellow solid film on the wall of
the reactor tube outlet. This yellow color was almost identical
to the color of calcined In-impregnated SiO2 prepared in the
first step of the synthesis and is typical of In2O3, suggesting
that the deposits correspond to some lost In. The elemental load-
ings for PdIn catalysts were measured by AAS. Table 1 shows
the obtained Pd and In contents and the In : Pd ratio in each
catalyst. The Pd content for all PdIn catalysts was close to
the target weight loading. The In content, however, was about
half of the target loading, confirming partial In loss. After the
initial reduction of the catalyst precursor during preparation,
subsequent reduction pretreatments of PdIn catalysts did
not lead to significant additional loss of In.
3.2 Particle size and catalyst dispersion
Metal nanoparticle sizes of Pd and PdIn catalysts were deter-
mined by STEM imaging. Images were taken for all four cata-
lysts after pre-reduction in H2 at 600 C and exposure to air.
The image of PdIn-0.8 catalyst and corresponding size distri-
bution statistics are shown in Fig. 2 and are typical of the
other samples. The average particle size of this sample was

determined to be 1.8 nm with a standard deviation of 0.4
nm. Obtained average particle sizes for the other samples are
reported in Table 1. Except for PdIn-2.0, all the catalysts
have roughly the same particle size of about 2 nm. PdIn-2.0
has slightly larger particles of 2.7 nm. The similar particle
sizes of these catalysts enable comparison between their ki-
netics and surface structure without having to account for
the changes in particle size.
The Pd dispersions of the catalysts were determined from
CO chemisorption analysis or STEM particle size. For the
monometallic Pd catalyst, the dispersion was estimated to be
47% using the average particle size. For PdIn catalysts, the
lower boundary values of dispersion were calculated from the
CO uptake in CO chemisorption analysis assuming a stoichi-
ometry of CO : Pd = 1 : 1. The IR spectra discussed below show
a high fraction of linearly bound CO; thus this assumption is
a reasonable estimate. The dispersion values were found to
be 14% for PdIn-0.2 and 12% for PdIn-0.8 catalysts, lower
than that of the Pd catalyst with similar particle size,
suggesting possible covering of the surface by some In spe-
cies. The dispersion of the PdIn-2.0 catalyst was even lower
(2%) and much smaller than one would expect for a catalyst
with 2.7 nm nanoparticles. Surface coverage by a species
which does not chemisorb CO is likely for this sample.
3.3 Ethane dehydrogenation kinetics
The catalytic performance of Pd and PdIn catalysts were de-
termined for ethane dehydrogenation at 600 C. At this tem-
perature, methane was the only side product (due to ethane
hydrogenolysis). Calcined In impregnated silica showed neg-
ligible catalytic activity. The conversion in all tests are below
10% and far from equilibrium as confirmed by the approach
to equilibrium index β. The TORs were tested at 600 C,
corrected by approach to equilibrium index β and normalized
by the amount of surface Pd obtained from chemisorption
(Table 1). Apparent activation energy Ea was measured at 4
different temperature between 570 and 600 C after catalysts
stabilization. The results for the Pd and PdIn catalysts are
shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. The product distribution was
calculated for each catalyst at 15% ethane dehydrogenation
conversion. While the Pd catalyst had an ethylene selectivity
of 53% typical of noble metal nanoparticles, the PdIn cata-
lysts showed much higher selectivity. PdIn-0.2 was 98% se-
lective to ethylene and PdIn-0.8 was near 100%. PdIn-2.0
had a stabilized selectivity of 99%.
The TORs (low concentrations of H2 and ethylene prod-
ucts were co-fed with the ethane) were measured under dif-
ferential conditions (Table 2 and Fig. 3b). Normalizing the
moles of ethane converted per second to the moles of surface
Pd atoms (using the dispersion value in Table 1), the
initial TORs were determined for each catalyst and were 0.03
s1, 0.09 s1, 0.26 s1 and 0.21 s1 for Pd, PdIn-0.2, PdIn-0.8
and PdIn-2.0, respectively. The TORs of PdIn-0.8 catalyst
increased almost 10 fold compared to monometallic Pd,
indicating that In promoted the ethane dehydrogenation re-
action rate. The stability of these catalysts was also found to
be very different. While Pd quickly deactivated to low conver-
sion, the PdIn catalysts deactivated moderately within the
first 23 h and reached a stable conversion, allowing activa-
tion energy to be measured. Although the selectivity is close
to 100% for the PdIn catalysts, there is a small amount of

The

measurements
were
performed on PdIn catalysts after stabilization at similar
conversions below 10% (see Arrhenius plot in Fig. S1). The
results are also shown in Table 2. Pd deactivated too rapidly
to determine a reliable activation energy. The Ea of PdIn-0.2
was 102 kJ mol1, and for both PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0 it was
around 130 kJ mol1. The significantly different Ea of PdIn-0.8
and PdIn-2.0 from that of PdIn 0.2 and the higher TOR's of the
former suggests that the two catalysts with higher In loading
may have different surface structure compared with PdIn-
0.2 and In likely modifies the electronic properties of Pd for
ethane dehydrogenation reaction.
3.4 In situ infrared spectroscopy
In situ IR of chemisorbed CO on reduced Pd and PdIn cata-
lysts are shown in Fig. 4. In each spectrum there are two
characteristic CO bands, one from 2000 cm1 to 2100 cm1
assigned to linearly adsorbed CO and a second between 1700
and 2000 cm1 associated with bridge bound CO.34,35 For the
monometallic Pd catalyst, the IR spectrum is dominated by
the broad bridge bound CO band. This broad band possibly
contains two or more peaks including the ones between 1750
and 1900 cm1 assigned to CO bridge bound on terrace and
hollow Pd sites and the ones between 1900 and 2000 cm1 at-
tributed to CO bridge bound to corner and edge sites.3538
The linear bound CO band is a small feature on the 2 nm
monometallic Pd catalyst. For the PdIn samples, however,
the linear CO peak is much more pronounced, with peak
maxima between 2060 cm1 and 2070 cm1. While the bridge
bound CO peak is large relative to the linear bound peak
in PdIn-0.2 sample, its intensity decreases with increasing
In content. For PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0, the bridge bound
CO peaks are small. The feature between 1750 and 1850 cm1
is no longer present, indicating few terrace and hollow Pd
sites in these catalysts.
A decrease in the ratio of bridge bound to linear bound
CO is observed with increasing In loading, Table 3. Bridge-to-
linear ratios for the catalysts were determined by dividing
the total peak area between 1700 and 2000 cm1 by the peak
area between 2000 and 2100 cm1. Though these ratios do
not take into consideration the extinction coefficients of the
different CO adsorption bands and are not quantitatively re-
lated to the CO coverages of the various Pd sites, the ratios
reflect qualitative changes in the surface of the catalysts. The
monometallic Pd catalyst has a bridge to linear ratio of 21,
i.e., primarily bridge bound CO bound to Pd terrace and hol-
low sites. With increasing In loading, the ratio decreases to
3.2 for PdIn-0.2, 0.63 for PdIn-0.8 and finally to 0.13 for
PdIn-2.0. In the PdIn-0.8 and 2.0 samples, the relative pro-
portion of Pd terrace and hollow sites is significantly reduced
and Pd sites capable of binding CO linearly are predominant.
The shift in the CO binding mode suggests that In breaks the

Pd ensembles and creates isolated Pd sites binding CO line-
arly. Though Pd atoms with low coordination number are typ-
ically thought to be responsible for linear bound CO, the new
linear Pd sites are likely from the bimetallic nanoparticle for-
mation since the particle size of the monometallic Pd and
PdIn catalysts are similar.
3.5 In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
The local structure of Pd and In atoms was determined by in
situ X-ray absorption spectra (in situ XAS) for the Pd and Pd
In catalysts. The spectra were taken at room temperature af-
ter the catalysts were pre-reduced in H2/He at 600 C. The
XANES and EXAFS spectra at both the Pd and In edges are
shown in Fig. 5 and 6 for PdIn-2.0 and is typical of the other
PdIn catalysts (see Fig. S2, S3 for the spectra of Pd, PdIn-
0.2 and PdIn-0.8). Comparing the Pd edge XANES of PdIn-
2.0 catalyst to Pd foil the edge energy (24 350 eV) and white line
intensity are similar between these 2 samples indicating the
PdIn-2.0 catalyst is fully reduce to metallic Pd; however, there
are some small differences in the shape of the XANES
suggesting additional metallic atoms in the nanoparticles.
The white line in PdIn-2.0 decreases slightly in intensity
compared to Pd foil (Fig. 5a), suggesting that Pd has some
metallic In neighbors. The EXAFS of PdIn-2.0 looks similar
to that of Pd foil (Fig. 5b), but with slightly longer bond dis-
tance (Table 4). Pd and In have a similar number of
electrons, therefore, scatter similarly. Nevertheless, difference
can still be observed in the position and shape of the scatter-
ing peaks corresponding to the first coordination shell, due
to the existence of In neighbors and their different bond dis-
tance. At the In edge, the edge energy in the XANES of Pd
In-2.0 and In2O3 are similar (27 940 eV), but the intensity of
the white line in PdIn-2.0 is significantly lower than that in
In2O3 (Fig. 6a), which indicates that some metallic In is also
present in the sample. This is confirmed in the In edge
EXAFS of PdIn-2.0 as major scattering peak at R = 2.6 Å
(phase uncorrected distances) typical for 4d metal is observed
(Fig. 6b).39 Spectra with the same features were obtained for
PdIn-0.2 and PdIn-0.8 catalysts, indicating bimetallic inter-
actions in all PdIn catalysts studied.
The k2-weighted EXAFS at both the Pd and In edge of all
the samples were fit and the results are given in Table 4
(graphical fitting results are shown for PdIn-2.0 in Fig.
S4 and S5). At the Pd edge, an average coordination
number and bond distance was determined for PdPd and
PdIn scattering by fitting with a single PdPd scattering
path, since PdPd and PdIn scattering are very similar.
At
the
In
edge,
InPd
scattering
was also
fitted with
the PdPd scattering reference. The average coordination
number of In from the fit is the number of InPd neighbors
normalized to all the In atoms in the sample (including the
metallic In in all the PdIn catalysts and the oxidized In in
two of the catalysts PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0). Therefore, for
samples containing oxidized In, the obtained coordination
number is lower than the expected value for fully reduced In.
While for PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0 contributions from InO
scattering in the range of R = 1.01.8 Å (phase uncorrected
distances) are observed, due to the nature of light scattering,
their intensity are very low and, therefore, the InO scattering
was not possible to fit. For PdIn-0.2, the InPd coordination
number is 8.0 and the bond distance is 2.80 Å, shorter than
that of In metal at 2.87 Å, which implies the In has Pd neigh-
bors. At the Pd edge, average PdMetal (PdM) coordination
number is 10.8 and the bond length is 2.78 Å, longer than
the values for Pd foil (12 at 2.75 Å), suggesting that there are
PdIn bonds in the first coordination shell. For PdIn-0.8
and PdIn 2.0 the PdM and InM bond distances were simi-
lar to those of PdIn-0.2, also indicating the presence of bi-
metallic nanoparticles, but the coordination numbers vary

3.6 In situ X-ray diffraction
While XAS identified that Pd and In formed bimetallic nano-
particles, it was not possible to determine if, or which, or-
dered structures were formed. To investigate the phase as-
semblage of the sub-3 nm PdIn bimetallic nanoparticles, in
situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction was performed. Background
subtracted diffraction patterns were obtained for PdIn cata-
lysts at 600 C and at room temperature after reduction
(Fig. 7a). It was found that except for peak displacement
caused by thermal induced lattice expansion, the spectra
taken at 600 C (Fig. S6) were very similar to those taken at
RT, indicating unchanged crystal structure of the catalysts at
the two different temperatures. The RT patterns were com-
pared to standard diffraction patterns of Pd, PdIn interme-
tallic compounds and Indium oxides. No In-only species were
identified in the diffraction patterns. FCC Pd and cubic PdIn
intermetallic compound (IMC) with a CsCl type structure
(shown in Fig. 7b) were the only two phases observed for the
PdIn nanoparticles. Simulated diffraction patterns of Pd
and cubic PdIn IMC structures (dotted, Fig. 7a) are thus plot-
ted together with the diffraction patterns of the PdIn cata-
lysts (solid, Fig. 7a).
Despite the very low intensity (see Fig. S7 compared to
amorphous silica background) and broad shape of the dif-
fraction peaks arising from small particle size (ca. 2 nm), due
to the very high resolution (0.005) and signal to noise ratio
of synchrotron data it is possible to identify which phases
were present in each sample. For PdIn-2.0 with the highest
In loading, its diffraction pattern shows only peaks corre-
sponding to the cubic PdIn IMC phase. The peaks are slightly
broadened compared to the simulated bulk PdIn XRD pat-
tern. The crystallite size calculated using the FWHM of the
(110) peak is 3.3 nm, slightly larger than the average particle
size determined from the STEM image (2.7 nm). This is com-
mon for size estimation using these two techniques since
STEM measures number distributions while XRD measures
volume weighted distributions.27 For nanoparticles in this

size, its high surface portion (3040%) means any local or
surface structure different from the bulk particle would give
rise to additional diffraction features or extra peak broaden-
ing in the XRD pattern. Accordingly, absence of these fea-
tures for this catalyst indicates that the nanoparticles are well
ordered PdIn IMC.
Identification of the crystal phases in PdIn-0.8 catalyst is
less straightforward. The pattern contains weak features of
both Pd and PdIn IMC. Two local maxima can be identified
for the most intense peak in this sample. One maximum is
observed at 2.95, corresponding to the PdIn (110) peak, and
another is observed at 3.01, which is the position of Pd (111)
peak of FCC Pd suggesting diffraction from both phases.
Other diffraction features of these two phases are shown by
the broad peaks centered around 4.9, 5.7, and 7.6 for FCC
Pd marked by the grey vertical lines and the small peaks at
4.1, 5.1, 5.9, and 6.6 for PdIn IMC marked by the black
vertical lines. These diffraction peaks are very broad and
overlapping. Therefore the crystallite size estimated from the
FWHM of the most intense peak using the Sherrer equation 1.3
nm would be smaller than the actual crystallite size. The av-
erage size from STEM imaging for this catalyst is 1.8 nm.
For PdIn-0.2, while XAS indicated some In-metal scatter-
ing, only broad peaks similar to those of FCC Pd metal were
present. Compared to standard FCC Pd, the peaks in PdIn-
0.2 are slightly shifted to lower angle (0.04 for the most
intense (111) peak). The shift in peak position increases with
2θ value, suggesting that it is related with increased lattice
parameter, i.e. lattice expansion, due to the presence of In in
the nanoparticles. Using Bragg's law, the increased lattice pa-
rameter is calculated from the peak position of the most
intense (111), (220) and (311) peak. The average value is
found to be 3.93 Å, corresponding to an average PdM bond
distance of 2.78 Å, which is in agreement with EXAFS fitting
results. The crytallite size estimated from the FWHM of (111)
peak using Sherrer equation is 1.4 nm, which is smaller than
the STEM determined particle size 2.0 nm also due to
overlapping of diffraction peaks.
4 Discussion
4.1 Detailed structure analysis of PdIn intermetallic
catalysts
The structure of PdIn catalysts with three different In : Pd ra-
tios have been investigated by in situ IR, XAS and XRD. While
IR shows there are changes occurring at the nanoparticle sur-
face, XAS reveals local structure, and XRD identifies the long
range order of atoms in the catalyst. Combined analysis of
these results sheds light on the details of the changes of the
catalyst structure.
For the PdIn-2.0 catalyst, XRD indicates that the nano-
particles are very likely fully alloyed cubic PdIn IMC with
CsCl type structure, in which Pd has only 8 In and In has
8 Pd as first nearest neighbors at a bond distance of 2.81 Å.22
EXAFS fitting gives a PdM bond distance of 2.79 Å with a co-
ordination number of 7.6 and a InM bond distance of 2.80
Å, all close to the theoretical coordination environment of
the PdIn IMC structure. The average coordination number
for In is lower than the expected value 8 as the number of
InPd neighbors is normalized to both the In in InPd and a
roughly identical amount of In oxide estimated from the
atomic ratio of In to Pd in the catalysts. The isolation of Pd
atoms by In atoms expected for PdIn IMC structure on the
particle surface is confirmed by the CO IR, which shows predom-
inantly linear bound CO. The very low CO chemisorption capac-
ity and the low intensity of the IR peaks of this sample compared
to the other ones in similar particle size suggest that much of
the catalytic surface is covered with non-catalytic In species.
For the PdIn-0.8 catalyst, a mixture of Pd and PdIn IMC
phases was identified by XRD. However, the nanoparticle sur-
face is very likely in PdIn IMC structure only. In situ IR shows
predominantly linear bound CO, which means the surface
has mostly isolated Pd atoms. PdIn-0.8 undergoes almost
identical ethane dehydrogenation kinetics compared with
PdIn-2.0, as shown by their similar selectivity, TOR and
their almost identical activation energy, suggesting that they
probably have the same PdIn surface structure. Both IR and ki-
netics results do not favor presence of monometallic Pd on the
catalyst surface though it is found to be present in the bulk, in-
dicating a morphology of a Pd-core/PdIn-IMC shell structure.
Comparison of the structure of PdIn-0.8 to that of PdIn-2.0
suggests that intermetallic alloy formation occurs starting at
the surface of Pd nanoparticles followed by the inward
growth of the intermetallic alloys, which has been previously
reported for β1-PdZn alloy catalyst.40,41
At low In loadings, for PdIn-0.2, only Pd nanoparticles
could be identified by XRD. Nevertheless, it is clear from the
partial improvement in the ethane dehydrogenation selectiv-
ity, an increase in the L/B ratio in IR, and the presence of me-
tallic InM scattering peaks at the In EXAFS that the nano-
particles surface are not just metallic Pd. The In EXAFS fit
gives CN = 8.0 and a bond length of 2.80 Å, almost identical
to the expected value for PdIn IMC, suggesting that the ma-
jority of In atoms likely form a local PdIn IMC structure. The
average bond distance of PdM neighbors 2.78 Å is between
the expected values of those of FCC Pd and the Pd in PdIn
structure. The average coordination number of Pd 10.8 is
higher than that of monometallic Pd nanoparticles in similar
size, likely indicating that there are fewer low-coordination
surface Pd atoms in this catalyst, i.e., there are also surface
In. In situ IR also shows increased linear bound CO, which
suggest the formed PdIn IMC is present on the particle sur-
face. It seems that PdIn IMC is preferentially formed over other
more Pd rich IMC or substitutional solid solution even at rel-
atively low In loading. Similar phenomenon has been previ-
ously reported for a series of RhIn/C intermetallic catalysts.19
In summary, combined analysis of particle size, in situ IR,
XAS and XRD leads to a general picture of the structure of PdIn
catalysts with different loadings. The evolution of PdIn
nanoparticle structure with increasing In content is demon-
strated by a schematic model in Fig. 8. PdIn catalysts with

increasing In loading have increasing fraction of the nano-
particles transformed from Pd to cubic PdIn IMC with a CsCl
type structure. It is very likely that PdIn-0.2 has an FCC Pd
core structure with its surface partially transformed into PdIn
alloy and PdIn-0.8 has a Pd-core with PdIn shell structure.
At higher loadings, for PdIn-2.0, the PdIn structure is fully
formed; however, part of the nanoparticle surface is cov-
ered by non-catalytic In species.
4.2 Structurefunction relationship of PdIn intermetallic
catalyst: the promotion effect of Indium
Section 3.3 shows the ethane dehydrogenation performance
(including selectivity, stability, TOR, and apparent activation
energy) of Pd and PdIn catalysts. As with catalyst structure,
it is found to vary with In loading. Pd exhibits low selectivity
(53% at 15% conversion), initial TOR (0.03 s1) and stability
(fast deactivation). When a limited amount of In is intro-
duced, the catalyst performance is greatly improved as seen
in PdIn-0.2. It becomes highly selective (>97%), more active
(0.09 s1 initial TOR), and stable (0.03 s1 TOR after 3 h).
Higher In loading results in further improved performance.
For PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0 catalysts, further increases are
seen in their selectivity (>99%), initial TOR (0.26 s1 and 0.21
s1) and TOR after 3 h (0.12 s1 and 0.16 s1). The latter two
catalysts have similar selectivity, TOR and almost identical
apparent activation energy (130 kJ mol1) for ethane dehydro-
genation, possibly suggesting similar active sites. However,
PdIn-2.0 catalyst has a much lower dispersion and rate per
gram compared with PdIn-0.8. Excess In in the catalyst leads
to blocking of active Pd sites and lower activity per gram, al-
though the TOR and Ea of the exposed sites are unchanged.
Correlating the catalyst function with the surface structure
suggests that formation of the PdIn IMC leads to higher eth-
ane dehydrogenation selectivity. Pd nanoparticles have Pd en-
sembles, which catalyze hydrogenolysis. As the fraction of the
surface of PdIn IMC increases, and the fraction of ensemble
sites decreases, the olefin selectivity increases. Additionally,
the TOR and Ea significantly increase. When the surface con-
tains only isolated, catalytically active Pd atoms, the hydro-
genolysis (and rapid coke formation) is nearly eliminated.
PdIn IMC has a cubic CsCl type structure where the first
nearest neighbors of Pd are In atoms at a bond distance of
2.81 Å. The PdPd distance is much longer at 3.25 Å. Thus,
all catalytic Pd sites are isolated by the non-catalytic In
atoms. This site isolation eliminates the PdPd terrace en-
sembles responsible for the structure-sensitive reaction, i.e.,
ethane hydrogenolysis. As a result, this undesirable side reac-
tion is turned off, leaving only structure-insensitive dehydro-
genation
reactions
and
a
highly
selective
catalyst.
As
evidenced from in situ IR, Pd terrace and hollow sites are
greatly reduced on PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-2.0 and isolated Pd
sites dominate in these two catalysts.
Changes in nanoparticle composition and geometric struc-
ture often concomitantly lead to change in the electronic
properties of the catalytic atoms,42 which may be related with
changes in catalyst TORs and Ea. Many previous studies have
emphasized the importance of electronic modification in pro-
moting catalyst activity.4,69,43 For the PdIn-0.8 and PdIn-
2.0 catalysts with PdIn IMC surface, although their TORs 0.2
0.3 s1 are lower than the reported TOR 23 s1 of PtIn and
PtSn catalysts,14 which suggests that Pt is more active than
Pd for ethane dehydrogenation, their TORs are almost 10 times
higher than that of monometallic Pd, showing that In is pro-
moting the activity of the Pd catalyst for ethane dehydrogena-
tion. The Pd edge XAS of the PdIn catalysts shows changes
in the shape of the XANES compared to monometallic Pd, in-
dicating a possible change in the electronic properties of Pd
due to PdIn IMC formation which may be related with the
change in TORs.14 Further studies to understand the changes
in electronic structures of intermetallic alloys compared to
monometallic metals by density functional theory are in
progress.
Overall, promotional effect of In appears to be both geo-
metric, i.e., isolation of the active Pd atoms, leading to high
selectivity and lower deactivation rates, and electronic due to
formation of PdIn bonds leading to higher TOR's and higher
activation energies.
Geometric effects have been discussed in a number of pre-
vious studies on bimetallic Pt light alkane dehydrogenation
catalysts.3,10,14 It has been proposed that the catalyst selectiv-
ity is improved when Pt ensembles are reduced by bimetallic
particle formation or when Pt sites with low coordination are
covered. However, the exact structure of the bimetallic sur-
face ensemble has not been identified in these catalysts. As
shown for the phase diagrams for PdIn in Fig. 1a, several
intermetallic alloys are often possible in bimetallic nano-
particles.21 Bimetallic nanoparticles, however, may not only
form ordered alloy structures, but may also form, solid solu-
tions or alloys without isolated active atoms.17,44 This work
suggests that only one of the several possible intermetallic
compound structures is formed in PdIn catalysts. That struc-
ture has isolated Pd atoms, thus, is selective for alkane dehy-
drogenation reactions. A similar structure was observed for a
β1-PdZn dehydrogenation catalyst.11 For both In and Zn pro-
moters, although Pd is not generally thought as a potential
alkane dehydrogenation, for Pd alloys where the active atoms
are isolated, high olefin selectivity is possible. It is possible
that the role of promoter atoms, Sn, Zn, Ga, and In, in Pt is
formation of intermetallic alloys with isolated Pt sites.14,4549

4.3 Preferential alloy phase formation
For this study, the In : Pd ratio varies from 0.2 to 2.0, covering
the composition range of 6 different possible intermetallic
compound phases according to the phase diagram (Fig. 1a).21
Nevertheless, the only alloy phase observed is the 1 : 1 cubic
PdIn intermetallic compound with CsCl structure, suggesting
preferential formation of this intermetallic phase. During cat-
alyst synthesis, the reaction temperature is far from the melt-
ing point of Pd and relevant PdIn IMCs, indicating that the
IMC formation reaction is likely kinetically controlled rather
than thermodynamically controlled. This means that for two
intermetallic compound phases, both within the relevant
composition range, though one may be thermodynamically
more stable than the other, formation of the second phase
from Pd metal precursor may be preferred due to its lower ac-
tivation energy, or kinetic barrier. This kinetic barrier is de-
pendent on the difference in the crystal structure of the prod-
uct phase compared to the reactant phase. When the PdIn
catalysts were prepared, Pd is easily reduced at about 200 C,
where InOx is not reducible. Reduction of InOx likely occurs
at higher temperature on the surface of the Pd nanoparticles
by surface dissociated H atoms.18,50 The reduced In then dif-
fuses at higher temperature into the Pd nanoparticle from
the surface, forming PdIn IMC. Among all 6 possible PdIn
IMC phases (Fig. 1b),2226 the PdIn 1 : 1 IMC in a cubic CsCl
type structure is most similar in crystal structure to FCC Pd
and would require the least rearrangement of Pd atoms, i.e.
has the lowest kinetic barrier. Therefore, only this IMC struc-
ture formed in all PdIn catalysts. Further rearrangement
does not occur at the temperature of preparation or reaction.
This phenomenon has been observed in other catalysts
where intermetallic compounds are known.12,18,19 In almost all
cases, the preferred IMCs are characteristic of similar close
packed crystal structures to the parent noble metal. It has been
reported that in PdZn catalysts, the only IMC phase that form
is a 1 : 1 β1-PdZn intermetallic compound with the CuTi type
structure (tetragonal, shortened in c axis compared to the CsCl
type).12 For RhIn catalysts, only RhIn 1 : 1 IMC (in the same
structure as PdIn: cubic, CsCl type) forms.19 Even when the In:
Rh is substantially lower than 1 : 1, the catalysts maintain a
high symmetry RhIn structure (tetragonal, AuCu type) by in-
creasing the c/a ratio from the original CsCl structure via lattice
distortion

catalysts with Pt3Sn and PtSn as the only IMCs formed,49,51 and

diffusion, or kinetically controlled preferential phase formation
phenomenon is well-known in metallurgy.53,54,55
5 Conclusion
Monometallic Pd and three PdIn intermetallic compound
(IMC) catalysts with different In loading have been synthesized,
characterized and tested for ethane dehydrogenation. Addition
of In greatly increases the olefin selectivity for ethane dehydro-
genation by forming a PdIn 1 : 1 IMC (cubic, CsCl type struc-
ture) in the PdIn catalysts. At low In loading, partial surface
PdIn IMC is formed. With additional In, there is a complete
PdIn surface IMC, and at high In loading fully formed PdIn
IMC nanoparticles are present. Although there are several PdIn
IMC structures possible, only the cubic PdIn 1 :1 IMC (with a
CsCl structure type) is formed in all PdIn catalysts. It is
suggested this occurs by a kinetically controlled mechanism
for solid state IMC formation. The PdIn 1 : 1 IMC is the struc-
ture with the lowest kinetic barrier for intermetallic alloy for-
mation and requires the least rearrangement of atoms in the
initially formed FCC Pd nanoparticle. In the cubic PdIn IMC
structure, the first nearest neighbors of Pd atoms are In at
2.81 Å with the nearest PdPd distance of 3.25 Å, ensuring
isolation of the catalytically active Pd atoms. For catalysts
with a PdIn IMC surface, the ethane dehydrogenation selec-
tivity is near 100%; while that of Pd nano-particles of similar
size is approximately 50%. The geometric isolation of the ac-
tive sites allows for catalytic reaction of structure insensitive
reactions, i.e., dehydrogenation, while elimination of hydro-
genolysis, a structure sensitive reaction. Concomitant PdIn
bond formation also modifies the electronic properties of Pd
atoms, leading to an increase in the TOR by almost 10 times

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
