a b s t r a c t
Silica-supported Pd and PdZn nanoparticles of a similar size were evaluated for neopentane hydrogenol-
ysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation. Monometallic Pd showed high neopen-
tane hydrogenolysis selectivity. Addition of small amounts of Zn to Pd lead PdZn scatters in the EXAFS
spectrum and an increase in the linear bonded CO by IR. In addition, the neopentane turnover rate
decreased by nearly 10 times with little change in the selectivity. Increasing amounts of Zn lead to greater
PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR and complete loss of neopentane conversion.
Pd NPs also had high selectivity for propane hydrogenolysis and thus were poorly selective for propylene.
The PdZn bimetallic catalysts, however, were able to preferentially catalyze dehydrogenation, were not
active for propane hydrogenolysis, and thus were highly selective for propylene formation. The decrease
in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn,
demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydroge-
nation does not.

1. Introduction
The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi-
fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the
particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition
of promoters or alloy formation. Boudart was the first to divide
reactions into two groups based on sensitivity of the catalytic
activity to particle size [1]. Structure-sensitive reactions are those
for which the kinetics is dependent on the particle size (due to
changes in the coordination of surface atoms with particle size),
while structure-insensitive reactions are independent of the parti-
cle size. For structure-sensitive reactions, the turnover rate (TOR),
or rate per surface atom, changes with size. This geometric effect
results because the active site for structure-sensitive reactions
requires an ensemble of active atoms and the number of these
ensembles changes with particle size. For structure-insensitive
reactions, every surface atom is an active site, and thus, the rate
is directly proportional to the dispersion.
Electronic effects alter the chemical reactivity of the metal
nanoparticle due to changes in the electronic structure. These
two effects are often interrelated as changes in surface geometry
often lead to changes in electronic properties. For example, as
the size of a metal cluster is reduced, the cluster exhibits quantum
confinement effects that perturb the electronic structure and in
some cases, can even give rise to a band gap [24]. The reduced
coordination of the cluster often results in changes in the energy
of the valence orbitals that alter the bond strength of adsorbates
[57].
Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop-
erties of a catalyst [8]. Two effects appear simultaneously when
metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the
alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel-
ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza-
tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in
the bond distances between metal atoms. At the same time, the
orbital extent or the size of the valence orbitals of the alloying ele-
ments is different, resulting in changes in the overlap between the
bonding orbitals. Therefore, alloying can result in both electronic
effects (degree of charge transfer and hybridization) and geometric
effects due to the creation of specific reaction ensembles. Although
it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor-
tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than
another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction.
However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular
reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

Previous work on Pt and Pd catalysts of different particle sizes
yielded a correlation between neopentane isomerization selectiv-
ity and the initial CO heat of adsorption [9]. Isomerization selectiv-
ity increased with decreasing CO heat of adsorption and this
correlation appears to be independent of metal, nanoparticle size,
and the configuration of adsorbed CO. Large Pd particles have pri-
marily bridge-bound CO, while small Pt particles have primarily
linear-bound CO, but they have similar catalytic behavior. This pro-
vides strong evidence that the selectivity is dependent on electro-
nic effects and the strength of adsorbate chemisorption. Extending
this correlation, high selectivity to isomerization should be
achieved by materials which bind CO even less strongly than Pt
terrace sites. From previous DFT calculations, an intermetallic 1:1
PdZn (111) surface was shown to have a lower CO adsorption
energy compared to Pt(111) [10]. Sarkrany et al. found experimen-
tally that the CO heat of adsorption on a PdZn alloy was 67 kJ/mol
lower than that of monometallic Pd [11,12]. Using our correlation
between the heat of adsorption and the neopentane isomerization
selectivity, it is anticipated that alloy formation between Pd and Zn
would lead to a lower heat of adsorption and also improve neopen-
tane isomerization selectivity [10].
PdZn alloys have been studied for a number of different reac-
tions, including methanol steam reforming, watergas shift, alkene
hydrogenation and auto-thermal reforming [11,1319]. Pd and Zn
form a large number of bimetallic structures each with their own
unique crystal structure and stoichiometry. At a 1:1 ratio of Pd:Zn,
a face centered tetragonal structure forms, which is present for a
wide range of Pd compositions (3070%) [13,17,18,20]. Improved
selectivity and stability were the main benefits that PdZn catalysts
exhibited for these various reactions. These improvements were
credited to both geometric changes caused by zinc altering the cat-
alyst surface by expanding the palladium bond distance and elec-
tronic effects observed by the weakening of the PdCO bond
[12,18]. Chen et al. performed DFT studies on the surface structure
of PdZn alloys and found that the (111) surface was the most ener-
getically favorable [21]. Calculations also suggested that the Pd d-
band valence width was significantly reduced compared to pure
Pd which was linked to improvements in methanol steam reforming
performance. Many of these studies used ZnO as a support or sup-
ported ZnO, e.g., from a Zn(NO3)2 precursor, as a source of zinc for
alloy formation. PdZn intermetallic structures are typically synthe-
sized with excess zinc and not in nominal molar ratios close to 1:1.
Iwasa et al. were unable to form the PdZn intermetallic structure on
silica at temperatures up to 700 C due to a lack of zinc reduction in
ZnO [22]. Fottinger et al. performed methanol steam reforming over
Pd/ZnO catalysts and found that reaction conditions caused PdZn
intermetallic formation which resulted in improvements to selec-
tivity [19]. Through in situ XAS it was also shown that the PdZn inter-
metallic structure was also reversible upon exposure to oxygen.
Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and testing
of two PdZn nanoparticle catalysts supported on silica with differ-
ent Pd:Zn molar ratios. The catalysts were characterized by elec-
tron microscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO, X-ray absorption spectros-
copy
(XAS),
CO
chemisorption,
and
isothermal
calorimetry.
Neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogen-
olysis/dehydrogenation reactions were used to evaluate the influ-
ence of Zn on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of Pd.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
PdZn bimetallic catalysts supported on silica (Davisil 646 silica
gel from SigmaAldrich, 300 m2/g and 1.15 mL/g pore volume)
were synthesized by two different synthesis methods  sequential
and co-incipient wetness impregnation (co-IWI) under controlled
pH conditions [23,24]. During IWI, the support is contacted with
just enough metal precursor solution to fill the pore volume. All
of the metal precursor solution contacts the surface due to the
incipient amount of liquid used. Sequential impregnation requires
the two metals be added in separate incipient wetness impregna-
tion steps, while co-impregnation combines the metals into a sin-
gle solution. The 2% Pd catalyst was synthesized using a procedure
described in previous work [9].
2.1.1. 2%Pd10%Zn
This catalyst was synthesized by sequential impregnation. Zinc
was first added to silica using the IWI method. 18.1 g of Zn(NO3)2-
6H2O was dissolved in 15 mL of H2O. 15 M NH4OH was then added
to this solution to initially form a white precipitate which dis-
solved when additional NH4OH was added bringing the total vol-
ume to 50 mL. This solution was added dropwise to 40 g of silica
and stirred. The catalyst was dried overnight at 125 C and then
calcined at 300 C for 3 h. Palladium was also added by the IWI
method. 2.81 g of 10% Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution from Aldrich was
added dropwise to 5 g of the 10% Zn/SiO2 catalyst. This catalyst
was then dried overnight at 125 C, calcined at 500 C for 3 h and
reduced at 550 C in 4% H2/He at 30 cc/min for 30 min.
2.1.2. 3%Pd1.8%Zn
The catalyst was synthesized by co-IWI with both zinc and pal-
ladium precursors added simultaneously. 0.42 g of Zn(NO3)26H2O
was dissolved in 1.5 mL of 15 M NH4OH and this solution was
added to 4.21 g of 10% Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution in H2O. This solu-
tion was then added dropwise to silica (5 g) and mixed between
drops. The catalyst was dried overnight at 125 C, calcined at
225 C for 3 h and then reduced at 300 C at 30 cc/min in
4%H2/He for 30 min.
2.2. STEM
The STEM images were taken at UICs Research Resources Cen-
ter facility using the JEOL-ARM 200CF aberration-corrected micro-
scope (70 pm spatial resolution and 300 meV energy resolution).
Samples were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and sonicated for
20 min. A drop of the solution was added to a holey-carbon copper
grid and dried under a heat lamp for 20 min. Images were taken
using the high angle angular dark field (HAADF) mode and particle
size was counted using the Particule2 program. A minimum of 100
particles were counted to get an accurate representation of the
particle size distribution for each catalyst.
2.3. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements for the Pd
K (24350 eV) edge were made on the bending magnet beamline
of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at
the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.
Measurements were taken in transmission mode. A palladium foil
spectrum was acquired through a third ion chamber simulta-
neously with each measurement for energy calibration.
Samples were prepared by grinding the catalysts into a fine
powder and pressing them into the sample holder. The sample
holder is a metal cylinder capable of holding up to six individual
samples. The sample holder is then placed in a quartz tube with
ports containing Kapton windows on each end to flow gases or iso-
late the sample after treatment. The sample thickness was chosen
to give a total absorbance at the Pd K-edge between 1 and 2
absorption lengths and edge steps around 0.30.5. The XAS spectra
were obtained following reduction at 275 C and 550 C at
76

atmospheric pressure in a 4% H2/He mixture at 50 cm3/min flow
rate. After reduction, the samples were purged with He at
100 cm3/min at the reduction temperature and cooled to room tem-
perature in He flow. Trace oxidants in He were removed by passing
through a Matheson PUR-Gas Triple Purifier Cartridge containing a
Cu trap. All spectra were obtained at room temperature in He.
WINXAS 3.1 software was used to fit the XAS data. The EXAFS
coordination parameters were obtained by a least-squares fit in
k-space of the k2-weighted Fourier transform data from 2.6 to
12.1 Å1, and the first shell fit of the magnitude and imaginary
parts were performed between 1.6 and 3.0 Å. Because of the lim-
ited data range and number of allowed fit parameters of the two-
shell fit in the bimetallic nanoparticles, the error in the fits was
determined by fixing Dr2 at values typical of 2.53 nm nanoparti-
cles, that is, 0.0010.002 greater than metallic foils. The error in N
was 10% and in R was 0.02 Å, within the typical fitting errors of
EXAFS. Fits were performed by altering the coordination number
(CN), bond distance (R), r2, and energy shift (E0). The r2 value
was kept constant through all sample fits, and CN and R were
allowed to vary in turn to determine the correct fit. Although CN
is determined for each catalyst, they used only to determine the
coordination environment of the Pd. Although coordination num-
bers can be used to determine the particle size [25] and morphol-
ogy in monometallic NPs [26], the complex structure, i.e., PdZn
alloy and multiple phases, e.g., Pd core with PdZn alloy shell,
makes determination of the particle size, for example, unreliable.
2.4. Neopentane hydrogenolysis and isomerization
Neopentane hydrogenolysis and isomerization kinetics and
selectivity were determined using 0.050.15 g of catalyst diluted
with 0.9 g of silica and loaded into a 0.500 O.D. quartz plug-flow
reactor. Glass wool was used for the bottom 2 cm of the bed. A
0.5-cm silica layer was placed on top of the glass wool before the
catalyst and silica mixture was added to the reactor resulting in
a catalyst bed height of 3 cm. The reactor was purged with He
for 5 min before each run, and the catalyst was reduced in 4% H2/
He as the temperature was increased to the reaction temperature,
273  2 C. This temperature allowed for all the catalysts to be
tested at differential conversion. A K-type thermocouple was
inserted from the bottom of the reactor into the lower portion of
the catalyst bed. Once the reaction temperature stabilized, the
pre-mixed reactant feed gas consisting of 0.35% neopentane and
3.5% H2 balanced in He was passed through the reactor. The flow
rate of the feed gas was varied from 25 to 100 cm3/min to obtain
differential conversions (0.56%). Each flow rate was run for at
least 1 h to ensure steady-state conversion had been reached. An
Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (J&W Scientific GS-Alumina col-
umn) with an FID detector was used to analyze the products and
was equipped with a back pressure regulator at the outlet to hold
the system at a constant pressure of 9 psig. Each experimental run
was completed within 6 h for consistency, and multiple runs for
each catalyst were performed. No appreciable deactivation during
neopentane hydrogenolysis was observed in any of the catalysts
over this period of time. The maximum relative error of any selec-
tivity measurements was 6%, with most of the data being repro-
ducible within 2%. Turnover rates were calculated based upon
the moles of neopentane converted divided by the number of
active sites determined by the dispersion calculated from CO
chemisorption.
2.5. Propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation selectivity and rate were determined
using 0.20.5 g of catalyst diluted with 0.9 g of silica and loaded
into the same 0.500 O.D. quartz plug-flow reactor used for neopen-
tane hydrogenolysis. The reactor was purged with He for 5 min
before each run, and the catalyst was reduced in 4% H2/He as the
temperature
was
increased
to
the
reaction
temperature,
550  2 C. Once the reaction temperature stabilized, the pre-
mixed reactant feed gas consisting of 2% propane and balance Ar
was passed through the reactor. The flow rate of the feed gas
was set to 50 cm3/min and held constant throughout the test so
that the deactivation of each catalyst could be determined. The test
was run until a steady-state conversion was reached. Each experi-
mental run was completed within 6 h for consistency and multiple
runs for each catalyst were performed. The maximum relative
error of any selectivity measurements was 6%, with most of the
data being reproducible within 2%.
2.6. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
(DRIFTS)
Infrared spectra were obtained using a Thermo Scientific Nico-
let 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific Pray-
ing Mantis diffuse reflectance in situ cell at the Northwestern Clean
Catalysis (CleanCat) Core Facility. Samples were ground to a fine
powder using a mortar and pestle and packed into the sample
chamber to create a uniform surface. The chamber was purged
with Ar, then the gas was switched to 10% H2/N2, and the temper-
ature was raised to 250 C and held for 15 min. After reduction of
the catalyst, the gas was switched back to Ar and the temperature
was reduced to 25 C. A background scan was then recorded, which
was averaged over 100 scans (2-min observation time) with
4 cm1 resolution. The sample was then exposed to 1.02% CO/N2
and another scan was taken once equilibrium was reached, at
which point the flow was changed back to Ar and a final scan
was taken once the intensity of the adsorbed CO peak was invari-
ant with time. The linear-to-bridge-bound ratios reported here do
not take into account the differences in extinction coefficients
between the adsorption sites and therefore do not represent quan-
titative
coverages,
but
rather
reflect
qualitative
differences
between catalysts [27].
2.7. CO heats of adsorption
Determination of the initial heat of adsorption of carbon mon-
oxide on the two PdZn catalysts (6070 mg) reduced at two dif-
ferent temperatures (300 and 550 C) was conducted utilizing a
Setaram Sensys EVO differential scanning calorimetry interfaced
with a plug-flow reactor. The plug-flow reactor was connected to
a mass spectrometer. After reduction at the specified temperature
in 5.11% H2/Ar (both gases 99.999%) for 2 h, the catalyst was cooled
down to 35 C in the same gas, and the catalyst was exposed to a
mixture of 1% CO (99.999% research grade) in He (99.9999%,
research grade) pulsed into the 5% H2/Ar stream from a ten-way
switching value with a 1000 lL sample loop. The number of moles
of CO per pulse calculated from the ideal gas law was 4  104 -
mmol. Twenty pulses of carbon monoxide were employed; the ini-
tial heat of adsorption was determined by only considering
injections in which the entire pulse of carbon monoxide was con-
sumed. The 3Pd1.8Zn/SiO2 adsorbed entirely 56 pulses depend-
ing on the reduction temperature, while the 2Pd10Zn/SiO2
adsorbed entirely 1 pulse of carbon monoxide.
2.8. CO chemisorption
The CO chemisorption measurements were conducted at the
Northwestern University Clean Catalysis (CleanCat) Core Facility
using an Altamira Instruments AMI-200. Catalysts (0.050.2 g)
were loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor tube, which was
weighed before and after sample addition to ensure an accurate

77
weight measurement. The loaded tube was then loaded into the
furnace, and the catalysts were reduced in H2/Ar at 300 C or
550 C for 2 h (10 C/min ramp rate) and then flushed for 30 min
in He. Using a six-way valve, 5% CO/He was then pulsed (595 lL
loop volume) into the system 15 times at 30 C to ensure the sur-
face was saturated. Each pulse peak was integrated to find the vol-
ume of CO remaining following adsorption. Surface saturation was
typically reached within 10 pulses. The dispersion determined by
CO chemisorption also included average stoichiometric factor
determined from the uncorrected DRIFTS linear-to-bridging ratios
for each catalyst. CO bound linearly account for one CO molecule
per surface atom while bridge-bound CO implies there is one CO
molecule per two surface atoms. The equation used to get the dis-
persion is given below.

3. Results
3.1. Particle size analysis
STEM imaging was used to determine metal nanoparticle size. A
representative STEM image for the 3%Pd1.8%Zn catalyst and cor-
responding size distribution are shown in Fig. 1. The particle sizes
for the three catalysts tested are reported in Table 1 and show that
the average particle sizes are similar. The 3%Pd1.8%Zn catalyst
was also reduced at the propane dehydrogenation reaction tem-
perature (550 C) to determine if any sintering occurred. The parti-
cle
size
did
not
appreciably
change,
between
the
two
temperatures. Having similar particle sizes between catalysts
enables the changes caused by alloying to be studied without hav-
ing to account for changes in particle size which are known to alter
the kinetics of structure-sensitive reactions. From our previous
studies, there are results for similar sized monometallic Pd cata-
lysts for comparison with these PdZn bimetallic catalysts [9].
3.2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray
absorption near-edge (XANES) spectra were gathered for each cat-
alyst following reduction at 275 C and fitting done to determine
bond distances and coordination numbers (CN). The XANES spectra
are shown in Fig. 2a and an expanded view to the leading edge is
shown in Fig. 2b. XANES were analyzed to determine the Pd K-edge
position of each catalyst and evaluate the oxidation state of palla-
dium. The edge energy is defined as the inflection point of the lead-
ing edge and is determined by taking the maximum of first
derivative of the spectra in Fig. 2a. The edge energy for all three
catalysts
is
summarized
in
Table
2.
A
K-edge
energy
of
24.350 keV corresponds to metallic Pd and the PdZn catalysts are
slightly shifted as seen in Fig. 2b (to 24.349 keV) from Pd which
is consistent with the presence of bimetallic nanoparticles [8].
The intensity of the first absorption peaks is similar indicating that
the palladium is metallic rather than oxidized which would cause
the peak intensity to increase. The small differences in the spectra
following the first peak, changes in intensities and peak shifts, also
indicate that non-Pd neighbors are near to Pd.
Fig. 3 shows the EXAFS spectra for the Pd foil reference and all
three catalysts reduced at 275 C, and Table 2 summarizes the
parameters calculated from the fitting of the spectra. Coordination
numbers and bond distances were determined by fitting the mag-
nitude and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the k2-
weighted first shell spectra. Although the total coordination num-
bers for each of the samples are identical, the identity of the neigh-
bors and their distances change between the three catalysts. The
monometallic Pd catalyst shows two prominent peaks at 2.05
and 2.50 Å (phase uncorrected distances) at a ratio of 2:1, typical
of metallic Pd and also observed for the Pd foil spectra seen in
Fig. 3a [18]. The PdPd bond distance of 2.75 Å in Table 2 also cor-
responds to metallic Pd. Fig. 3b shows both bimetallic PdZn cata-
lysts; the 3%Pd1.8%Zn spectra look similar to metallic Pd;
however, a change in the peak ratio to 1.45:1 is consistent with a
small number of non-Pd scattering atoms. The fit confirms there
are PdZn bonds with a coordination number of 2.3 and a bond dis-
tance of 2.56 Å. The coordination number for the PdPd scatters is
5.3 with a bond distance of 2.73 Å (similar to metallic Pd). The dif-
ferences in the coordination numbers between the PdPd and Pd
Zn scatterers indicate that the majority of the palladium atoms in
this catalyst are still surrounded by other palladium atoms with a

few Zn neighbors. The 2%Pd10%Zn catalyst also has two promi-
nent peaks, but these peaks deviate from the pure Pd spectra sig-
nificantly. Although the peak positions are similar, the ratio of
the peaks has changed, suggesting that the bonding environment
of Pd has changed with the addition of zinc. The fits in Table 2 con-
firm this shift from Pd-rich particles to a catalyst with significant
interaction between Pd and Zn as the PdZn coordination number
increases to 5.3 and the PdPd coordination number decreases to
2.7. The bond distances have not changed significantly in the two
PdZn catalysts and these bond distances are also similar to those
found in the literature [18]. Although the average coordination
environment in these catalysts is different, EXAFS is a bulk charac-
terization; therefore, the surface composition and structure, which
is responsible for the catalytic activity, is uncertain.
3.3. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
(DRIFTS)
DRIFTS of CO adsorption was used to evaluate changes in sur-
face composition and structure of the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows the
DRIFTS spectra for the PdZn catalysts as well as the monometallic
Pd catalyst with a similar particle size. Bridge-bound CO has previ-
ously been assigned to the peaks in the range of 18002000 cm1.
Within this range, peaks between 1800 and 1900 cm1 are attrib-
uted to CO bridge-bound on terrace and hollow sites, while peaks
between 1900 and 2000 cm1 are assigned to CO bridge-bound to
corner and edge sites [28,29]. Linear bound CO is characterized by
two peaks typically appearing around 2080 and 2050 cm1 in
which Lennon et al. have assigned to corner and edge adsorption
sites respectively [28].
The 2%Pd catalyst, with an average particle size of 2.5 nm, has
one very prominent bridge-bound CO peak at 1936 cm1, a shoul-
der centered around 1835 cm1, and one linear CO peak at
2084 cm1. The presence of two bridge-bound CO peaks is typical
of pure Pd catalysts [28,29]. The 3%Pd1.8%Zn catalyst has one
bridge-bound CO peak located at 1975 cm1. The loss of the
bridge-bound CO peak around 1835 cm1 peak suggests zinc
breaks up palladium terraces on the surface typically responsible
for bridge-bound CO. Since the tail of the peak extends into the ter-
race site range, there may be a small percentage of Pd ensembles
remaining. The shift of the linear peak to 2075 cm1 from
2084 cm1 indicates there is a small fraction of CO linearly bound
to edge sites since most is still bound to corner sites. These shifts

have also been reported for other PdZn catalysts [18,30]. The
2%Pd10%Zn catalyst has a small bridge-bound CO peak at
1960 cm1 corresponding to corner and edge sites. The peak posi-
tion has shifted from the other PdZn catalyst; however, it is still in
the range of bridge-bound CO on corner and edge sites and there
are no longer peaks for CO in the terrace region. The linear region
has two distinct peaks at 2080 cm1 and 2050 cm1, which indi-
cates that CO is linearly bound to edge sites as well as corner sites
suggesting further zinc addition continues to reduce the number of
surface palladium ensemble sites. Two peaks in the linear region
have also been observed for PdZn catalysts [18].
The linear-to-bridge-bound ratio calculated by comparing the
raw areas of the different peaks is presented in Table 3. The addi-
tion of zinc causes a dramatic shift in the CO adsorption resulting
in greatly reduced concentration of bridge-bound CO. While the
monometallic Pd catalyst has mostly bridge-bound CO, the addi-
tion of zinc causes a significant increase in linear-bound CO. The
addition of excess zinc in the 2%Pd10%Zn catalyst leads to a minor
increase in the overall ratio of linear-to-bridge-bound CO (2.5:1)
compared to the lower Zn sample (2.1:1), but there are differences
in the peak positions as discussed above. The shift in the linear-to-
bridge ratio indicates that zinc breaks up palladium ensembles on
the surface and decreases the number of Pd ensemble sites capable
of adsorbing bridge-bound CO. Weilach et al. used DFT to study CO
adsorption on PdZn surfaces and found that adsorption on top sites
was preferred on the intermetallic surface past  ML CO coverage
[31].
3.4. Heat of adsorption of CO determined by isothermal calorimetry
The initial heat of adsorption determined previously for a pair of
Pd/SiO2 catalysts with a mean TEM particle size of 2.53 nm was
130 kJ mol1 [9]. The heat of CO adsorption on Pd was previously
determined for the catalysts reduced in H2, evacuated at the reduc-
tion temperature, followed by cooling in an inert gas to the adsorp-
tion temperature (35 C). In the previous work, the differential
(initial) heat of adsorption was determined using a volumetric
adsorption instrument (Micromeritics ASAP 2020C) interfaced
with a Setaram Sensys EVO differential scanning calorimeter. For
the PdZn catalysts studied in this work, calorimetric measure-
ments of CO adsorption led to abnormally large heat flow which
was associated with the oxidation of CO by small quantities of oxy-
gen in He (99.999% UHP) led to the oxidation of CO. Enthalpy mea-
surements in He were unreliable since the oxidation reaction is
highly exothermic and contributed significantly to the measured
heat. All attempts to eliminate the CO oxidation reaction were
unsuccessful including utilizing a CO/He mixture containing
research grade He (99.9999%). As a result, the PdZn bimetallic cat-
alysts were cooled in a 5% H2/Ar mixture to the adsorption temper-
ature of 35 C. Due to the small particle size and alloy formation
with Zn, the formation of a hydride is not expected, but there will
be an adsorbed layer of hydrogen on the surface of these PdZn cat-
alysts [3235]. Chemisorbed hydrogen will lower the heat of
adsorption compared to an adsorbate-free surface of Pd [36]. The
results in Table 3 also show that increasing reduction temperature
slightly lowered the heat of adsorption. For comparison the heat of
CO adsorption of monometallic Pd catalyst was obtained using the
same procedure.
3.5. Neopentane isomerization and hydrogenolysis
Neopentane conversion was conducted at 273  2 C, 9 psig and
varying flow rates in order to vary conversion within range of dif-
ferential conversion (<10%). There are two possible reaction path-
ways: hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Isomerization products
include isopentane produced from an initial isomerization reaction
and n-pentane if isopentane undergoes a second isomerization
reaction before desorption from the surface. A single hydrogenoly-
sis reaction will produce isobutane and methane, and any subse-
quent
steps
will
produce
additional
methane
and
lighter
hydrocarbons (propane and ethane). All selectivities given in
Table 4 are extrapolated to 0% conversion. Calculated turnover
rates (TOR) using the same method described previously are also
given in Table 4 [9]. Products with non-zero selectivity at 0% con-
version are considered primary products while products that have
0% selectivity are considered to be secondary products [37]. The
isomerization selectivity is defined as the selectivity to isopentane
and hydrogenolysis products are any molecule lower than C5
shown in Table 4. The 2%Pd catalyst has an isomerization and
hydrogenolysis selectivity of 9% and 91%, respectively. The 3%Pd
1.8%Zn catalyst has a similar isomerization selectivity (13%) and
hydrogenolysis selectivity (87%). The product distributions are also
similar for the various hydrogenolysis products. If a single hydrog-
enolysis event occurs per converted neopentane molecule, equal
amounts of methane and isobutane should be identified in the
product distribution. An excess of methane can be seen for both
catalysts in Table 4 which indicates that further hydrogenolysis
is occurring, as evidenced by the presence of small amounts of
ethane and propane at 0% conversion.
Since zinc does not adsorb CO, the amount of surface palladium
was determined by chemisorption and used to calculate the TOR
