Ethane hydrogenolysis involves CC bond rupture in unsaturated species in quasi-equilibrium with gas-
eous reactants and H2 on metal clusters, because CC bonds weaken as C-atoms replace hydrogen with
exposed metal atoms from catalyst surfaces. The nature and reactivity of such adsorbed species are
probed here using kinetic data and density functional theory (DFT) for the case of Ir surfaces, but with
conclusions that appear to be general to hydrogenolysis on noble metals. On surfaces saturated with
chemisorbed H-atoms (H), theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly
via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane; all other
intermediates cleave CC bonds at much lower rates (>107-fold). Measured activation energies
(213 kJ mol1) and free energies (130 kJ mol1) reflect the combined values for quasi-equilibrated steps
that desorb H, adsorb C2H6, form C2-intermediates by dehydrogenation, and form the transition state
from CHCH species. DFT-derived activation energies (218 kJ mol1) and free energies estimated from
these values and statistical mechanics treatments of reaction and activation entropies (137 kJ mol1)
are in excellent agreement with measured values. The removal of four H-atoms in forming the
kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on
hydrogenolysis rates, show that 23 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition
state, as expected from the structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries
on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal
clusters. Theory and experiments combine here to provide mechanistic insights inaccessible to direct
observation and provide compelling evidence for reaction pathways long considered to be plausible for
hydrogenolysis on noble metals. The extent of unsaturation in the single relevant intermediate and its
CC cleavage rates will depend on the identity of the metal, but the elementary steps and their kinetic
relevance appear to be a general feature of metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.

1. Introduction
Hydrogenolysis of CC bonds on metals is the reaction of choice
for decreasing the chain length of acyclic molecules and for opening
rings in cyclic hydrocarbons [112]. It is also responsible, however,
for yield losses during hydrocarbon reforming and isomerization
[13,14], making mechanistic models of hydrogenolysis reactivity
and selectivity useful in practice [15]. CC bond rupture has been
widely used to probe the effects of cluster size [9,10,1626],
elemental identity, and alloying [2737] in catalysis. Early studies
recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening
of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates
that
replace
CH
bonds
with
C-metal
bonds
on
surfaces
[9,11,16,3841]. The structure and degree of unsaturation of these
species on metal surfaces have been inferred indirectly from mea-
sured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates [29,3840]
and from isotopic exchange data [4244], because they lack distin-
guishable spectroscopic signatures required for their direct interro-
gation and, therefore, can only be assessed using theoretical
methods [35,4548].
Our recent studies have addressed the enthalpic and entropic
barriers that govern reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenolysis
of C2C10 n-alkanes [49] and isoalkanes [50] on supported Ir
clusters. Here, we combine hydrogenolysis turnover rates and their
kinetic interpretation on Ir clusters saturated with chemisorbed
hydrogen (H) with density functional theory (DFT) treatments
on the Ir(111) surface in order to infer mechanistic details for
the hydrogenolysis of ethane. This study shows that CC bond
cleavage occurs via a specific reactive intermediate (CHCH) that

forms by the loss of four H-atoms (as H2) through the sequential
dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane molecules. These findings
and the DFT-derived activation barriers agree well with measured
turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters. They confirm
the essential role of unsaturation in the cleavage of CC bonds in
ethane [45,46,48] and, by inference, in larger n-alkanes, isoalkanes,
and cycloalkanes [7,8,16,35,47], for which similar kinetic depen-
dences and activation barriers have been observed. The identifica-
tion of the reactive species that cleave CC bonds shows also how
their concentrations depend on H2 pressures and temperatures and
can, therefore, inform the choice of reaction conditions and cata-
lysts for processes that deliberately, or inadvertently, involve
hydrogenolysis reactions.
2. Methods
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of IrSiO2
IrSiO2 (3.0 wt.%) was prepared by incipient wetness impregna-
tion using reported methods [49]. Samples were heated to 393 K at
0.017 K s1 in flowing dry air (Praxair, 99.99%, 5.0 cm3 g1 s1) and
held for 8 h and subsequently heated at 0.033 K s1 to 1123 K and
held for 12 h. The sample was cooled to ambient temperature and
then heated at 0.033 K s1 to 1173 K in flowing 50% H2/He (Praxair,
99.999%, 1.0 cm3 g1 s1) and held for 8 h. The sample was again
cooled to ambient temperature and passivated in flowing 0.5%
O2/He (Praxair, 99.99%, 1.0 cm3 g1 s1) for 3 h. The number of ex-
posed Ir atoms (Irs) was determined from volumetric uptakes of H2,
O2, and CO at 298 K [49,51] and the mean Ir cluster diameter
(<dchem>) was estimated by assuming hemispherical crystallites
and the atomic density of bulk Ir (70.7 atoms nm3) [52,53]. Ir frac-
tional dispersions from H2, O2, and CO chemisorption were 0.13,
0.15, and 0.13, respectively, the average of which indicates that
the mean diameter of the Ir clusters was 7 nm. Distribution of clus-
ter sizes was determined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) in bright-field mode (Philips, CM200F) using samples ap-
plied as a fine dust onto lacey carbon-coated Cu grids. Surface-
averaged cluster diameters were calculated using the following:
< dTEM >
P nid
3
i
P nid
2
i
1
where ni is the number of clusters with a diameter di (1029 clusters)
[54]. Values of <dTEM> (14.4 nm) and <dchem> (7 nm) indicate that
the majority of the Ir exists in aggregates of 104 atoms. We must
conclude that, in this case, distributions of detected cluster sizes
overestimate the mean cluster diameter because TEM does not de-
tect a significant numbers of small (d < 0.6 nm) clusters that are
represented in chemisorption experiments. Thus, we conclude that
the chemisorption measurements most accurately represent the
average size of the clusters, 7 nm, and the corresponding number
of Irs is used to calculate hydrogenolysis turnover rates. The Ir con-
tent was measured by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (Galbraith Laboratories, Inc.). The Supporting Informa-
tion summarizes the synthesis and characterization of the 7 nm
IrSiO2 catalyst (Table S1) and contains a representative TEM image
and cluster size distribution for the IrSiO2 catalyst (Fig. S1).
2.2. Ethane hydrogenolysis rate measurements
Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were measured in a flow packed-
bed stainless steel tubular reactor (3/800 O.D.) with plug-flow hydro-
dynamics from 553 to 663 K with ethane ((C2H6)) and hydrogen
((H2)) pressures from 10 to 80 kPa and from 0.6 to 1.8 MPa, respec-
tively. The reactor was placed within a three-zone resistively-heated
furnace, and the bed temperature was measured with a type K ther-
mocouple held within a 1/16 stainless steel sheath aligned axially
along the bed. The IrSiO2 catalyst was mixed with additional SiO2
(CabOSil HS-5, washed with deionized water and treated in flow-
ing dry air at 793 K for 5 h) to avoid any axial or radial temperature
gradients. Pressure was controlled using a dome-loaded regulator
(Mity-Mite, S91XW). The catalyst was treated in flowing H2 (Praxair,
99.999%) at ambient pressure (50 cm3 g1 s1) by heating to 673 K at
0.083 K s1 and holding for 2 h. The composition of the reactant
stream was set using electronic mass flow controllers (Parker, 201)
to meter the flow rates of H2 (Praxair, 99.999%), and ethane (5% eth-
ane, 10% Ar, 85% He, Praxair, certified-grade). CH4 and C2H6 effluent
concentrations were measured by gas chromatography (Agilent GC,
5890) using a methyl silicone capillary column (HP-1, 50 m  0.32
mm  1.05 lm) and a flame ionization detector. No other hydrocar-
bons were detected. All rates are reported at differential conversions
(<5%) to avoid consequential axial gradients in reactant concentra-
tions. Turnover rates are reported as moles of ethane consumed
per unit time normalized by the number of surface metal atoms
determined by chemisorption, and reported uncertainties represent
two-standard deviations (95% confidence intervals).
2.3. Computational methods
Periodic plane-wave DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [5558]. The plane-
waves were constructed using projector augmented-wave (PAW)
potentials with an energy cutoff of 396 eV [59,60]. The revised Per-
dewBurkeErnzerhof (RPBE) form of the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) was used to determine exchange and corre-
lation energies [6163]. Calculations of gaseous species were com-
puted using 18  18  18 Å unit cells. The catalyst surface was
modeled as a 4  4 Ir(111) closed-packed periodic lattice with a
lattice parameter of 3.84 Å; it consists of four layers in the z-direc-
tion with the bottom two layers fixed in their bulk positions and
the other two allowed to relax to their minimum energy structures.
Wavefunctions were converged to within 106 eV and forces were
computed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) grid with a cutoff of
twice the planewave cutoff and a 3  3  1 Monkhorstpack sam-
pling of the first Brillouin zone (k-point mesh) [64]. For optimiza-
tions, the structures were relaxed until the force on unconstrained
atoms was <0.05 eV/Å. After geometric convergence, a single-point
calculation with a 6  6  1 k-point mesh was performed to opti-
mize energy minima of reactant, product, and transition states.
Transition state (TS) structures were obtained for each elemen-
tary reaction by using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method
[65,66] and the dimer method [67]. The NEB method was carried
out using 16 images, and wavefunctions were converged to within
104 eV using a 3  3  1 k-point mesh and an FFT grid size of 1.5
times the planewave cutoff. The maximum force on each atom was
converged to <0.3 eV/Å. These protocols provided an estimate of
the reaction path and a starting point for the structure and the
reactive vibrational mode for each transition state. The dimer algo-
rithm was then used with wavefunctions converged to within
106 eV using a 3  3  1 k-point mesh and an FFT grid size of 2
times the planewave cutoff. For dimer calculations, the maximum
force on each atom was converged to <0.05 eV/Å. As with optimi-
zations of reactant and product states, the energy of the TS was
then
determined
using
a
single-point
calculation
with
6  6  1 k-point mesh. Zero-point energy and thermal corrections
were implemented using vibrational frequencies for reactants,
transition states and products involved in each elementary step
to estimate enthalpies and entropies of each state (details in
