Abstract
A simple scheme for the estimation of oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys is presented. It is
shown that a d-band center model of the alloy surfaces is a convenient and appropriate basis for this scheme; variations
in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects are all incorporated into the binding energy analysis through
this parameter. With few exceptions, the agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on
hundreds of binary surface alloys is remarkable. The scheme should therefore provide a fast and effective method for
the estimation of oxygen binding energies on a wide variety of transition metal alloys.

1. Introduction
The development of a detailed understanding of
the catalytic properties of transition metal alloys
generally requires the evaluation of a large number
of catalytic and structural parameters [1]. How-
ever, in many cases, simple trends in catalytic
activity can be deduced by evaluating and compar-
ing a much smaller number of parameters. For
example, it has been shown that trends in the activ-
ity of hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization cat-
alysts can be correlated to bulk energy descriptors
[2]. Jacobsen et al. [3] have demonstrated that the
relative activity of ammonia synthesis catalysts
can be understood largely by considering varia-
tions in another parameter, the binding energy of
nitrogen [3]. More recently, calculations have indi-
cated that trends in the oxygen reduction activity
of transition metal catalysts are primarily deter-
mined by changes in the oxygen binding energy [4].
Given the importance of parameters such as
binding energies in determining trends in catalytic

activities, it is imperative to have efficient means of
estimating the magnitude of these parameters for a
variety of metals and alloys. One technique for so
doing is to employ first-principles computational
techniques to evaluate the parameter values; these
approaches are ideally suited for screening large
numbers of alloys because changing the composi-
tion of an alloy requires almost no effort in an
in silico environment [5]. Experimental evaluation
of these parameters, on the other hand, would re-
quire the synthesis of large numbers of alloys, of-
ten at great cost.
Although computational screening of impor-
tant catalytic parameters might generally be ex-
pected to be more efficient than experimental
screening of such parameters, the expense associ-
ated with such calculations is still not negligible,
and it is thus desirable to have even simpler tech-
niques for evaluating the parameters. For exam-
ple, if binding energies could be estimated from
the properties of the clean alloy surfaces alone, sig-
nificant savings could be realized. If the clean alloy
properties could further be estimated by appropri-
ate averaging of the properties of the pure constit-
uent metals, then the binding energies on a huge
number of alloys could effectively be estimated
from a handful of calculations on pure metals.
The d-band theory of Hammer and Nrskov
[6,7] provides a rigorous theoretical framework
for the evaluation of adsorbate properties from
clean surface properties. In the simplest version
of that theory, binding energies and transition
state energies can be estimated from a single
clean-surface parameter, the surface d-band center
[811]. Several physical factors affect these d-band
centers, including strain, ligand, and ensemble ef-
fects [1217]. By carefully accounting for each of
these effects, it is in principle possible to estimate
the d-band center of a clean alloy surface and,
thence, to determine the properties of adsorbates
on that surface.
In this contribution, we demonstrate that the
simple approach described above is capable of
producing semi-quantitative predictions of oxygen
binding energies on a large number of binary tran-
sition metal alloys. We compare the results of the
simple model to detailed DFT calculations on hun-
dreds of alloys, and we find excellent agreement
with the detailed calculations in a significant
majority of the cases. Given the simplicity and rel-
atively high accuracy of the approach, we expect
that it will find application in a large number of
problems in which oxygen chemistry is important,
including oxygen reduction, NO reduction, CO
oxidation, SO2 oxidation, and other reactions [18].
2. Methods
The DACAPO code [19] is used for all total en-
ergy calculations in this study. A three-layer slab,
periodically repeated in a super-cell geometry with
five equivalent layers of vacuum between any two
successive metal slabs, is used. A

unit cell, corresponding to an adsorbate coverage
of 1/3 ML, is employed. For simplicity, all slabs
are constrained to an fcc crystal structure with lat-
tice constants optimized for that crystal system; this
approximation will introduce modest inaccuracies
into calculations where iron (whose natural crystal
structure is bcc) is the substrate (see description of
alloy geometries below), but we do not expect it to
affect the results for alloys with other substrates.
The slabs are kept fixed in their bulk-truncated
geometries, and the adsorbates are relaxed accord-
ing to the HellmanFeynman forces until the total
force on the oxygen atom is less than 0.75 eV/A
 .
The total energy is then further refined by using
the residual forces and estimated harmonic vibra-
tional frequencies for oxygen to extrapolate to the
bottom of a parabola in energy space; these correc-
tions typically amount to a few hundredths of an
eV. While the approximations used in these calcula-
tions may introduce errors of up to 0.15 eV into the
calculated binding energies, we expect that the
trends calculated over hundreds of pure metals
and alloys should still be quite accurate. In any case,
the main purpose of the DFT calculations is simply
to produce a database of adsorption energies to
which our model can be compared.
Adsorption is allowed on only one of the two ex-
posed surfaces of the metal slabs, and the electro-
static potential is adjusted accordingly [20]. Ionic
cores are described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials
[21], and the KohnSham one-electron valence
states are expanded in a basis of plane waves with

kinetic energy below 340 eV; a density cutoffof
500 eV is used. The surface Brillouin zone is sam-
pled with an 18

grid. In all cases, convergence of the total energy
with respect to the cutoffenergies and the k point
set is confirmed. The exchange-correlation energy
and potential are described by the generalized gra-
dient approximation (GGA-RPBE98) [19]. The
self-consistent RPBE98 density is determined by
iterative diagonalization of the KohnSham Ham-
iltonian, Fermi population of the KohnSham
states (kBT = 0.1 eV), and Pulay mixing of the
resulting electronic density [22]. All total energies
have been extrapolated to kBT = 0 eV. Spin polar-
ization effects are not included in the reported re-
sults; the omission of these effects will lead to
small overestimates of the strength of oxygen bind-
ing for alloys where naturally magnetized elements
(Ni, Co, and Fe) are present.
The binary transition metal alloys considered in
this study consist of two substrate layers and one
surface layer. These alloys are described with the
notation ABCD; in this formalism, A, B, and
C denote the elemental nature of the three atoms
in the surface layer while D indicates the identity
of the element in the substrate layer; the lattice
constant of the alloy is dictated by the lattice con-
stant of the substrate element. We do not explicitly
consider the thermodynamic stability of the sur-
face alloys in our analysis; this information, while
important for detailed analyses of specific catalytic
systems, is not relevant for the present study whose
goal is simply to establish general trends in chemi-
sorption properties on the broadest possible vari-
ety of transition metal alloys. In total, binary
combinations of 11 elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu,
Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) are considered.
However, only alloys where oxygen atoms prefer
threefold or quasi-threefold sites are included in
the final analyses. A full analysis of the informa-
tion contained in this binary alloy database will
be presented in a future publication [23].
3. Model
The fundamental parameter that we use to esti-
mate the binding energy of oxygen on pure metals
and alloys is the clean surface d-band center, ed.
This parameter has been shown to correlate well
with the adsorption and reactivity properties of
both pure transition metals and a limited group
of transition metal alloys [5,14,24,25]; herein, we
extend the range of application of this simple mod-
el by using it to predict oxygen binding energies on
a large ensemble of alloy surfaces.
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the d-
band center and the oxygen binding energy for
Rh (a) and Ag (b) overlayers on a variety of tran-
sition metal substrates (analogous data for over-
layers of all other transition metals examined in
this study, together with data for the pure transi-
tion metals, are given in Table 1). The x-axis is
the difference in ed between the overlayer and the
corresponding pure metal slab; the y-axis is the

lated with a cutoffradius of 1.0 A
 and an energy

quired to pass through the origin.
The correlation for the Rh overlayers (Fig. 1(a))
is excellent; similarly good trends are seen, with
very few exceptions, for the other non-noble (i.e.,
not Au, Ag, or Cu) metals (Table 1). These results
provide strong evidence that the surface d-band

All shifts are given with respect to the pure metal slabs corresponding to the overlayer elements. The first entry is the d-band shift, the
second entry is the DFT-calculated binding energy shift, and the third entry is the binding energy shift estimated from the simple
model. The slopes and r2 values refer to the best-fit lines for each column with the intercepts set to zero. Italicized values in the
diagonals correspond to the actual d-band centers and oxygen binding energies for the pure metals. The data for Pt on Cu and for Pd
on Cu have not been included in the corresponding best-fit lines.

center is an important parameter in describing
binding energy trends on surface alloys. However,
the correlations are not as good for overlayers
of the noble metals, as evidenced by the some-
what greater scatter in the Ag overlayer plot
(Fig. 1(b)). In addition, the slope of the best-fit line
for the Ag plot (0.41 for Ag vs. 1.34 for Rh) is
significantly smaller; similar results are found on
Cu and on Au. These considerations demonstrate
that the dependence of the oxygen binding energies
on the d-band centers is weaker for noble metals
than it is for other transition metals; this phenom-
enon is caused, in large part, by the filled d-bands
of the noble metals [6].
Given that a significant majority of pure metal
overlayers show a good correlation between oxy-
gen binding energy and d-band shifts (Fig. 1 and
Table 1), it seems that d-band-based correlations
are a reasonable starting point for the develop-
ment of an oxygen binding energy estimation
scheme (although the correlations for the noble
metals do show greater scatter than the correla-
tions for the other transitions metals, the standard
errors are still less than 0.2 eV, sufficiently good to
obtain reasonable quantitative estimates of bind-
ing energies). We now outline a procedure for
making such estimates on a variety of binary sur-
face alloys; the only restriction that we impose is
that the most favorable oxygen binding site should
be threefold or quasi-threefold (this will, indeed,
be the case for a large majority of binary transition
metal alloys).
1. For each surface metal atom that surrounds the
threefold site where oxygen is expected to
adsorb (Fig. 2), estimate the shift in ed that will
occur when the atom is moved to the alloy envi-
ronment from its corresponding pure slab. This
shift will depend on ligand and strain effects
from the substrate of the alloy, and it will also
depend on the chemical nature of the elements
surrounding the atom in the surface layer. For
our simple estimation scheme, we neglect the
latter effect, and we estimate the former from
our database of pure overlayer clean slab calcu-
lations (Table 1). We note that similar results
have been previously published [12]; differences
in the computational methods employed lead to
some differences between our numbers and the
published
results,
but
the
trends
remain
unchanged.
2. Use the appropriate linear correlations from
Table 1, combined with the ed shifts determined
in step (1), to estimate an effective oxygen bind-
ing energy for each element on the alloy surface.
3. Average the binding energies from step (2) to
arrive at an estimate of the oxygen binding
energy at a threefold site on the alloy.
We note that an alternative estimation scheme
could be easily pursued using the data in Table
1; namely, the binding energy at surface alloy
threefold sites could be directly estimated by aver-
aging the appropriate binding energies calculated
for pure metal overlayers on the substrate of inter-
est. This alternative procedure has also been found
to yield excellent results. One disadvantage of the
procedure, however, is that additional calculations
of oxygen binding energies would be required to
extend the method to other elements; only clean-
slab calculations would be required for similar
extensions with the d-band model. In any case,
since part of the goal of the present work is to eval-
uate the suitability of the d-band model for use in
estimation schemes, and since the alternative pro-
cedure is sufficiently simple to require no further
explanation, we do not discuss it in detail here.
With the d-band based approach, we have
estimated the oxygen binding energies of a large
number of binary surface alloys, and we have com-
pared the resulting estimates to our DFT calcula-

surface alloy. For both of the threefold sites, the estimated
binding energy would be determined using contributions from
two A atoms and a single B atom. The graphics were
produced with VMD [26].

tions. A parity plot of the model vs. full DFT re-
sults is shown in Fig. 3. Note that we have only
performed the indicated model-DFT comparison
for alloys that show a strong preference (0.2 eV
in the DFT calculations) for threefold sites.
4. Discussion
The parity plot in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the
oxygen binding energy estimation scheme pre-
sented above reproduces the full DFT calculations
quite well. The majority of the data points show
deviations of less than 0.2 eV from the parity line;
given the very simple techniques used for the esti-
mation, this agreement is remarkably good (we
also note that, given that DFT calculations often
have errors on the order of 0.2 eV [19], it is not
clear that further increases in the accuracy of the
model would have significant practical benefits).
The good agreement is strong evidence that the
clean surface d-band center is a parameter of con-
siderable descriptive power for the analysis of
adsorption on surface alloys.
Although the simple binding energy estimation
procedure performs very well for the large major-
ity of the alloys investigated, there are clearly some
systems for which the model fails. This failure
seems to be particularly acute for a few systems
containing either full or partial Pt, Pd, or Ir over-
layers on noble metals (particularly Cu and Ag)
and for systems containing full or partial Fe over-
layers on both noble metals (notably Ag and Au)
and Pd. In some of these cases, where noble metals
are actually present in the surface layer, the devia-
tions can be partially explained by the greater scat-
ter in the correlations between the d-band and
binding energy shifts that are typically associated
with noble metals on surfaces (see Fig. 1b and dis-
cussion above); the significant chemical dissimilar-
ities between the noble metals and other metals on
the surface may also contribute to the deviations in
these cases (see discussion below). In the cases
involving pure overlayers on Cu or Ag, the devia-
tions can be traced to the data in Table 1. Those
data demonstrate, for example, that there is a large
separation of the Pt on Cu datapoint from the
best-fit line established by the data points associ-
ated with Pt overlayers on other transition metals
(a smaller, but not negligible, deviation is seen for
the Pt on Ag and Pt on Au data points). Similar
problems are observed for Pd and Ir overlayers
on Cu substrates. These exceptions point to the
fact that ed is only the simplest parameter charac-

shape of the d-band, together with changes in the
role of s and p electrons, can also be important
in exceptional cases. We note, in passing, that
these effects are distinct from the deviations shown
in Fig. 1b; in that figure, the scatter is traced to the
presence of noble metals on the alloy surface,
while in the present case, the deviations result from
noble metals in the subsurface layers. Finally, the
scatter associated with the Fe overlayers (Fig. 3)
may be due, in part, to the neglect of magnetic ef-
fects in our analyses. Fe is a highly magnetized
metal, and certain Fe-containing systems might,
therefore, be sensitive to changes in magnetic
structure parameters. Test calculations indicate
that the decrease in the oxygen binding energy
magnitude resulting from the inclusion of mag-
netic effects is significantly larger for Fe overlayers
on Au, Ag, and Pd than it is for Fe overlayers on
most other metals; this effect probably contributes
to the deviations associated with the AuFeFeAu,
AgFeFeAg, PdFeFePd, and PdPdFePd alloys
(Fig. 3).
Additional scatter in the parity plot may result
from the approximate scheme used to estimate
the ed shifts for the atoms on the alloy surfaces.
While that scheme accounts rigorously for shifts
in ed from strain and ligand effects in the substrate,
it does not explicitly account for such changes
resulting from interaction with other elements in
the surface layer. These additional shifts might
lead to some inaccuracies for alloys with non-uni-
form surface layers.
5. Conclusion
A simple scheme for the estimation of the
binding energy of oxygen at threefold sites on
transition metal surface alloys is presented. The
scheme incorporates the effect of changes in chem-
ical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects
into the binding energy analysis through a single
parameter, the surface d-band center. With few
exceptions, the agreement of the results from the
simple model with full DFT calculations on a large
number of binary alloys is remarkably good. This
agreement supports the notion that the d-band
center is a parameter of considerable descriptive
power for a broad range of alloy systems. Further,
the scheme is sufficiently accurate that it should
provide a simple, fast, and reliable method for
the estimation of oxygen binding energies on a
wide variety of transition metal surface alloys.
The method could, therefore, be useful in screen-
ing such alloys for desirable catalytic properties.
