Efforts to replace noble-metal catalysts by low-cost alternatives are of constant interest. The
organometallic, non-aqueous wet-chemical synthesis of various hitherto unknown nanocrystalline Ni/Ga
intermetallic materials and the use of NiGa for the selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes are
reported. Thermal co-hydrogenolysis of the all-hydrocarbon precursors [Ni(COD)2] (COD  1,5-
cyclooctadiene) and GaCp* (Cp*  pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) in high-boiling organic solvents
mesitylene and n-decane in molar ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 3 and 3 : 1 yields the nano-crystalline powder
materials of the over-all compositions NiGa, Ni2Ga3 and Ni3Ga, respectively. Microwave induced co-
pyrolysis of the same precursors without additional hydrogen in the ionic liquid [BMIm][BF4] (BMIm  1-
butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium) selectively yields the intermetallic phases NiGa and Ni3Ga from the
respective 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 molar ratios of the precursors. The obtained materials are characterized by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), IR, powder X-ray
diffraction
(PXRD)
and
atomic
absorption
spectroscopy
(AAS).
The
single-source
precursor
[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] with a fixed Ni : Ga stoichiometry of 1 : 1 was employed as well. In comparison with
the co-hydrogenolytic dual precursor source approach it turned out to be less practical due to
inefficient nickel incorporation caused by the parasitic formation of stable [Ni(PMe3)4]. The use of ionic
liquid [BMIm][BF4] as a non-conventional solvent to control the reaction and stabilize the nanoparticles
proved to be particularly advantageous and stable colloids of the nanoalloys NiGa and Ni3Ga were
obtained. A phase-selective Ni/Ga colloid synthesis in conventional solvents and in the presence of
surfactants such as hexadecylamine (HDA) was not feasible due to the undesired reactivity of HDA with
GaCp*
leading
to
inefficient
gallium
incorporation.

semihydrogenate 1-octyne and diphenylacetylene (tolan) to 1-octene and diphenylethylene, respectively,
with a yield of about 90% and selectivities of up to 94 and 87%. Ni-NPs yield alkanes with a selectivity of
97 or 78%, respectively, under the same conditions.
Introduction
The properties of metals can be fine-tuned by alloying.1,2
Bimetallic nanoalloys are particularly interesting for applica-
tions in colloidal and heterogeneous catalysis.24 Bottom-up
synthesis of such nanoalloys by so, wet-chemical methods is of
particular relevance in this respect.57 Most studies on bime-
tallic systems are focussed on combinations of transition
metals, typically involving noble metals which can easily be
obtained by reduction from salt-like molecular precursors. Far
less results are published on nanoalloys with electropositive Zn,
Al, or Ga as components.2,3 For example, Armbr
uster et al.
described the promising properties of PdGa, Pd2Ga, Pd3Ga7
(ref. 8) and Fe4Al13 (ref. 9) for alkyne semihydrogenation to
alkenes instead of alkanes. Bridier et al. reported ternary

CuNiFe catalysts for semihydrogenation of propyne to pro-
pene with near 100% selectivity.10 Selective (semi-)hydrogena-
tion of alkynes to alkenes is of industrial and scientific interest,
e.g., to remove catalyst-poisoning acetylene traces from ethylene
feeds.11 Heterogeneous colloidal semihydrogenation catalysts
typically contain noble metals12 such as Pd,13,14 Pt,15 Ru,16 Rh17
and Au.18 The usually high selectivity of semihydrogenation is
still not understood completely,13 but it is clear that total
hydrogenation
requires
larger
active
sites
than
semi-
hydrogenation19 according to the site-isolation concept.20 Hence
a careful and perhaps fortuitous catalyst design involving
alloying, PdC-phase formation,21 and addition of promoters is
necessary to achieve the desired semihydrogenation selectivity
of the noble metal nano-catalysts together with high activity and
catalyst stability. Compared to these established catalysts it
seems that the Hume-Rothery type intermetallic compounds of
type B metals (i.e. groups 2, 12 and 13) with low-cost transition
metals are very promising novel materials in place of expensive
noble-metal catalysts.
Previously
we
reported
a
non-aqueous
organometallic
synthesis of nano-brass (a/b-CuZn, g-Cu3Zn) by the co-hydro-
genolysis of [CpCu(PMe3)] and [ZnCp*2] (Cp*  pentam-
ethylcyclopentadienyl) or the co-decomposition of Cu- and Zn-
amidinates {[Me(C(NiPr)2)]Cu}2 and [Me(C(NiPr)2)]2Zn as metal
sources. This synthesis concept was used to prepare Cu/ZnO
colloidal catalysts for methanol synthesis from CO/CO2/H2.22,23
Our investigations of the related group-13 organometallic
precursor chemistry showed that the low-valent [(AlCp*)4] and
the related GaCp* are valuable sources to obtain the interme-
tallic Hume-Rothery type nanoalloys of Co/Al, Ni/Al and Cu/Al
by co-hydrogenolysis of the corresponding transition metal
precursors.24 Sochemical synthesis in organic solvents from
organometallic complexes is a means of access to chemical
nanometallurgy and allows preparation of metals and alloys in
the nanometer scale regime.5,6
Herein we present our results on the corresponding so, wet-
chemical synthesis of, to the best of our knowledge, hitherto
unknown Ni/Ga nanoalloys using the individual metal-olefin
precursors, [Ni(COD)2] (COD  1,5-cyclooctadiene) and GaCp*
in appropriate ratios. We have also explored the hydrogenolysis
of two single-source precursors with fixed Ni : Ga stoichiometry,
[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] and [Ni(GaCp*)3(PCy3)]. In addition we
compared this hydrogenolytic Ni/Ga nanoalloy synthesis in
conventional
organic
solvents
(e.g.
mesitylene)
with
the
synthesis in ionic liquids (ILs) using the same precursors, but
without the need for additional hydrogen. ILs are well known
for their unique properties for reaction control and for inherent
stabilization of metal nanoparticles25 which were prepared from
metal salts,2629 organometallic metal complexes30,31 and metal
carbonyls.32,33
Nickelgallium intermetallics
Group-13 metals (Al, Ga and In) readily form a number of
different intermetallic compounds with nickel.34 In the NiGa
system nine phases were characterized, Ni3Ga, Ni5Ga3, Ni3Ga2
(HT), Ni3Ga2 (LT), NiGa, Ni3Ga4, Ni2Ga3, Ni3Ga7 and NiGa5
(the latter two were previously believed to be NiGa4) (Fig. S1 in
the ESI).35 The NiGa phase melts congruently at 1220 C.33 The
ternary phase NiMgGa is of interest as a ferromagnetic shape-
memory alloy also in nanoparticular form.36 In general, nickel
gallium intermetallic phases and compounds are typically
prepared by metallurgical processes, such as arc-melting fol-
lowed by annealing at high temperatures for several weeks.
Individual metals of high purity or the corresponding reducable
metal salts serve as metal sources.37 However, these procedures
and precursors are neither suited for obtaining nanoalloy
particles with much size control nor for free-standing (i.e. not
agglomerated) nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents
(i.e. nanoalloy colloids).6,38
Therefore, we compare here the synthesis of NixGay nano-
alloy particles from organometallic precursors [Ni(COD)2] and
GaCp* or the single-source precursor [Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] under
different conditions. The phase NiGa is shown to be an effective
catalyst for the semihydrogenation of alkynes.
Results and discussion
1.
Nanocrystalline NiGa, Ni2Ga3 and Ni3Ga powder samples
by co-hydrogenolysis of [Ni(COD)2] and GaCp* in mesitylene
Co-hydrogenolysis of GaCp* and [Ni(COD)2] in various molar
ratios in mesitylene under 4 bar H2 pressure at 150 C in the
absence of any additional surfactants leads to immediate
formation of a dark-red to brown solution.
The color gradually darkens and finally a black precipitate
with a colorless (NP1 and NP3) or brown (NP2) supernatant is
formed (Scheme 1). The obtained insoluble products were
characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),
bright-field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM), high-
resolution TEM (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) aer diges-
tion of a fraction of the respective sample. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proves the absence of any stabi-
lizing organic moieties or hydrocarbon impurities. The PXRD
patterns (Fig. 1) provide evidence for the formation of NiGa
(NP1), Ni2Ga3 (NP2) and Ni3Ga (NP3) which match the
employed stoichiometric ratios of the reactants (Scheme 1).
High resolution TEM images of all three samples (Fig. 1)
confirm that the obtained materials are indeed nano-crystal-
line. NP1 and NP3 were proven to be NiGa and Ni3Ga by
indexing Fourier analyses of HR-TEM images of the corre-
sponding samples (Fast Fourier Transformation, FFT, images of
NP1 and NP3 in Fig. 1b are shown directly below in Fig. 1c). A
high degree of agglomeration is observed, due to the absence of

any agents that could stabilize individual nanoparticles and
their inherent superparamagnetic properties. EDX analyses (up
to 4% rel. error) of different agglomerates of NP1 and NP3
confirm the formation of rather pure NiGa and Ni3Ga. NP2 was
found to be rather impure Ni2Ga3. Although the PXRD (Fig. 1)
shows only reections of the Ni2Ga3 phase, EDX spectra of
different agglomerates of NP2 yield different Ni/Ga ratios
(Table S1 and Fig. S3S5 in the ESI). According to AAS reference
data, the Ni and Ga molar ratios of the bulk samples are rather
close to the expected values from TEM-EDX and correspond to
the analytical compositions Ni1Ga1.07 (NP1), Ni2Ga3.08 (NP2) and
Ni2.79Ga (NP3). If the overall composition derived from AAS is
compared to the composition of individual agglomerated
nanoparticles derived by EDX it is apparent that there are
impurities of amorphous or hardly crystalline Ni and Ga in NP2.
Notably, a reproducible shito somewhat larger values of 2q in
the powder XRD pattern of NP1 (assigned to the NiGa phase),
suggesting significant contraction of the lattice parameters, is
observed (Fig. 1). Such shis in PXRD patterns are not
uncommon for nanoparticles. A number of effects can be
considered including a wide range of stoichiometric composi-
tions, partly inhomogeneous element distribution, defects such
as stacking and twin faults and nanosized crystalline domains
being much smaller than the bulk reference material causing
lattice contraction or expansion and strain.39
However, the shis in the reections for NP1 are too high to
be caused by a mere size effect of the crystalline domains. For
NP2 EDX shows a rather impure sample (see above). For NP3 the
width of the reections is unreasonably large to be caused by
small crystallites. Because of this and the high degree of
agglomeration in the TEM images we conclude that calculation
of the particle sizes for NP13 from the PXRD patterns is not
reasonable and will therefore not be presented here.

Hydrogenolysis of [Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3]
A series of complexes [Ni(GaCp*)x(PMe3)4x] (x  1, 2) can be
synthesized from [Ni(COD)2], GaCp* and PMe3 in the appro-
priate
stoichiometric
ratios.40,41
The
Ni1Ga1
complex
[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] was chosen as a representative example in
order to probe the validity of the single-source precursor (SSP)
decomposition concept to accomplish the selective formation of
the corresponding NixGay phases (Scheme 2) and to compare
this concept with the dual-source pathway (vide supra).
A yellow solution of [Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] in n-decane was set
under 4 bar H2 pressure and heated to 185 C for 60 h (Scheme
2; analytical data in the ESI). The color of the solution gradu-
ally turns dark brown and the formation of a dark precipitate
(NP4) is observed. The PXRD of NP4 is in accordance with the
pattern reported for the Ni2Ga3 phase and that observed for NP2
(Fig. S10 in the ESI). Aer annealing of the sample (20 h at
300 C under a dynamic vacuum of 103 mbar) the reections
become sharper, but no phase transformation is observed.
The bright-field TEM images for NP4 (Fig. S8 in the ESI)
show smaller particles (520 nm) as well as huge agglomerates

and 103856 (Ni3Ga).

(up to several mm). The EDX data reveal substantial composi-
tional variations with Ni : Ga ratios ranging between 1 : 1 to
1 : 2 (10% rel. error) and point to the presence of amorphous
impurities (Fig. S9). The data were taken from larger areas of
the sample, i.e. multiple particles. The AAS data agree with an
overall ratio of 2 : 3 (i.e. Ni2Ga2.93) which matches with the
expectation from the PXRD pattern (vide supra). The only crys-
talline phase present was identified as Ni2Ga3 (Fig. S10 in the
ESI) which proves that the impurities are amorphous. Inter-
estingly, the observed Ni : Ga ratio is poor in nickel with respect
to the precisely defined 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the single-source
precursor starting material. The missing nickel forms [Ni(PR3)4]
as it was proven by a 31P{1H}-NMR spectrum of the supernatant
solution aer the decomposition reaction. The spectrum shows
one intense singlet peak at 21.78 ppm, which neither corre-
sponds to free PMe3 (63.3 ppm) nor to the starting material
(5.6 ppm).40 In fact, the observed chemical shiis very close to
the one reported for the homoleptic PMe3 complex of nickel,
namely [Ni(PR3)4] (22.2 ppm).41 This latter complex is
surprisingly stable to hydrogenolysis under the applied condi-
tions. It is noteworthy that the same effect occurs if a SSP with a
sterically more demanding phosphine, i.e., [Ni(GaCp*)3(PCy3)]
is used (see Scheme S1, Fig. S11 and S12 in the ESI for further
information). Thus Ni/Ga SSPs should not contain phosphine
ligands. However, a selective synthesis of suitable SSPs of the
general formula [Nia(GaCp*)bLc] with a/b  1, 2/3 or 3 and L
being a more innocent ligand, which does not form stable
nickel complexes as side products during hydrogenolysis, is still
to be accomplished.

Colloidal Ni/Ga nanoalloy particles in mesitylene or n-
decane
Based on the results of the above discussed co-hydrogenolysis of
[Ni(COD)2] and GaCp* which led to nanocrystalline powder
samples of rather controlled Ni/Ga phase compositions the
same dual source precursor chemistry was employed to obtain
colloidal solutions of the respective Ni/Ga nanoalloy particles.
However, the organic reaction medium mesitylene or n-decane,
respectively, did not prevent particle agglomeration. Therefore
hexadecylamine (HDA) was chosen as an additive (surfactant).
HDA is well known for reversible surface capping of metal and
metal alloy nanoparticles and leads to the formation of rather
stable colloidal solutions of non-agglomerated HDA-stabilized
nanoparticles as it did here for the respective Ni/Ga nanoalloys.
Notably,
co-hydrogenolysis
using
dodecanethiol
or
poly-
phenylene oxide (PPO), i.e., poly(oxy-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenyl-
ene), instead of HDA did not yield colloids, but black
amorphous precipitates, which were not analyzed further. The
as-synthesized HDA-stabilized particles were precipitated by
addition of acetonitrile and were purified by washing with
acetonitrile. The obtained samples NP57 were characterized by
the same techniques as NP1NP4. BF-TEM images of NP57
(Fig. 2) show individual particles of 5.0 nm (1.3 nm standard
deviation).
EDX measurements of NP57 (Fig. S13a, S14 and S15a in the
ESI) indicate the formation of Ga-deficient materials with
respect to the molar ratio of the precursors and the desired
stoichiometry of the intermetallic phase. Thus, NP5 (targeting
NiGa) shows a Ni : Ga ratio between 1 : 0.54 and 1 : 0.73, NP6
(targeting Ni2Ga3) shows a Ni : Ga ratio between 2 : 2.44 and
2 : 2.83 and NP7 (targeting Ni3Ga) shows a Ni : Ga ratio between
3 : 0.52 and 3 : 0.61 (Table S2a). X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) analysis of three different regions of two samples
of NP5 (targeting NiGa) gave Ni : Ga ratios between 1 : 0.68 and
1 : 0.91 and of NP7 (targeting Ni3Ga) gave Ni : Ga ratios between
3 : 0.39 and 3 : 0.78 (Fig. S13b, S15b and Table S2b in the ESI).
Hydrogenation
of
the
single-source
precursor
[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] in n-decane in the presence of HDA as a
stabilizer results in colloidal NiGa particles NP8. According to
EDX (Fig. S16 and Table S2a in the ESI), the particles exhibit
various compositions ranging from 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 1.77 and,
hence, are not phase pure. A BF-TEM image (Fig. 2) shows
particle sizes of 13 nm (5 nm standard deviation).
Probably excess HDA reduces the amount of gallium in the
resulting intermetallic Ni/Ga particles. It might form stable,
soluble Ga(III) amino/amido/imido complexes or clusters by
protolytic cleavage of Cp*H. At present, an analysis of the
supernatant solutions aer precipitation of the particles NP57
by mass spectrometry and 1H-NMR spectroscopy did not yield
conclusive results. We did not study the phenomenon in great
detail, because of the presented results in the next section.
According to BF-TEM images and EDX or XPS spectra all Ni/
Ga materials synthesized in conventional solvents were either

Free-standing NiGa and Ni3Ga nanoalloy particles
obtained from [Ni(COD)2] and GaCp* in the ionic liquid
[BMIm][BF4]
Ionic liquids (ILs) are unique alternatives to conventional
aqueous or organic solvents42 and have been introduced to
materials chemistry in particular over the last few years.43,44
Using ILs for the bottom-up wet-chemical preparation of
advanced functional materials, including metal nanoparticles,
has been shown to be very promising.4549 The excellent solva-
tion properties, high thermal stability, negligible vapor pres-
sure,
high
ionic
conductivity,
and
a
broad
liquid-state
temperature
range
combined
with
the
concomitant
ion-
othermal synthesis method constitute particular advantages of
ILs.50,51 Microwave (MW) induced thermal decomposition of
organometallic compounds in ILs is a rapid and energy-saving
means of access to metal nanoparticles because of the signifi-
cant absorption efficiency of ILs of microwave energy due to
their
ionic
character,
high
polarity,
and
high
dielectric
constant.52 In contrast to conductive heating, microwave radi-
ation directly heats the reaction mixture and not primarily the
vessel, i.e., it is the reaction mixture which absorbs the micro-
wave energy. This leads to localized superheating, very fast and
efficient heating rates. The temperature of 200 C is reached
within seconds.5356 As soon as metal particles form from the
thermally decomposed molecular precursors, they can absorb
the MW radiation as well which leads to effective growth and
annealing.
With these considerations in mind we investigated MW
assisted co-pyrolysis of [Ni(COD)2] and GaCp* in 1 : 1 and 3 : 1
molar ratios in dried, deoxygenated [BMIm][BF4] without addi-
tional reduction by hydrogen. Quantitative decomposition of
the precursors was achieved aer only 10 minutes using a low
power of 50 W at 220 C in a nitrogen atmosphere (Scheme 3),
which was verified by the complete absence of the characteristic
[Ni(COD)2] peaks and the presence of the expected peaks of free
COD in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S17 in the ESI). Black
colloidal solutions of 0.5 wt% of metal content were obtained.
The respective samples are denoted as NP1-IL and NP3-IL. High-
angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) yields
characteristic diameters between 7 and 29 nm (average 14  5
nm) for NP1-IL and between 12 and 19 nm (average 17  4 nm)
for NP3-IL (Fig. 3 and 4).
In comparison to the agglomerated, nanocrystalline powder
samples NP1 and NP3 obtained by co-hydrogenolysis from
mesitylene, co-pyrolysis in an IL resulted in non-agglomerated
nanoparticles. The Ni/GaIL dispersions are stable. Even aer
two weeks the NPs did not agglomerate, as it was shown by
HAADF-STEM measurements carried out aer this time.
Nanoparticles of NP1-IL were precipitated from the IL solu-
tions by addition of a sufficient amount of acetone and char-
acterized by PXRD providing evidence for NiGa as the single
crystalline component. The slightly broadened reections
suggest crystallite domain sizes of 21 (4 nm standard devia-
tion) as calculated with the Scherrer equation.57 It is noteworthy
that the peaks in the PXRD of NP1-IL (Fig. 3) do not exhibit a

significant shiin 2q in comparison with the NiGa reference
peaks, which was the case in the PXRD of NP1 (Fig. 2). Inter-
estingly, the pyrolysis and decomposition of both organome-
tallic
precursors
occurred
without
hydrogenolysis
by
dihydrogen. This is somewhat surprising because of the quite
robust nature of GaCp*. In conventional solvents GaCp* is
thermally stable up to 300 C (in the absence of hydrogen).58
However, the reactivity of the imidazolium component of ILs
with reactive metal centers has to be considered. It has been
shown that in the course of metal nanoparticle formation from
organometallic precursors in ILs, CH/D activation/exchange
processes may take place at molecular metal centers as well as at
the surface of metal nanoparticles. Thus, nitrogen heterocyclic
carbene species (NHCs) formed by decomposition of ILs may
contribute to the stabilization of metal clusters and nano-
particles.59 Hence, cooperative mechanisms involving H-trans-
fer from the transition metal (i.e. Ni) to Ga and then the release
of Cp*H need to be taken into account, even in the absence of
additional hydrogen.60
The EDX spectra of NP3-IL for a single nanoparticle at
different points as well as the average composition of 7090
particles (Fig. 4 and 5) agree on a homogeneous phase of the
composition Ni3Ga. Fig. 4 illustrates EDX spectra at three (P1 to
P3) out of six measured points (Fig. S18) with 1 nm2 resolution
across a single nanoparticle with Ni 71  5%; Ga 29  5%
(Ni : Ga z 3 : 1) (larger instrumental errors due to a very small
scan area).
Bimetallic nanoparticles can be differentiated into core
shell and alloy structures.61 The formation of either structure
depends on kinetic inuences during metal reduction and
nanoparticle growth processes as well as electron transfer
processes between the metal species. For nano-alloy formation
both metal precursor species must be reduced at the same rate
and quantitatively. An inter-metal electron transfer of the type
M(1)+ + M(2) / M(1) + M(2)+ must be much slower to avoid
metal segregation within a nano-cluster. The metal ratio of the
formed alloy then corresponds to those of the precursors for
quantitative reduction. The initial reduction according to e +
M+ / M followed by metal aggregation M(1) + M(2) / {M(1)
M(2)} gives bimetallic nano-alloys.61

Catalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes with NiGa
The semihydrogenation of a CC triple bond to a C]C double
bond is an important reaction in industrial and synthetic
organic chemistry. Supported and modified noble (expensive)
metal nanoparticles can be used in heterogeneous catalytic
hydrogenation to prevent over-reduction to alkanes and to
increase the stability of the catalyst.8,1318 Only a few reports were
published on noble-metal-free heterogenous catalysts for alkyne
semihydrogenation. These include nickel nanoparticles for the
highly
stereoselective
cis
semihydrogenation
of
internal
alkynes62 and Cu3Fe and Cu2.75Ni0.25Fe for the gas-phase semi-
hydrogenation of propyne to propene.9
We have tested Ni-NPs (from Ni(COD)2) and NiGa-NPs both
in [BMIm][BF4] under organic-solvent-free conditions for the
(semi-)hydrogenation of 1-octyne (Scheme 4) and diphenylace-
tylene (Scheme 5).

Ni-NPs (median diameter 18  6 nm, see Scheme S1,
Fig. S19, S20 and Table S3 in the ESI) showed high conversion
rates for the total hydrogenation of the triple bond and selec-
tivity to octane (97%) or diphenylethane (78%). On the other
hand NiGa-NPs from NP1-IL yielded primarily 1-octene or
diphenylethylene
with
94%
or
up
to
87%
selectivity,
respectively.
The NiGa catalyst can easily be recovered aer product
removal and re-used again with fresh substrate. The semi-
hydrogenation of 1-octyne could be run four times with the
same catalyst charge and little loss of conversion or selectivity
(Table 1).
Aer catalysis the NiGa nanoalloy particles have increased in
size to 68 (10) nm but are still separate nanoparticles (Fig. 6).
PXRD confirms the unchanged presence of a crystalline NiGa
phase in [BMIm][BF4] aer catalysis (Fig. 6).
Conclusions
We have investigated the sowet-chemical preparation of
nanocrystalline Ni/Ga alloy materials NiGa, Ni2Ga3, and Ni3Ga
in non-aqueous media. The dual source precursor concept
based on the organometallic precursors [Ni(COD)2] and GaCp*
proved to be successful, while single-source precursors such as
[Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3] did not yield the expected Ni/Ga phase due
to the formation of stable [Ni(PMe3)4] as a side product. Co-
hydrogenolysis in the conventional organic solvent mesitylene
turned out to be less reliable and selective in terms of yielding
specific NixGay phases than the co-pyrolysis conducted in the
ionic liquid (IL) under microwave heating and in the absence of
hydrogen. In particular, the reaction control and intrinsic
particle stabilizing properties of ILs turned out to be advanta-
geous,

homogeneous composition and high crystallinity are the
desired products. Very stable colloids of nanocrystalline NiGa
and Ni3Ga particles in the ionic liquid [BMIm][BF4] were
obtained. In contrast, in the case of co-hydrogenolytic prepa-
ration of the respective Ni/Ga colloids in conventional organic
media, hexadecylamine (HDA) was needed as a surfactant
additive. HDA turned out to be incompatible with the chemistry
of GaCp* and caused undesired loss of the gallium component.
Thus, the advantage of the ionic liquid as the reaction medium
for nanoalloy synthesis is based on three aspects: (i) the non-
necessity of H2 and (ii) no additional surfactant is needed and
(iii) the shorter reaction time (10 min versus several hours) with
less energy consumed (50 W microwave energy focused on the
sample versus several hundred Watts to heat an oil bath with a
sample tube to 150 C). From the precursor chemistry point of
view the most attractive aspect might be the possible involve-
ment of imidazolium CH activation and the formation of
nitrogen heterocyclic carbene species in the course of the
decomposition mechanism of the organogroup-13 precursor
GaCp*. This aspect needs further investigations.
The synthesis of intermetallic NixGay nanoparticles is a
proof-of-concept for the easy and straightforward formation of
nanoalloys from organometallic precursors in ILs. The catalytic
NiGa semihydrogenation properties are further evidence that
intermetallic Hume-Rothery phases of a metal from CrNi and a
metal from groups 1215 can mimic and replace costly noble
metal catalysts. Hume-Rothery type nanoalloys of Co/Al, Ni/Al
and Cu/Al were already obtained by one of us by co-hydro-
genolysis of the corresponding transition metal precursors.22
The goal would be to obtain Fe/Al nanoalloys either from
separate Fe and Al precursors or from FeAl mixed-metal clus-
ters, such as [Fe(AlCp*)5].63
Experimental section
All experimental manipulations were performed under a puri-
fied inert nitrogen or argon atmosphere by using standard
Schlenk line and glove-box techniques. Syntheses of NP1NP8
were carried out in 100 mL Fischer-Porter vessels. Syntheses of
NP1-IL and NP3-IL were done in septum-sealed 10 mL CEM
microwave-vessels in a CEM Discover microwave.
The solvents (acetone, acetonitrile, n-hexane, toluene, tetra-
hydrofuran) were dried using the MBraun solvent purification
system. Mesitylene and n-decane were dried by passing the
solvent over activated Al2O3 (neutral) column. The final H2O
content was controlled by Karl Fischer titration. The metal
precursors Ni(COD)2,64 GaCp*,65 and [Ni(GaCp*)(PMe3)3]38 were
prepared according to the previously reported procedures under
strictly inert dry argon conditions. Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phen-
ylene oxide) (PPO), hexadecylamine (HDA) and dodecanethiol
were purchased from Acros Organics. HDA was dried and
degassed prior to use.
The ionic liquid [BMIm][BF4] was synthesized by reacting 1-
methylimidazole with 1-chlorobutane to yield first [BMIm][Cl]
which was further reacted with HBF4 to give [BMIm][BF4]. The
IL was dried under high vacuum (107 mbar) at 80 C for several
days. Quantitative anion exchange and, thus, IL purity of >99%
was assessed by ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-1100, with
IonPac AS14, 4  250 mm column). Water content measured
by coulometric Karl Fischer titration (ECH/ANALYTIK JENA
AQUA 40.00) was below 10 ppm.
Analytical techniques and instrumentation
Metal analysis was conducted at the laboratory of microanalysis
of the Ruhr University Bochum (CHNSO: Vario EL by Elementar
Hanau). AAS analysis for the metal content of Ga and Ni was
undertaken using a Vario 6 AAS instrument from Analytik Jena.
The samples were dissolved in aqua regia or HCl and H2SO4.
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DPX-250 spec-
trometer (1H, 250 MHz; 13C, 62.9 MHZ; 31P, 101.3 MHz) at 298 K
in C6D6 and toluene-d8 and the chemical shis are referenced to
the residual solvent peaks.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data for the NP1NP8
samples were measured on a D8-Advance-Bruker-AXS-diffrac-
tometer (Cu-Ka-radiation, 1.54178 
A, scan step 0.0141 2q,
heating current 30 mA) in BraggBrentano q2q-geometry, using
a G
obel mirror as a monochromator and a position sensitive
detector. The powder samples were prepared under argon using
Lindeman capillaries (diameter 0.5, 0.7 or 1.0 mm). The capil-
laries were ame-sealed prior to measurements. The detector
was
calibrated
to
the
reections
of
crystalline
a-Al2O3.
Measurements were done to collect the 2q range of 1090.
PXRD data for NP1-IL and NP3-IL samples were measured at
ambient temperature on a Bruker D2 Phaser using a at sample
holder and Cu-Ka radiation (l  1.54182 
A). Samples had been
precipitated with acetone from the NP/IL dispersion and
washed with acetonitrile.
TEM samples of NP1NP8 were prepared as diluted solu-
tions or suspensions in toluene and deposited on carbon
coated
copper
grids.
Bright-field
transmission
electron
microscopy (BF-TEM) images were acquired on a Philips CM30
equipped with a Schottky field emission gun (FEG) operating
at 300 kV. BF-TEM together with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) were carried out using a Philips CM20
microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament operating at 200 kV
acceleration voltage and a Hitachi H-8100 microscope equip-
ped with a LaB6 filament operating at 200 kV acceleration
voltage. BF-TEM, HR-TEM images, and EDX were acquired on
a Tecnai FEI G2 microscope equipped with a FEG operating at
200 kV.
HAADF-STEM images of NP-IL samples were taken at room
temperature using a Tecnai FEI G20 TEM equipped with a FEG
operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Samples were
deposited on 200 mm carbon-coated gold grids. The size distri-
bution was calculated from a manual diameter determination
over a minimum of 50 isolated particles.
All EDX spectra acquired in STEM mode were averaged scans
over selected areas of 100  100 nm2. The EDX spectra of an
isolated particle from NP3-IL were measured at several points
with a spatial resolution of 1 nm2 (acquisition time of 30 s at
each point). Thereby the instrumental errors of this high-reso-
lution EDX scan led to an estimated standard deviation of 10
15% rel. error.

XPS-(ESCA),
measurement was performed with a Fisons/VG Scientific
ESCALAB 200X XP-spectrometer, operating at room tempera-
ture, at a pressure of 1.0  108 bar and a sample angle of 30.
Using this spectrometer, electron spectra were recorded using
polychromatic Al-Ka excitation (14 kV, 20 mA) and an emission
angle of 0. Calibration of the XPS was carried out by recording
spectra, using Al-Kalpha X-rays, from clean samples of copper,
silver and gold, at 20 eV and 10 eV pass energies and compar-
ison with reference values.
GC/MS data were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ.
Preparation of sample NP1 (NiGa)
In a Fischer-Porter vessel, 0.400 g of [Ni(COD)2] (1.454 mmol)
and 0.296 g of GaCp* (1.450 mmol) were dissolved in mesitylene
(15 mL). The resultant yellow-orange solution was degassed for
5 min and set to 4 bar H2 pressure. The bottle was then placed
into an oil bath at 150 C. Aer 10 min of heating the solution
became dark red, and slowly changed to dark brown aer 20
min with the formation of a black precipitate. The mixture was
stirred for 3 h at the same temperature, where upon the solution
became colorless with a black precipitate. Aer cooling to room
temperature (25 C), the colorless supernatant was decanted
under argon and the black material was washed several times

in mesitylene (20 mL). The resultant yellow reaction mixture
was degassed for 10 min at room temperature, set to 4 bar H2
pressure and the Fischer-Porter vessel placed in an oil bath at
150 C. Aer 5 min, the color of the reaction mixture changed to
dark-brown, then aer 15 min formation of a black precipitate
was observed. The mixture was stirred for 6 h, where upon the
solution became colorless. Aer cooling to room temperature
the colorless supernatant was decanted under an argon atmo-
sphere and the black material was washed several times with
toluene (6  10 mL), followed by n-hexane (4  10 mL). There-

with 4 bar H2 and placed into an oil bath which was pre-heated
to 185 C. Aer 30 min of stirring at this temperature the colour
of the solution changed to dark brown with slow formation of a
black/brown precipitate. This mixture was further heated for
60 h. Aer cooling to room temperature, the suspension was
transferred into a Schlenk tube and centrifuged to separate the
black precipitate, which was then washed with n-hexane (5

Co-decomposition of [Ni(COD)2] (13.3 mg, 0.048 mmol) and
GaCp* (9.9 mg, 0.048 mmol) by means of microwave irradiation
was carried out under nitrogen. In a typical reaction, the

[BMIm][BF4] (1 mL, density [BMIm][BF4]: 1.21 g mL1, 1.21 g)
for a 0.5 wt% M-NP/[BMIm][BF4] dispersion. For the synthesis,
the mixture was placed in a microwave (CEM, Discover) under
an inert nitrogen atmosphere and the conversion was finished
within 10 min at a power of 50 W and a temperature of 220 C.
Each decomposition reaction was carried out at least twice. XRD
reections (2q/): 31.4, 44.9, 55.9, 65.5, 74.6 and 83.3. EDX

uchi stainless-steel autoclave with a glass inlet was charged
with 0.1 g of a freshly synthesized NiGa/[BMIm][BF4] or Ni/
[BMIm][BF4] dispersion (0.5 wt% in total metal, 85 mmol Ni or
39 mmol NiGa). 2 g of degassed, dry substrate 1-octyne (2.5 mL,
18.1 mmol) or phenylacetylene (tolan, 11.2 mmol) was added.
For 1-octyne the NiGa : substrate ratio was 1 : 464 or Ni : sub-
strate ratio  1 : 212; NiGa : tolan  1 : 287, Ni : tolan  1 : 131.
The reaction mixture was heated to 120 C. Aer reaching the
reaction temperature the autoclave was pressurized with H2 to 5
bar (B
uchi press ow gas controller, bpc) which was kept
constant by the B
uchi bpc. Aer the chosen time (3 h) the
reaction was stopped, cooled down and a 0.5 g sample was
analyzed for its content by GC/MS and NMR. Conversion and
selectivity were determined by GC/MS (Tables S5 and S6 in the
ESI) [retention times: 1.51 (1-octene), 1.67 (octane), 1.87
(1-octyne), Shimadzu GC2014, column Ultra2, crosslinked 5%
PhMe silicone, 25 m  0.2 mm  11 mm]. A 1H NMR spectrum
was recorded by dissolving 0.1 mL of the sample in 0.65 mL
deuterated chloroform (see Fig. S21 in the ESI).

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
