Ethane hydrogenolysis involves C–C bond rupture in unsaturated species in quasi-equilibrium with gas-
eous reactants and H2 on metal clusters, because C–C bonds weaken as C-atoms replace hydrogen with
exposed metal atoms from catalyst surfaces. The nature and reactivity of such adsorbed species are
probed here using kinetic data and density functional theory (DFT) for the case of Ir surfaces, but with
conclusions that appear to be general to hydrogenolysis on noble metals. On surfaces saturated with
chemisorbed H-atoms (H), theory and experiments indicate that C–C cleavage occurs predominantly
via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane; all other
intermediates cleave C–C bonds at much lower rates (>107-fold). Measured activation energies
(213 kJ mol1) and free energies (130 kJ mol1) reﬂect the combined values for quasi-equilibrated steps
that desorb H, adsorb C2H6, form C2-intermediates by dehydrogenation, and form the transition state
from CHCH species. DFT-derived activation energies (218 kJ mol1) and free energies estimated from
these values and statistical mechanics treatments of reaction and activation entropies (137 kJ mol1)
are in excellent agreement with measured values. The removal of four H-atoms in forming the
kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on
hydrogenolysis rates, show that 2–3 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition
state, as expected from the structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries
on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal
clusters. Theory and experiments combine here to provide mechanistic insights inaccessible to direct
observation and provide compelling evidence for reaction pathways long considered to be plausible for
hydrogenolysis on noble metals. The extent of unsaturation in the single relevant intermediate and its
C–C cleavage rates will depend on the identity of the metal, but the elementary steps and their kinetic
relevance appear to be a general feature of metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.

1. Introduction
Hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds on metals is the reaction of choice
for decreasing the chain length of acyclic molecules and for opening
rings in cyclic hydrocarbons [1–12]. It is also responsible, however,
for yield losses during hydrocarbon reforming and isomerization
[13,14], making mechanistic models of hydrogenolysis reactivity
and selectivity useful in practice [15]. C–C bond rupture has been
widely used to probe the effects of cluster size [9,10,16–26],
elemental identity, and alloying [27–37] in catalysis. Early studies
recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening
of C–C bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates
that
replace
C–H
bonds
with
C-metal
bonds
on
surfaces
[9,11,16,38–41]. The structure and degree of unsaturation of these
species on metal surfaces have been inferred indirectly from mea-
sured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates [29,38–40]
and from isotopic exchange data [42–44], because they lack distin-
guishable spectroscopic signatures required for their direct interro-
gation and, therefore, can only be assessed using theoretical
methods [35,45–48].
Our recent studies have addressed the enthalpic and entropic
barriers that govern reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenolysis
of C2–C10 n-alkanes [49] and isoalkanes [50] on supported Ir
clusters. Here, we combine hydrogenolysis turnover rates and their
kinetic interpretation on Ir clusters saturated with chemisorbed
hydrogen (H) with density functional theory (DFT) treatments
on the Ir(111) surface in order to infer mechanistic details for
the hydrogenolysis of ethane. This study shows that C–C bond
cleavage occurs via a speciﬁc reactive intermediate (CHCH) that

forms by the loss of four H-atoms (as H2) through the sequential
dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane molecules. These ﬁndings
and the DFT-derived activation barriers agree well with measured
turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters. They conﬁrm
the essential role of unsaturation in the cleavage of C–C bonds in
ethane [45,46,48] and, by inference, in larger n-alkanes, isoalkanes,
and cycloalkanes [7,8,16,35,47], for which similar kinetic depen-
dences and activation barriers have been observed. The identiﬁca-
tion of the reactive species that cleave C–C bonds shows also how
their concentrations depend on H2 pressures and temperatures and
can, therefore, inform the choice of reaction conditions and cata-
lysts for processes that deliberately, or inadvertently, involve
hydrogenolysis reactions.
2. Methods
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of Ir–SiO2
Ir–SiO2 (3.0 wt.%) was prepared by incipient wetness impregna-
tion using reported methods [49]. Samples were heated to 393 K at
0.017 K s1 in ﬂowing dry air (Praxair, 99.99%, 5.0 cm3 g1 s1) and
held for 8 h and subsequently heated at 0.033 K s1 to 1123 K and
held for 12 h. The sample was cooled to ambient temperature and
then heated at 0.033 K s1 to 1173 K in ﬂowing 50% H2/He (Praxair,
99.999%, 1.0 cm3 g1 s1) and held for 8 h. The sample was again
cooled to ambient temperature and passivated in ﬂowing 0.5%
O2/He (Praxair, 99.99%, 1.0 cm3 g1 s1) for 3 h. The number of ex-
posed Ir atoms (Irs) was determined from volumetric uptakes of H2,
O2, and CO at 298 K [49,51] and the mean Ir cluster diameter
(<dchem>) was estimated by assuming hemispherical crystallites
and the atomic density of bulk Ir (70.7 atoms nm3) [52,53]. Ir frac-
tional dispersions from H2, O2, and CO chemisorption were 0.13,
0.15, and 0.13, respectively, the average of which indicates that
the mean diameter of the Ir clusters was 7 nm. Distribution of clus-
ter sizes was determined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) in bright-ﬁeld mode (Philips, CM200F) using samples ap-
plied as a ﬁne dust onto lacey carbon-coated Cu grids. Surface-
averaged cluster diameters were calculated using the following:
< dTEM >¼
P nid
3
i
P nid
2
i
ð1Þ
where ni is the number of clusters with a diameter di (1029 clusters)
[54]. Values of <dTEM> (14.4 nm) and <dchem> (7 nm) indicate that
the majority of the Ir exists in aggregates of 104 atoms. We must
conclude that, in this case, distributions of detected cluster sizes
overestimate the mean cluster diameter because TEM does not de-
tect a signiﬁcant numbers of small (d < 0.6 nm) clusters that are
represented in chemisorption experiments. Thus, we conclude that
the chemisorption measurements most accurately represent the
average size of the clusters, 7 nm, and the corresponding number
of Irs is used to calculate hydrogenolysis turnover rates. The Ir con-
tent was measured by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (Galbraith Laboratories, Inc.). The Supporting Informa-
tion summarizes the synthesis and characterization of the 7 nm
Ir–SiO2 catalyst (Table S1) and contains a representative TEM image
and cluster size distribution for the Ir–SiO2 catalyst (Fig. S1).
2.2. Ethane hydrogenolysis rate measurements
Ethane hydrogenolysis rates were measured in a ﬂow packed-
bed stainless steel tubular reactor (3/800 O.D.) with plug-ﬂow hydro-
dynamics from 553 to 663 K with ethane ((C2H6)) and hydrogen
((H2)) pressures from 10 to 80 kPa and from 0.6 to 1.8 MPa, respec-
tively. The reactor was placed within a three-zone resistively-heated
furnace, and the bed temperature was measured with a type K ther-
mocouple held within a 1/16’’ stainless steel sheath aligned axially
along the bed. The Ir–SiO2 catalyst was mixed with additional SiO2
(Cab–O–Sil HS-5, washed with deionized water and treated in ﬂow-
ing dry air at 793 K for 5 h) to avoid any axial or radial temperature
gradients. Pressure was controlled using a dome-loaded regulator
(Mity-Mite, S91XW). The catalyst was treated in ﬂowing H2 (Praxair,
99.999%) at ambient pressure (50 cm3 g1 s1) by heating to 673 K at
0.083 K s1 and holding for 2 h. The composition of the reactant
stream was set using electronic mass ﬂow controllers (Parker, 201)
to meter the ﬂow rates of H2 (Praxair, 99.999%), and ethane (5% eth-
ane, 10% Ar, 85% He, Praxair, certiﬁed-grade). CH4 and C2H6 efﬂuent
concentrations were measured by gas chromatography (Agilent GC,
5890) using a methyl silicone capillary column (HP-1, 50 m  0.32
mm  1.05 lm) and a ﬂame ionization detector. No other hydrocar-
bons were detected. All rates are reported at differential conversions
(<5%) to avoid consequential axial gradients in reactant concentra-
tions. Turnover rates are reported as moles of ethane consumed
per unit time normalized by the number of surface metal atoms
determined by chemisorption, and reported uncertainties represent
two-standard deviations (95% conﬁdence intervals).
2.3. Computational methods
Periodic plane-wave DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [55–58]. The plane-
waves were constructed using projector augmented-wave (PAW)
potentials with an energy cutoff of 396 eV [59,60]. The revised Per-
dew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) form of the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) was used to determine exchange and corre-
lation energies [61–63]. Calculations of gaseous species were com-
puted using 18  18  18 Å unit cells. The catalyst surface was
modeled as a 4  4 Ir(111) closed-packed periodic lattice with a
lattice parameter of 3.84 Å; it consists of four layers in the z-direc-
tion with the bottom two layers ﬁxed in their bulk positions and
the other two allowed to relax to their minimum energy structures.
Wavefunctions were converged to within 106 eV and forces were
computed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) grid with a cutoff of
twice the planewave cutoff and a 3  3  1 Monkhorst–pack sam-
pling of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (k-point mesh) [64]. For optimiza-
tions, the structures were relaxed until the force on unconstrained
atoms was <0.05 eV/Å. After geometric convergence, a single-point
calculation with a 6  6  1 k-point mesh was performed to opti-
mize energy minima of reactant, product, and transition states.
Transition state (TS) structures were obtained for each elemen-
tary reaction by using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method
[65,66] and the dimer method [67]. The NEB method was carried
out using 16 images, and wavefunctions were converged to within
104 eV using a 3  3  1 k-point mesh and an FFT grid size of 1.5
times the planewave cutoff. The maximum force on each atom was
converged to <0.3 eV/Å. These protocols provided an estimate of
the reaction path and a starting point for the structure and the
reactive vibrational mode for each transition state. The dimer algo-
rithm was then used with wavefunctions converged to within
106 eV using a 3  3  1 k-point mesh and an FFT grid size of 2
times the planewave cutoff. For dimer calculations, the maximum
force on each atom was converged to <0.05 eV/Å. As with optimi-
zations of reactant and product states, the energy of the TS was
then
determined
using
a
single-point
calculation
with
6  6  1 k-point mesh. Zero-point energy and thermal corrections
were implemented using vibrational frequencies for reactants,
transition states and products involved in each elementary step
to estimate enthalpies and entropies of each state (details in
Supporting information). For transition states, these frequency

analyses conﬁrmed the transition state mode and the presence of a
single negative frequency.
3. Results and discussion
Scheme

shows
a
sequence
of
elementary
steps
that
account for measured rates for the hydrogenolysis of ethane
[38–40,45,48,68], and which are analogous to steps for larger n-
alkanes [17,49,69,70], and isoalkanes [17,27,50]. These steps are
examined here by combining experimental rate data and DFT
calculations. These elementary steps are consistent with the previ-
ously observed dependence of n-alkane hydrogenolysis rates on H2
and n-alkane (C2–C10) pressures on clusters of Rh, Pt, as well as Ir,
the latter being the focus of this study [49].
Scheme 1 includes H2 dissociation (1.1), molecular C2H6 adsorp-
tion (1.2), and dehydrogenation of adsorbed C2H6 (C2H
6, where 
indicates an intermediate bound to one metal atom) via sequential
C–H bond cleavage to form a quasi-equilibrated pool of dehydroge-
nated chemisorbed surface intermediates with y H-atoms removed
from the ethane reactants (C2H
6y, where 1 6 y 6 6 and - denotes
an intermediate bound to two vicinal metal atoms; (1.3–1.5)). C–C
bond rupture may occur in any of these C2H
6y intermediates,
which differ in both the number of H-atoms removed from ethane
and the location from which they are removed. The presence of
equilibrated mixtures of isobutane–isobutene [50] and cycloal-
kane–arene mixtures during hydrogenolysis on Ir [50,71] (and Pt,
Ru, and Rh [72]) and the equilibrated nature of H/D exchange reac-
tions during ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt [42], suggest that H2 and
ethane dissociation steps (steps 1.1–1.5) are indeed quasi-equili-
brated, making C–C bond cleavage the sole kinetically-relevant
step. Each surface intermediate (C2H
6y) cleaves C–C bonds with
a rate constant that reﬂects, in part, the stability of the transition
state that mediates that reaction event; thus, any of these
unsaturated species (C2H
6y) can plausibly contribute to measured
ethane hydrogenolysis rates. Some of these quasi-equilibrated
intermediates will preferentially contribute to the products formed,
because C–C bonds weaken as C–H bonds are replaced by C-metal
bonds, in a process that transfers electron density from the C–C
bond to the surface metal atoms [73]. Consequently, measured
hydrogenolysis rates and their dependence on temperature and
H2 pressure ((H2)) reﬂect the appropriately averaged degree of
unsaturation of the intermediate pool and the stability of the
respective transition states that lead to C–C bond cleavage in each
of these intermediates.
Fig. 1 shows C2H6 hydrogenolysis turnover rates as a function of
C2H6 (Fig. 1a) and H2 (Fig. 1b) pressures on Ir clusters of 7 nm mean
diameter. Hydrogenolysis rates are proportional to C2H6 pressure
((C2H6)1.0±0.1, Fig. 1a) and show an inverse dependence on H2 pres-
sure ((H2)3.3±0.2, Fig. 1b). Measured C2H6 hydrogenolysis rates
(robs, Fig. 1) represent the combined rates of C–C bond cleavage
for quasi-equilibrated reactive C2-intermediates with each value
of y:
robs ¼

where ry is the rate of C–C cleavage of species with (6  y) H-atoms.
The reactive species (C2H
6y) cleave C–C bonds at rates propor-
tional to their respective surface concentrations:
ry ¼ kCC;y  ½C2H
6y
ð3Þ
where kCC,y is the C–C cleavage rate constant. At high H2:C2H6 ratios
(>15), H replaces dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species as the most
abundant surface intermediate (MASI) as shown by hydrogenolysis
rates that become inversely dependent on (H2) for C2–C10 n-alkanes

[49]. In this case, the rate equation derived from elementary steps
in Scheme 1, taken together with the assumption of quasi-equili-
brated molecular adsorption and dehydrogenation steps (steps
1.1–1.5) [49], becomes:

ð4Þ
Here, KH2 and KC2H6 are the equilibrium constants for adsorption of
H2 and C2H6, respectively and Qy
n¼1KCH;n represents the product of
the equilibrium constants for the sequential C–H bond ruptures that
occur as C2H6 dehydrogenates before C–C bond cleavage in each
intermediate. This equation is consistent with measured hydrogen-
olysis turnover rates, which are proportional to (C2H6) (Fig. 1a) and
decrease with increasing H2 pressure (Fig. 1b). The value of k
(3.3 ± 0.2, from the data in Fig. 1b) in Equation (4) reﬂects the com-
bination of the number of H-atoms that desorb from the surface (c)
to accommodate the reactive intermediate (reverse of step 1.1) and
the number of H-atoms lost from C2H6 to form reactive species that
cleave C–C bonds (y, steps 1.3–1.5) [49] according to the equation:
y þ c ¼ 2k
ð5Þ
where k must be multiplied by a factor of two because k represents
the number of H2 molecules while y andc are the number of H-atoms.
The chemical interpretation of k values is identical on H⁄-covered
surfaces of other metal clusters (e.g., 0.7 nm Ir, 3.0 ± 0.2 [49];
0.9 nm Rh, 3.0 ± 0.2 [49]; 0.6 nm Pt, 2.3 ± 0.2 [49]; and 1.0 nm Ru,
3.0 ± 0.2 [72]). These values show that C–C bonds are cleaved in dee-
ply dehydrogenated intermediates derived from C2H6 on metal clus-
ter catalysts. This conclusion is consistent with previous ﬁndings that
have shown that multiple H-atoms are lost from C2H6 before the C–C
bond cleaves on metal surfaces [28,38,74]. The chemical signiﬁcance
of the dependence of rates on (H2) is less clear for C2H
x-covered sur-
faces (hydrocarbons as MASI) or surfaces containing both free sites
and C2H
x-species [28,38], because the average H-content of the sur-
face intermediates and the H-content of the reactive intermediates
are both unknown [49].
Ethane hydrogenolysis rates show that an average of 6.6 ± 0.4
H-atoms evolve as H2 during the formation of the reactive interme-
diates that undergoes C–C bond cleavage on 7 nm Ir clusters
(Fig. 1b). The non-integer nature of the reactivity-averaged value
of y would indicate that several intermediates, with different
H-contents (Eq. (2), e.g., CHCH and CHC), have transition states
with similar stability, thus cleaving C–C bonds at comparable rates.
Non-integer c values would show that multiple pairs of exposed Ir
atoms, distinct in their H-coverage, contribute to measured rates.
For example, ensembles that include edge and corner atoms, can
bind more than one H-atom (H/Irs > 1) [75–77], and would give a
different c than ensembles containing only terrace sites, which
bind a single H-atom. Alternatively, the rates could be dominated
by C–C bond rupture that occurs entirely on ensembles of terraces
sites, in which case, fractional c values show that a signiﬁcant
number of terrace sites are unoccupied (i.e., H/Irs < 1) at the equi-
librium H-coverages for these experiments (0.6–1.8 MPa, 593 K).
Measurements of hydrogenolysis rates, by themselves, cannot
determine y and c values; therefore, they cannot discern whether
parallel pathways or distinct site occupancy account for turnovers
that release a non-integer average number of H-atoms into the
gas-phase. We examine these possibilities by using quantum
mechanical simulations to assess the stability of transition states
that cleave C–C bonds in C2-intermediates derived from C2H6
adsorption and subsequent dehydrogenation on bare Ir(111) with
the implicit assumption that the presence of H-atoms at satura-
tion coverages do not cause signiﬁcant differences between the
stability of different surface intermediates and transition states
and do not change differences between the barriers to activate
C–C bonds in different intermediates. The Ir(111) surface was se-
lected because it is representative of the majority of the surface
of 7 nm Ir clusters at low temperatures and in vacuum. These cal-
culations will not account for reactivity of the minor fraction (<10%
[78]) of under-coordinated sites that exist on the surfaces of these
clusters. Turnover rates for C2H6 hydrogenolysis on these under-
coordinated sites, which dominate the surfaces of 0.7 nm Ir clus-
ters, are, however, 200 times smaller [49] than turnover rates
on 7 nm Ir clusters at 20 kPa C2H6, 1.8 MPa H2, 593 K. Thus, we
estimate that Ir atoms that are located at edges and corners of
7 nm Ir clusters account for 0.05% of the measured C2H6 hydrog-
enolysis rate, and consequently, that the Ir(111) surface provides a
reasonable and appropriate description of the cluster surfaces that
contribute to measured hydrogenolysis rates.
C–C bond cleavage in partially-dehydrogenated C2-intermedi-
ates (Scheme 1) is preceded by quasi-equilibrated adsorption of
C2H6 and H2 and dehydrogenation of C2H6. On H-saturated sur-
faces, these elementary steps lead to overall enthalpy barriers
(DH) given by the enthalpy of the transition state (H) and the k
moles of H2 formed by dehydrogenating ethane on the surface
(kHH2) relative to the combined enthalpies of the relevant precur-
sors (Href). In this case, the relevant precursors are the gaseous eth-
ane reactant (HC2H6) and the c H-atoms displaced from the Ir
surface to accommodate the transition state (cHH⁄), as shown by
the functional form of the rate expression Eq. (4). Thus, the state
properties of enthalpy show that DH is given by:
DHz ¼ H z þk  HH2  Href ¼ H z þk  HH2  HC2H6  c  HH
ð6Þ
The value of DH must also be equal to the sum of reaction enthal-
pies (Hrxn) for all steps preceding the kinetically-relevant transition
state and the intrinsic activation enthalpy (Hact) to form the TS from
the reactive intermediate:
DHz ¼
X
Hrxn þ Hact
ð7Þ
Overall entropy changes (DS) are also state functions and are sim-
ilarly deﬁned:
DSz ¼ S z þk  SH2  Sref ¼ S z þk  SH2  SC2H6  c  SH
ð8Þ
DSz ¼
X
Srxn þ Sact
ð9Þ
These equations lead, in turn, to overall free energy barriers (DG):
DGz ¼ DH z TDSz
ð10Þ
for ethane hydrogenolysis reactions.
Fig. 2 shows Hrxn and Hact for C–H and C–C bond rupture in C2H6
and its dehydrogenated intermediates (steps 1.3–1.6) calculated by
DFT on bare Ir(111) surfaces at 593 K. When H is the MASI, the for-
mation and activation of C2H
6y species on two adjacent sites (-)
is preceded by the recombinative desorption of vicinal H (step 1.1,
Hrxn = 34 kJ mol1). In these simulations, C–C cleavage can occur via
interactions of C2H6 with - site pairs to form two CH
3 fragments
(Hact = 200 kJ mol1) but, oxidative metal–atom insertion into the
C–H bond to form adsorbed ethyl (CH3CH
2) and H involves a much
smaller barrier (Hact = 99 kJ mol1). After this initial C–H activation
step, CH3CH
2 can react with an unoccupied site to cleave the C–C
bond
and
form
CH
3
and
CH
2
(Hact = 136 kJ mol1),
but
its
dehydrogenation to form CH3CH (Hact = 29 kJ mol1) or CH2CH
2
(Hact = 46 kJ mol1) or its hydrogenation by H to re-form CH3CH
3
(Hact = 18 kJ mol1) are more facile. Differences between the barrier
to cleave the C–C bond and to form or cleave C–H bonds
(>90 kJ mol1) indicate that CH3CH
2 formation is quasi-equilibrated
during ethane hydrogenolysis.
Hrxn and Hact for C–C and C–H bond cleavage were calculated for
all surface intermediates from C2H
5 to C
2 (Fig. 2, and SI, Figs.

S2–S11). Table 1 lists the DH and DG values, calculated from Eq.
(7) and Eq. (10), respectively, for C–C bond cleavage in each of the
10 C2-intermediates. The formation and cleavage of C–H bonds is
favored by >50 kJ mol1 over C–C bond cleavage for all C2H
6y spe-
cies, except CHCH intermediate. C–C bond cleavage in this -
CHCH intermediate shows a much lower activation barrier
(Hact = 105 kJ mol1)
than
for
its
further
dehydrogenation
(Hact = 185 kJ mol1), indicating that CHCH is the dehydrogenated
intermediate predominantly responsible for measured ethane
hydrogenolysis turnover rates. Hact values for its hydrogenation
steps to re-form C2H
6 are lower than its Hact for C–C bond cleavage
by >25 kJ mol1, consistent with quasi-equilibrated CHCH forma-
tion from C2H6. These conclusions are consistent with measured
hydrogenolysis rates (Fig. 1) and with the rate equation Eq. (4),
and its chemical interpretation [49].
The formalism of transition state theory [79] dictates that the
gas-phase C2H6 and two H-atoms exist in quasi-equilibrium with
the transition state that cleaves the C–C bond (C2H
6y) and the
product H2:
C2H6 þ c  H ¢
Kz C2H6y  z þ k  H2
ð11Þ
where K– is the equilibrium constant describing the overall equilib-
rium between these reactants and products. Hydrogenolysis rates
for each reactive intermediate (Table 1) are calculated at 20 kPa
C2H6, 1.8 MPa H2, and 593 K using the functional form of the rate
expression derived from transition state theory:

½L ¼ kBT
h  exp
DGz
RT
ð
Þ  ðC2H6Þ
H2
ð
Þk
ð12Þ
Here, kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constant, respectively,
and DG and k have values that depend on the intermediate
(Table 1). Turnover rates reﬂect the reactivity of multiple intermedi-
ates only when their C–C bonds rupture at comparable rates Eq. (12).
DFT-derived barriers (Table 1) show that the enthalpy barrier for
cleaving C–C bonds in CHCH (DH = 218 kJ mol1) is 13 kJ mol1
smaller than for the next most reactive intermediate (CH3CH,
DH = 231 kJ mol1). Differences in DG values for different reactive
intermediates, which determine rate constants, also reﬂect the sig-
niﬁcant entropy gained from gas-phase H2 formed by quasi-equili-
brated dehydrogenation of C2H6 and desorption of H from the
surface [49]. As a result of entropy differences, it is far more favor-
able to cleave the C–C bond in CHCH (DG = 137 kJ mol1) rather

than in CH3CH (DG = 229 kJ mol1) or any other intermediate
(Table 1), because more deeply dehydrogenated intermediates
produce a larger number of gaseous H2 molecules, giving larger
entropy gains (Table 1), which decrease DG (Eq. (10)). Calculated
barriers for C–C bond cleavage in

DG = 137 kJ mol1)

measured
barriers
for
C2H6
hydrogenolysis
(DH = 213 ± 2 kJ mol1,
DG = 130 ± 5 kJ mol1, Table 1); these experimental barriers were
determined from changes in hydrogenolysis turnover rates with
temperature (Fig. 3) on surfaces of 7 nm Ir clusters, which predom-
inantly consist of close-packed (111) terraces [78]. The predicted
rates for C–C bond cleavage in all possible reactive intermediates
(Table 1) show that differences in DG lead to much higher C–C bond
cleavage rates in CHCH (3:7  104 C2H6 Ir1
s
s1) than for any
other species in the quasi-equilibrated pool of unsaturated interme-
diates
(e.g.,
CH3CH,
5:2  1011 C2H6 Ir1
s
s1)
(20 kPa
C2H6,
1.8 MPa H2, 593 K). These computational and experimental results,
summarized in Fig. 4, show that measured hydrogenolysis turnover
rates predominantly reﬂect C–C bond rupture in a single intermedi-
ate, CHCH, at the experimental conditions. Thus, the value of y in
Eq. (5) is equal to four.
DFT calculations show that measured hydrogenolysis rates re-
ﬂect C–C cleavage rates in CHCH, therefore, four of the 6.6 ± 0.4
H-atoms that desorb come from dehydrogenating C2H6. This re-
quires that the other 2.6 ± 0.4 H-atoms desorb from the catalyst
surface (i.e., c = 2.6 ± 0.4; Eq. (5)). This fractional value of c indi-
cates that H-coverages are not uniform at all sites on 7 nm Ir clus-
ters. A plausible interpretations involves ensembles of surface
atoms that require either two or three H to desorb depending
on the coordination of exposed atoms on non-uniform Ir clusters.
Edge and corner atoms of Ir nanoparticles have larger H/Irs adsorp-
tion stoichiometries than terraces at all H-coverages, as shown by
our
DFT
calculations
on
Ir201
cubo-octahedral
nanoparticles
(1.6 nm in diameter, Fig. S2), DFT calculations on <1 nm Pt clusters
[76], and experiments with Ir, Rh, and Pt clusters (<1.5 nm in diam-
eter) [77]. The agreement between measured and DFT-derived DG
values (Table 1) and turnover rates (Fig. 4) indicates that hydrog-
enolysis occurs predominantly via the CHCH reactive intermedi-
ate and that fractional c values are likely to reﬂect differences
between the H/Irs among distinct active site ensembles on Ir clus-
ter surfaces.
C2H6 hydrogenolysis rates on H-covered Ir clusters and their
kinetic dependence on reactant pressure and temperature and
DFT-derived energy and free energy barriers for C–H and C–C bond
cleavage on Ir(111) indicate that C–C cleavage occurs predomi-
nantly in a single reactive intermediate because of C–H and C–C
bond activation barriers that vary with the H-content of C2-species.
Chemical similarities between alkanes suggest that hydrogenolysis
rates for a given C–C bond in larger n-alkanes [49], isoalkanes [50],
and cycloalkanes [50,71] will also arise from the rupture of a C–C
bond within a small fraction of all unsaturated surface intermedi-
ates. The quasi-equilibrated nature of the intervening adsorption
and dehydrogenation steps provide opportunities to control the
position of C–C bond cleavage in larger alkane reactants by control-
ling H2 pressures, which concomitantly change the relative cover-
ages of intermediates with different degrees of unsaturation.
Differences between C–H and C–C activation barriers will change
with the elemental identity of metal clusters and cause the H-con-
tent of reactive intermediates to differ among catalysts [27–37]. In
spite of this, even very small differences in DG at typical temper-
atures for hydrogenolysis will cause C–C bond cleavage to occur
predominately in a single unsaturated species [9,11,16,38–41].
4. Conclusions
Overall activation parameters (DH, DS, DG) to cleave the C–C
bond in ethane-derived C2 surface intermediates were calculated
by DFT and compared to measurements that reﬂect the composi-
tion of the reactive species and the DG for the dominant reaction
pathway. This comparison was possible because hydrogenolysis
turnover rates were measured in the limit of well-deﬁned cover-
ages (H as MASI) on 7 nm Ir particles for which the predominant
surfaces are similar to the (111) plane modeled in simulations. Re-
sults from DFT conﬁrm that C2H6 undergoes quasi-equilibrated
dehydrogenation steps, forming a pool of dehydrogenated inter-
mediates prior to C–C bond cleavage. Each C2-intermediate can un-
dergo irreversible and kinetically-relevant C–C activation to form
C1 intermediates which are then rapidly hydrogenated to form
CH4. The rates at which each intermediate cleaves its C–C bond de-

pends upon the free energy of its distinct transition state,
therefore, experimental rates can potentially reﬂect the sum of
C–C bond cleavage rates within multiple and distinct reactive
species. Large differences between DG for C–C bond rupture in
different reactive intermediates indicate, however, that C2H6
hydrogenolysis is dominated by the contributions of a single inter-
mediate (CHCH) on Ir clusters. The number of H-atoms that are
displaced when the C–C bond in CHCH cleaves varies between
two to three, as it depends on the local H-coverage which varies
across the surface of Ir clusters. This study focuses on the relatively
simple system of C2H6 hydrogenolysis on large clusters of Ir, yet it
establishes a methodology to effectively combine experiment and
theory in order to study hydrogenolysis of complex alkanes and
other reactants on metal clusters of different elements and sizes.
