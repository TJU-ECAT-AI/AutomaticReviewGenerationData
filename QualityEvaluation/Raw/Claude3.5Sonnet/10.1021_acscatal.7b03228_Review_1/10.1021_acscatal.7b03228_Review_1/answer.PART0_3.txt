[1] "To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."

[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."

[3] "Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene were demonstrated successfully in order to illustrate the advantageous catalytic properties of the Pd@Cu SSA."

[4] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."

[5] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."

[6] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that structure sensitive reactions are more likely to be successful."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing unique sites for hydrogen activation. This boosts both activity and selectivity in the process.

The key advantages of SAAs include:

1. Reduced energy barrier for hydrogen dissociation without significantly affecting adsorption enthalpy.
2. Breaking of Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi scaling rules, allowing for improved catalytic performance beyond traditional electronic structure limitations.
3. Improved selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, such as acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion and guest metal aggregation.
2. Avoiding reactive environments that could cause metal segregation.
3. Choosing reactions that can benefit from the unique geometric sites created by SAAs, particularly structure-sensitive reactions.

SAAs offer advantages over traditional catalysts by providing a way to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems. This is achieved through the combination of geometric effects and electronic effects, allowing for more precise control of catalytic properties and potentially paradigm-shifting performance improvements in metal catalysts.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过提供独特的氢活化位点来增强选择性加氢反应的催化性能。这提高了反应的活性和选择性。

SAAs的主要优势包括：

1. 降低氢解离的能量障碍，同时不显著影响吸附焓。
2. 打破Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi标度规则，使催化性能超越传统电子结构的限制。
3. 提高加氢反应的选择性，如乙炔到乙烯和苯乙烯到乙苯的转化。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 温和的反应温度，以防止金属-金属扩散和客体金属聚集。
2. 避免可能导致金属分离的反应环境。
3. 选择能够受益于SAAs创造的独特几何位点的反应，特别是结构敏感的反应。

与传统催化剂相比，SAAs通过提供打破标度规则和提高各种催化剂系统选择性的方法，具有显著优势。这是通过几何效应和电子效应的结合实现的，允许更精确地控制催化性能，并可能在金属催化剂中实现突破性的性能改进。
