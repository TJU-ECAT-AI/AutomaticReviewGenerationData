[1] "To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation."

[2] "DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (0.35 eV on the alloy but 0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."

[3] "Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene were demonstrated successfully in order to illustrate the advantageous catalytic properties of the Pd@Cu SSA."

[4] "The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metalmetal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."

[5] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metaladsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing unique sites for hydrogen activation. This boosts both activity and selectivity in these reactions.

SAAs are able to break scaling rules, which typically dictate a correlation between reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier. In the case of Pd@Cu SAAs, the barrier for hydrogen dissociation is significantly reduced without strongly affecting the adsorption enthalpy. This departure from traditional scaling relationships allows for improved catalytic performance.

The enhanced catalytic properties of Pd@Cu SAAs have been demonstrated in selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the conversion of acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene. These examples showcase the improved selectivity achieved through the use of SAAs.

For designing successful SAA catalysts, several key criteria should be considered:

1. Reaction conditions: The reaction temperature should be mild to prevent metal-metal diffusion and aggregation of the guest metal.

2. Metal properties: The chosen metals should avoid segregation in reactive environments. This means selecting metals that do not form strong metal-adsorbate bonds that could cause one metal to migrate to the surface.

3. Reaction type: The chosen reaction should be able to take advantage of the unique geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. Structure-sensitive reactions are more likely to benefit from SAA catalysts.

The specific advantages of SAA catalysts over traditional catalysts include their ability to break scaling rules, improve selectivity, and provide unique active sites for specific reactions. By carefully controlling the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst surface, SAAs offer a promising approach to designing more efficient and selective catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过提供独特的氢活化位点来增强选择性加氢反应中的催化性能。这提高了这些反应的活性和选择性。

SAAs能够打破通常规定反应焓和反应障碍之间相关性的标度规则。在Pd@Cu SAAs的情况下，氢解离的障碍显著降低，而不会强烈影响吸附焓。这种偏离传统标度关系的特性允许改善催化性能。

Pd@Cu SAAs增强的催化特性已在选择性加氢反应中得到证实，例如乙炔转化为乙烯和苯乙烯转化为乙苯。这些例子展示了通过使用SAAs实现的改进选择性。

在设计成功的SAA催化剂时，应考虑以下几个关键标准：

1. 反应条件：反应温度应温和，以防止金属-金属扩散和客体金属的聚集。

2. 金属特性：选择的金属应避免在反应环境中发生分离。这意味着选择不会形成强金属-吸附质键的金属，这可能导致一种金属迁移到表面。

3. 反应类型：所选反应应能够利用单原子合金创造的独特几何位点。结构敏感反应更有可能从SAA催化剂中受益。

与传统催化剂相比，SAA催化剂的具体优势包括它们能够打破标度规则，提高选择性，并为特定反应提供独特的活性位点。通过仔细控制催化剂表面的几何和电子性质，SAAs为设计更高效和选择性的各种加氢反应催化剂提供了一种有前景的方法。

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing unique sites for hydrogen activation. This boosts both activity and selectivity in these reactions.

The key advantages of SAAs include:

1. Reduced energy barriers for hydrogen dissociation without significantly affecting adsorption enthalpy, breaking BrønstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules.

2. Improved selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, such as acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene.

3. The ability to fine-tune catalytic properties through careful control of atomic-scale geometry.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion and guest metal aggregation.

2. Avoiding reactive environments that could cause metal segregation.

3. Choosing reactions that can benefit from the unique geometric sites created by SAAs, typically structure-sensitive reactions.

4. Selecting appropriate metal combinations where one metal (e.g., Cu) acts as a stable host while the other (e.g., Pd) provides specific catalytic functionality.

SAAs offer advantages over traditional catalysts by allowing precise control over active sites, breaking scaling relationships, and improving selectivity across various catalyst systems. This approach enables the design of catalysts with unique properties that can be tailored for specific reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic processes.
