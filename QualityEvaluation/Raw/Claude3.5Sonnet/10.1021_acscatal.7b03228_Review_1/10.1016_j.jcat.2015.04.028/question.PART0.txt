The poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst for the FischerTropsch reaction by sulfur was investigated
by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Experiments were performed under syngas at pressures
around 10 mbar and at sample temperatures around 500 K under methanation conditions. After the reac-
tion experiments, the surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry
showed that the sample was poisoned when hydrogen with <0.5 ppm of sulfur was used in the syngas.
STM images recorded under these conditions showed a strong restructuring of the surface into small ter-
races. The terraces were fully covered by a stable surface phase, displaying small ordered areas with
(2  2) and (p19  p19)R23.4 structures. The observations contrast with the flat terraces covered by
a mobile adsorption layer when sulfur-free hydrogen was used. The poisoned surface state is interpreted
as a mixed sulfur/carbon layer that additionally involves a reconstruction of the Co(0001) surface.

1. Introduction
The cobalt- or iron-catalyzed FischerTropsch synthesis of
liquid fuels from syngas,
nCO  2n  1H2 ! CnH2n2  nH2O;
is strongly and irreversibly poisoned by sulfur, a particularly harm-
ful effect for the expensive cobalt-based catalysts [13]. Sulfur com-
pounds have therefore to be removed from the CO/H2 mixtures fed
into FischerTropsch reactors to extremely low contents. Maximum
tolerable concentrations of 20 ppb [1] or similarly low values have
been reported [4,5]. In the technical process, this is achieved in
several cleaning steps, until, at the last step, most of the remaining
sulfur is adsorbed on ZnO [6].
How such low concentrations of sulfur can deactivate a cobalt
FischerTropsch catalyst has been mainly studied with supported
catalysts, by adding small amounts of sulfur compounds to the feed
gas, or to the catalyst material during preparation, and measuring
the decrease in activity. In an experiment, in which methanation
conditions on a supported Co catalyst were applied, it was found
that adding only 1387 ppb of H2S to the syngas led to a drop of
the methanation rate by more than four orders of magnitude [7].
The sulfur coverage responsible for this deactivation was estimated
from the amount of H2S consumed and from Auger electron spectra
(AES) of the catalyst taken out of the reactor. It was found that the
surface was saturated with sulfur, corresponding to a coverage of S
atoms of H = 1/22/3 of a monolayer (ML) with respect to the Co
surface atoms. Similarly strong deactivation effects of low amounts
of sulfur have also been observed in several studies performed
under FischerTropsch conditions [3,812]. That the sulfur cover-
ages are so high already at extremely low partial pressures of sul-
fur compounds can be explained by the high binding energy of
adsorbed S atoms. A value is available for the (2  2)S structure
on Co(0001) for which DFT calculations obtained 5.3 eV per S
atom [13,14].
That poisoning is caused in a nonselective way by a closed layer
of sulfur atoms is consistent with a local deactivation mechanism,
either by a simple geometric site blocking, or by local electronic
changes at the Co atoms directly bonded to the S atoms [13]. An
electronic effect can be understood within the d band model,
according to which adsorbed sulfur causes a downshift of the
energy of the d band of a transition metal with more than
half-filled d band [15]. As a consequence, the dissociation barrier
for moleculesin the present case the dissociation of CO is a criti-
cal stepcan become higher at the directly bonded metal atoms. A
local poisoning mechanism was also supported by adsorption

experiments on a Co(0001) surface in which adsorption sites for
D2 and CO were found to be blocked by preadsorbed S atoms
[16,17].
However, the picture of nonselective poisoning by a closed layer
of S atoms may not be fully adequate for the FischerTropsch syn-
thesis on cobalt. It does, e.g., not include effects on the morphology
of the Co catalysts. The dissociation of CO molecules on cobalt,
most likely an essential step in the reaction sequence, is strongly
structure sensitive [18], so that sulfur-induced changes of the sur-
face morphology could be important. Moreover, adsorbed sulfur is
known to enhance the surface self-diffusion of metal surfaces
[1921], which may accelerate sintering of supported Co catalysts.
In other systems, there are also indications of heterogeneous distri-
butions of sulfur. Using steady state isotopic transient kinetic
analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on the
methanation on a supported Ni catalyst, it was found that sulfur
did, in fact, block CO adsorption sites, but that surprisingly the
active sites for the reaction partially seemed to remain uncovered
[22]. One may also question the chemical nature of the poisoned
surface. The reported sulfur coverages of H = 1/22/3 of a ML in
the deactivated state [7] are significantly higher than H = 25% of
a ML of adsorbed sulfur atoms in the (2  2)S structure on
Co(0001), the only experimentally known ordered phase of
adsorbed sulfur on cobalt [13,16,17]. Because of the almost com-
plete lack of direct surface information under reaction conditions,
the actual state of the poisoned catalyst surface is still obscure.
Here we present results of high-pressure high-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments, performed in
a syngas atmosphere, on the poisoning of a Co(0001) surface by
sulfur. Atomic resolution was achieved under reaction conditions
in the methanation limit of the FischerTropsch synthesis. The data
provide, to our knowledge, the first atomic scale, in situ insight into
sulfur poisoning of a FischerTropsch catalyst. The images show
that minute amounts of sulfur in the syngas drastically change
the surface morphology. These changes are in strong contrast to
a recent in situ STM study in which we have shown that, under
methanation conditions in the absence of sulfur, the Co(0001) sur-
face morphology was unchanged with respect to the state under
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) [23]. With sulfur, we observed, in addi-
tion, so far unknown surface structures that can be explained by
a mixed sulfur/carbon layer on a reconstructed surface.
2. Experimental
The experiments were performed using an apparatus consisting
of a UHV chamber and a high-pressure cell housing the STM that
has been described in detail previously [24]. In short, the UHV
chamber is equipped with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and a monochromatized X-ray source, low-energy electron
diffraction (LEED), quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and an
ion gun. The STM in the high-pressure cell can be operated at pres-
sures between 1010 mbar and 1 bar, during heating of the sample
with an infrared laser. The gas composition in the cell was mea-
sured by QMS using a bypass to a leak valve at the UHV chamber.
For details of the preparation of the Co(0001) single crystal by Ar
ion sputtering and annealing we refer to an earlier paper [23].
Gases used were 99.9999% H2 (Alphagaz 2, Air Liquide), the
same gas as in our previous study [23,25], 99.999% H2 (lecture bot-
tle, Linde), and 99.97% CO (lecture bottle, Linde). After experiments
in the mbar regime with the hydrogen from the lecture bottle, both
in syngas mixtures and in H2 only, XP spectra showed a distinct
sulfur signal. By contrast, after experiments with the Alphagaz 2
hydrogen, the surface was free of sulfur. As the same gas inlet
was used in both cases, we rule out a sulfur source in our experi-
mental setup. The sulfur must be contained in the hydrogen gas
in the lecture bottle. Since no sulfur compounds are given in the
list of residual contaminants provided by the supplier, the maxi-
mum sulfur content must be below 0.5 ppm of hydrocarbons, the
lowest concentration of other foreign components listed. Mass
spectra of the hydrogen gas from the lecture bottle showed no sul-
fur compounds, in particular no H2S signal above the background
level at m/z = 34. The sulfur content must therefore be below
1 ppm, a similar limit as from the above estimate. That the
Alphagaz 2 hydrogen does not contain sulfur contaminations is
explained by an extra low temperature purification step applied
by the producer that freezes out sulfurous compounds.
The CO gas, stored in an aluminum lecture bottle, was intro-
duced into the stainless steel gas inlet only directly before an
experiment to avoid accumulation of Ni carbonyls. In no case a
nickel signal was detected by XPS on the sample surface.
Experiments with CO alone did not lead to a sulfur signal in XPS.
Experiments were typically performed by cleaning the sample
in UHV, transferring it to the STM cell, adjusting the H2 and CO
pressures between p(H2):p(CO) = 4:1 to 40:1 and at ptotal = 10
14 mbar, and heating the sample to T = 493523 K. Then, the
STM or QMS data were taken. The cell was not pumped during
the STM and activity experiments, which thus correspond to batch
conditions. After the experiments, the STM cell was evacuated, the
heating was stopped, the sample was transferred to the UHV
chamber and quickly reheated, a sequence during which the tem-
perature intermediately dropped by roughly 100 K. Finally, XP
spectra were taken. The C 1s, O 1s, S 2p, and Co 2p peaks in XPS
were analyzed as described previously [23]. Survey scans did not
show any other foreign elements.
To further characterize the surface structures observed by STM,
a supporting H2S adsorption experiment was performed in another
UHV chamber. This chamber was equipped with STM, AES, LEED,
and QMS. H2S was formed by reaction of Na2S with phosphoric acid
and filled into a glass tube that was mounted to a leak valve at the
chamber. The so-produced H2S contained a small amount of air.
H2S was dosed at a sample temperature of 300 K until AES indi-
cated saturation. Then, the sample was flash-annealed to 650 K
to decompose the adsorbed H2S and desorb H2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reference experiments with sulfur-free hydrogen
For reference purposes, Fig. 1 shows two STM images of the
Co(0001) surface, recorded in a syngas atmosphere with the
Alphagaz
2
hydrogen
[ptotal = 10 mbar,
p(H2):p(CO) = 40:1,
T = 493 K]. Images like these were typical for the active state of
the surface and have been analyzed in detail earlier [23]. The sur-
face in this state was characterized by several 100 Å wide terraces,
most of which were separated by monatomic steps of irregular
directions. The low hillocks are caused by Ar atoms implanted into
the bulk of the crystal during ion sputtering and not completely
removed in the annealing step. (Because of the hcp-to-fcc phase
transition of cobalt, the temperature had to be kept well below
695 K [26].) Also the many screw dislocations are explained by
the low preparation temperatures. This morphology was indistin-
guishable from the morphology of the freshly prepared surface
under UHV at room temperature.
The XP spectra recorded thereafter (Fig. 2, spectra 1) only
showed a small C 1s signal at 283.3 eV in the range of carbidic
carbon (8% of a ML), and a broad peak at 285.1 eV, in the range
of graphitic carbon (67% of a ML). The significant O 1s signal
(main peak at 529.6 eV and a second peak at 530.7 eV, 17% of a
ML) is most likely due to atomic oxygen formed from water
adsorption after the experiment during pump down of the STM

chamber. The water originates from the rest moisture of H2. (For
the assignments of the carbon and oxygen species, we refer to an
earlier paper [23].) The S 2p spectral region was completely flat.
The Alphagaz 2 hydrogen was thus free of sulfur compounds.
Fig. 3(a) shows, also for reference purposes, activity data
obtained with the sulfur-free hydrogen [red trace, ptotal = 10 mbar,
p(H2):p(CO) = 40:1] [23]. The QMS signal of the CH3
+ fragment of
methane at m/z = 15 steadily increased after the sample tempera-
ture (dotted line) had been raised from room temperature to
523 K, and remained constant during the intermediate cooling per-
iod to room temperature (the short plateau at 5 h). (m/z = 16 was
not
used
for
methane
detection
because
of
the
oxygen
compounds.) This proved that methane was catalytically formed
on the Co(0001) sample in the STM cell. The TOF obtained from
the slope of the curve was 0.02 s1 site1 [Fig. 3(b)].
3.2. Experiments with sulfur-containing hydrogen
The black trace in Fig. 3(a) shows the m/z = 15 signal of methane
obtained with a syngas mixture using the hydrogen from the
lecture
bottle
[ptotal = 10 mbar,
p(H2):p(CO) = 40:1,
T = 523 K].
Obviously, the signal was considerably lower than with the
sulfur-free hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure (red
line). The somewhat bent shapes of the curves, and the finite slopes

before the temperature was increased, were caused by small
parameter drifts, namely by the initial gas mixing and heating,
and the continuous gas extraction to the QMS. Though small, the
methanation activity was still finite with the hydrogen from the
lecture bottle as follows from the kink at 9 h, when the tempera-
ture was lowered to room temperature, causing the activity to drop
to actual zero. The TOF was 0.004 s1 site1, a factor of 5 lower
than with the sulfur-free hydrogen, [Fig. 3(b)]. At 493 K, the activ-
ity with the hydrogen from the lecture bottle was below the
detection limit.
The XPS recorded after the experiment at 523 K showed two
peaks in the S 2p range (Fig. 2, spectra 2). The energy separation
of 1.2 eV agrees with the known spin-orbit splitting of the 2p peak
of sulfur, and the S 2p3/2 peak position at 161.8 eV indicates a sul-
fide or adsorbed sulfur species [27,28]. S 2p3/2 energies between
161.5
and
161.9 eV
were
measured
throughout
this
study
(Fig. 2). The sulfur coverage estimated from the peak intensity
was 23% of a ML, which was not yet the maximum, even after
almost 8 h of reaction (cf. spectra 3 and 6 in Fig. 2), consistent with
the residual small activity at 523 K (Fig. 3). From these data, it is
clear that the strongly reduced methanation activity was corre-
lated with the formation of an adsorbed sulfur layer on the cobalt
surface (bulk CoS is excluded as there was no corresponding chem-
ical shift in the Co 2p3/2 signal [27]) and that the source was a sul-
fur compound in the hydrogen from the lecture bottle. The C 1s
spectrum showed 20% of a ML of a carbidic species (283.6 eV),
together with a relatively high amount (21% of a ML) of graphitic
carbon (284.7 eV), compared to the experiments at lower temper-
atures. The reason for the enhanced graphitic carbon level in this
experiment could not yet be clarified.
The STM images recorded under syngas mixtures with the
sulfur-containing hydrogen (Fig. 4) showed striking differences
with
respect
to
experiments
with
the
sulfur-free
hydrogen
[Fig. 1, same size as Fig. 4(a)]. Fig. 4(a) shows that, under similar
conditions [T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1] as in
the experiment of Fig. 1, the surface had become rough on a
900 Å scale, in contrast to the flat terraces seen before. The surface
still consisted of defined atomic terraces, separated by the
2.0 Å-high steps of Co(0001), but the terraces were only several
10 Å wide, an order of magnitude smaller than the extended ter-
races in the sulfur-free experiments. There were also many me-
sas, small terraces only bordered by downward steps, and the
steps were preferentially aligned along the close-packed h2 
1 
10i
directions, which was only rarely seen in UHV or in experiments
with the sulfur-free hydrogen.
On a smaller scale, the terraces displayed a partially ordered,
stable surface structure [Fig. 4(b)]. One can see stripes oriented
along h2 
1 
10i in some of which one can identify a local (2  2)
structure. In some other areas, one recognizes few unit cells of a
hexagonal pattern that is rotated by approximately 20 with
respect to the h2 
1 
10i directions and is best described by a
(p19  p19)R23.4 structure. A (2  2) structure is known from
adsorbed sulfur atoms on Co(0001) [13,16,17], whereas other
ordered sulfur phases have not been reported so far. The corre-
sponding experiments in syngas with the sulfur-free hydrogen
had not shown any defined surface structures on this length scale.
This had been explained by a mobile layer of CO molecules, hydro-
gen atoms, and reaction intermediates [23].
The XPS after the STM experiment showed a distinct S 2p dou-
blet (Fig. 2, spectra 3, S 2p3/2 at 161.8 eV). The sulfide coverage was
34% of a ML, a higher coverage than after the reaction experiment
at 523 K (Fig. 2, spectra 2), consistent with the fact that at 493 K
the activity was below the QMS detection limit. The carbon region
showed a carbidic C 1s peak at 283.6 eV (20% of a ML), more than
after the sulfur-free experiment (Fig. 2, spectra 1), and a minor gra-
phitic C 1s peak at 284.4 eV (2% of a ML). No O 1s peak was
detected, so that we rule out that oxygen was involved in the struc-
tures observed by STM. Hence, the STM data of Fig. 4, taken in situ
under
methanation
conditions
at
493 K,
show
the
highly
sulfur-poisoned state of the Co(0001) surface.
To further characterize this poisoned state, additional experi-
ments were performed. First, the sample was exposed to a
hydrogen-only atmosphere. Fig. 5 shows in situ STM data taken
at 493 K in 10 mbar of the sulfur-containing hydrogen gas. The
data
are
clearly
different
from
the
data
obtained
in
the
sulfur-containing hydrogen + CO atmosphere (Fig. 4). They show
relatively large and flat terraces that are not covered by immobile
phases, and there were no clear signs of roughening, even after 4 h
in the hydrogen atmosphere. On the other hand, the STM data are
also different from the analogous experiment with the sulfur-free
hydrogen (without CO). The surface morphology in a 10 mbar
atmosphere of sulfur-free hydrogen at 493 K was identical to the
morphology in UHV at room temperature [23] (This morphology
was the same as in Fig. 1, showing the surface in syngas with
sulfur-free hydrogen at 493 K.) The typical extended terraces in
these previous experiments were completely static. In contrast,
in the sulfur-containing hydrogen gas, time-dependent changes
could be seen in successive STM images (Fig. 5). For example,
one of the small mesas in Fig. 5(a) (arrow) had shrunk 3 min later
in Fig. 5(b). Apparently, the surface structure was fluctuating on a

minute timescale (see also the movie in the supplement). Also the
fringes at the step edges, dynamic effects generally observed in this
temperature range and indicating mobility of step atoms, were
much stronger than usual, suggesting enhanced fluctuations. We
attribute these fluctuations to adsorbed S atoms on the surface.
Here we follow the explanation of previous observations of a
sulfur-enhanced self-diffusion of metal surfaces [1921]. That the
S atoms were not resolved is consistent with the low surface diffu-
sion barrier of S on Co(0001) of only 0.2 eV [13] and the resulting
high mobility at 493 K.
XPS recorded after the STM experiment (Fig. 2, spectra 4)
indeed showed sulfide (16% of a ML, S 2p3/2 at 161.8 eV), in addi-
tion to some carbidic (11% of a ML, 283.5 eV) and graphitic carbon
(5% of a ML, 284.4 eV). The oxygen signals at 529.7 and 530.8 eV
(12% of a ML) again were most likely caused by the rest moisture
in the H2 that adsorbed during evacuation of the chamber after
the reaction and decomposed to give adsorbed oxygen. The oxygen
peaks were also observed in experiments with sulfur-free hydro-
gen, but with higher intensities (corresponding to 19% of a ML,
Fig. 2, spectra 5), presumably because of the absent blocking of sur-
face sites by the adsorbed sulfur [23]. [Carbon coverages (Fig. 2,
spectra 5) were low, with 5% of a ML at 283.3 eV and 2% of a ML
at 284.6 eV.]
In a second experiment, it was attempted to monitor changes of
the surface state present in the hydrogen-only atmosphere when
CO was added in a second step. Fig. 6 shows two STM images in
10 mbar sulfur-containing hydrogen at 493 K, recorded 30 and
90 min after additional 2.5 mbar of CO had been introduced
[Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. The CO immediately resulted in an alignment
of most of the step edges along the h2 
1 
10i directions. (The initial
restructuring was too fast to be resolved by STM.) The surface
structure had thus developed toward the structure seen in
Fig. 4(a) that was directly recorded in the syngas mixture. After
30 min, the surface was largely covered by a disordered structure,
except for small areas showing a (p19  p19)R23.4 structure [in-
set of Fig. 6(a)] and stripes parallel to the straight steps. After
90 min,
the
structure
had
transformed
into
a
relatively
well-defined stripe phase [Fig. 6(b)]. Like in Fig. 4(b), the stripes
were always oriented along the h2 
1 
10i directions. In the subse-
quent XPS (Fig. 2, spectra 6), the coverages were 41% of a ML of sul-
fide (S 2p3/2 at 161.8 eV), 17% of a ML of carbidic carbon
(283.6 eV), and 6% of a ML of graphitic carbon (284.5 eV). Hence,
the characteristic surface morphology and the immobile structures
on the terraces in the poisoned state did do not yet form in the
sulfur-containing hydrogen alone but only after CO had been
added.

A characteristic of the poisoned surface state was its stability
during pump down and cooling to room temperature. In experi-
ments, in which sulfur-free hydrogen had been used, STM images
recorded thereafter showed the formation of adsorbed clusters
and, in parts, of a disordered, ill-defined surface structure that
was different from the state under in situ conditions. (For this
reason, the XP spectra recorded after transfer to the UHV chamber
cannot be expected to show the unchanged composition of the sur-
face in the in situ experiments.) In contrast, the STM images of
Fig. 7, recorded after evacuation and cooling to room temperature
after the in situ experiments using sulfur-containing hydrogen
(Figs. 4 and 6), showed the same type of small terraces, aligned

steps, and the stripe phase as the surface under high-pressure
high-temperature conditions. The state of the surface was thus
preserved, meaning that the surface was not only passivated for
the reaction, but also for the changes during removal of the gas
phase and lowering of the temperature.
3.3. H2S adsorption experiments
Finally, H2S adsorption experiments were performed in a sepa-
rate chamber to compare possible sulfur structures with the
structures resolved in situ. Fig. 8 shows an STM image of the
Co(0001)
sample,
recorded
in
UHV,
after
dosing
6 L
(1 L = 1.3  106 mbar  s) of H2S at 300 K and flash annealing to
650 K to desorb the hydrogen. The surface was fully covered by a
stable, partially ordered structure. Structures that could be identi-
fied were a hexagonal pattern that appears similar to the
(p19  p19)R23.4 structure described above and two different
types of stripes. One type represents domain boundaries of the
(p19  p19)R23.4 structure [Fig. 8(c) arrow], whereas the other
stripes [Fig. 8(b)] were oriented in the close-packed h2 
1 
10i direc-
tions. [They did not display a (2  2) structure, but a rectangular
motif, the symmetry of which could not be evaluated.] The surface
structures were thus similar to the structures seen in the in situ
experiments under syngas (Figs. 4 and 6). On the other hand, the
terraces did not display the regular shapes with oriented steps seen
under syngas and were not as small (Figs. 4 and 6).
AES showed a strong sulfur peak but also a carbon signal (20% of
the sulfur peak intensity) which we attribute to coadsorption of a
carbon compound during H2S dosing (no oxygen peak was seen).
In these preliminary H2S adsorption experiments, we have not
been able to prevent coadsorption of carbon, most likely from
CO. That the known (2  2)S structure was not observed we thus
explain by coadsorbed carbon atoms.
3.4. Discussion
The STM data, recorded under syngas with sulfur-containing
hydrogen, showed that the catalytic deactivation measured by
QMS was connected with two distinct differences to the data
obtained with sulfur-free hydrogen: The originally flat surface
had restructured into many small terraces, and the terraces were
covered by a stable, partially ordered surface phase.
We attribute the stable surface phase to a mixed layer of sulfur
and carbon atoms. This conclusion is mainly based on the experi-
ment in which CO was added in a second step to an atmosphere
of sulfur-containing H2. The characteristic surface phase, resolved
under poisoned conditions, only occurred in syngas, i.e., in the
presence of a carbon source, not in the sulfur-containing hydrogen
alone. The poisoned state of the surface is thus not a pure layer of S
atoms, in contrast to the general assumption about sulfur poison-
ing of the FischerTropsch cobalt catalyst. A mixed S/C layer is con-
sistent with a higher C 1s signal after the syngas experiments than
after the hydrogen-only experiment. It is also consistent with the
fact that only a part of the surface was covered by a (2  2) phase,
the known overlayer structure of adsorbed S atoms. The other
phase, a (p19  p19)R23.4 structure is not known for S atoms
on Co(0001), suggesting that it is not a pure sulfur phase. That
the same structure was observed in the H2S adsorption experiment
can be explained by carbon coadsorption that occurred in this
experiment.
However, the data confirm the assumption that in the poisoned
state the surface of the Co FischerTropsch catalyst is fully covered,
corresponding to a nonselective poisoning mechanism, which so
far was only based on indirect evidence. In the in situ STM experi-
ments, in which defined structures were resolved, the adsorbate
layer was in fact dense and homogeneous. The layer covered the
terraces up to the step edges, without visible gaps, so that even

the enhanced step density in the presence of sulfur did not com-
pensate for the reduced activity. Of course, it cannot be ruled out
that at lower sulfur coverages an additional selective poisoning
mechanism of step sites comes into play. Steps are probably the
active sites for the dissociation of the CO molecules.
The restructuring of the surface into many small terraces in the
poisoned state is surprising. It contrasts with the unchanged flat
morphology in experiments in which sulfur-free hydrogen had
been used [23]. The contrasting findings of the two experi-
mentsunder the chosen methanation conditions in the 10 mbar
pressure regime and at high H2:CO ratiosare exactly opposite to
the previous model of the activation of Co FischerTropsch cata-
lysts. This model suggested that the flat, close-packed surface is
hardly active and that the activation is related to a surface rough-
ening [29,30]. This discrepancy is currently unresolved.
The most likely explanation for the sulfur-induced roughening
observed in our experiments is the formation of a surface phase
with a different density of cobalt atoms than the original metal
surface, as would be the case if, e.g., a cobalt sulfide layer had
formed. Such a phase transition on the surface would be connected
with 2-D mass transport of Co atoms to balance the density
change, leading to the formation of holes in the original terraces
or to the deposition of material in the form of new terraces, as seen
in the data. However, bulk CoS is thermodynamically not stable in
a hydrogen atmosphere with an H2S content below 1 ppm and
thus not very likely [31]. It is also kinetically hard to form.
According to DFT calculations, the activation barrier for a sulfur
atom to move to a subsurface site, a step possibly connected with
bulk CoS formation, is very high (2.03 eV) [32]. We suggest instead
that a reconstruction of the Co(0001) surface is involved. The
observed phase is thus not a simple layer of adsorbed S and C
atoms on the unchanged Co(0001) surface, but involves Co atoms.
A reconstruction may also account for the relatively high maxi-
mum sulfur coverage of 41% of a ML observed after the syngas
experiments.
An enhanced surface self-diffusion in the presence of S atoms,
which was expected from previous investigations [1921], was in
fact observed in the form of strong terrace fluctuations. However,
the effect was only observed as long as only S atoms were present,
and it disappeared after the reconstructed S/C phase had formed
under the syngas atmosphere. This phase was quite stable,
speaking against a sulfur-induced sintering effect as a possible
deactivation mechanism.
4. Conclusions
Using high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmo-
sphere, first direct insight into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model
catalyst by sulfur was obtained. In the methanation limit of
the
FischerTropsch
reaction
[T = 493 K,
ptotal = 14.5 mbar,
p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1], and using hydrogen containing <0.5 ppm of
sulfur compounds, the sample was poisoned under conditions
under
which
methanation
had
been
observed
before
with
sulfur-free hydrogen. The STM data showed that in the poisoned
state the originally flat surface had restructured into many small
terraces with diameters of only several 10 Å. This roughening con-
trasts with a widespread model of the FischerTropsch reaction
according to which a surface roughening is related to the formation
of the active state of the Co catalyst. If this discrepancy persists
under more realistic FischerTropsch conditions has to be shown
in experiments under higher syngas pressures and at lower
p(H2):p(CO) ratios. A second finding of the in situ STM experiments
was that the terraces were fully covered by a stable structure, sug-
gesting a nonselective poisoning mechanism. The structure dis-
played stripes partially showing a (2  2) structure and small
areas with an ordered (p19  p19)R23.4 structure. XP spectra,
taken after transfer of the sample to UHV, showed sulfur coverages
up to 41% of a ML and significant amounts of carbon. Together with
STM experiments, in which H2 and CO were introduced sequen-
tially, this indicated a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state,
rather than a simple overlayer of adsorbed S atoms. The roughen-
ing suggested that, in addition, a surface reconstruction was
involved in the poisoned state.
