[1] "Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the more active of the two components (in our case Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at very low concentrations [0.01 monolayer (ML)] and (ii) atoms of the more active component (Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers or trimers are present at low coverage."

[2] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[3] "Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu surface. The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[4] "Inspired by this vastly different energetic landscape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption, we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations by using two probe molecules: styrene and acetylene."

[5] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Low concentration of active metal: SAAs contain a very low concentration (0.01 ML) of the more active metal (Pd) in the host metal surface (Cu).

2. Thermodynamic stability: The active metal atoms are more stable when surrounded by the host metal, preventing the formation of dimers or trimers.

3. Improved H2 activation: A small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active for H2 uptake, allowing dissociation on Pd atoms and spillover onto Cu terraces.

4. Lowered activation barrier: Single Pd atoms in Cu(111) lower the activation barrier for H2 dissociation while maintaining weak binding of hydrogen atoms.

5. Bifunctional surface: The SAA creates a surface where different regions facilitate different steps in the reaction - Pd atoms activate hydrogen, while Cu areas provide weak binding sites for hydrogenation.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Reaction conditions: Low-temperature operation (e.g., 85 K for H2 uptake) to maintain the atomic dispersion of the active metal.

2. Metal properties: The active metal should have a lower dissociation barrier for reactants (e.g., H2) compared to the host metal.

3. Concentration control: Maintaining a very low concentration of the active metal to ensure isolated atomic dispersion.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAAs demonstrate high selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to pure metals or higher-concentration alloys.

2. Efficient use of precious metals: Only small quantities of the active metal are required, making SAAs more cost-effective.

3. Breaking scaling rules: SAAs can overcome the limitations of the traditional trade-off between reactant activation and product binding strength.

4. Tunable reactivity: The properties of SAAs can be tailored by selecting appropriate metal combinations and concentrations.

These principles can potentially be applied to various catalyst systems to improve selectivity and efficiency in different reactions.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 活性金属低浓度：SAAs在宿主金属表面含有非常低浓度（0.01 ML）的更活性金属（Pd）。

2. 热力学稳定性：活性金属原子被宿主金属包围时更稳定，防止形成二聚体或三聚体。

3. 改善H2活化：Cu表面中少量Pd原子使SAA对H2吸收更活跃，允许在Pd原子上解离并溢出到Cu台阶上。

4. 降低活化能障：Cu(111)中的单个Pd原子降低了H2解离的活化能障，同时保持了氢原子的弱结合。

5. 双功能表面：SAA创造了一个表面，其中不同区域促进反应的不同步骤 - Pd原子活化氢，而Cu区域提供弱结合位点用于加氢。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 反应条件：低温操作（例如，H2吸收温度为85 K）以维持活性金属的原子分散。

2. 金属性质：活性金属应具有比宿主金属更低的反应物（如H2）解离能障。

3. 浓度控制：保持活性金属的极低浓度，以确保孤立的原子分散。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 改善选择性：与纯金属或高浓度合金相比，SAAs在加氢反应中表现出高选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用：仅需少量活性金属，使SAAs更具成本效益。

3. 打破扩展规则：SAAs可以克服传统反应物活化和产物结合强度之间权衡的限制。

4. 可调反应性：通过选择适当的金属组合和浓度，可以定制SAAs的性质。

这些原理可能适用于各种催化剂系统，以改善不同反应中的选择性和效率。
