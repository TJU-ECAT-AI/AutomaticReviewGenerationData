[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."

[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."

[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."

[4] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

[5] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by:

1. Lowering the energy barrier for hydrogen uptake and desorption on the Cu surface.

2. Facilitating facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites while maintaining weak binding to Cu.

3. Creating a bifunctional surface where Pd atoms activate hydrogen, which then populates Cu areas for effective hydrogenation.

4. Allowing for very selective hydrogenation compared to pure Cu or Pd metal alone.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Using small quantities of catalytically active metal atoms (e.g., 1% Pd) in a less reactive metal host (e.g., Cu).

2. Ensuring the active metal atoms remain isolated and dispersed in the host surface.

3. Selecting metal combinations that provide complementary functions (e.g., H2 activation and weak binding).

4. Considering reaction conditions that maintain the stability of the SAA structure.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

2. Efficient use of precious metals, making them more cost-effective.

3. Ability to optimize both facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates simultaneously, which is typically difficult to achieve with traditional catalysts.

4. Potential to break scaling rules by separating the functions of reactant activation and product formation on different surface sites.

5. Applicability across various catalyst systems, offering a new approach to catalyst design.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下方式增强选择性氢化反应的催化性能：

1. 降低Cu表面氢气吸附和脱附的能量障碍。

2. 在Pd原子位点促进氢气的易解离，同时保持与Cu的弱结合。

3. 创造一个双功能表面，其中Pd原子活化氢气，然后氢原子扩散到Cu区域进行有效的氢化。

4. 与纯Cu或Pd金属相比，实现更高选择性的氢化。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 在低反应性金属主体（如Cu）中使用少量催化活性金属原子（如1%的Pd）。

2. 确保活性金属原子在主体表面保持孤立和分散状态。

3. 选择具有互补功能的金属组合（例如，H2活化和弱结合）。

4. 考虑能够维持SAA结构稳定性的反应条件。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 提高氢化反应的选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用，使其更具成本效益。

3. 能够同时优化反应物的易解离和中间体的弱结合，这通常难以用传统催化剂实现。

4. 有潜力打破定标规则，通过在不同的表面位点分离反应物活化和产物形成的功能。

5. 适用于各种催化剂系统，为催化剂设计提供新方法。
