[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."

[2] "Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the more active of the two components (in our case Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at very low concentrations [0.01 monolayer (ML)] and (ii) atoms of the more active component (Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers or trimers are present at low coverage."

[3] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[4] "Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu surface. The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[5] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by combining the beneficial properties of both metals. The Pd atoms provide low-energy dissociation sites for H2, while the Cu surface weakly binds the resulting hydrogen atoms, allowing for efficient hydrogenation.

The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentration of the active metal (e.g., 0.01 ML Pd in Cu)
2. Thermodynamic stability of isolated active metal atoms in the host metal surface
3. Ability of the active metal to dissociate reactants (e.g., H2)
4. Weak binding of intermediates on the host metal surface

Reaction conditions should allow for the maintenance of the SAA structure, typically at lower temperatures compared to traditional catalysts.

The specific advantages of SAAs over traditional catalysts include:

1. Improved selectivity due to the absence of larger ensembles of the active metal
2. Efficient use of precious metals, as only small quantities are required
3. Ability to break scaling relationships between reactant activation and product desorption
4. Creation of bifunctional surfaces with different regions facilitating different reaction steps

SAAs can improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by providing a unique combination of facile reactant dissociation and weak binding of intermediates, which is difficult to achieve with traditional catalysts.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过结合两种金属的有益特性来增强选择性加氢反应的催化性能。Pd原子提供了H2的低能量解离位点，而Cu表面则弱结合所产生的氢原子，从而实现高效的加氢。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 活性金属的低浓度（例如，Cu中0.01 ML的Pd）
2. 活性金属原子在宿主金属表面的热力学稳定性
3. 活性金属解离反应物（如H2）的能力
4. 中间体在宿主金属表面的弱结合

反应条件应允许保持SAA结构，通常比传统催化剂的温度更低。

SAA相对于传统催化剂的具体优势包括：

1. 由于缺少较大的活性金属集合体，选择性得到提高
2. 贵金属的高效利用，因为只需要少量
3. 能够打破反应物活化和产物脱附之间的比例关系
4. 创建具有不同区域促进不同反应步骤的双功能表面

SAA可以通过提供易于实现的反应物解离和中间体弱结合的独特组合来提高各种催化剂系统的选择性，这在传统催化剂中很难实现。
