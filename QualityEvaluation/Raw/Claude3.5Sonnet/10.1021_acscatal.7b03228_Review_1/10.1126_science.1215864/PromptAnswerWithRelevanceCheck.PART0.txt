[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."

[2] "Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the more active of the two components (in our case Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at very low concentrations [0.01 monolayer (ML)] and (ii) atoms of the more active component (Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers or trimers are present at low coverage."

[3] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[4] "Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu surface. The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[5] "Inspired by this vastly different energetic landscape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption, we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations by using two probe molecules: styrene and acetylene."

[6] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Lowering activation barriers: Single Pd atoms in the Cu surface lower the activation barrier for H2 dissociation, making the surface active for hydrogen uptake.

2. Weak binding of intermediates: The Cu host surface weakly binds hydrogen atoms, allowing them to participate in hydrogenation reactions more readily.

3. Spillover effect: Hydrogen can dissociate on Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu terraces, creating a larger active surface area.

4. Bifunctional surface: The SAA creates a surface where different regions facilitate different steps in the reaction - Pd atoms activate hydrogen, while Cu areas provide sites for weakly bound hydrogen to participate in hydrogenation.

5. Low-temperature activity: The combination of easy H2 activation and weak binding allows for efficient hydrogenation at lower temperatures.

The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentration of active metal: The more active component (e.g., Pd) should be present at very low concentrations (around 0.01 monolayer).

2. Thermodynamic stability: The active metal atoms should be more stable when surrounded by the host metal, preventing the formation of dimers or trimers.

3. Complementary properties: The active metal should facilitate reactant activation, while the host metal should provide suitable binding properties for intermediates.

4. Reaction conditions: Low-temperature operation may be possible due to the unique properties of SAAs.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAAs can offer higher selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to pure metals or traditional alloys.

2. Efficient use of precious metals: Very small quantities of the active metal can significantly influence catalytic properties, making SAAs more cost-effective.

3. Breaking scaling rules: SAAs can potentially overcome the limitations of the traditional scaling relationships between reactant activation and product desorption.

4. Tunable reactivity: By carefully selecting the active and host metals, the reactivity can be fine-tuned for specific reactions.

5. Reduced side reactions: The isolated nature of active sites can minimize unwanted side reactions and decomposition of reactants.

These principles can potentially be applied across various catalyst systems by selecting appropriate metal combinations based on their individual properties and the desired reaction characteristics.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 降低活化能垒：Cu表面上的单个Pd原子降低了H2解离的活化能垒，使表面对氢气吸收变得活跃。

2. 中间体弱结合：Cu宿主表面弱结合氢原子，使它们能更容易参与加氢反应。

3. 溢出效应：氢气可以在Pd单原子实体上解离，然后溢出到裸露的Cu台阶上，创造更大的活性表面积。

4. 双功能表面：SAA创造了一个表面，其中不同区域促进反应的不同步骤 - Pd原子激活氢气，而Cu区域提供弱结合氢参与加氢的位点。

5. 低温活性：易于H2活化和弱结合的组合允许在较低温度下进行高效加氢。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

2. 热力学稳定性：活性金属原子被宿主金属包围时应更稳定，防止形成二聚体或三聚体。

3. 互补性能：活性金属应促进反应物活化，而宿主金属应为中间体提供适当的结合性能。

4. 反应条件：由于SAA的独特性质，可能实现低温操作。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 提高选择性：与纯金属或传统合金相比，SAA可以在加氢反应中提供更高的选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用：极少量的活性金属就可以显著影响催化性能，使SAA更具成本效益。

3. 打破定标规则：SAA可能克服传统反应物活化与产物脱附之间定标关系的限制。

4. 可调节反应性：通过仔细选择活性和宿主金属，可以为特定反应微调反应性。

5. 减少副反应：活性位点的孤立性可以最小化不需要的副反应和反应物的分解。

这些原理可以潜在地应用于各种催化剂系统，通过根据各个金属的性质和所需的反应特性选择适当的金属组合。

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by combining the beneficial properties of both metals. The Pd atoms provide low-energy dissociation sites for H2, while the Cu surface weakly binds the resulting hydrogen atoms, allowing for efficient hydrogenation.

The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Low concentration of the active metal (e.g., 0.01 ML Pd in Cu)
2. Thermodynamic stability of isolated active metal atoms in the host metal surface
3. Ability of the active metal to dissociate reactants (e.g., H2)
4. Weak binding of intermediates on the host metal surface

Reaction conditions should allow for the maintenance of the SAA structure, typically at lower temperatures compared to traditional catalysts.

The specific advantages of SAAs over traditional catalysts include:

1. Improved selectivity due to the absence of larger ensembles of the active metal
2. Efficient use of precious metals, as only small quantities are required
3. Ability to break scaling relationships between reactant activation and product desorption
4. Creation of bifunctional surfaces with different regions facilitating different reaction steps

SAAs can improve selectivity across various catalyst systems by providing a unique combination of facile reactant dissociation and weak binding of intermediates, which is difficult to achieve with traditional catalysts.

1. Lowered energy barriers: Isolated Pd atoms in the Cu surface substantially reduce the energy barrier for both hydrogen uptake and desorption from the metal surface.

2. Facile hydrogen dissociation: Pd atom sites enable easy hydrogen dissociation, while the surrounding Cu surface binds hydrogen weakly.

2. Low concentrations of the active metal: Small quantities of the precious metal are sufficient, making SAAs economically attractive.

3. Atomic dispersion: The active metal atoms should be isolated and well-dispersed in the host metal surface.

4. Stability under reaction conditions: The SAA structure should be maintained at operating temperatures and in the presence of reactants.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAAs demonstrate higher selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to pure metals or traditional alloys.

2. Economic efficiency: SAAs require significantly less precious metal than conventional catalysts.

3. Tunability: The properties of SAAs can be fine-tuned by adjusting the combination and ratio of metals used.

4. Breaking scaling relations: SAAs can potentially overcome limitations in catalyst design by decoupling reactant activation and product formation steps.

5. Synergistic effects: Different components of the catalyst serve specific functions in the overall reaction mechanism.

The ability of SAAs to break scaling rules and improve selectivity can potentially be extended to various catalyst systems beyond Pd/Cu, opening new possibilities for designing highly efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions.
