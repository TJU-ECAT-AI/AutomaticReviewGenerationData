[1] "Isolated Metal Atom Geometries as a Strategy for Selective Heterogeneous Hydrogenations"

[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."

[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."

[4] "Our recent work provides evidence that, in the Pt catalyzed water-gas shift reaction, it is not the metal nanoparticle as such but an ionic species stabilized on the surface of the oxide support that functions as the active site for catalytic turnover"

[5] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[6] "The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[7] "Inspired by this vastly different energetic landscape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption, we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations by using two probe molecules: styrene and acetylene."

[8] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Lowered energy barriers: Isolated Pd atoms in the Cu surface substantially reduce the energy barrier for both hydrogen uptake and desorption from the metal surface.

2. Facile hydrogen dissociation: Pd atom sites enable easy hydrogen dissociation, while the surrounding Cu surface binds hydrogen weakly.

3. Spillover effect: Hydrogen can dissociate on Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu terraces, increasing the available reactive hydrogen.

4. Bifunctional surface: The SAA creates a surface where different regions facilitate different steps in the reaction - Pd atoms activate hydrogen, while Cu areas weakly bind it for effective hydrogenation.

5. Low-temperature activity: The unique energetic landscape allows for low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Careful selection of metal combinations: The active metal (e.g., Pd) should be able to activate the desired reactant (e.g., H2), while the host metal (e.g., Cu) should provide weak binding sites.

2. Low concentrations of the active metal: Small quantities of the precious metal are sufficient, making SAAs economically attractive.

3. Atomic dispersion: The active metal atoms should be isolated and well-dispersed in the host metal surface.

4. Stability under reaction conditions: The SAA structure should be maintained at operating temperatures and in the presence of reactants.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAAs demonstrate higher selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to pure metals or traditional alloys.

2. Economic efficiency: SAAs require significantly less precious metal than conventional catalysts.

3. Tunability: The properties of SAAs can be fine-tuned by adjusting the combination and ratio of metals used.

4. Breaking scaling relations: SAAs can potentially overcome limitations in catalyst design by decoupling reactant activation and product formation steps.

5. Synergistic effects: Different components of the catalyst serve specific functions in the overall reaction mechanism.

The ability of SAAs to break scaling rules and improve selectivity can potentially be extended to various catalyst systems beyond Pd/Cu, opening new possibilities for designing highly efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions.

单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下几种机制提高了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 降低能量障碍：Cu表面中的isolated Pd原子显著降低了氢气吸附和脱附的能量障碍。

2. 容易的氢气解离：Pd原子位点使氢气容易解离，而周围的Cu表面与氢的结合较弱。

3. 溢出效应：氢可以在Pd单原子实体上解离，然后溢出到裸露的Cu台阶上，增加了可用的反应性氢。

4. 双功能表面：SAA创造了一个表面，其中不同区域促进反应的不同步骤 - Pd原子激活氢气，而Cu区域弱结合氢气以实现有效的加氢。

5. 低温活性：独特的能量景观允许进行低温、选择性催化加氢。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 仔细选择金属组合：活性金属（如Pd）应能激活所需的反应物（如H2），而主体金属（如Cu）应提供弱结合位点。

2. 活性金属的低浓度：少量贵金属就足够了，使SAA在经济上具有吸引力。

3. 原子分散：活性金属原子应在主体金属表面上被隔离并充分分散。

4. 反应条件下的稳定性：SAA结构应在操作温度和反应物存在的情况下保持稳定。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 提高选择性：与纯金属或传统合金相比，SAA在加氢反应中表现出更高的选择性。

2. 经济效率：SAA所需的贵金属比传统催化剂少得多。

3. 可调性：可以通过调整所使用的金属组合和比例来微调SAA的性能。

4. 打破缩放关系：SAA可能通过解耦反应物活化和产物形成步骤来克服催化剂设计的局限性。

5. 协同效应：催化剂的不同组分在整体反应机理中起特定作用。

SAA打破缩放规则和提高选择性的能力可能会扩展到Pd/Cu以外的各种催化剂系统，为设计高效和选择性的催化剂开辟了新的可能性，适用于广泛的化学反应。
