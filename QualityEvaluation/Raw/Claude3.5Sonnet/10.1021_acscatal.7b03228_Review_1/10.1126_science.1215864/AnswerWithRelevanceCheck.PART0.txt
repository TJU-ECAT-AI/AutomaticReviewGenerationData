          [1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis. However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."

[2] "Two key characteristics of SAAs are (i) the more active of the two components (in our case Pd) is present in the surface of the host metal at very low concentrations [0.01 monolayer (ML)] and (ii) atoms of the more active component (Pd) are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the host metal such that no dimers or trimers are present at low coverage."

[3] "Critically, we find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monoatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."

[4] "Our TPD data revealed that single Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface lowered the activation barrier to H2 dissociation and bound Ha weakly enough to allow it to spill over onto the Cu surface. The net effect is a surface that can easily activate H2 dissociation (as evidenced by efficient uptake at 85 K) but also bind it weakly."

[5] "Inspired by this vastly different energetic landscape for hydrogen adsorption and desorption, we investigated the capacity of Pd/Cu SAAs to perform low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations by using two probe molecules: styrene and acetylene."

[6] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals. Minority Pd atoms (1%) in a Cu surface activate hydrogen, which then populates bare Cu areas (99%) where it is weakly bound and effective for hydrogenation, yielding a bifunctional surface with different regions facilitating different steps in the reaction."

[7] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."

[8] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."

[9] "From a practical application standpoint, the small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

          Single-atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Low concentration of active metal: SAAs contain a very low concentration (0.01 ML) of the more active metal (Pd) in the host metal surface (Cu).

2. Thermodynamic stability: The active metal atoms are more stable when surrounded by the host metal, preventing the formation of dimers or trimers.

3. Lowered energy barriers: Isolated Pd atoms in the Cu surface substantially reduce the energy barrier for both hydrogen uptake and desorption from the metal surface.

4. Improved H2 activation: A small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active for H2 uptake, allowing dissociation on Pd atoms and spillover onto Cu terraces.

5. Weak binding of intermediates: The Cu surface weakly binds hydrogen atoms, allowing for efficient hydrogenation.

6. Bifunctional surface: The SAA creates a surface where different regions facilitate different steps in the reaction - Pd atoms activate hydrogen, while Cu areas provide weak binding sites for hydrogenation.

7. Low-temperature activity: The unique energetic landscape allows for low-temperature, selective catalytic hydrogenations.

Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. Careful selection of metal combinations: The active metal (e.g., Pd) should be able to activate the desired reactant (e.g., H2), while the host metal (e.g., Cu) should provide weak binding sites.

2. Low concentrations of the active metal: Small quantities (around 1%) of the precious metal are sufficient, making SAAs economically attractive.

3. Atomic dispersion: The active metal atoms should be isolated and well-dispersed in the host metal surface.

4. Reaction conditions: Low-temperature operation to maintain the atomic dispersion of the active metal.

5. Stability under reaction conditions: The SAA structure should be maintained at operating temperatures and in the presence of reactants.

Advantages over traditional catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: SAAs demonstrate higher selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to pure metals or traditional alloys.

2. Efficient use of precious metals: Only small quantities of the active metal are required, making SAAs more cost-effective.

3. Breaking scaling rules: SAAs can overcome the limitations of the traditional trade-off between reactant activation and product binding strength.

4. Tunable reactivity: The properties of SAAs can be tailored by selecting appropriate metal combinations and concentrations.

5. Synergistic effects: Different components of the catalyst serve specific functions in the overall reaction mechanism.

These principles can potentially be applied to various catalyst systems to improve selectivity and efficiency in different reactions, opening new possibilities for designing highly efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions.

          单原子合金（SAAs），特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过以下几种机制增强了选择性加氢反应的催化性能：

1. 活性金属低浓度：SAAs在宿主金属表面含有非常低浓度（0.01 ML）的更活性金属（Pd）。

2. 热力学稳定性：活性金属原子被宿主金属包围时更稳定，防止形成二聚体或三聚体。

3. 降低能量障碍：Cu表面中的isolated Pd原子显著降低了氢气吸附和脱附的能量障碍。

4. 改善H2活化：Cu表面中少量Pd原子使SAA对H2吸收更活跃，允许在Pd原子上解离并溢出到Cu台阶上。

5. 中间体弱结合：Cu表面弱结合氢原子，实现高效的加氢。

6. 双功能表面：SAA创造了一个表面，其中不同区域促进反应的不同步骤 - Pd原子活化氢，而Cu区域提供弱结合位点用于加氢。

7. 低温活性：独特的能量景观允许进行低温、选择性催化加氢。

设计成功的SAA催化剂的基本标准包括：

1. 仔细选择金属组合：活性金属（如Pd）应能激活所需的反应物（如H2），而主体金属（如Cu）应提供弱结合位点。

2. 活性金属的低浓度：少量（约1%）贵金属就足够了，使SAA在经济上具有吸引力。

3. 原子分散：活性金属原子应在主体金属表面上被隔离并充分分散。

4. 反应条件：低温操作以维持活性金属的原子分散。

5. 反应条件下的稳定性：SAA结构应在操作温度和反应物存在的情况下保持稳定。

相对于传统催化剂的优势：

1. 改善选择性：与纯金属或传统合金相比，SAAs在加氢反应中表现出更高的选择性。

2. 贵金属的高效利用：仅需少量活性金属，使SAAs更具成本效益。

3. 打破扩展规则：SAAs可以克服传统反应物活化和产物结合强度之间权衡的限制。

4. 可调反应性：通过选择适当的金属组合和浓度，可以定制SAAs的性质。

5. 协同效应：催化剂的不同组分在整体反应机理中起特定作用。

这些原理可能适用于各种催化剂系统，以改善不同反应中的选择性和效率，为设计高效和选择性的催化剂开辟了新的可能性，适用于广泛的化学反应。
