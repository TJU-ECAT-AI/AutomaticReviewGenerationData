<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about single-atom alloys, Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, or their effects on catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be about propane dehydrogenation over PtSn catalysts, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献不包含任何与回答关于单原子合金、嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子或它们对选择性氢化反应的催化性能影响的问题相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于PtSn催化剂上的丙烷脱氢，这与所提出的问题无关。因此，无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
