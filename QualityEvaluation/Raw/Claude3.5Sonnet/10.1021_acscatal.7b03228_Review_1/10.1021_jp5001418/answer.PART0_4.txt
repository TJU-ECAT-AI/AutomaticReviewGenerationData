The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about single-atom alloys, Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, or their catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a title and citation information for an article about predicting and comparing CM and OM bond strengths for adsorption on transition metal surfaces, which is not directly related to the question asked. Without access to the full text or additional information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the question based solely on the given literature.

给定的文献不包含任何与回答单原子合金、嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子或它们在选择性加氢反应中的催化性能相关的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于预测和比较过渡金属表面上CM和OM键强度吸附的文章的标题和引用信息，这与所问的问题并不直接相关。在没有获得全文或额外信息的情况下，仅凭给定的文献无法对该问题提供准确的回答。
