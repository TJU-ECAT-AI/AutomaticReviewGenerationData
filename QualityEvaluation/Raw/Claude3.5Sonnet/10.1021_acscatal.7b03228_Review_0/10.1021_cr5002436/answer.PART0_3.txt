[1] "Both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."

[2] "From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles."

[3] "A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."

[4] "DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."

Geometric and electronic effects work together synergistically in PtSn alloy catalysts to improve catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Geometrically, the addition of Sn reduces the size of Pt nanoparticles and ensembles. This suppresses undesirable side reactions like isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coke formation.

2. Electronically, Sn transfers electrons to Pt, modifying its electronic structure and adsorption properties. This alters the binding strength of reactants and intermediates.

3. The combination of these effects facilitates hydrogen diffusion on the surface while suppressing strong adsorption of coke precursors.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Carefully control alloy composition and nanoparticle size to optimize geometric effects.

2. Use promoters or support materials that can further tune the electronic properties.

3. Employ advanced characterization and computational modeling to understand and predict synergistic effects.

4. Explore new bimetallic and multimetallic combinations that may exhibit beneficial geometric-electronic synergies.

5. Design nanostructured catalysts with controlled facets and interfaces to maximize synergistic effects.

By leveraging these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, selective and stable catalysts that outperform traditional monometallic systems for reactions like dehydrogenation.

几何和电子效应在PtSn合金催化剂中协同工作，通过以下几种方式改善催化性能：

1. 从几何上看，添加Sn减小了Pt纳米颗粒和集合体的尺寸。这抑制了异构化、氢解和积碳形成等不良副反应。

2. 从电子角度看，Sn向Pt转移电子，改变其电子结构和吸附性质。这改变了反应物和中间体的结合强度。

3. 这些效应的结合促进了氢在表面上的扩散，同时抑制了积碳前体的强吸附。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂：

1. 仔细控制合金成分和纳米颗粒大小，以优化几何效应。

2. 使用可以进一步调节电子性质的助剂或支撑材料。

3. 采用先进的表征和计算模拟来理解和预测协同效应。

4. 探索可能表现出有益的几何-电子协同作用的新型双金属和多金属组合。

5. 设计具有可控晶面和界面的纳米结构催化剂，以最大化协同效应。

通过利用这些策略，研究人员可以开发出比传统单金属系统更高效、更选择性和更稳定的催化剂，用于脱氢等反应。
