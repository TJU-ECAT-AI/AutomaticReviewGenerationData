[1] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[2] "From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles."

[3] "A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."

[4] "DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Geometric effects: Adding a second metal like Sn to Pt reduces the size of Pt ensembles, suppressing undesired side reactions like isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coke formation. This improves selectivity.

2. Electronic effects: Electron transfer from Sn to Pt modifies the electronic structure of Pt, altering its adsorption properties. This can weaken the binding of reactants/intermediates, facilitating their desorption.

3. Synergistic effects: The combination of geometric and electronic effects leads to improved catalytic properties. For example, Sn addition to Pt weakens hydrocarbon binding, facilitating migration of coke precursors away from active sites. It also reduces H2 adsorption strength, improving H atom diffusion.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Rationally select metal combinations to tune both geometric and electronic effects.

2. Use advanced characterization and computational modeling to understand structure-property relationships.

3. Optimize alloy composition, particle size, and support interactions to maximize synergistic effects.

4. Develop novel synthesis methods to create well-defined bimetallic nanostructures.

5. Explore ternary or more complex alloy systems to further enhance tunability.

6. Investigate dynamic structural changes under reaction conditions to design more stable catalysts.

7. Combine alloy catalysts with other strategies like single-atom catalysts or core-shell nanoparticles.

By leveraging the synergistic geometric and electronic effects in transition metal alloys, researchers can develop highly efficient, selective, and stable catalysts that significantly outperform traditional monometallic systems across a wide range of reactions.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能的方式如下：

1. 几何效应：将锡等第二种金属添加到铂中可以减小铂集合的尺寸，抑制异构化、氢解和积炭等不良副反应。这提高了选择性。

2. 电子效应：从锡到铂的电子转移改变了铂的电子结构，改变了其吸附性质。这可以减弱反应物/中间体的结合，促进它们的脱附。

3. 协同效应：几何和电子效应的结合导致催化性质的改善。例如，向铂中添加锡可以减弱碳氢化合物的结合，促进积炭前体远离活性位点的迁移。它还降低了氢气的吸附强度，改善了氢原子的扩散。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂：

1. 合理选择金属组合，以调节几何和电子效应。

2. 使用先进的表征和计算模拟来理解结构-性能关系。

3. 优化合金成分、粒子大小和载体相互作用，以最大化协同效应。

4. 开发新型合成方法，创造出明确定义的双金属纳米结构。

5. 探索三元或更复杂的合金系统，以进一步增强可调性。

6. 研究反应条件下的动态结构变化，设计更稳定的催化剂。

7. 将合金催化剂与其他策略结合，如单原子催化剂或核壳纳米粒子。

通过利用过渡金属合金中的协同几何和电子效应，研究人员可以开发出高效、高选择性和高稳定性的催化剂，在各种反应中显著优于传统的单金属系统。
