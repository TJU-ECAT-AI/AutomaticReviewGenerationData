[1] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[2] "From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles. Notably, the formation of a platinumtin alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles."

[3] "A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."

[4] "DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Geometric effects: The formation of alloys or partial covering of one metal by another creates smaller metal ensembles. This can suppress undesired reactions like isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coke formation.

2. Electronic effects: Electron transfer between alloyed metals alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties. For example, tin transfers electrons to platinum's 5d band, modifying its behavior.

3. Synergistic interplay: The combination of geometric and electronic effects leads to multiple benefits, such as suppressing side reactions, minimizing sintering, neutralizing support acidity, and facilitating coke diffusion.

4. Adsorption properties: Alloying can alter adsorption strengths of reactants and intermediates. For instance, tin addition to platinum reduces hydrogen adsorption strength, potentially facilitating its diffusion.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Rational alloy design: Carefully select metal combinations that provide complementary geometric and electronic effects to enhance desired reactions while suppressing unwanted ones.

2. Controlled synthesis: Develop methods to precisely control alloy composition, particle size, and structure to optimize the balance between geometric and electronic effects.

3. Advanced characterization: Utilize in-situ and operando techniques to understand how geometric and electronic properties evolve under reaction conditions.

4. Computational screening: Use DFT and machine learning to predict alloy combinations with optimal geometric and electronic properties for specific reactions.

5. Support engineering: Design supports that enhance the stability of alloy nanoparticles and complement their catalytic properties.

6. Dynamic systems: Explore alloys that can adapt their geometric and electronic properties in response to reaction conditions for improved performance and longevity.

By leveraging these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts across a wide range of applications.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应以多种方式协同影响催化性能：

1. 几何效应：合金的形成或一种金属部分覆盖另一种金属会创造更小的金属集合体。这可以抑制异构化、氢解和积炭等不需要的反应。

2. 电子效应：合金化金属之间的电子转移改变了吸附和催化性质。例如，锡向铂的5d带转移电子，改变了其行为。

3. 协同作用：几何和电子效应的结合带来多重益处，如抑制副反应、最小化烧结、中和载体酸性和促进积炭扩散。

4. 吸附性质：合金化可以改变反应物和中间体的吸附强度。例如，向铂添加锡会降低氢的吸附强度，可能有助于其扩散。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化系统：

1. 理性合金设计：仔细选择金属组合，提供互补的几何和电子效应，以增强所需反应同时抑制不需要的反应。
