[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the √3 alloy."

[3] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "We propose a simple model for hydrogen adsorption to explain these changes."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Opening new reaction pathways: Alloying Sn with Pt(111) creates a new hydrogenation pathway that selectively produces butene, which is not observed on pure Pt(111).

2. Tuning activation energies: The (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy shows the highest conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene due to the closely matched desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene. This matching leads to high coverages of both reactants at elevated temperatures, enhancing reaction rates.

3. Modifying adsorption properties: The alloys exhibit different site-blocking effects for hydrogen adsorption compared to pure Pt(111), which can be explained by a proposed model of hydrogen adsorption on the alloy surfaces.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Fine-tuning alloy composition: Controlling the Sn concentration in supported SnPt catalysts can optimize the synergy between reactant adsorption and reaction kinetics.

2. Designing alloy structures: Creating specific surface arrangements, such as the (2 × 2) or √3 structures, can tailor the catalyst's electronic and geometric properties for desired reactions.

3. Balancing competing reactions: By carefully adjusting the alloy composition, it's possible to balance competing reactions (e.g., hydrogenation vs. desorption) to maximize selectivity and efficiency.

4. Exploiting site-blocking effects: Understanding and utilizing the unique site-blocking properties of alloys can help control reactant coverages and influence reaction pathways.

These strategies can lead to the development of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by leveraging the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic factors in transition-metal alloys.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 开辟新的反应途径：将Sn与Pt(111)合金化创造了一种新的氢化途径，可选择性地生产丁烯，这在纯Pt(111)上是观察不到的。

2. 调节活化能：(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)合金显示出最高的1,3-丁二烯到丁烯的转化率，这是由于H2和1,3-丁二烯的脱附活化能非常接近。这种匹配导致在较高温度下两种反应物都有高覆盖度，从而提高反应速率。

3. 修改吸附性质：与纯Pt(111)相比，合金对氢吸附表现出不同的位阻效应，这可以通过提出的合金表面氢吸附模型来解释。

利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括：

1. 精细调节合金成分：通过控制负载型SnPt催化剂中的Sn浓度，可以优化反应物吸附和反应动力学之间的协同作用。

2. 设计合金结构：创建特定的表面排列，如(2 × 2)或√3结构，可以为所需反应量身定制催化剂的电子和几何性质。

3. 平衡竞争反应：通过仔细调整合金成分，可以平衡竞争反应（如氢化vs脱附），以最大化选择性和效率。

4. 利用位阻效应：理解和利用合金的独特位阻性质可以帮助控制反应物覆盖度并影响反应途径。

这些策略可以通过利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子因素的协同效应，开发出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统。
