[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the √3 alloy."

[3] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111)"

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Alloying can open new reaction pathways, as seen with Sn/Pt(111) alloys enabling selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene to butene, which does not occur on pure Pt(111).

2. The composition and structure of the alloy surface can tune the relative activation energies of different processes. For example, the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy shows higher conversion due to matching desorption energies of reactants.

3. Alloys can modify adsorption properties, as evidenced by the reduced hydrogen pre-coverage needed to block 1,3-butadiene adsorption on Sn/Pt(111) alloys compared to pure Pt(111).

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalysts:

1. Fine-tune alloy composition and surface structure to optimize the balance of adsorption strengths and activation energies for desired reactions.

2. Use the altered electronic properties of alloys to selectively activate certain bonds or create new reaction pathways.

3. Leverage geometric effects, such as altered binding sites or ensemble effects, to control reactant coverage and orientation.

4. Develop methods to precisely control alloy composition and structure at the nanoscale to maximize beneficial synergistic effects.

5. Combine computational modeling with experimental studies to predict and design alloy catalysts with optimal geometric and electronic properties for specific reactions.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应以几种方式协同影响催化性能：

1. 合金化可以开辟新的反应途径，如Sn/Pt(111)合金能够选择性地将1,3-丁二烯氢化为丁烯，而纯Pt(111)上不会发生这种反应。

2. 合金表面的成分和结构可以调节不同过程的相对活化能。例如，(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)合金由于反应物的脱附能匹配而表现出更高的转化率。

3. 合金可以修改吸附性质，这从Sn/Pt(111)合金上阻断1,3-丁二烯吸附所需的氢预覆盖量比纯Pt(111)少得多这一事实得到证实。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化剂：

1. 微调合金成分和表面结构，以优化所需反应的吸附强度和活化能的平衡。

2. 利用合金的改变的电子性质来选择性地活化某些键或创造新的反应途径。

3. 利用几何效应，如改变的结合位点或集合效应，来控制反应物覆盖率和取向。

4. 开发在纳米尺度上精确控制合金成分和结构的方法，以最大化有益的协同效应。

5. 将计算机模拟与实验研究相结合，预测和设计具有最佳几何和电子性质的合金催化剂，用于特定反应。

这些策略可以导致与传统单金属体系相比，具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。
