[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the √3 alloy."

[3] "This synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111)"

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by creating new reaction pathways and altering adsorption/desorption energetics. This is exemplified by the Sn/Pt(111) alloys studied, which open a new selective hydrogenation pathway for 1,3-butadiene not present on pure Pt(111).

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tuning alloy composition to match desorption energies of reactants, as seen with the (2x2) Sn/Pt alloy showing highest conversion due to matching H2 and 1,3-butadiene desorption energies.

2. Controlling site-blocking effects through alloy formation, as Sn/Pt alloys require much less hydrogen to block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption compared to pure Pt.

3. Optimizing surface alloy structure to create specific active sites, as different Sn/Pt surface alloys showed varying reactivity and selectivity.

4. Fine-tuning elemental concentrations in supported catalysts to maximize synergistic effects, as suggested for practical Sn-Pt catalysts.

These strategies can lead to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems by allowing precise control over surface reactivity and adsorption properties, potentially outperforming traditional monometallic catalysts in various applications.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过创造新的反应途径和改变吸附/脱附能量来协同影响催化性能。这在所研究的Sn/Pt(111)合金中得到了体现，这些合金为1,3-丁二烯开辟了一条在纯Pt(111)上不存在的新的选择性加氢途径。

利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括：

1. 调整合金组成以匹配反应物的脱附能，如(2x2) Sn/Pt合金由于H2和1,3-丁二烯脱附能的匹配而显示出最高的转化率。

2. 通过合金形成控制位阻效应，因为Sn/Pt合金需要的氢气量远少于纯Pt来阻止1,3-丁二烯的化学吸附。

3. 优化表面合金结构以创造特定的活性位点，因为不同的Sn/Pt表面合金显示出不同的反应活性和选择性。

4. 精细调节负载型催化剂中的元素浓度以最大化协同效应，如对实际Sn-Pt催化剂的建议。

这些策略可以通过精确控制表面反应活性和吸附性质，导致更高效、更具选择性和可调节的催化系统，在各种应用中可能优于传统的单金属催化剂。
