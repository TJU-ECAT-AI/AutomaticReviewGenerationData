          [1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the √3 alloy."

[3] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111)"

          The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. New reaction pathways: Alloying Sn with Pt(111) creates a new hydrogenation pathway that selectively produces butene, which is not observed on pure Pt(111).

2. Tuning of activation energies: The (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy shows higher conversion rates due to the matching of desorption activation energies for H2 and 1,3-butadiene, creating a synergistic effect.

3. Control of surface coverage: The alloy structure affects the coverage of reactants at high temperatures, which can be optimized by controlling the Sn concentration.

4. Site-blocking effects: Alloying changes the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption, allowing for more efficient use of the catalyst surface.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems include:

1. Optimize alloy composition: Fine-tune the Sn concentration to maximize the synergy between reactant desorption energies and surface coverage.

2. Engineer surface structure: Design alloy surfaces with specific atomic arrangements to create desired reaction pathways and site-blocking effects.

3. Develop multi-component alloys: Explore combinations of different metals to further enhance selectivity and efficiency.

4. Use computational modeling: Employ theoretical calculations to predict and design alloy structures with optimal geometric and electronic properties.

5. Apply in-situ characterization: Use advanced spectroscopic techniques to study the dynamic behavior of alloy catalysts under reaction conditions.

6. Control site-blocking effects: Utilize the unique site-blocking properties of alloys to fine-tune reactant coverages and influence reaction pathways.

These strategies can lead to the development of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by leveraging the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic factors in transition-metal alloys.

          过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 新的反应途径：将Sn与Pt(111)合金化创造了一种新的氢化途径，可选择性地生产丁烯，这在纯Pt(111)上是观察不到的。

2. 激活能的调节：(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)合金由于H2和1,3-丁二烯的脱附激活能匹配，显示出更高的转化率，产生协同效应。

3. 表面覆盖率控制：合金结构影响高温下反应物的覆盖率，可以通过控制Sn浓度进行优化。

4. 位阻效应：合金化改变了阻止1,3-丁二烯化学吸附所需的预吸附氢的量，从而更有效地利用催化剂表面。

利用这种相互作用设计更高效催化系统的创新策略包括：

1. 优化合金组成：精细调节Sn浓度，以最大化反应物脱附能和表面覆盖率之间的协同作用。

2. 工程表面结构：设计具有特定原子排列的合金表面，以创造所需的反应途径和位阻效应。

3. 开发多组分合金：探索不同金属的组合，以进一步提高选择性和效率。

5. 应用原位表征：使用先进的光谱技术研究合金催化剂在反应条件下的动态行为。

6. 控制位阻效应：利用合金的独特位阻性质来微调反应物覆盖度并影响反应途径。

这些策略可以通过利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子因素的协同效应，开发出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统。
