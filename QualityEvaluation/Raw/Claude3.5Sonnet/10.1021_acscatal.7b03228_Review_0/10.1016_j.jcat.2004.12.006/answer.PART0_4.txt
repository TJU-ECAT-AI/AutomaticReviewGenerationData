[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the √3 alloy."

[3] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111)"

The study demonstrates how geometric and electronic effects in Sn/Pt(111) alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) creates a new hydrogenation pathway, allowing selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen.

2. The (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy shows the highest conversion rate due to the matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene, which maintains high coverages of both reactants at elevated temperatures.

3. The alloys exhibit enhanced site-blocking effects, requiring less preadsorbed hydrogen to block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption compared to pure Pt(111).

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Control Sn concentration in supported SnPt catalysts to optimize the synergy between reactant desorption energies.

2. Utilize the enhanced site-blocking effects to fine-tune reactant coverages and reaction selectivity.

3. Explore other bimetallic combinations that may offer similar or improved synergistic effects for specific reactions.

4. Design catalysts with tailored surface structures to take advantage of the geometric effects observed in the ordered alloys.

These strategies can lead to more selective, efficient, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by leveraging the unique properties of bimetallic alloys.

研究表明，Sn/Pt(111)合金中的几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能：

1. 将Sn与Pt(111)合金化创造了一种新的氢化途径，可以从1,3-丁二烯和氢选择性地生产丁烯。

2. (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)合金显示出最高的转化率，这是由于H2和1,3-丁二烯的脱附活化能匹配，在高温下保持了两种反应物的高覆盖率。

3. 这些合金表现出增强的位阻效应，与纯Pt(111)相比，需要更少的预吸附氢来阻止1,3-丁二烯化学吸附。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化系统：

1. 控制负载型SnPt催化剂中的Sn浓度，以优化反应物脱附能之间的协同作用。

2. 利用增强的位阻效应来微调反应物覆盖率和反应选择性。

3. 探索其他可能为特定反应提供类似或改进协同效应的双金属组合。

4. 设计具有定制表面结构的催化剂，以利用有序合金中观察到的几何效应。

这些策略可以通过利用双金属合金的独特性质，带来比传统单金属催化剂更具选择性、效率和可调性的催化系统。
