[1] "The d-band theory of Hammer and Nrskov [6,7] provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the evaluation of adsorbate properties from clean surface properties. In the simplest version of that theory, binding energies and transition state energies can be estimated from a single clean-surface parameter, the surface d-band center [811]."

[2] "Several physical factors affect these d-band centers, including strain, ligand, and ensemble effects [1217]. By carefully accounting for each of these effects, it is in principle possible to estimate the d-band center of a clean alloy surface and, thence, to determine the properties of adsorbates on that surface."

[3] "Given the simplicity and relatively high accuracy of the approach, we expect that it will find application in a large number of problems in which oxygen chemistry is important, including oxygen reduction, NO reduction, CO oxidation, SO2 oxidation, and other reactions [18]."

The interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys significantly influences catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. The d-band center theory provides a framework to understand how surface properties affect adsorbate binding and reactivity. 

2. Strain, ligand, and ensemble effects all contribute to shifting the d-band center of alloy surfaces, which in turn impacts adsorption properties.

3. By carefully accounting for these various effects, it's possible to estimate the d-band center and adsorbate properties of alloy surfaces.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Use computational screening based on d-band center estimates to rapidly evaluate many alloy combinations.

2. Engineer alloy surfaces with optimal d-band centers for specific reactions by tuning composition and structure.

3. Develop catalysts with multiple active sites by combining metals with complementary electronic properties.

4. Create "bifunctional" catalysts where different components activate different reaction steps.

5. Design alloys with tunable selectivity by adjusting the relative strengths of competing adsorption processes.

These strategies could lead to alloy catalysts that are more active, selective, and stable than traditional monometallic systems for important reactions like oxygen reduction, CO oxidation, and NOx reduction. The ability to rationally tune surface electronic properties through alloying offers great potential for developing next-generation catalytic materials.

过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的相互作用通过以下几种机制显著影响催化性能:

1. d带中心理论提供了一个框架,用于理解表面性质如何影响吸附质的结合和反应活性。

2. 应变、配体和集成效应都会导致合金表面d带中心的移动,从而影响吸附性质。

3. 通过仔细考虑这些不同的效应,可以估算合金表面的d带中心和吸附质性质。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂:

1. 使用基于d带中心估算的计算筛选,快速评估多种合金组合。

2. 通过调整成分和结构,设计具有特定反应最佳d带中心的合金表面。

3. 通过结合具有互补电子性质的金属,开发具有多个活性位点的催化剂。

4. 创造"双功能"催化剂,其中不同组分激活不同的反应步骤。

5. 通过调整竞争吸附过程的相对强度,设计具有可调选择性的合金。

这些策略可能会导致开发出比传统单金属系统更活跃、更具选择性和更稳定的合金催化剂,用于氧还原、CO氧化和NOx还原等重要反应。通过合金化合理调整表面电子性质的能力为开发下一代催化材料提供了巨大潜力。
