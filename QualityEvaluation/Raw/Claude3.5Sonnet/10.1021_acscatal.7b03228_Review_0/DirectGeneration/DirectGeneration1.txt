Transition-metal alloys have emerged as powerful catalysts, offering superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the synergistic interplay between geometric and electronic effects. The combination of different metal atoms in alloy structures creates unique active sites with modified electronic properties and optimized surface geometries. This interplay allows for fine-tuning of adsorption energies, activation barriers, and reaction pathways, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Geometric effects arise from the altered atomic arrangements and lattice strain in alloys, which can expose more active sites and facilitate the binding of reactants in optimal configurations. Simultaneously, electronic effects stem from charge transfer between metal atoms and modifications in the d-band structure, influencing the catalyst's ability to form and break chemical bonds. By carefully engineering the composition and structure of transition-metal alloys, researchers can exploit these effects to design catalysts with tailored properties for specific reactions, potentially revolutionizing various industrial processes and paving the way for more efficient and sustainable chemical transformations.
