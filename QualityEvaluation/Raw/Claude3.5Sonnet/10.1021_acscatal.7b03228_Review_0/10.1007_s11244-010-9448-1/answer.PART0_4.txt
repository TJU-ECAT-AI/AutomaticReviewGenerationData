[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."

[2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."

[3] "For example, it has been shown recently that the catalytic activity of Pt can be changed significantly by combining Pt with 3d metals to form 3d-M/Pt skin alloys."

[4] "When used as electrodes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the 3d-M/Pt alloys exhibit higher tolerance to CO and lower over-potential losses associated with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt."

[5] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several key mechanisms:

1. Hybridization of d-orbitals: When two metals form an alloy, their d-orbitals hybridize, changing the width of the local density of d-states. This affects the chemical reactivity of the alloy sites without significant charge transfer between elements.

2. Altered d-band center: The position of the local d-band center changes in alloys, which directly impacts chemical reactivity. This change is primarily governed by the width of the localized d-band.

3. Geometric factors: The alloy geometry, specifically the bond distance between atoms, influences the d-band width and thus the reactivity.

4. Electronic factors: The spatial extent of d-orbitals of the constituent metals also plays a crucial role in determining the d-band width and reactivity.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Tailored alloy composition: Carefully select metal combinations to achieve desired d-band characteristics and reactivity.

2. Surface engineering: Create skin alloys (e.g., 3d-M/Pt) to modify surface reactivity while maintaining bulk properties.

3. Predictive modeling: Develop models based on easily accessible parameters like bond distances and orbital extents to predict alloy reactivity.

4. Targeted property enhancement: Design alloys for specific improvements, such as increased CO tolerance or reduced overpotential in fuel cells.

5. Structure-performance correlations: Establish comprehensive databases linking alloy structure to catalytic performance for more informed catalyst design.

6. Multi-metallic systems: Explore complex alloys with three or more metals to fine-tune electronic and geometric effects.

7. Strain engineering: Manipulate lattice strain to further modify d-band characteristics and reactivity.

These strategies can lead to the development of highly efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by leveraging the unique synergies between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过几个关键机制协同影响催化性能：

1. d轨道杂化：当两种金属形成合金时，它们的d轨道发生杂化，改变了d态局部密度的宽度。这影响了合金位点的化学反应性，而元素之间没有显著的电荷转移。

2. 改变的d带中心：合金中局部d带中心的位置发生变化，直接影响化学反应性。这种变化主要由局部d带的宽度决定。

3. 几何因素：合金的几何结构，特别是原子间的键长，影响d带宽度，从而影响反应性。

4. 电子因素：构成金属的d轨道的空间范围在决定d带宽度和反应性方面也起着关键作用。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化系统：

1. 定制合金成分：仔细选择金属组合以达到所需的d带特性和反应性。

2. 表面工程：创建表层合金（如3d-M/Pt）以修改表面反应性，同时保持体相性质。

3. 预测模型：基于易获取的参数（如键长和轨道范围）开发模型，以预测合金反应性。

4. 目标性能增强：设计合金以实现特定改进，如提高燃料电池中的CO耐受性或降低过电位。

5. 结构-性能相关性：建立全面的数据库，将合金结构与催化性能联系起来，以实现更明智的催化剂设计。

6. 多金属系统：探索含有三种或更多金属的复杂合金，以微调电子和几何效应。

7. 应变工程：操纵晶格应变以进一步修改d带特性和反应性。

这些策略可以通过利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应之间的独特协同作用，开发出高效、选择性强和可调节的催化系统，从而超越传统的单金属催化剂性能。
