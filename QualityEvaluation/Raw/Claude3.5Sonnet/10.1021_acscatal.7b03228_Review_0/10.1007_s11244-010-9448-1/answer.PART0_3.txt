[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."

[2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."

[3] "For example, it has been shown recently that the catalytic activity of Pt can be changed significantly by combining Pt with 3d metals to form 3d-M/Pt skin alloys"

[4] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Hybridization of d-orbitals: When two metals form an alloy, their d-orbitals hybridize, changing the width of the local density of d-states. This width is a key descriptor of chemical reactivity.

2. Geometric effects: The bond distances between atoms in the alloy affect the d-band width. This geometric factor directly influences the electronic structure.

3. Spatial extent of d-orbitals: The reach of d-orbitals from different metals in the alloy also impacts the d-band width and thus reactivity.

4. d-band center shifts: Changes in d-band width lead to shifts in the d-band center position relative to the Fermi level, which is crucial for determining adsorption energies and catalytic activity.

5. Minimal charge transfer: Despite hybridization, there is little charge transfer between elements, allowing for more predictable behavior.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Tailor d-band width: Select metal combinations that produce optimal d-band widths for specific reactions.

2. Engineer surface geometry: Control bond distances to fine-tune the d-band structure.

3. Leverage skin alloys: Use techniques like creating 3d-M/Pt skin alloys to modify surface reactivity while maintaining bulk properties.

4. Predictive modeling: Develop models based on easily obtainable parameters like orbital spatial extent to predict alloy performance.

5. Combine multiple effects: Design alloys that optimize both geometric and electronic factors simultaneously.

6. Explore multi-metallic systems: Investigate alloys with three or more metals to access a broader range of electronic structures.

7. In-situ characterization: Develop techniques to study alloy electronic structure under reaction conditions to better understand structure-performance relationships.

By systematically exploring these strategies, researchers can design alloy catalysts with precisely tuned electronic structures, potentially achieving higher efficiency, selectivity, and stability than traditional monometallic catalysts.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. d轨道杂化：当两种金属形成合金时，它们的d轨道发生杂化，改变局部d态密度的宽度。这个宽度是化学反应活性的关键描述符。

2. 几何效应：合金中原子间的键长影响d带宽度。这种几何因素直接影响电子结构。

3. d轨道的空间范围：合金中不同金属的d轨道范围也影响d带宽度，从而影响反应活性。

4. d带中心移位：d带宽度的变化导致d带中心相对于费米能级的位置发生移动，这对决定吸附能和催化活性至关重要。

5. 最小电荷转移：尽管发生杂化，元素之间的电荷转移很少，使得行为更容易预测。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂：

1. 调整d带宽度：选择能产生特定反应最佳d带宽度的金属组合。

2. 设计表面几何结构：控制键长以精细调节d带结构。

3. 利用表皮合金：使用如创建3d-M/Pt表皮合金等技术来修改表面反应活性，同时保持体相性质。

4. 预测性建模：基于易获得的参数（如轨道空间范围）开发模型，以预测合金性能。

5. 结合多重效应：设计同时优化几何和电子因素的合金。

6. 探索多金属体系：研究含有三种或更多金属的合金，以获得更广泛的电子结构范围。

7. 原位表征：开发在反应条件下研究合金电子结构的技术，以更好地理解结构-性能关系。

通过系统地探索这些策略，研究人员可以设计具有精确调节电子结构的合金催化剂，潜在地实现比传统单金属催化剂更高的效率、选择性和稳定性。
