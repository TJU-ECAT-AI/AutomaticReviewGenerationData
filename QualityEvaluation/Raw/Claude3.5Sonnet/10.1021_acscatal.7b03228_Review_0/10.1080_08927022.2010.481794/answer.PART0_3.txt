[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."

[3] "Here, the ligand effect is incorporated into the matrix element in the numerator through the rd of each metal, whereas the strain is included in the denominator through the distance between atoms."

[4] "Even considering the Co impurity, the average error has been calculated to be less than 2.5%, indicating the feasibility of our proposed d-band width formalism."

[5] "We attribute this to an electronic strain, where the Pd d-orbitals are not as crowded by the smaller 3d orbitals as they would be by other Pd orbitals. Consequently, they are effectively under-coordinated, resulting in a sharpening of the d-band."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Strain effects: The interatomic distances between metal atoms affect the d-band width and center, which in turn influences reactivity. Compressive or tensile strain can tune the d-band properties.

2. Ligand effects: The chemical nature of neighboring atoms affects the electronic structure through orbital interactions. This is captured by the characteristic orbital sizes (rd) of different metals.

3. Ensemble effects: The specific arrangement and composition of surface atoms create unique active sites with distinct electronic properties.

4. Electronic strain: Alloying metals with different orbital sizes can lead to under-coordination effects, sharpening the d-band and potentially increasing reactivity.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Rational design of surface alloys: Combine metals with complementary electronic properties to achieve desired d-band characteristics.

2. Strain engineering: Use lattice mismatch in core-shell nanoparticles or epitaxial growth to induce beneficial strain.

3. Single-atom catalysts: Maximize ligand effects by dispersing single atoms of one metal in a host matrix.

4. Gradient alloys: Create surfaces with spatially varying composition to tune reactivity across the catalyst.

5. Machine learning approaches: Use the d-band model as input to rapidly screen large numbers of potential alloy combinations.

6. In-situ restructuring: Design alloys that dynamically optimize their surface structure under reaction conditions.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems by precisely tuning the synergistic geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 应变效应：金属原子之间的原子间距影响d带宽度和中心，进而影响反应活性。压缩或拉伸应变可以调节d带特性。

2. 配体效应：相邻原子的化学性质通过轨道相互作用影响电子结构。这可以通过不同金属的特征轨道大小(rd)来捕捉。

3. 集合效应：表面原子的特定排列和组成创造出具有独特电子性质的活性位点。

4. 电子应变：将不同轨道大小的金属合金化可能导致配位不足效应，使d带变窄，可能增加反应活性。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂：

1. 理性设计表面合金：结合具有互补电子性质的金属，以实现所需的d带特性。

2. 应变工程：利用核壳纳米粒子或外延生长中的晶格失配来诱导有益的应变。

3. 单原子催化剂：通过在宿主基质中分散一种金属的单个原子来最大化配体效应。

4. 梯度合金：创建具有空间变化组成的表面，以调节催化剂的反应活性。

5. 机器学习方法：使用d带模型作为输入，快速筛选大量潜在的合金组合。

6. 原位重构：设计可在反应条件下动态优化其表面结构的合金。

这些策略可以通过精确调节过渡金属合金中协同的几何和电子效应，开发出比传统单金属体系具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。
