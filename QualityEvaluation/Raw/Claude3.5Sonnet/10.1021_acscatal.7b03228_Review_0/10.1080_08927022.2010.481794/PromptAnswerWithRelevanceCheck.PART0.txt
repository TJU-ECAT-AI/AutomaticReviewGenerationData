[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."

[3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces, it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."

[4] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment"

[5] "Here, the ligand effect is incorporated into the matrix element in the numerator through the rd of each metal, whereas the strain is included in the denominator through the distance between atoms."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Surface reactivity is determined by the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds, which is influenced by both geometric arrangement and electronic structure.

2. The d-band model explains variations in reactivity based on coupling between metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. This coupling is sensitive to both strain (geometric) and ligand (electronic) effects.

3. Modifications to d-band characteristics, which explain reactivity, arise from both electronic and geometric contributions.

4. The interplay between geometric and electronic effects can be quantified through correlations between d-band width and interatomic matrix elements.

5. In alloys, ligand effects arise from the electronic properties of different metals, while strain effects come from changes in interatomic distances.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Use computational modeling to rapidly screen alloy combinations, optimizing both composition and structure.

2. Design core-shell nanoparticles with tuned strain and ligand effects.

3. Create surface alloys with controlled distributions of atoms to fine-tune local electronic environments.

4. Utilize high-entropy alloys to access complex electronic structures.

5. Develop adaptive catalysts that can dynamically modify their geometric and electronic structure under reaction conditions.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems by precisely tuning the synergistic interactions between geometric and electronic effects.

[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti-bonding adsorbatesurface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals."

[3] "The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak."

[4] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Surface properties: The reactivity of transition metals is determined by their surface properties, which affect the ability to form and break bonds with adsorbates.

2. Electronic structure: The distribution of electrons in bonding and anti-bonding states between the adsorbate and the metal surface (involving both sp and d orbitals) influences bond strength and reactivity.

3. d-band model: Variations in catalytic activity are largely explained by differences in the coupling between metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is sensitive to the d-band center.

4. Strain effects: Changes in interatomic distances due to lattice mismatch or surface reconstruction alter the overlap of electronic orbitals, affecting the d-band width and center.

5. Ligand effects: The presence of different metal atoms in an alloy modifies the local electronic environment, changing the characteristic orbital sizes and interactions.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Engineered strain: Precisely control lattice strain through epitaxial growth or nanostructuring to tune the d-band center for optimal reactivity.

2. Rational alloying: Combine metals with complementary electronic properties to achieve synergistic effects on adsorption energies and reaction barriers.

3. Core-shell nanoparticles: Design particles with specific surface compositions to leverage both geometric and electronic effects for enhanced selectivity.

4. Surface doping: Introduce small amounts of dopants to modify the local electronic structure without significantly altering the bulk properties.

5. Defect engineering: Create and control surface defects to generate unique active sites with modified electronic properties.

6. 2D materials and single-atom catalysts: Utilize atomically thin materials or isolated metal atoms on supports to maximize the impact of electronic modifications.

7. Machine learning-aided design: Employ computational methods to rapidly screen and predict alloy compositions with optimal geometric and electronic properties for specific reactions.

By strategically combining these approaches, it is possible to design catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and tunability across a wide range of chemical transformations.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Strain effects: The interatomic distances between metal atoms affect the d-band width and center, which in turn influences reactivity. Compressive or tensile strain can tune the d-band properties.

2. Ligand effects: The chemical nature of neighboring atoms affects the electronic structure through orbital interactions. This is captured by the characteristic orbital sizes (rd) of different metals.

3. Ensemble effects: The specific arrangement and composition of surface atoms create unique active sites with distinct electronic properties.

4. Electronic strain: Alloying metals with different orbital sizes can lead to under-coordination effects, sharpening the d-band and potentially increasing reactivity.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Rational design of surface alloys: Combine metals with complementary electronic properties to achieve desired d-band characteristics.

2. Strain engineering: Use lattice mismatch in core-shell nanoparticles or epitaxial growth to induce beneficial strain.

3. Single-atom catalysts: Maximize ligand effects by dispersing single atoms of one metal in a host matrix.

4. Gradient alloys: Create surfaces with spatially varying composition to tune reactivity across the catalyst.

5. Machine learning approaches: Use the d-band model as input to rapidly screen large numbers of potential alloy combinations.

6. In-situ restructuring: Design alloys that dynamically optimize their surface structure under reaction conditions.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems by precisely tuning the synergistic geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys.

The results also indicate that more reactive surface structures could be achieved with the presence of 3d metals as the impurity in the surface, causing a narrowing of the surface d-band width and a consequent shift in d-band centre closer to the Fermi level."
