[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti-bonding adsorbatesurface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals."

[3] "The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak."

[4] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."

[5] "Here, the ligand effect is incorporated into the matrix element in the numerator through the rd of each metal, whereas the strain is included in the denominator through the distance between atoms."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Surface properties: The reactivity of transition metals is determined by their surface properties, which affect the ability to form and break bonds with adsorbates.

2. Electronic structure: The distribution of electrons in bonding and anti-bonding states between the adsorbate and the metal surface (involving both sp and d orbitals) influences bond strength and reactivity.

3. d-band model: Variations in catalytic activity are largely explained by differences in the coupling between metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is sensitive to the d-band center.

4. Strain effects: Changes in interatomic distances due to lattice mismatch or surface reconstruction alter the overlap of electronic orbitals, affecting the d-band width and center.

5. Ligand effects: The presence of different metal atoms in an alloy modifies the local electronic environment, changing the characteristic orbital sizes and interactions.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Engineered strain: Precisely control lattice strain through epitaxial growth or nanostructuring to tune the d-band center for optimal reactivity.

2. Rational alloying: Combine metals with complementary electronic properties to achieve synergistic effects on adsorption energies and reaction barriers.

3. Core-shell nanoparticles: Design particles with specific surface compositions to leverage both geometric and electronic effects for enhanced selectivity.

4. Surface doping: Introduce small amounts of dopants to modify the local electronic structure without significantly altering the bulk properties.

5. Defect engineering: Create and control surface defects to generate unique active sites with modified electronic properties.

6. 2D materials and single-atom catalysts: Utilize atomically thin materials or isolated metal atoms on supports to maximize the impact of electronic modifications.

7. Machine learning-aided design: Employ computational methods to rapidly screen and predict alloy compositions with optimal geometric and electronic properties for specific reactions.

By strategically combining these approaches, it is possible to design catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and tunability across a wide range of chemical transformations.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 表面性质：过渡金属的反应性由其表面性质决定，这些性质影响与吸附物形成和断裂键的能力。

2. 电子结构：吸附物与金属表面之间的键合和反键状态（涉及sp和d轨道）中电子的分布影响键强度和反应活性。

3. d带模型：催化活性的变化主要由金属d态与吸附物轨道之间耦合的差异来解释，这种耦合对d带中心很敏感。

4. 应变效应：由于晶格失配或表面重构导致的原子间距离变化会改变电子轨道的重叠，从而影响d带宽度和中心位置。

5. 配体效应：合金中不同金属原子的存在会改变局部电子环境，改变特征轨道大小和相互作用。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化系统，可以采取以下策略：

1. 工程应变：通过外延生长或纳米结构精确控制晶格应变，调节d带中心以获得最佳反应活性。

2. 理性合金化：结合具有互补电子性质的金属，以实现吸附能和反应势垒的协同效应。

3. 核壳纳米粒子：设计具有特定表面组成的粒子，利用几何和电子效应来增强选择性。

4. 表面掺杂：引入少量掺杂剂来修改局部电子结构，而不显著改变体相性质。

5. 缺陷工程：创建和控制表面缺陷，生成具有改良电子性质的独特活性位点。

6. 二维材料和单原子催化剂：利用原子级薄的材料或支撑物上的孤立金属原子，最大化电子修饰的影响。

7. 机器学习辅助设计：采用计算方法快速筛选和预测具有最佳几何和电子性质的合金组成，以用于特定反应。

通过战略性地结合这些方法，可以设计出在活性、选择性和可调性方面优于传统单金属催化剂的催化系统，适用于广泛的化学转化反应。
