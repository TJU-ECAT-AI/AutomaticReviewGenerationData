[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles."

[2] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character."

[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

[4] "Electronic and geometric effects are generally observed for both alloys and intermetallic compounds. This means that the orderedness of intermetallic phases is not essential to these effects."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Geometric effects alter the surface structure by incorporating less active metals, reducing coordination numbers and ensemble sizes of active sites. This can enhance selectivity by suppressing undesired reactions requiring larger ensembles.

2. Electronic effects modify the d-band structure of active metals, changing adsorption energies and reaction barriers. The d-band center position relative to the Fermi level governs reactivity according to the d-band theory.

3. The combination of geometric and electronic effects allows fine-tuning of catalytic properties. By choosing appropriate second metals and compositions, both surface geometry and electronic states can be controlled.

4. Intermetallic compounds offer additional control through their ordered structures, enabling more precise design of active sites.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Rational design of bimetallic catalysts based on d-band theory predictions.

2. Engineering specific surface structures in intermetallic compounds to create unique active sites.

3. Developing synthesis methods for shape-controlled intermetallic nanoparticles to expose desired facets.

4. Combining computational modeling with in-situ characterization to understand structure-property relationships.

5. Exploring ternary or more complex alloy systems to further expand the design space.

6. Utilizing the ordering effect in intermetallic compounds to enhance stability and create novel electronic structures.

By leveraging these synergistic effects, researchers can develop catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability that outperform traditional monometallic systems across a wide range of reactions.

[4] "Thus, in general, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."

[5] "The formation of intermetallic or alloy phases is generally accompanied not only by ensemble effects but also by ligand effects. This is because the incorporation of the second metal, whose character differs significantly from the parent metal, typically induces a drastic change in the electronic structure and hence in the adsorption strength and reaction profiles as well."

However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."

[3] "Figure 14 shows the ligand, ensemble, and total effects as functions of n, revealing that the ensemble effect dominates the total effect."
