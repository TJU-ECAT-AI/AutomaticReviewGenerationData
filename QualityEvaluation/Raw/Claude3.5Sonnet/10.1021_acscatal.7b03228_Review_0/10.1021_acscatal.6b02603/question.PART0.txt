Abstract
An overview of the catalytic properties of intermetallic compounds has been made to provide a comprehensive understanding regarding (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials. A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections. The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects. The unprecedented steric effects governed by the specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds highlight the unique capabilities of intermetallic materials. On the basis of this overview, we have concluded that intermetallic compounds have the following advantages for fine catalyst design: (i) control of the electronic structure, (ii) a specific and ordered atomic-level structure, and (iii) homogeneity of geometric and electronic structures. Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems.

1 Introduction
Catalytic conversion by metallic materials is a key methodology used for various chemical transformations in industrial chemistry, organic synthesis, gas purification, and energy conversion. To improve the performance of metallic catalysts, secondary metallic elements have been frequently added to catalysts as modifiers. The development of such bimetallic catalytic materials remains an intriguing research area in catalytic chemistry. (1-3) In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7) Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds. (8) The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a). If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b). The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c). (8) In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table. As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time. (9-13) In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18) However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts. This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts. Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research. The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high. This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic. In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts. However, the recent increase in publications suggests that this field has also received growing attention. Moreover, the insights obtained from these studies suggest that the potential of intermetallic compounds for catalyst materials is high compared to conventional inorganic catalyst materials. To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials. To this day, a few reviews of intermetallic compounds focused on a specific topic (metalsupport interaction) (19) and reactions (acetylene semihydrogenation (20, 21) and methanol steam reforming) (21, 22) have been reported. We have also published a minireview summarizing our recent studies on intermetallic catalysts. (23) However, no cyclopedic literature covering a broad range of catalytic chemistry of intermetallic compounds has been reported.

With this context as our motivation, we summarize the current status of intermetallic compounds to provide an overview of their role as catalyst materials in this review. In section 2, we describe the typical methodologies for preparation of intermetallic compound catalysts and outline several points where care should be taken in their preparation. In section 3, we classify a number of catalytic systems that use intermetallic compounds as effective catalysts with respect to the type of reaction and clarify what intermetallic compounds can do. In section 4, the fundamental aspects of intermetallic or alloy phases that govern catalysis are categorized into several parts, including electronic and geometric effects. Other observed features that are unique to intermetallic phases are also introduced. On the basis of the nature of these features, we demonstrate the advantages of intermetallic compounds in catalyst design. Finally, in section 5, we discuss future perspectives on this research field and describe several challenges to be overcome.
For better categorizing in this review, we describe bimetallic combinations in order of the catalytically active metal (M) first and the counterpart metal (N) second. Specific intermetallic and solid-solution alloy phases are designated as MmNn and MxN(1x) (where m, n are integer numbers and x is a decimal number), respectively. When we do not indicate a specific intermetallic or alloy phase, the bimetallic designation combined with a dash (MN) is used. This designation indicates a composite of various phases, a generic term for a bimetallic system, and/or a simple mixture of two metals. Note that some descriptions in this manuscript differ from the original ones in the literature.
2 Catalyst Preparation
In general, an intermetallic catalyst should contain a catalytically active element, such as one of the late transition metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, Co, Ru, and Fe). Therefore, the counterpart metal should be an early transition metal or a typical metallic element, which is well-separated from the active metals in the periodic table (Figure 3). The combination of a later transition metal and a typical metal or a half metal (Al, Si, Zn, Ga, Ge, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Tl, Pb, or Bi) is commonly employed, whereas combinations containing an early transition metal (Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr, Nb, La, Hf, or Ta) have been less frequently reported. For the former combinations, most intermetallic compounds can be easily prepared as highly dispersed nanoparticles on a certain catalyst support using conventional impregnation methods with hydrogen reduction. (23) A stoichiometric supply and homogeneous dispersion of the two metal precursors are important in order to obtain a high phase-purity of the desired intermetallic phase. Ideally, the intermetallic catalyst should be single-phase so that the catalytic performance of the phase in question can be well understood. To avoid inhomogeneous distribution of metal precursors during drying, it is preferable to use the least amount of solvent possible, as is typically employed for pore-filling impregnation. The two metal precursors are loaded on the catalyst support simultaneously or successively (Figure 4). For the former fashion, which is called coimpregnation (Figure 4a), the precursors simultaneously undergo the gas-phase reduction procedure typically at high temperatures. However, in most cases, the reduction of two metal precursors does not occur simultaneously because of the significant deviation in their reduction potentials. (24) The reduction of noble metal precursor occurs (typically below 200 C) before the furnace temperature is elevated sufficiently to reduce the base metal precursor. This trend can be observed clearly in the temperature programed reduction (TPR) profiles of some intermetallic catalysts. (25) For the successive impregnation fashion (Figure 4b), the second metal precursor is loaded on the prereduced monometallic catalyst. The reduction of the second metal occurs at the surface or neighboring sites of the parent active metal nanoparticles by surface or spillover hydrogen, followed by diffusing into the bulk to form the intermetallic phase. The size of the resulting intermetallic nanoparticles depends roughly on that of the parent metal. Therefore, this procedure is suitable for the preparation of size-controlled intermetallic nanoparticles. Instead of the supported monometallic particles, Raney-type porous bulk metals can also be used as the parent materials for the successive impregnation procedure. (26)

Appropriate choice of the catalyst support is also a significant factor to prepare a supported intermetallic compound with high phase purity. Catalyst supports that tend to strongly capture the metals or metal precursors, such as γ-Al2O3, are less suitable for synthesizing single-phase intermetallic nanoparticles because they often result in less-homogeneous dispersions of the metal precursors and/or low surface mobility of the metals during the alloying process. (24) Using an inert support such as SiO2 or carbon is suitable not only for obtaining high phase-purity but also for clarifying the role of the intermetallic phase in enhanced catalysis due to the absence of contributions from the support itself. Of course, the use of other supports such as TiO2 or MgO is also valid when one expects concerted catalysis involving both the metallic phase and the support. (27, 28) Al2O3-supported intermetallic compounds can successfully be prepared by liquid-phase reduction (Figure 4d) using borohydride as a strong reducing agent. (24) It has been suggested that rapid coreduction of the two metal cations is effective for synthesizing an intermetallic phase on Al2O3. (24) Liquid-phase reduction can also be applied for the colloidal synthesis of intermetallic nanoparticles without any catalyst support. (29) Some capping agents are used to avoid aggregation. As a reducing agent, NaBH4, (30) LiBH4, (24, 27) LiBHEt3, (31-33) or sodium naphthalenide (34) has often been used.
As well as the aforementioned methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD, Figure 4c) (35-39) and polyol process (Figure 4e) have also been employed for the preparation of intermetallic nanoparticles. For the CVD method, the second metal precursor is fed as a vapor directly to the surface of the parent metal particles, followed by reductive deposition and alloying. (35) At an appropriate temperature, the reductive deposition occurs preferentially on the active metal surface but not on the inert support, allowing selective deposition. The precursors having sufficiently high vapor pressures, such as silane (39) and tetraalkyl compounds of group 14 elements, (38) are typically employed for CVD. Note that because the loading amount depends strongly on the temperature and time of the CVD procedure, it is necessary to find an appropriate condition to control exactly the loading amount of the second metal. (35) This method often enables high phase purities and minimal aggregation or sintering of the parent metal particles under an appropriate condition. Polyol process is a unique and useful method for synthesizing intermetallic nanoparticles by successive alloying of the parent metal particles in liquid phase. Multivalent alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propanediol, and glycerol (so-called polyols) act as a (a) high-boiling solvent (bp 200350 C), (b) capping agent, and (c) reductant (hydrogen donor). (40) Both colloidal and supported nanoparticles can be used as the parent materials (Figure 4e). This method enables high phase-purity of the resulting intermetallic nanoparticles, where the size, shape, and dispersity of the parent particles are retained. Schaak et al. reported that a variety of intermetallic nanopartilces were prepared successfully using this method: for example, AuCu, (41) PtM (M = Sn, Sb, Fe, Bi, Pb, Cu), (42, 43) and MSn (M = Fe, Ni, Co, Pd). (42)
For bimetallic combinations containing early transition metals, the preparation of supported intermetallic compounds is a challenging task. This is because the precursors of these metals are difficult to reduce to the metallic states by a typical hydrogen reduction treatment at high temperatures (400800 C) due to the very low reduction potentials (typically < 1.5 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)). (44), For example, a reduction temperature of 900 or 1000 C with flowing hydrogen is required to convert PtTi4+ or PtNb5+ composite to Pt3Ti (45) or Pt3Nb (46) phase, respectively. A strong reducing agent such as LiHBEt3 (33, 47) or sodium napthalenide (34) in the liquid phase (Figure 4d) was reported to be effective for preparing intermetallic Pt3M (M = Ti, Zr, and Nb). Metal precursors with highly negative reduction potentials such as Sc3+ or lanthanide cations (typically < 2.0 V vs NHE) (44) are almost impossible to be reduced using chemical agents. Intermetallic compounds containing such metals can be prepared as bulk materials by conventional metallurgical alloying (Figure 4f). However, considering the very low reduction potentials of these metals, the resulting intermetallic phase is likely to be highly sensitive to air and moisture. For instance, the surface of Pd-based intermetallic compounds containing Ti or Nb undergoes oxidative decomposition into monometallic Pd and the oxide phases of the counterpart metal even in purified Ar atmosphere containing only a trace amount of O2 (<1 ppb). (48) Therefore, the intrinsic catalytic properties of intermetallic compound surfaces containing highly oxidizable metals is difficult to evaluate under typical reaction conditions and should be measured under very strict conditions such as an ultrahigh vacuum condition. In the following section, we show some examples of intermetallic catalysts containing early transition metals. In these cases, one should consider the possibility that the intermetallic phase acts as the precursor of the true active phase.
3 Survey of Intermetallic Catalysts
In this section, a number of chemical transformations are first classified into three major divisions, namely, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming. The individual reactions are the focus of different subsections. Here, reports dealing with bimetallic catalysts that do not give sufficient phase characterization are not covered, except for important examples, so that the contribution of the specific phase is clarified. Solid-solution alloy catalysts that are particularly important or relevant to the focused reaction were also included.
3.1 Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation
Intermetallic compounds typically comprise base metal elements, which are sensitive to air, and therefore are suitable for chemical reactions performed under an inert or reductive atmosphere rather than an oxidative atmosphere. Hydrogenation of multiple bonds such as CC, CC, CO, and NO or dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons and alcoholic moieties is one of the most widely studied reaction categories that involve intermetallic compounds. In this section, several hydrogen-mediated reactions are categorized into five subsections, including (1) chemoselective hydrogenation, (2) alkene hydrogenation and isomerization, (3) alkane dehydrogenation, (4) alcohol-based N-alkylation of amines, and (5) hydrogenation of carbon oxides.
3.1.1 Chemoselective Hydrogenation
Hydrogenation of organic molecules having two reducible functional groups can yield several different products because hydrogenation may occur at any functional groups. If one aims to exclusively obtain a certain hydrogenated product, the targeted functional group should be selectively hydrogenated with the other functional group remaining. Occasionally, however, the other functional group may be kinetically and thermodynamically more easily hydrogenated than the target functional group. In such a case, a drastic modification of the catalytic property is required in order to suppress the undesired hydrogenation of the other group.
3.1.1.1 α,β-Unsaturated Aldehyde to Allylic Alcohol
Allylic alcohols such as crotyl alcohol, prenol, geraniol, cinnamyl alcohol, and furfuryl alcohol are valuable intermediates for the production of perfumes, flavoring, pharmaceuticals, and resins. (49-51) These alcohols can be produced by preferred hydrogenation of the CO group of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (i.e., crotonaldehyde, prenal, citral, cinnamaldehyde, and furfral, respectively). Selective catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols is a key step in the industrial production of fine chemicals and is one of the most widely studied chemoselective hydrogenations in fundamental research on catalysis. (48) Conventional monometallic catalysts such as Pt (52) Ni, (39) or Ru (53, 54) typically catalyze undesired hydrogenation of the CC bond to form a saturated aldehyde or alcohol.
In this research field, Sn-modified bimetallic systems represented by PtSn have been reported to be effective (typically 7090% selectivities for allylic alcohols) since the 1980s. (55-57) At the early stage (prior to 2000), however, most studies proposed that cationic Sn species adjacent to Pt sites act as anchoring sites of the CO moiety for selective hydrogenation and made little mention of the involvement of alloy or intermetallic species. (55-58) The adsorption properties of PtSn alloys (including surface alloys and bulk intermetallic Pt3Sn) have been extensively studied by a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature programed desorption (TPD) in the 2000s. (59-62) These studies revealed that alloying of Pt with Sn significantly weakened the adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in side-on conformations, resulting in CC hydrogenation, whereas it enhanced that in top coordination on Sn sites, enabling CO hydrogenation. Very recently, Hou et al. reported the catalytic properties of a supported Pt3Sn intermetallic phase. (63) They prepared Pt3Sn intermetallic nanoparticles on SnO2 islands dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This catalyst exhibits good to excellent (7598%) yields for 12 different unsaturated alcohols, including crotyl, cinnamyl, and furfuryl alcohols under relatively mild conditions (2 MPa H2, 70 C, Scheme 1). (63)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Selective Hydrogenation of Various Unsaturated Aldehydes over Pt3Sn/SnO2/rGO
Ni-based intermetallic catalysts such as Ni3Sn2/TiO2 (64) and NiIn/MgO (65) were also reported to be effective for chemoselective hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes. These catalysts show good catalytic performances comparable to that of Pt3Sn/SnO2/rGO, although more severe reaction conditions are required (3 MPa H2, 110140 C). This might be due to the intrinsic hydrogenation ability of Pt, which is superior to that of Ni. X-ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis and DFT calculations for the NiIn system revealed that charge transfer from In to Ni occurs upon alloying, which produces electron-rich Ni and electron-deficient In sites. (65) The authors propose that such polarized sites prefer CO adsorption rather than CC adsorption, allowing preferential hydrogenation of the CO moiety. They also point out that isolation of Ni atoms by In (the so-called ensemble effect) decreases CC adsorption. Intermetallic compounds with different Ni/In ratio (Ni2In, Ni3In, NiIn, and Ni2In3) were also tested in this system. As the Ni/In ratio decreased, the selectivity for CO hydrogenation increased, whereas the catalytic activity decreased. This trend is consistent with the rationale they proposed. These interpretations are essentially similar to those found for the aforementioned PtSn system.
Other than Sn or In-containing intermetallic compounds, RuTi/SiO2 (37) and unsupported PtZn (66) were also tested for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, in which the selectivity to crotyl alcohol was ca. 40%. Interestingly, cofeeding ppm levels of bromoethane for the PtZn system significantly increases crotyl alcohol selectivity up to 88%. This enhancement is rationalized by preferential adsorption of the CO moiety on positively charged Zn species that are formed in these conditions. (62) Ternary intermetallic compounds such as Co6Ge6Mg and Ni4Sn2Ca were tested for hydrogenation of citral. Co6Ge6Mg showed a higher ratio of saturated alcohol (S:(geraniol + nerol)/(citronellal + citronellol) = 4.6) than RuSn/SiO2 catalyst (S = 4.1). (67) Similar results were observed between Ni4Sn2Ca (S = 1.2) or Ni4Sn2(Ca0.5Sr0.5) (S = 1.5) and Ni3Sn (S = 1.1). (68) The polar properties of these ternary materials are suggested for the origin of chemoselectivity.
Thus, in general, the intermetallic catalysts effective for selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde typically possess second metal sites that preferentially adsorb and activate carbonyl moieties.
3.1.1.2 Nitroarene to Aminoarene
Functionalized anilines are important intermediate chemicals for dyes, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and herbicides. (69) These molecules are synthesized by hydrogenation of the corresponding nitroarenes. Selective catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes to aminoarenes using gaseous hydrogen and a reusable heterogeneous catalyst is a highly atom-efficient and environmentally friendly process. The number of literatures using heterogeneous catalysts has been increasing in this decade, (70-81) indicating this field as a hot topic among researchers in heterogeneous catalysis. Functional groups substituted for aromatic rings are typically alkenyl, carbonyl, cyano, and halo groups. Among these, protecting alkenyl groups during nitro-hydrogenation (for example, nitrostyrene to aminostyrene) is the most challenging, because alkenyl groups are much more easily hydrogenated than other functional groups when a transition-metal catalyst and gaseous hydrogen are used. (82) Recently developed heterogeneous catalysts such as those based on Au (73, 83) and Ag (75, 76) typically need high H2 pressures (>0.6 MPa) and high reaction temperatures (>110 C) to work well. In contrast, Rh-based intermetallic compounds such as RhIn/SiO2 (81) and Rh0.75Ni0.25 nanoparticles capped by octadecylamine (84) were reported to be active in very mild conditions. RhIn/SiO2 acts as a highly active and selective catalyst for hydrogenation of various nitroarenes including nitrostyrene under 1 atm H2 at 75 and 25 C. As shown in Scheme 2 (left part), a variety of nitro arenes with vinyl, cyano, styryl, acetoxy, acetyl, formyl, chloro, bromo, and iodo groups were converted into the corresponding aminoarenes with high yields. (81) Note that monometallic Rh/SiO2 preferentially catalyzes undesired CC hydrogenation and gave a negligible amount of the desired aminoarene. Chemoselective conversion can be achieved using a specific surface structure of RhIn, which is explained in detail in section 4.3. Although Rh0.75Ni0.25 displays similar catalytic performance for various functionalized nitroarenes, no substrate containing an alkenyl group was tested (Scheme 2, right part). For the RhNi system, alloys with Ni contents higher than 0.33 show low selectivities (<62%). A similar result was also reported in the literature for RhIn/SiO2. In addition, several Pt-based catalysts that operate under relatively mild conditions have also been developed in recent years. (78, 83, 85) Many researchers consider isolation of Pt to be promising for selective nitro-hydrogenation. (78, 85) Indeed, to develop isolated Pt environments, some strategies such as single-atom dispersion (78) and ligand capping (85) have been adopted and demonstrated to be suitable. On the other hand, electronically modified Pt has been used for selective hydrogenation by intermetallic catalysts. Iihama et al. reported that PtZn/SiO2 catalyzed selective hydrogenation of various halonitrobenzenes to haloanilines (C6H4XNO2; X = Cl, Br, and I, including all regio isomers) under 1 atm H2 at 40 C. (86) They proposed that electron-enrichment of Pt by Zn not only suppresses CX scission but also enhances nitro-hydrogenation.

Although the use of gaseous hydrogen is highly atom-efficient and suitable for industrial applications, using other hydrogen sources such as methanol may be more convenient for laboratory-scale organic synthesis. Transition-metal-catalyzed hydrogenation using organic hydrogen donors is termed catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH). (87, 88) Although this type of reaction was initially studied decades ago, there are few literature reports focused on intermetallic materials as catalysts. Pd13Pb9/SiO2 and RhPb2/SiO2 are efficient catalysts for CTH of nitrostyrene to aminostyrene using methanol as a hydrogen source and solvent. (79) In particular, RhPb2/SiO2 can hydrogenate nitrostyrene and its derivatives (in total, 6 substrates) to the corresponding amino compounds under 1 atm Ar at 70 C in 1 or 1.5 h. (79)
3.1.1.3 Alkyne to Alkene
Semihydrogenation of alkyne to alkene is also one of the most widely studied reaction categories in the area of fundamental and applied chemistry. Acetylene semihydrogenation is an important industrial process used to purify crude ethylene containing a small amount of acetylene, which terminally deactivates ethylene polymerization catalysts. (89) Conversion of aliphatic and functionalized alkynes to the corresponding alkenes is also frequently employed in organic syntheses. (90) Protecting the produced CC bond, which is easily hydrogenated to a saturated CC bond in hydrogenation conditions, is the key concern for this reaction. In general, conversion of alkyne proceeds successively to alkene and alkane. However, direct conversion to ethane via surface ethylidene species has also been proposed for acetylene hydrogenation. (91) Pd- and Ni-based catalysts are known to be effective for selective alkyne semihydrogenation. For example, a PdAg alloy has been utilized as an acetylene semihydrogenation catalyst for ethylene purification in industrial process. (92, 93) A number of intermetallic compounds have also been reported to be effective catalysts: e.g., AuPd/TiO2, (94) PdmGa (bulk and Al2O3- or C-supported, m = 1 or 2), (31, 32, 95-97) PdZn/ZnO, (98) Ni3Sn, (99) Ni3Ge/MCM-41, (100) NiZn/MgAl2O4, (101) and Ni3Ga/MgAl2O4. (102) In addition, other 3d transition-metal-based intermetallic compounds such as CoM (M = Al, Co, and Ge) (103) and Fe4Al13 (104) catalyze acetylene hydrogenation and display high selectivity to ethylene. The enhanced selectivity to ethylene has often been explained by the weakened adsorption of ethylene. (105, 106) The adsorption energy of alkene on Pd typically becomes less negative in the presence of the second metal atoms adjacent to Pd atoms, which accelerates alkene desorption, thereby inhibiting overhydrogenation. (106) However, alkyne adsorption is also weakened, which lowers the hydrogenation rate of alkyne. Therefore, alkene yields generally exhibit a volcano-type relationship to the adsorption properties of the surface.
Table 1 summarizes the catalytic performance of reported intermetallic and alloy catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation. Detailed information such as the list of feed gas space velocities can be found in the literature. In most cases, small amounts of C4 byproducts such as butenes are yielded by dimerization of C2 molecules. Note that ethylene selectivity is sometimes reported as the percentage of ethylene in C2 molecules (not including C4 molecules), which is shown in parentheses in Table 1. In general, Ni-based catalysts require higher reaction temperatures than Pd-based catalysts to obtain high conversion rates. Among these catalysts, PdZn/ZnO exhibits a remarkably high catalytic activity and selectivity even at a reaction temperature of 80 C (Table 1, entry 8), which is much lower than that for other Pd-based catalysts, typically 200 C. The outstanding high catalytic activity is explained by a high H2 dissociation ability and the capacity for moderate di-σ coordination of acetylene to Pd, unlike in the case of other Pd-based intermetallic compounds such as PdGa (107) or PdAl. (108) The barrier for H2 dissociation on PdZn(100) of 39 kJ mol1 is lower than that on PdGa(210) (49 kJ mol1 at minimum) (109) and close to that on Pd(111) (20 kJ mol1). (110) Armbrster and the corroborators reported that PdGa and Pd2Ga could be prepared as supported or unsupported nanoparticles that display good ethylene selectivities (5882%) at sufficiently high acetylene conversions (6695%) (Table 1, entries 37). It is worth mentioning that a Ni0.25Zn0.75 catalyst (Table 1, entry 11) was discovered through theoretical predictions by Nrskov et al. They employed the heat of adsorption of methyl as a single descriptor representing catalytic activity and selectivity and surveyed the heat of adsorption for a number of bimetallic combinations. They discovered that intermetallic NiZn displayed a similar heat of adsorption of methyl to that of PdAg and demonstrated that high selectivity was indeed obtained when supported NiZn catalysts were used. It should also be noted that Fe4Al13 shows a very high catalytic activity that is comparable to Pd-based catalysts despite its low specific surface area (20 m2g1), and it has sufficient selectivity (Table 1, entry 13) compared to that of an industrial benchmark. The use of ubiquitous metal elements and their good catalytic performances makes them a fascinating alternative to noble metal catalysts.

Liquid-phase hydrogenation of aliphatic alkynes was studied using Pd2Ga, (111) and PdZn/ZnO, (112) which showed high alkene selectivities. For functionalized alkynes, selective hydrogenation to the corresponding alkenes was achieved using Pd3Pb/SiO2 and Pd3Bi/SiO2. (106) Intermetallic Pd3Pb shows higher alkene selectivity than other Pd-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pd0.5Ag0.5, Pd2Ga, PdZn, and the commercial Lindlar catalyst (PdPb/CaCO3). Note that the states of Pb atoms in intermetallic Pd3Pb and PdPb/CaCO3 differ significantly: Pb atoms comprise the lattice of Pd3Pb but are deposited as oxides on the surface of monometallic Pd, respectively. (113) A DFT study on these Pb-containing materials suggested that the Pd3Pb(111) surface had much lower heat of adsorption of alkyne and alkene than the Pb-deposited Pd(111) surface. (106)
3.1.1.4 Diene to Monoene
Selective hydrogenation of diene to monoene requires inhibition of overhydrogenation of the product alkene to alkane. Similarly for alkyne semihydrogenation, diminishing the alkene adsorption by alloying has been often employed. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of 1,5-hexadiene was performed using a PdAg alloy supported on alumina. (114, 115) Alkene selectivity was significantly improved by alloying with a small amount of Ag (Pd0.8Ag0.2), resulting in a 77% yield of hexenes at 100% conversion. However, inner alkenes such as 2-hexenes were also formed by 1-hexene isomerization. Gas-phase hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene was studied using PtxGe/SiO2 (x = 1, 2, and 3). (116) Pt3Ge exhibited excellent selectivity (95%) to butenes at 100% conversion. Although Pt2Ge and PtGe showed good selectivities, the reaction rate significantly decreased as the Ge content increased. In addition, some Pt-based alloys (Pt0.8M0.2, M = Ni, Co, or Fe) were tested for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation, and good selectivity was obtained (Pt0.8Fe0.2, 89% selectivity at 50% conversion). (117)
3.1.2 Alkene Hydrogenation and Isomerization
As mentioned in the two preceding sections, the alkene hydrogenation ability of a monometallic catalyst is significantly diminished by the formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase. However, an exceptional case of hydrogenation activity enhanced by the formation of an intermetallic phase has also been reported. Intermetallic Pt3Ti was reported to give a much higher reaction rate for hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. (118) Therefore, it may be generally concluded that hydrogenation ability is often decreased when the counterpart metal is a late transition or a typical metal. The unexpected enhancement in hydrogenation ability observed for Pt3Ti cannot be explained in terms of adsorption energy because adsorptivity is also weakened on Pt3Ti. (119) Presumably, a specific electronic state or configuration of alkenes that is energetically favorable for hydrogen attack might be possible on Pt3Ti.
Unique hydrogenation abilities of intermetallic compounds capable of hydrogen storage have also been reported. Endo et al. reported that Ni2Ce adsorbs hydrogen within its bulk lattice to form an amorphous Ni2CeHx phase. (120) This amorphous intermetallic hydride almost completely catalyzes ethylene hydrogenation at low temperatures (conversion: >99%, above 40 C), while the parent Ni2Ce was almost inactive (0% at 40 C). The drastic enhancement in hydrogenation ability was explained by a direct involvement of the adsorbed hydrogen at the surface in ethylene hydrogenation.
During hydrogenation of inner alkenes, isomerization to another stereoisomer also proceeds as a side reaction. This reaction takes places by CC rotation of the alkyl intermediate, followed by β-hydrogen elimination as a reverse reaction of the initial hydrogen addition to alkene. Scheme 3 outlines the hydrogenation and isomerization of alkene by hydrogen, which is known as the HoriuchiPlanyi mechanism. (121) The thermodynamically stable (E)-isomer is typically generated as an isomerization product. However, for monometallic and usual bimetallic catalysts, overhydrogenation to alkane inevitably occurs because hydrogen atoms can attack the alkenyl carbon from various directions. Therefore, it is difficult to selectively catalyze alkene isomerization in the presence of hydrogen. Recently, Rh- and Ru-based intermetallic compounds belonging to the orthorhombic Pnma space group, such as RhSb, were reported to selectively catalyze (Z) to (E) isomerization of various inner alkenes. (122, 123) A unique surface stereochemistry governed by a specific bimetallic structure allows one-atom hydrogenation for isomerization and inhibits two-atom hydrogenation to alkane, which is explained in detail in section 4.3. Contrary to the commonly used alkene isomerization methodologies using acid or photoexcitation, the use of hydrogen is much more functional-group-tolerant. Therefore, an RhSb catalyst can be applied to conversion of functionalized alkenes and alkynes as described in the following paragraph.
Scheme 3
Scheme 3. Reaction Mechanism of Hydrogen-Mediated Alkene Isomerization and Hydrogenation Known as HoriuchiPolanyi Mechanism
Catalytic hydrogenation of inner alkynes generates (Z)-alkenes due to syn addition of hydrogen to the alkenyl moiety. Obtaining (E)-alkenes from alkyne generally requires Birch-type reduction, which is performed in liquid NH3. (124) However, this reaction is stoichiometric, and the reaction conditions seem to be poorly functional-group-tolerant. (125) Therefore, obtaining functionalized (E)-alkenes by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding alkynes is highly challenging. This can be accomplished by a combination of an alkyne semihydrogenation catalyst (Pd3Pb/SiO2) and the alkene isomerization catalyst (RhSb/SiO2). (106) Note that both catalysts work in the presence of gaseous hydrogen, enabling a one-pot procedure to be used for the (E)-alkene synthesis. Various functionalized inner alkynes containing carbonyl or hydroxyl moieties were converted stepwise into the corresponding (E)-alkenes with high yields using a 1:1 mixture of these catalysts under 1 atm H2 at room temperature (Scheme 4). (106)

3.1.3 Alkane Dehydrogenation
Dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons such as propane, ethane, and isobutene is one of the most important chemical processes for the production of light alkenes. Particularly, in these days, propane dehydrogenation to propylene is increasingly in demand due to an insufficient supply of propylene from steam crackers. (126) In this field, PtSn bimetallic catalysts have been widely studied and used as industrial catalysts. (127-132) The addition of Sn to Pt often increases catalytic activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation toward hydrogenolysis or oligomerization. Moreover, this enhances coke resistance and catalyst stability. Recent experimental (133, 134) and theoretical (135, 136) studies revealed that the intermetallic Pt3Sn phase shows both high catalytic activity and selectivity among various PtSn phases such as PtSn alloys (Sn content <10%), Pt3Sn, PtSn, and PtSn2. As shown in Figure 5, the most stable (111) plane of the Pt3Sn phase exhibits an Sn arrangement with a (2 × 2) structure. The incorporated Sn atoms effectively dilute large Pt ensembles, which cause undesired side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, coke formation, and oligomerization. (135) However, 3-fold Pt sites remain on Pt3Sn(111) and act as the minimum active site for CH activation, affording sufficient catalytic activity. In contrast, Sn-rich intermetallic phases such as PtSn, PtSn2, and PtSn4 are almost inactive for alkane dehydrogenation (127-129) probably because the surface Pt atoms are completely isolated by surrounding Sn atoms, resulting in disappearance of PtPt sites.
Figure 5
Figure 5. (a) Crystal structure of Pt3Sn with a single unit cell and (b) atomic arrangement of Pt3Sn(111) surface with a (2 × 2)-Sn structure.
Another explanation for the geometric role of Sn was also proposed. Olsbye et al. have suggested that low-coordination Pt sites, namely, corners or edges, are active for hydrogenolysis while Sn atoms preferentially block these Pt sites. (137) This explanation was supported theoretically by Yang et al. (138) They showed that stepped sites on Pt(211) surface prefers overdehydrogenation of propylene to its desorption, whereas on the flat (111) surface, desorption is much more favored to overdehydrogenation. They also pointed that (1) the stepped sites are very active and unselective, but undergo rapid deactivation due to the coke formation and that (2) reactions occur on the flat surface after reaching the steady state. (138)
As well as the geometric effects of Sn, the contribution of electronic effects has also been reported. An X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) (134) and XAFS (134, 139) study showed that the electron density of Pt increases by alloying with Sn. Downward shift of the d band center was also reported for a series of PtSn surfaces. (135) This modified electronic state changes the adsorption properties of Pt. Indeed, many experimental (127) and computational approaches (135, 136) have revealed that adding Sn to Pt reduces the heat of propylene adsorption, which promotes desorption of propylene and suppresses successive side reactions. Figure 6 shows the difference in energy barriers between propylene desorption and overdehydrogenation to propenyl species. (135) Pt(111) surface prefers overdehydrogenation, while this trend is inverted for PtSn surfaces. Propylene desorption becomes much more favorable, as the Sn content at the surface and subsurface region increased. This energy difference in propylene desorption and overdehydrogenation to propenyl species has often been used as a descriptor of selectivity to propylene. Note that this electronic effect on the adsorption property is very similar to that observed in alkyne semihydrogenation. Thus, it is likely that selective alkane dehydrogenation relies on both the geometric and electronic effects generated by the addition of Sn.

3.1.4 Alcohol-Based N-Alkylation of Amines
N-Alkylation of amines with alcohol is an important chemical transformation for the synthesis of N-alkylamines, which are key building blocks that comprise a variety of functional organic molecules. (140) This reaction takes places by alcohol dehydrogenation, followed by reductive amination, as shown in Scheme 5a. Here, dehydrogenation of alcohol and hydrogenation of intermediate imine are catalyzed by transition-metal catalysts through a process known as a hydrogen-borrowing mechanism. (141) Here, alcohol acts as not only an alkylating agent but also a hydrogen source. At present, various heterogeneous catalysts containing transition metals such as Au, (142) Ag, (143) Cu, (144) Pt, (145) Pd, (146) Ni, (147) and Ru (148) have been reported to be effective for this reaction. These catalytic systems are highly atom-efficient, environmentally benign, and easy to handle under atmospheric pressure. However, in most cases, the scope of amine substrates is limited to less reactive amines such as aniline derivatives and aliphatic amines. This is because amines are essentially more reactive than alcohol, causing undesired side reactions such as amine dimerization (Scheme 5b) or CN cleavage to occur that decrease the yield of N-alkylation products. N-alkylation of reactive amines such as benzylamine can be achieved using a PdZn/Al2O3 catalyst with high yields. (149) The formation of a PdZn intermetallic phase drastically changes the adsorption affinity of Pd for alcohol and amine. On monometallic Pd, the adsorption of amine and the subsequent β-hydrogen activation are kinetically and thermodynamically preferred over those of alcohols. Conversely, this trend is inverted on PdZn, allowing selective adsorption and activation of alcohols for N-alkylation. A DFT calculation for Pd(111) and PdZn(111) (described by a CuAu-type unit cell) surfaces revealed that the highly oxophilic character of Zn atoms in contrast to the azophilic character of Pd atoms contributed to the drastic change in adsorption affinity. (149) Various amines including aliphatic amines, benzylamine, and its derivatives can be alkylated with high yields in a few hours using a PdZn/Al2O3 catalyst (Scheme 6). This catalytic system is also suitable for heteroaromatic alcohols such as furfuryl alcohol and N-alkylation of secondary amines to tertiary amines. Note that one of the most challenging tasks, the combination of less reactive octylacohol and highly reactive benzylamine, was also tested, and produced N-octylbenzylamine with a moderate yield. Using an Al2O3 support is also important for this system because the acidity of Al2O3 can accelerate condensation of the aldehyde and the amine to form an intermediate imine, as is often suggested in relevant works. (141)

Scheme 6
Scheme 6. N-Alkylation of Various Amines Using PdZn/Al2O3
High catalytic performance for N-alkylation has also been reported using a Pt-based bimetallic catalyst. Wei et al. reported that PtSn/Al2O3 (Pt:Sn = 1:3) selectively catalyzed N-alkylation of various amines. (145) They also demonstrated a wide scope of substrates with 47 aniline derivatives, 3 aliphatic amines, and 5 benzylamine derivatives (typically 8099% yields). Because this study includes no original characterization of the catalyst except for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, it is unclear which intermetallic or alloy species contribute to the selective catalysis. However, preferential activation of alcohol over amines is certainly governed by this bimetallic catalyst.
In relation to N-alkylation of amine, amination of alcohol with ammonia (N-alkylation of ammonia) has also been studied, particularly by researchers in homogeneous catalysis. (150-152) However, very few heterogeneous catalysts are effective for alcohol amination. This reaction is much more challenging than N-alkylation of amine because the intermediate imine is a primary imine, which is very unstable and easily undergoes deaminative dimerization. (153) Therefore, the hydrogenation of methanimine to the primary amine product needs to be sufficiently promoted. Recently, Nakagawa et al. reported amination of 1,2-propanediol with aqueous ammonia using a RhIn/C catalyst. (154, 155) The optimized catalyst (Rh:In = 1:1) showed a 28-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Rh/C. The products were dominated by a 1:1 mixture of 1-amino-2propanol and 2-amino-1-propanol. Detailed characterization revealed that the tetragonal RhIn phase (distorted CsCl structure) was the main active species. This catalytic system operates under a high H2 pressure (5 MPa), probably to promote the hydrogenation of imine to amine.
3.1.5 Hydrogenation of Carbon Oxides
Hydrogenation of carbon oxides (CO or CO2) to methane, methanol, or oligomerized hydrocarbons is an important methodology used to synthesize fuels. Methanation of CO or CO2 was widely studied for use in natural gas production from coal or biomass. (156) These days, CO methanation is increasingly in focus as a choice for purification of crude hydrogen for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), (157) in which CO terminally deactivates Pt electrodes. In the early stages, 3d late transition-metal-based intermetallic compounds (MxNy; M = Cu, (158, 159) Ni, (159-161) Co, (160, 161) or Fe; (162) N = Th, (158, 159) U, (159) Si, (160, 161) or Ti (162)), some of which are known as hydrogen storage materials, were utilized for CO methanation and related reactions. However, in these cases, the actual active phases were monometallic M dispersed on N oxides, which were formed by degradation of the parent intermetallic phases during the reaction or intentional oxidizing pretreatments. On the other hand, a recent study using silica-supported bimetallic NiSi catalysts by Liang et al. showed that catalysts containing intermetallic NiSi phases (Ni2Si, NiSi, or NiSi2) exhibited higher CO conversions, CH4 selectivity, and catalyst stability than Ni/SiO2. (163) As shown in Figure 7, the SiNi/SiO2-350 catalyst, which was prepared by direct silicification of Ni/SiO2 in a flow of 10% SiH4 in H2 at 350 C (categorized into a CVD method), showed better catalytic performance than Ni/SiO2 in the entire temperature region tested (200600 C). They also suggested that strong interactions between Ni and Si prevented sintering of the nanoparticles and carbon deposition.

Improved catalytic activity of a Ni-based bimetallic catalyst was also reported by Christensen et al., where alloying with Fe resulted in a 5-fold improvement in CO conversion at 225 C, with a yield for NiFe/MgAl2O4 (Ni:Fe = 1:1) of 41% compared to that of Ni/MgAl2O4 of 8%. (164) Interestingly, this observation was partially motivated by an attempt to optimize the adsorption properties of Ni by alloying according to the volcano-relationship between the activity and dissociative CO adsorption energy. In this relationship, the reaction rate is limited by a high barrier for CO dissociation when CO adsorption is weak, whereas it is limited by the high binding energy of the adsorbed C and O species when CO adsorption is strong. Elemental Ni and Fe are located on the stronger and weaker adsorption sides of the volcano-curve, respectively. Such a concept can be expanded to produce more thorough catalyst designs and predictions. For example, Nrskov and co-workers recently reported the theoretical prediction and discovery of intermetallic Ni5Ga3 catalysts effective for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. (165) They built a theoretical volcano-plot for elemental Pd, Cu, Ni, Zn-doped Cu (uses as the model for the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 industrial catalyst), and some NiGa intermetallic compounds (Ni3Ga, Ni5Ga3, and NiGa). Using the adsorption energy of an O atom (ΔEO) as a single descriptor for solving a microkinetic model allows TOF to be represented as a single function of EO, showing a volcano-relationship in the form of a concave-down curve (Figure 8). Here, it is important that scaling relations exist between ΔEO and the adsorption energies and the transition-state energies of all the oxygen-bound surface intermediate species for the tested metal surfaces. The plot indicates that Ni5Ga3 and Zn-doped Cu are very close to the top of the curve. Indeed, the prepared Ni5Ga3/SiO2 catalyst showed comparable or higher catalytic activity and much lower byproduction of CO than the conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. As well as Ni-based catalysts, the application of a Pd-based catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was also reported. Ota et al. reported that high selectivities to methanol in hydrogenation of CO2 were obtained using nanoparticulate Pd2Ga and PdZn catalysts, which were prepared from hydrotalcite-like compounds including PdZnAl and PdMgGa, respectively. (166)

Production of hydrocarbons by reductive oligomerization of CO, namely, FischerTropsch (FT) synthesis, is also categorized in this section. Similarly for CO methanation, a number of Ni-, Co-, Fe-, and Ru-based catalysts have been reported to be active for this reaction. (167) Among them, Ru is known as the most active metal, which operates at the lowest temperatures (e.g., 150 C). It was reported that a RuTi/SiO2 catalyst prepared by a CVD method with titanocene dichloride showed good catalytic performance with a much higher CO conversion (86%) and hydrocarbon selectivity (C3, 15 C-%; C4, 40C-%; C5+, 25 C-%) than that of Ru/SiO2 (C2+, <1 C-%) at 230 C. (168) As a reaction related to COx reduction, they also tested the application of Ni- and Co-based intermetallic compounds to CO2 reforming of methane. Among the various unsupported intermetallic compounds, CoHf2 exhibited 8- and 2.5-fold higher CO2 conversions than monometallic Co and Ni, respectively at 750 C. (169) CoHf2 also showed long-term stability of CO2 conversion over 100 h, whereas that of monometallic Ni declined to half over the same time. Endo et al. reported that the Ni2CeHx, mentioned in section 3.1.2 (ethylene hydrogenation), was also effective for FT synthesis. (170) Although the parent Ni2Ce material showed a CO conversion rate comparable to that of pure Ni, the amorphous intermetallic hydride exhibited a nearly 3-fold higher conversion rate at a reaction temperature of 260 C. The product distributions of C1, C2, C3, and C4 were 49, 26, 20, and 5%, respectively.
3.2 Oxidation
As described in the last section, intermetallic compounds provide catalytic properties superior to those of monometallic catalysts under inert or reductive atmospheres. In contrast, for oxidation reactions, intermetallic compounds face oxidative decomposition that forms oxide phases from the base metals. However, several intermetallic compounds exhibit excellent catalytic performance under relatively mildly oxidative conditions. In this section, a series of oxygen-mediated reactions are categorized into four subsections as follows: (1) oxidative dehydrogenation, (2) oxidative esterification, (3) CO oxidation, and (4) electrooxidation.
3.2.1 Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, (171) amines, (172) or hydrocarbons (173) to carbonyl, imine, or alkenyl compounds using molecular oxygen has been extensively studied in terms of fundamental and applied aspects. The reactions for alcohols and amines typically proceed under relatively mild conditions such as an atmospheric oxygen pressure at ca. 100 C. Generally, for oxidative dehydrogenation over Pt-group metals, molecular oxygen is consumed to oxidize the hydrogen atoms eliminated from the substrate to form water. (171) Therefore, an appropriate supply of molecular oxygen does not oxidize the Pt-group metals to cationic states. Pt or Pd catalysts have been studied for alcohol oxidation decades and the addition of typical heavy elements such as Bi, Pb, or Te significantly improves their catalytic activities and/or selectivities. (171) Some researchers suggested that intermetallic phases such as PdBi, (174) Pd3Pb, (175) or Pd3Te (176) are involved in the enhanced catalysis. However, the role of the individual intermetallic phases has not been clarified. On the other hand, many researchers have advocated different rationales for the positive roles of the promoter metals themselves. For example, (1) supply of adsorption sites for oxygen, (177-179) (2) prevention of Pd corrosion, (174, 175) (3) synergetic effects by the noble and second metals, (180, 181, 182) (4) ensemble effects to inhibit side reactions yielding poisoning species (e.g., CC cleavage), (183, 184) (5) complex formation between the second metal and the substrate, (185) and (6) suppression of hydrogen sorption. (186) Recently, Baiker et al. reported an in situ characterization of liquid-phase oxidation of alcohol over a PdBi catalyst using XAFS and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy techniques in an operando mode. (187) They revealed that Bi inhibited side reactions and supplied oxygen to the catalyst surface. A similar technique was also applied to a PtBi system, suggesting that Bi protected Pt from oxidation and blocked adsorption sites for solventPt interaction. (188) Thus, although useful insights have been provided by spectroscopic methods, the nature of this chemical system is still being debated and is an attractive field for further investigation.
Recently, Au-based bimetallic catalysts have become an appealing subject in alcohol oxidation chemistry. (189) In particular, AuPd alloys show remarkably high catalytic activities and superior selectivities compared with monometallic Pd and Au. (190, 191) For example, Prati et al. reported that Au0.8Pd0.2/C showed 70- and 510-fold higher TOF than Pd/C and Au/C, respectively, in oxidation of benzylalcohol in water at 60 C under 1.5 atm O2. (190) Hutchings et al. also reported enhanced catalytic activity of Pd/C alloyed with Au in benzylalcohol oxidation without solvents at 120 C under 10 atm O2. However, the enhancement in Pd/C was observed only for Pd-rich alloys (Pd content = 5088%) but not for Au-rich alloys. (190) This discrepancy may be stem from the significant difference in reaction conditions. Other than AuPd alloys, AuCu and AuAg alloys were reported to be more active than monometallic Au in oxidation of benzylalcohol.
The oxidation of amines to imines is also an important chemical transformation because of the versatile applications of imines as intermediates in the synthesis of medicines or biologically active nitrogen-containing organic molecules. (172) Developing efficient heterogeneous catalytic systems for aerobic oxidation of amines is important in relation to organic synthesis and industrial applications. Although Ru catalysts, (192, 193) Au catalysts, (194-197) and semiconductor photocatalysts (198-202) have been reported to be effective for amine oxidation, no heterogeneous catalyst has been reported in the literature to provide high catalytic activity, high selectivity, and a wide scope of substrate. The difficulty centers on the limited scope of substrates for secondary amines. This is because the CN bonds of secondary amines of which nitrogen is less sterically hindered are easily cleaved. (194) Therefore, oxidation of sterically hindered secondary amines, such as N-phenyl, N-isopropyl, or N-tert-butylbenzylamine, have typically been tested and reported. Very recently, Furukawa et al. reported that intermetallic Pd3Pb/Al2O3 acts as a highly efficient catalyst for oxidation of various amines. (27) As listed in Scheme 7a, primary, secondary, benzylic, and aliphatic amines could be selectively oxidized into the corresponding imines with high yields within a few hours. Note that the N-methyl and N-ethylbenzylamines and dibutylamines, which are less sterically hindered secondary amines, were successfully converted into the imines. Moreover, monometallic Pd showed a very low catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable promotion effect of Pb on the reaction rate. A mechanistic study based on FTIR, TPD, and kinetic analysis revealed the reaction mechanism (Scheme 7b) and that large Pb atoms weaken the strong adsorption of the product imine to Pd sites, hence promoting imine desorption. (203) This promotion effect changes the rate-determining step from imine desorption to amine adsorption. It is interesting that this activity promotion effect differs from those proposed for alcohol oxidation over Pd-based bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, the role of Pb in providing the enhanced selectivity (minimized CN cleavage) might be due to an ensemble effect. For Pd3Pb on basic supports, amine adsorption is further accelerated by deprotonation (Scheme 7c), affording a remarkable enhancement in the catalytic activity. Note that this support effect does not appear for monometallic Pd catalysts because the reaction rate is limited by imine desorption. Thus, in this catalytic system, the concerted catalysis between the intermetallic phase and the support plays a key role on the improved catalytic performances.

Next, we show an example of an intermetallic catalyst working under severely oxidative conditions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is typically performed at temperatures higher than 200 C. Mixed metal oxides represented by bismuth molybdates are generally used as catalysts for this reaction, (204-207) whereas metallic catalysts such as Pt or Pd have rarely been used. This is due to the strong oxidation ability of zerovalent metals, which causes complete combustion to COx. In a related study, a series of Pd-based intermetallic compounds (PdmMn/SiO2: M = Bi, Fe, Ge, In, Sn, or Zn) were recently tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene at 400 C. (25) Pd3Fe/SiO2 and PdIn/SiO2 showed the highest selectivity to 1,3-butadiene (ca. 40%), which was much higher than that of Pd/SiO2 (15%). In these oxidative conditions, the shell portions of the PdIn particles are decomposed into a composite of highly dispersed Pd clusters and In2O3 (Scheme 8a). On this composite, the CH activation of 1-butene and consumption of the eliminated hydrogen to form water are mediated by Pd and lattice oxygen of In2O3, respectively (Scheme 8b). Molecular oxygen is preferentially used for restoring oxygen vacancies over direct combustion. In this system, the PdIn phase act as a precursor of the active phase and reaches a steady state between decomposition to the PdIn2O3 composite and regeneration to PdIn during the reaction. A similar in situ structural change in the PdIn2O3 composite was also reported from systems of steam reforming of methanol, as shown in Section 3.3.

3.2.2 Oxidative Esterification
Oxidative esterification such as acetoxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is an important industrial process, to which bimetallic or intermetallic catalysts have been widely applied. (202) This reaction proceeds in the presence of molecular oxygen via oxidative addition of acetic acid to the substrate hydrocarbons, such as benzene, (209) toluene, (210) and 1,3-butadiene, (211) to form acetates. The obtained acetates can be easily converted to phenol, benzylalcohol, and 1,4-butandiol, respectively, which are the important raw materials for resins, perfumes, and fibers. (209-211) Compared with direct oxidation such as benzene oxidation, acetoxylation proceeds at low reaction temperatures (ca. 200 C) and shows high selectivities to the final products. (209) Similarly for alcohol oxidation, Pd-based catalysts containing Au, (210) Tl, (36) Pb, (36) Bi, (36, 208) or Te (209, 212) have been reported to be effective catalysts for acetoxylation. For 1,3-butadiene to 1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene, PdTe (212) and Pd3Tl (36) catalysts showed the highest catalytic activity and selectivity among various Pd-based bimetallic or intermetallic compounds. The PdTe catalyst was industrialized for acetoxylation of 1,3-butadiene by the Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation in the 1980s. (213) This catalyst is also effective for benzene acetoxylation. Asakawa et al. reported that Pd-based alloys (possibly intermetallic compounds) with Te, Bi, and Sb showed a 24-fold higher formation rate of benzylacetate with good selectivity (8095% compared with Pd at ca. 50%). (209) Among these alloys, PdTe alloy were highly resistant to leaching of the second metal, that is, catalyst deactivation. In the case of toluene acetoxylation, Komatsu et al. reported that Pd3Bi/SiO2 and Pd3Pb/SiO2 exhibit high selectivities to benzylacetate compared with other Pd-based catalysts. (32) A similar result was also reported by Miyake et al., (208) who found a sufficiently high catalyst stability with a Pd3Pb half-life of ca. 1000 h, whereas that of Pd was below 100 h.
Intermetallic Pd3Pb is also effective for other esterification process. Yamamatsu et al. reported that Pd3Pb selectively catalyzed oxidative esterification of methacrolein with O2 and methanol to form methyl methacrylate (MMA), (214) which is the major monomer of acrylic resins. Although metallic Pd also catalyzes this reaction, decarbonylation of methacrolein to propylene inevitably occurs, resulting in a poor yield of MMA (typically less than 30%). However, the formation of the Pd3Pb phase significantly improved the selectivity to higher than 95% by inhibiting the byproduction of propylene. Asahi-Kasei Chemical industrialized this catalytic system for MMA production from tert-butylalcohol. (214) In this process, tert-butylalcohol is initially oxidized to methacrolein at 300450 C, followed by direct methyl esterification to MMA at 50100 C. The Pd3Pb catalyst in this process was replaced in 2008 with a coreshell structured NiOx-Au catalyst showing higher catalytic activity and selectivity. (215)
Thus, Pd-based intermetallic compounds with typical heavy elements are very stable and suppress undesired side reactions, which makes them effective catalysts for oxidative esterification.
3.2.3 CO Oxidation
CO oxidation by O2 to CO2 is one of the simplest reactions in catalytic chemistry. This reaction is very important not only to fundamental chemistry but also for practical use in the purification of air, exhaust gas, and hydrogen for fuel cells. For purification of hydrogen for PEFC, the CO content should be reduced to ppm levels, which can be achieved by preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen, referred to as preferential oxidation of CO in excess hydrogen (PROX). (216) Many researchers in catalytic chemistry and surface science have made substantial efforts to establish a thorough understanding of CO oxidation chemistry. (217-220) In this area, elemental Pt, Pd, or Rh, particularly the (111) surface, has been the focus of study as a target catalyst material, which can be found in various literature reports. (217) In addition, nanoscale Au was has been a topic of investigation in this field, (219) starting with the discovery of its low-temperature activity for CO oxidation by Haruta et al. (221) In this section, we describe Pt- and Au-based intermetallic compounds that are highly active for CO oxidation and PROX.
Saravanan and Abe et al. reported that Pt3Ti/SiO2 showed improved catalytic activity compared with Pt/SiO2 (222) and a 3-fold increase in CO conversion at maximum with a much lower onset (light-off) temperature (Pt3Ti/SiO2, 125 C; Pt/SiO2, 200 C). They explained the higher activity by weakened adsorption of CO on Pt3Ti compared with Pt, which was elsewhere confirmed by thermal desorption techniques. Because CO, in general, fully covers Pt sites, the weaker adsorption of CO promotes its desorption and releases oxygen adsorption sites. In addition, this is a rare example of the preparation of a supported intermetallic compound with an early transition metal and the application to catalytic conversion. For Au-based materials, AuCu catalysts were studied for use in CO oxidation. Zhang et al. showed that intermetallic Au3Cu (223) and Au0.5Cu0.5 alloy (224) supported on SBA-15 converted CO completely to CO2 even at room temperature. Because monometallic Au and Cu supported on SBA-15 showed much lower CO conversions, they suggested some synergy effect to account for the enhanced catalysis. An in situ characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) revealed that the Au3Cu intermetallic phase was transformed into a composite of metallic Au and tiny CuOx islands. (223) They proposed that the CuOx acts as an effective oxygen supplier and that low temperature CO oxidation proceeds along the perimeter of Au and CuOx. A similar structural change in AuCu under an oxidative atmosphere was reported by other research groups. (225, 226) Kameoka and Tsai (225) employed bulk AuCu as a catalyst and calcined it at 600 C prior to CO oxidation. This treatment resulted in a two-order increase in the specific surface area (from <0.05 to 8.3 m2g1) by the formation of a porous CuO layer and an increase in the CO conversion (from 20 to ca. 100%). They also reported that a fine porous Au catalyst could be synthesized by acid treatment with bulk AuCu3 to leach Cu, which exhibited an areal rate of CO oxidation comparable to that of Au/TiO2. (227)
Other than AuCu, a unique Au-based intermetallic compound, AuNa2, was recently reported to be active for CO oxidation at near room temperature. (228) The estimated apparent activation energy for CO oxidation was 31.6 kJ mol1, which is comparable to that of Au/TiO2. This is also a very rare case of catalytic use of an alkali-metal-containing intermetallic compound. The AuNa2 catalyst was prepared by annealing a mixture of elemental Au and Na at 1050 C, followed by grinding into fine particles under N2 and water treatment. They mentioned that the water treatment removed surface Na species and formed an Au-rich surface. A DFT calculation for CO oxidation over an AuNa2(111) surface revealed that (1) Na atoms in the second layer pop out to the top layer upon O2 exposure and act as binding sites of O2 (Figure 9, IS) and that (2) this allows CO reacting directly with O2 to form an OOCO intermediate, which is kinetically favorable (Figure 9, MS). (228)

In the case of PROX conditions, the catalyst is required to be not only selective (not to combust hydrogen) but also active in the low-temperature region (80120 C) corresponding to the working temperature of PEFC. (216) At present, various Pt- and Pd-based bimetallic catalysts have been reported to be effective for PROX. The counterpart metal is a late 3d transition or typical metal (Mn, (229) Fe, (230-232) Co, (223-235) Ni, (236) and Cu (237-239)) present in various states such as oxides, alloys, and intermetallic compounds. The widely accepted explanation for their low-temperature activity is that the second metal acts as an adsorption site for O2, as mentioned for the case of AuCu. (240) A kinetically favored LangmuirHinshelwood-type association of CO and an oxygen species is permitted in the presence of O2 adsorption sites, whereas an EleyRideal association is imposed in the absence of such sites because of the strong adsorption of CO on the Pt surface. Here, we choose some examples of intermetallic catalysts found to be effective for PROX.
Bersani et al. tested a series of PdSn bimetallic catalysts for PROX. (241) They compared the catalytic activity of PdSn/Al2O3 with various PdSn ratios and revealed that increasing Sn content of the catalysts was correlated with higher catalytic activity (lower light-off temperature). Although the individual catalytic properties were not clearly mentioned, some intermetallic phases such as Pd3Sn, Pd2Sn, and Pd21Sn13 were observed for Sn-rich catalysts.
Komatsu et al. compared the catalytic activity of various SiO2-supported Pt-based intermetallic compounds (PtmMn/SiO2; M = Co, Cu, Fe, Ge, Sn, and Tl) and observed that Pt3Co and PtCu were the most active bimetallic combinations. (38) Optimizing the catalyst support resulted in even more active Pt3Co/MgO (28) and PtCu/Al2O3 (30) catalysts, which exhibited more than 95% CO conversion at 100 and 120 C, respectively. In each case, the CO2 selectivity was 50%. Using an IR-TPD technique for CO adsorbed on PtCu/Al2O3 revealed that (1) Cu presented at the surface of PtCu and that (2) CO adsorption on Cu was much weaker than that on Pt. (30) Moreover, a kinetic study suggested that O2 adsorption was promoted by Cu and competed with CO adsorption. These results strongly indicate that Cu acts as an effective O2 adsorption site. XRD analysis showed that no changes in the PtCu phase, such as segregation of Pt and/or CuOx, occurred after the reaction. Note that the reaction atmosphere dominantly consists of hydrogen, so oxidative decomposition of the parent intermetallic phase is less likely to occur, in contrast with CO oxidation over AuCu. In addition to the O2 supply effect, another unique effect was also proposed to occur in these systems. A mechanistic study using D2 labeling indicated that a kinetically favorable reaction path via the formation of bicarbonate intermediate contributes to the low-temperature activity. (28) The bicarbonate intermediate is formed by the reaction of adsorbed CO on Pt, O2 on Co or Cu, and hydrogen in surface hydroxyl groups (Scheme 9).

3.2.4 Electrooxidation
Electrooxidation of fuels such as methanol or ethanol, that are used in direct fuel cells, is one of the most pertinent areas of study for energy conversion from chemicals to electricity. Compared with hydrogen-based fuel cells, direct fuel cells do not require on-site hydrogen storage or onboard steam reformers to produce hydrogen. (242) Monometallic Pt is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of pure hydrogen. However, monometallic Pt is not suitable for the electrodes in small organic fuels because of the destructive poisoning of Pt by CO, which forms as an intermediate during oxidation of organic fuels. PtRu/C is widely known as an efficient electrocatalyst for direct fuel cells, showing a high performance and good CO tolerance compared with Pt/C. (243, 244) However, leaching of Ru from PtRu alloys remains a major problem in direct fuel cells.
Recently, major attention has been focused on Pt-based alloys and intermetallic compounds as electrocatalysts with high catalytic performance and improved corrosion resistance for electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, or formaldehyde. In 2004, Disalvo and Abrua et al. compared the electrocatalytic performance of a series of Pt-based intermetallic compounds (PtmMn; M = Bi, In, Mn, Pb, Sb, and Sn) for oxidation of methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, and ethylene glycol. (242) They observed that most bimetallic catalysts exhibited lower onset potentials and higher current densities than pure Pt and that the best performances were obtained with PtPb, PtBi, and PtIn. Among them, PtPb showed an onset potential that was 100 mV less positive and a peak current density ca. 40 times higher than those of Pt for methanol oxidation. A similar improved performance was also reported using PtSb. In 2008, Abe and Disalvo et al. discovered that intermetallic Pt3Ti showed a superior performance (lower onset potential, lower affinity toward CO, and higher current density) compared to pure Pt and PtRu alloys for oxidation of methanol and formic acid. (34) The lower CO affinity is consistent with its weaker adsorption property mentioned in the last section. These discoveries triggered further exploration of more efficient Pt-based intermetallic catalysts. Several Pt-based have very recently been reported to be effective in direct fuel cell applications: PtGa (Pt3Ga + Pt2Ga), (245) Pt3Nb, (46, 47) Pt8Ti, (246) Pt3Zn, (247) hexagonal Pt3Zr, (33) and coreshell structured Pt3PbPtPb. (248) These catalysts are typically nanosized and can be synthesized by liquid-phase reduction of the metal precursors as mentioned in section 2. It should be noted that the as-prepared Pt3Zr phase has a cubic crystal structure, which transforms into a hexagonal phase by annealing at 9001000 C. (33) Interestingly, hexagonal Pt3Zr exhibits higher catalytic activity and stability than cubic Pt3Zr (Figure 10). This enhancement was explained by an increase in surface energy, which was indicated both experimentally and theoretically. (249-251) A high-energy surface is likely to accelerate adsorption of the fuel molecules.

3.3 Steam Reforming
Steam reforming of fuels such as methane, methanol, and hydrocarbons is a commonly used process for producing hydrogen. Due to its high hydrogen content and ease of storage and transportation, methanol has been widely accepted as an effective hydrogen source for steam reforming. (252) Currently, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts have been commercialized for methanol steam reforming (MSR). (253) However, the byproduction of CO at a level of around 1000 ppm hampers its application to PEFC, where a CO concentration of less than 50 ppm is required. (216) In 1993, a promising catalyst was discovered by Iwasa et al. They reported that the catalytic activity and CO2 selectivity of Pd was drastically improved when ZnO was used as a support. (254) Further characterization revealed that Pd atoms mediated reduction of ZnO to atomic Zn by hydrogen, followed by alloying to form an intermetallic PdZn phase on ZnO. (255, 256) Recent reports oriented toward practical uses suggested that the use of Pd/ZnO catalysts is feasible in designing high-performance methanol steam reformers for portable device applications. (257) The discovery of Pd/ZnO (PdZn/ZnO) catalysts triggered widespread interest for researchers not only in catalytic chemistry but also in the area of fundamental characterization, surface science, and theoretical calculations. Tsai and the collaborators performed XPS and DFT studies on the electronic structure of the PdZn phase. (258) They observed that the Pd 4d level shifted downward away from the Fermi level upon alloying with Zn, resulting in a valence band structure almost identical to that of pure Cu. On the other hand, the valence band structures of less selective PtZn and NiZn differ from those of Cu and PdZn. Interestingly, they also showed that PdCd as an electronic analogue of PdZn gave a high selectivity comparable to those of PdZn and Cu. Based on this observation, they proposed that the catalytic properties necessary for MSR are solely governed by the valence band structure of the catalyst. In a similar manner, they showed that the valence band structure of Pd could be reproduced by alloying Cu and Ni and that a CuNi alloy gave high CO selectivity in MSR and methanol decomposition, which was identical to the behavior of Pd. (259) A number of theoretical approaches to understanding the catalytic properties of PdZn have also been made. (260-264) In terms of calculations, the most stable (111), (100), and the stepped (221) (including Pd- and Zn-terminated) surfaces of intermetallic PdZn with a L10 structure were considered. Xie and Guo et al. performed a thorough DFT study on MSR over PdZn considering the involvement of both methanol and water, the latter of which decisively affects the selectivity. (262) They reported that dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde was kinetically favored on the flat (111) surface (Scheme 10, blue lines), whereas deep dehydrogenation to CO was kinetically unfavorable (Scheme 10, red lines). In contrast, another pathway involving the reaction of formaldehyde with OH, formed by water activation was suggested as a kinetically favorable and likely route to form CO2 (Scheme 10, green lines). The formaldehyde intermediate undergoes deep dehydrogenation to CO or hydroxylation to CO2, which is the turning point determining selectivity. There is approximately 50 kJ mol1 difference in activation energy for PdZn, resulting in the selective CO formation. They also demonstrated that the reaction network on PdZn(111) is very similar to that on Cu(111), which is also consistent with the similarities in the d band structures of PdZn and Cu. A modified overview considering the contribution of PdZn(221) stepped surfaces was also proposed. (22) The activation energies in methanol dehydrogenation to formaldehyde on PdZn(221) surfaces were significantly lower than those on PdZn(111) (260, 265, 266) and close to the experimental apparent activation energy (48 kJ mol1). (267) Therefore, the overall reaction network designated in red values in Scheme 10 is more likely.

Armbrster et al. investigated the effect of the Pd/Zn composition ratio on catalytic performance in MSR. (268) Since the intermetallic PdZn phase possesses a range of compositions (4762.5%Pd), allowing an enrichment in one component without changing the parent tetragonal crystal structure is allowed. They varied the composition of the bulk PdxZny within x = 0.470.59 and revealed that the catalytic activity and selectivity drastically dropped in the Pd-rich region. Surprisingly, the drop in selectivity (from ca. 95 to less than 20%) was observed in a very narrow range (x = 0.480.53). They also pointed out the presence of Zn oxide species on Zn-rich catalysts that were prereduced. On the basis of these results, they proposed that the significant functionality in selective catalysis for SRM arises from the combined effects of PdZn and Zn oxide rather than the intermetallic PdZn phase alone. (268) In relation to this finding, a DFT study on water activation showed that the ZnO(0001) surface (41 kJ mol1) (269) displayed a lower activation energy than the PdZn(221)Zn surface (4359 kJ mol1), (270) suggesting a contribution from Zn oxide species. In this context, Zn oxide likely acts as an effective activation site for water, which is necessary for conversion to CO2. Further details on the properties of PdZn catalysts can be found in recent reviews by Armbrster et al. (22) Their group also reported certain related bimetallic systems for use in MSR. For example, they recently showed that an intermetallic PdIn or Pd2In3 phase was formed on PdO/In2O3 with H2 treatment at 300 or 390 C, respectively. (271) The catalysts containing these intermetallic phases exhibited good CO2 selectivities (PdIn 91%, Pd2In3 98%) and long-term stability up to 100 h in MSR. Bulk intermetallic NiZn was also studied for MSR, which showed 98% selectivity to CO2. (272) In this case, the parent NiZn phase was partially decomposed into a mixture of NiZn, ZnO, and a Ni0.7Zn0.3 alloy, the latter of which was suggested to be true active phase for MSR. Besides, Pd2Ga formed from a hydrotalcite-like PdMgGa composite was reported to be effective for MSR. (166)
3.4 Other Reactions
Here, we cover several intermetallic compound catalysts that have been used for reactions not included in the previous sections. PtSn (273) and PdZn (274, 275) phases were reported to be active in the reverse water gas shift reaction. PdZn also shows high selectivity to oxygenated products in the hydroformylation of ethylene. (276) A series of bulk Ru-based intermetallic compounds (RumMn, M = Ce, Dy, Ge, La, Nb, Sc, Si, Ta, Ti, Y, Zr) were tested for use in ammonia decomposition to produce H2 and N2. (277) Ru2La was found to be more active than other intermetallic compounds and monometallic Ru. This observation was extended to the development of a Raney-type RuLa catalyst prepared by base treatment of the ternary intermetallic compound Ru2LaAl10. The Raney-type RuLa catalyst showed a high specific surface area (ca. 100 m2g1) and higher TOF than the corresponding Raney Ru catalyst prepared from Ru4Al13.
3.5 Remarks
We have listed a number of intermetallic or alloy catalysts for various types of reactions. It is challenging to find a simple and clear-cut concept to describe the diverse roles of the bimetallic phases in enhanced catalysis. However, one may extract some general assessments for each reaction category as follows.
For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability.
For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components. Since oxidation and steam reforming typically use more severe conditions compared with reactions performed in inert or reductive atmospheres, the roles (ii) and (iv) have important implications.
To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches.
4 Important Effects Controlling Catalysis
In the previous section, we showed that intermetallic catalysts provide various effects that enhance catalysis. In this section, these effects are divided into several categories and explained in detail. In addition to the conventional (1) electronic and (2) geometric effects, we introduce (3) steric and (4) ordering effects, which are observed only for intermetallic compounds. These effects sometimes appear together, and therefore, one should carefully distinguish the contributions of each individual effect on enhanced catalysis.
4.1 Electronic Effect
The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity. However, many literature reports on bimetallic catalysts provide fragmentary information about the relationship between the electronic state and reactivity, which makes it challenging to establish a clear-cut relationship. In this section, we describe some systematic studies that clearly represent how the electronic state governs reactivity.
For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character. (281, 282) According to this model, the adsorptivity and reactivity are determined by the position of the center of mass of d electrons and holes (d band centers) relative to the Fermi level. This is because the d band center determines the positions of bonding and antibonding states, and hence the degree of filling of the antibonding states. The entire d band structure can be observed experimentally using X-ray emission and absorption spectra in the valence band region, which reflect occupied and unoccupied states, respectively. Alternatively, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques can be used. Linic et al. employed the latter techniques with the aid of DFT calculations for the NiSn system. (283) They found that (1) the addition of Sn to Ni weakened adsorption of various species such as C, O, CH, and CO and that (2) the d band center of Ni was downshifted by alloying with Sn. These observations were reasonably linked on the basis of d band theory. They also revealed that the number of d electrons and holes of Ni were preserved upon alloying with Sn, indicating no charge transfer between Ni and Sn. The change in the d band structure was explained by the formation of new electronic states due to hybridization between the d states of Ni and the s and p states of Sn.
A more clear relationship between reactivity and d band center was reported by Stamenkovic et al. They observed a volcano-relationship between activity in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) over Pt3M (M = Ti, V, Fe, Co, and Ni) and their d band center values (Figure 11). (284) This trend is explained as follows. When the d band center is too far from the Fermi level (left side of the volcano), weak adsorption of O2 and intermediates limit the reaction rate. On the other hand, if the d band center is too close to the Fermi level (right side of the volcano), strong adsorption of surface species such as OH inhibits the release of free Pt and limits the reaction rate. A similar relationship was also reported, for H2D2 equilibration over Ni and various Ni3M intermetallic compounds (M = Ge, Nb, Sn, Ta, and Ti). (285) A strong positive correlation was observed (Figure 12) between the d band centers and the apparent activation energies obtained by Arrhenius-type plots. The lower d band center weakens NiH(D) bonds, which lowers the desorption barrier of HD. For H2D2 equilibration, the desorption barrier of HD corresponds to the overall activation energy (Scheme 11). In this case, no top was observed as in the case for ORR, probably due to the absence of any competing path. Although these two studies estimated the d band center only from XPS or ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), it should be noted that good correlations were found. In a related study, it was reported that the d band centers measured from photoelectron spectroscopy agreed with those calculated by DFT. (286) This might be due to the much smaller number of unoccupied states than of occupied states.

In addition to the structure of the valence band, electron density of the active metal is often considered as the key role to control catalytic performance. The formation of intermetallic phase typically induces charge transfer from one metal to the other due to the significant difference in the electron-withdrawing character. (79, 81, 86) Partially charged metal atoms are likely to interact preferentially with polar molecules, providing a specific reaction pathway. The electron density of the active metal component of intermetallic compounds is evaluated typically by vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO, where the electron density affects the CO bond strength by π back-bonding. Figure 13 shows the relationship between vibrational frequencies of linearly adsorbed CO on Rh-based intermetallic compounds and their calculated atomic charges (Hirshfeld charge) of bulk or surface Rh. (81) A strong correlation was observed between the vibrational frequencies and Rh atomic charges, demonstrating that the vibrational frequency effectively reflects the electron density of Rh. Rh becomes electron-rich by the formation of intermetallic phases with the partial charge ranging from 0 to 0.14. It should be noted that the electron density of Rh can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. For most compounds, atomic charges of surface Rh were slightly more negative than those of bulk Rh, probably due to the presence of dangling bonds.

Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment.
4.2 Geometric Effect
The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions. There has been several reactions that require large ensembles as follows: (1) hydrogenolysis, (287-289) (2) dehydrocyclyzation, (289) (3) acetylene coupling to benzene, (290) (4) alkylidene formation, (91) and (5) dissociative adsorption of CO (291) and NO. (292) Among these, hydrogenolysis of CC, CO, or CN bonds and alkylidene formation leading to alkane typically occur in the hydrogenation or dehydrogenation process as undesired side reactions. Because hydrogenation or dehydrogenation does not require large ensembles, (91) the formation of an intermetallic phase that reduces the ensemble size, drastically improves the selectivity for the desired reaction.
Thus, in a commonly used sense, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, (278, 293) which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode. In this context, the formation of intermetallic or alloy phases is generally accompanied not only by ensemble effects but also by ligand effects. This is because the incorporation of the second metal, whose character differs significantly from the parent metal, typically induces a drastic change in the electronic structure and hence in the adsorption strength and reaction profiles as well. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the individual contributions of these effects. Nrskov et al. proposed a theory-based quantitative estimation of ligand and ensemble effects using CO adsorption on the Au-doped Pd(111) surface. (293)Scheme 12 shows a schematic illustration of this concept: CO is adsorbed on a series of hollow sties, where the number of Au atoms in the hollow site increases from 0 to 3. The number of Au atoms neighboring the hollow site differs between the upper and lower columns. In each column, the energy gained by Au incorporation includes the contribution of both ensemble and ligand effects (total effect = En+1  En) because the adsorbent atom and composition vary. Here, the ligand effect is represented as the difference in adsorption energy between two hollow sites with an identical Pd/Au composition and different numbers of neighboring Au atoms, namely, En  En. The ensemble effect is obtained by subtracting the ligand effect from the corresponding total effect, namely, En+1  En. Figure 14 shows the ligand, ensemble, and total effects as functions of n, revealing that the ensemble effect dominates the total effect. (293)

Another approach to studying an intrinsic ensemble effect was recently reported by Widmer et al. using well-defined PdGa(111) and (111) surfaces. (294) Although these two surfaces have equal surface symmetries and very similar electronic structures, the atomic configurations of Pd differ significantly: (111) has a separated 3-fold Pd3 trimer, whereas (111) has an isolated single Pd1 atom. These specific characteristics allow the intrinsic ensemble effect to be studied with a minimum contribution from ligand effects. Figure 15 shows scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of PdGa(111) and (111) surfaces with a very low coverage of CO adsorption. (294) CO molecules were adsorbed on the hollow site for the (111) surface (triangular depression), whereas they occurred on the top site for the (111) surface (bright protrusion). A reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) study revealed that for the (111) surface, migration to on-top adsorption was observed upon an increase in the CO coverage, whereas for (111), only on-top adsorption was observed. Note that no bridging CO was observed on PdGa(111) unlike for Pd(111), where migration to hollow, bridge, and on-top adsorption is typically observed. These observations could be attributed to the intrinsic ensemble effect of the specific Pd configurations.

For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect. Next, we show an example of the site addition effect allowing a drastic change in the product selectivity. As shown in section 3.1.4, PdZn/Al2O3 shows a high selectivity in alcohol-based N-alkylation of reactive amines, whereas Pd/Al2O3 gave poor selectivity to the desired product. (149) The selectivity generally depends on which alcohol or amine is activated: alcohol activation leads to N-alkylation, while amine activation leads to undesired amine dimerization. Figure 16 shows the adsorption energies of O and N atoms on hollow sites of Pd(111), PdCu(110), and PdZn(111) surfaces. (149) On Pd(111), N shows a higher adsorption energy than O, representing the azophilic character of Pd. In contrast, for PdCu(110), incorporation of Cu inverted this trend, producing an oxophilic surface. On PdZn(111), adsorption of O becomes much more strongly favored with a difference in adsorption energy of 90 kJ mol1. Thus, a drastic change in the adsorption properties is achieved by the formation of a PdZn phase, which is attributed to the strong oxophilic character of the Zn atom. Thus, the PdZn surface is capable of preferential adsorption and activation of alcohol over amines, enabling highly selective N-alkylation catalysis. Figure 17 shows the relationship between selectivity and the difference in adsorption energy between N and O (ΔEON). (149) The relative reaction rate of alcohol activation over amine activation was employed as a measure of selectivity. A strong positive correlation was observed, demonstrating the preferential adsorption and activation achieved by surface modification. Note that the vertical axis is represented on a logarithmic scale. This is because the relative rate should be proportional to the exponential of the energy difference, provided that the selectivity is thermodynamically controlled. A detailed explanation is provided in the next section. Thus, an intermetallic compound that has additional functional sites neighboring at the atomic level provides an effective bifunctional reaction environment.

In a strict sense, this site addition effect might include both geometric and electronic contributions similarly to the discussion for the quantitative estimation of ensemble and ligand effects (Scheme12 and Figure 14). In this context, one may wonder about the change in the adsorption properties due to the modified d band structure of PdZn being similar to that of Cu, as mentioned in section 3.3. However, it was reported that Cu/Al2O3 showed a lower selectivity in N-alkylation than PdZn/Al2O3: for example, for N-benzylation of aniline, Cu/Al2O3 shows 85% selectivity, while PdZn/Al2O3 exhibits >99% selectivity. (295) Therefore, the high selectivity observed for PdZn cannot be explained only by the electronic effects.
4.3 Steric Effect
Electronic and geometric effects are generally observed for both alloys and intermetallic compounds. This means that the orderedness of intermetallic phases is not essential to these effects. One may question which functions only intermetallic compounds can do. Considering that a specific and ordered atomic arrangement appears on the surface of intermetallic compounds, such an environment might impose some steric restrictions to adsorbate configurations and/or reaction dynamics, thereby allowing controlled catalysis. Very recently, two examples of such catalysis were reported by Furukawa et al. using Rh-based intermetallic compounds. One is the stereoselective alkene isomerization by hydrogen over RhSb/SiO2, (123) briefly mentioned in section 3.1.2. Hydrogen-mediated alkene isomerization is generally accompanied by overhydrogenation to alkane due to hydrogen attack from several directions. However, some Rh- and Ru-based intermetallic compounds belonging to the orthorhombic Pnma space group (RhSb, RuSb, and RhGe) showed high trans-alkene selectivity in isomerization of cis-stilbene (Figure 18, red bars). In contrast, Rh and Rh-based intermetallic compounds of the cubic Pm3m space groups (RhGa, RhIn, and RhZn) showed low selectivities to trans-stilbene over overhydrogenated diphenylethane. A similar result was also observed for isomerization of cis-β-methylstylene (Figure 18, green bars), suggesting that the selectivity depends on the space group of the solid. To the best of our knowledge, this observation, space-group-dependent selectivity, has never been reported in the literature on catalytic conversion. Interestingly, for cis-β-methylstylene, each selectivity was slightly lower than that for cis-stilbene. Thus, the selectivity is likely to depend not only on the space group of the solid but also on the steric hindrance of the alkyl group of alkenes. These results strongly suggest that some steric effects occur on the specific surface structure of Pnma intermetallic compounds. A Wulff construction and FT-IR study with CO adsorption on RhSb revealed that the surface was dominated by (211), (020), and (013) planes (Scheme 13). (123) These surfaces certainly display specific atomic arrangements, where one-dimensionally aligned and slightly zigzagged Rh and Sb arrays appear. DFT calculations showed that on these planes (hereafter, 1D-planes), hydrogen diffusion on the surface is restricted in the direction along the Rh arrays. Moreover, DFT calculations with adsorbed cis-2-butene suggested that access of hydrogen to the alkenyl carbon atoms of cis-2-butene is limited to only one direction (Scheme 13, light green arrow) because of the steric hindrance of one methyl group of cis-2-butene (Scheme 13, right side). This unique hydrogenation behavior allows one-atom hydrogenation for isomerization but inhibits two-atom hydrogenation for alkane formation. Thus, the specific surface structure of 1D-planes imposed a steric restriction on the reaction dynamics of hydrogen addition. On the other hand, for cubic compounds, overhydrogenation over Rh-terminated planes such as (100) is attributed to the low selectivities.

The other example is the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes over RhIn/SiO2, (81) mentioned in section 3.1.1.2. In this catalytic system, the selectivity to aminostyrene at 50% conversion varies widely from 3% (Rh/SiO2) to 97% (RhIn/SiO2), depending on the metallic phase. A kinetic study on this system revealed that the rate-determining step was hydrogen supply (dissolution or diffusion) and that adsorption of the substrate nitrostyrene was saturated. Therefore, the selectivity depends on which functional group of nitrostyrene, nitro or vinyl, binds preferentially to the surface. Figure 19 shows the relationship between nitro-hydrogenation selectivity and adsorption energy (Ead) of 4-nitrostyrene (NS) with nitro and vinyl moieties. (81) As a selectivity scale, the ratio of the nitro hydrogenation rate to the vinyl hydrogenation rate (rNO2/rCC) was set as the y-axis. The Ead of vinyl adsorption differed drastically depending on the surface, displaying a positive correlation with selectivity. Conversely, for nitro adsorption, the Ead values are within a small range without any correlation. Thus, the selectivity varies depending on the favorability of vinyl adsorption. For monometallic Rh, multiple coordination to Rh ensembles makes vinyl adsorption significantly favored. This is clearly reflected in the presence of aromatic CH bonds with sp3-like conformations. However, for bimetallic surfaces, this effect is diminished by inert second metal atoms adjacent to Rh atoms. The aromatic CH bonds show sp2-like conformations (e.g., RhZn and RhPb2), suggesting very weak adsorption. Vinyl adsorption becomes much less favored when the Rh sites are concave (e.g., RhIn and RhBi). This is because bending of the π plane is needed to avoid the significant steric hindrance between the second metal and the phenyl ring. On the other hand, such steric hindrance can be avoided for nitro adsorption because the nitro adsorption has an end-on geometry, thereby fitting within the concave Rh sites. Thus, the concave Rh structure observed for RhIn(110) is capable of chemoselective molecular recognition.

The relationship between the selectivity and Ead has a physical meaning as represented in eq 1:
where rx, NSx, NS, and Ex (x = NO2 or CC) are the hydrogenation rate of x, adsorbed NS with x, unadsorbed NS, and adsorption energy of NS with x, respectively. The equation indicates the conversion of the rate ratio to the adsorbate concentration ratio and represents the fraction of adsorbed NS using the Boltzmann distribution equation with its Ead. As a consequence, a simple proportional relationship is found between the logarithm of the rate ratio and ΔE. The plot of this function shows a good linear relationship through the origin (Figure 20), demonstrating the validity of this model. (81)

In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry.
4.4 Ordering Effect
The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect. Here, we should consider a certain bimetallic alloy that is able to form both ordered and disordered structures. For bulk materials, such bimetallic combinations are rare (e.g., AuCu, PtFe, PtCo, and PtCu). These pairs of metals are slightly separated in the periodic table compared with solid-solution alloys (Figure 3). Therefore, these alloys have intermediate characters between those of solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds. Ordered alloys in this category are called Kurnakov-type intermetallic compounds, (296) which have very large compositional ranges. As shown in the phase diagram of the PtCo bimetallic system (Figure 21), (297) the ordered PtCo phase ranges from ca. 40 to 75% Co in the low-temperature region. However, above 825 C, Pt and Co become isomorphous, and disordered PtCo alloys are formed. In the case of nanoparticles, deviation from phase diagrams may occur because their situation differs significantly from that of bulk materials (e.g., effects of dangling bonds). Ordered and disordered structures are distinguished by the presence or absence of additional diffraction patterns derived from the superlattice structures. Figure 22a shows the XRD patterns of ordered PtCu3 and disordered Pt0.25Cu0.75 particles with their atomic arrangements. (298) Ordered PtCu3 exhibited two additional peaks at 24 and 34 corresponding to 100 and 110 reflections of the Pm3m structure, respectively. Conversely, for disordered Pt0.25Cu0.75, these reflections do not appear due to the extinction rule for the highly symmetric Fm3m space group. Figure 22b shows TEM image of a partially ordered PtCu3 nanoparticle with coreshell disorderedordered structure. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the core and shell regions (Figure 22c,d, respectively) showed the corresponding Fm3m and Pm3m reflections, respectively.

The ordering effect was first reported by Watanabe et al. in 1994, where ordered and disordered PtCo alloys were tested for ORR. (299) They prepared an ordered tetragonal PtCo alloy (intermetallic compound) by annealing as-prepared PtCo at 600 C. Additional annealing at 800 or 900 C followed by quenching resulted in a structural transformation into the disordered PtCo alloy with an fcc structure, which is consistent with the phase diagram shown in Figure 21. They found that the ordered PtCo alloy showed 1.35-fold higher electrocatalytic activity. In this decade, similar improvements in electrocatalytic performance have been reported using Pt3Ti, (34) Pt3Co, (300, 301) PtFe, (302) and PtCu3. (298, 303-305) Note that in some of these materials, remarkable enhancements in electrocatalytic activity and durability have been achieved through structure ordering. (34, 301, 304) For instance, for Pt3Ti-catalyzed methanol electrooxidation, Pt3Ti with an ordered Pm3m structure (intermetallic compound with an L12 structure) showed a much higher current density than that with a disordered Fm3m structure (solid-solution alloy with an fcc structure (e.g., 0.34 vs 0.084 mAcm2 at the potential of +0.6 V), (34) indicating an influence from the ordering effect. In this study, the ordered Pt3Ti was prepared by annealing the disordered Pt3Ti at 600 C, causing a significant increase in the particle size form ca. 3 to 37 nm. Therefore, involvement of a size effect in enhanced catalytic performance has been suggested in addition to the ordering effect. Thus, in most of the cases referred to above, the important factors affecting the electrocatalytic performance typically varies, such as particle size distribution and/or the bimetallic composition, making it challenging to clarify the intrinsic contribution of the ordering effect on enhanced performance.
Very recently, Hodnik et al. studied the ordering effect in ORR using ordered and disordered PtCu3 alloys with an identical initial composition, particle dispersion, and size distribution to eliminate all coinciding effects. (298) They observed that the ordered PtCu3 nanoparticles supported on carbon exhibited higher electrocatalytic performance and durability in various conditions than the disordered PtCu3 catalyst. The higher durability was attributed to a higher resistance to Cu leaching in the ordered structure. The ordered PtCu3 structure statistically includes 24 CuCu and 24 PtCu bonds per unit cell on average, whereas the disordered structure contains 27 CuCu, 18 PtCu, and 3 PtPt bonds. Considering the much lower potential of copper leaching from a Cu substrate than from Pt (0.34 to 0.7 V), (306, 307) the ordered structure containing fewer CuCu bonds should exhibit higher resistance to Cu leaching. Although the authors did not clearly mention it, in our opinion the higher resistance to Cu leaching could be categorized as an ordering effect, namely, a geometric ordering effect. This effect maximizes the number of ideal sites (here, PtCu bonds). To exclude the effect of Cu leaching, they also plotted the specific and mass activities as functions of the amount of Cu removed as shown in Figure 23. (298) The ordered PtCu3 showed higher activities than the disordered PtCu3 in the entire region, clearly indicating that the greater amount of residual Cu is not the sole reason for the enhancement and that an intrinsic ordering effect is operating. Although the nature of the intrinsic ordering effect has not been clarified, they suggested two possibilities: the ordered structure (1) changes the lateral strain in the Pt-skin overlayer, modifying the binding energies of the adsorbates and (2) results in the formation of a skin-type rather than a skeleton-type morphology after dealloying. In any case, the observed ordering effect is certainly another example of what only intermetallic compounds can do, in addition to the steric effect.

From a macroscopic perspective, the durability of ordered alloys may be related to their higher thermodynamic stability, that is, a negative heat of ordering (ΔH0). Considering that the change in entropy for ordering is negative (ΔS0 < 0), ΔH0 must be sufficiently negative (ΔH0 < 0) to cancel out the entropy term because the formation of an ordered structure upon annealing at high temperatures is spontaneous (ΔG0 < 0). This concept is consistent with the observation that annealing at very high temperatures results in disordering (>800 C, PtCo) (299) due to the significant contribution of the entropy term.
4.5 Remarks
In this section, we have summarized the various effects that control the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds (i.e., electronic, geometric, steric, and ordering effects). It is noteworthy that the electronic state and the surface environment of the catalyst can be well controlled by an appropriate choice of a bimetallic combination and composition. This allows for more sophisticated fine-tuning of the catalyst design compared with conventional techniques for inorganic heterogeneous catalysts.
5 Future Tasks in This Field
As mentioned in the above sections, intermetallic compounds have various advantages that aid in constructing well-structured reaction environments. However, several future tasks should be considered in order to develop and establish a novel catalytic chemistry based on intermetallic compounds, as outlined below. In addition, several challenges involved in performing highly difficult reactions using intermetallic compounds are also mentioned.
5.1 Stability of Surface Structures
For heterogeneous solid catalysts, any catalytic reaction occurs at the outermost surface of the solid. Therefore, the real surface structure of the catalyst material should be taken into account. Particularly for intermetallic catalysts operating in the presence of oxidizing molecules such as O2 or H2O, it is necessary to know whether the second metal retains its original intermetallic state in order to determine the role of the intermetallic phase. In relation to this, Behrens et al. recently showed an example of an intermetallic compound of which surface was highly sensitive to air and water. (111, 308) They observed that the surface of Pd2Ga decomposed into a mixture of Pd and Ga oxide species even under an Ar atmosphere with trace amounts of O2 and H2O (<100 ppb), indicating the highly oxophilic character of Ga. In this system, TEM observations showed that a thin Ga oxide overlayer was observed around the surface of Pd2Ga particles. A similar surface decomposition of Pd2Ga was also confirmed in liquid-phase hydrogenation of alkynes. The formation of oxide phase in the presence of oxygen was also observed for PdZn catalysts. (268) A highly oxophilic character of the component of intermetallic compounds was also observed for Pd3Ti or Pd3Nb, where surface oxidation occurs even in the presence of <1 ppb O2. (48) On the other hand, a remarkable oxidation resistance of the second base metal was also reported. Baiker et al. performed an in situ XAFS characterization of a PdBi/Al2O3 catalyst during liquid-phase oxidation of alcohol under 1 atm O2. (187) They showed that Bi retained the zerovalent state until the substrate alcohol was consumed, which was followed by aerobic oxidation of Bi(0) to Bi3+. This indicates that oxygen is used only for consuming the eliminated hydrogen from alcohol, not for surface oxidation during the presence of alcohol as a hydrogen donor. Note that for this catalyst, Bi is loaded on the surface of Pd but is not present in the bulk, therefore the Bi-LIII edge XAFS data provides information about the surface. Furthermore, an XPS analysis of a Pd3Pb/SiO2 catalyst for amine oxidation revealed that Pb in the Pd3Pb phase nearly retained the metallic state with a trace amount of PbO even after contact with air. (203) This catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 400 C, followed by immediate transportation (in air) into the spectrometer. Moreover, for the RhSb/SiO2 catalyst for alkene isomerization, TEM observations revealed that amorphous overlayers could not be detected around the RhSb nanoparticles, (123) indicating that significant surface degradation of RhSb does not occur through TEM sample preparation using an organic solvent in air. Thus, the stability of the intermetallic phase depends on the particular bimetallic combination. The diversity in the stability of intermetallic phases can probably be attributed to intrinsic oxophilicity of the second metal. Strictly speaking, for example, the adsorption energy of an oxygen atom on an individual surface may be an indicator of the degree of oxophilicity. Alternatively, as a rough scale of oxophilicity, we propose using the oxidation potentials of the metals. Figure 24 shows an energy diagram of the oxidation potentials of various metals to the corresponding divalent or trivalent cations. (44) This is also a quantitative representation of the ionization tendency. In this diagram, the base metals showing high oxophilicity (Ti, Zn, and Ga, red lines) possess low reduction potentials, whereas other base metals that exhibit oxidation tolerance (Bi, Sb, Pb, blue lines) have moderate potentials. Because standard oxidation potentials are measured in aqueous solutions, (44) the reaction phase and situation may differ largely from those for heterogeneous systems. Therefore, this representation is somewhat lacking in accuracy; however, we can apply this trend as an approximate gauge reflecting the intrinsic oxidizability of the metals.
Figure 24
Figure 24. Energy diagram of standard oxidation potentials of various metals. For each metal, the potential for oxidation to the divalent (Cu, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Sn, Ti, and Zn) or trivalent (Bi, Ga, and Rh) cation was adopted. For antimony, the potential refers to the following reaction; SbO+ + 2H+ + 3e = Sb(s) + H2O(l).
In addition to the oxidation tolerance, we should consider whether the surface of as prepared intermetallic compounds retains the bulk-terminated structure. In general, for solid-solution alloys (309, 310) and Kurnakov-type intermetallic compounds, (311) the composition ratio of the two metals often differs between surface and subsurface regions due to segregation. However, this is not always the case with intermetallic compounds. For example, an extensive surface characterization of annealed Pt3Ti(111) and (100) single crystal surfaces using AES, XPS, and LEED revealed that these surfaces have ordered structures expected from truncation of the bulk crystal. (312, 313) A more clear evidence of bulk-truncated termination can be observed in the STM images of PdGa(111) surfaces as already shown in Figure 15. Note that these results suggest that no adsorbate-induced surface reconstruction occurs, which is often observed for monometallic or alloy surfaces. The surface stability of the powdered PdGa catalyst was also investigated by FT-IR with CO adsorption and in situ XPS and prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) analyses during acetylene semihydrogenation. (314) No segregation of Pd and dissolution of C and/or H atoms into the bulk was observed, demonstrating the surface stability of PdGa. Probably, the robustness of the intermetallic compounds relies on the thermodynamic stability. Table 2 summarizes the formation enthalpies (ΔHf) of various intermetallic compounds covered in this review. (315-332) Pt3Ti (94 kJ mol1) and PdGa (79 kJ mol1) showed highly negative ΔHf values, indicating that deviation from the ordered structure is thermodynamically unfavorable, and therefore, the ordered structure is thermodynamically stable. Other intermetallic compounds showed moderately to significantly negative ΔHf values (typically 30  100 kJ mol1), suggesting high stability. Conversely, Kurnakov-type intermetallic compounds (10.0  16.0 kJ mol1) and solid-solution alloys (typically 0 kJ mol1) have much less negative ΔHf values. The deviation in ΔHf between PtCo and Pt0.5Co0.5 corresponds to the heat of ordering (ΔH0) as mentioned in section 4.4. Thus, the structural stability of the intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys can be understood in terms of formation enthalpy. However, for a few layer thick surface alloys, surface reconstruction somewhat occurs even though the bulk intermetallic compound is highly stables. Figure 25 shows the standard row structure of 4-layer thick PdZn surface alloy on Pd(111) and the reconstructed zigzag structure. (333) According to TPD, polarization-modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRAS), and DFT studies, Weilach et al. proposed that CO adsorption induced surface reconstruction to the zigzag structure. The DFT calculation suggested that (1) the zigzag structure with CO adsorbed is energetically favored to the row structure and that (2) the former favors on-top CO adsorption, while the latter favors bridge adsorption. The PM-IRAS study showed the absence of the stable bridge adsorption, supporting the zigzag structure. Although the bulk PdZn or thicker layer was not considered in this study, the obtained result indicates the possibility of adsorbate-induced surface reconstruction for small intermetallic nanoparticles. Therefore, careful discussion based on spectroscopic and theoretical approaches is necessary to develop an atomic-level understanding of the catalysis of supported intermetallic compounds.

5.2 Contribution of Individual Crystal Planes
With the development of structure-dependent catalysis on specific surfaces of intermetallic compounds, one should consider the contribution of the individual crystal planes that are actually exposed on the overall catalytic performance. For example, for alkene isomerization over RhSb/SiO2, a DFT-based Wulff construction suggested that the (211), (020), and (013) planes dominate the surface. (123) However, the major (211) plane has a low surface energy, thereby displaying highly positive adsorption energies for alkene. This unfavorable adsorption probably minimizes its contribution to the overall catalytic reaction rate. Therefore, the overall reaction rate and selectivity should depend on the properties of the (020) and (013) planes. However, it is desirable to provide experimental supports for such a discussion, which in most cases can be obtained using well-defined single crystals with surface science techniques. As an alternative approach, the use of shape-controlled nanoparticles may be available. Shape-controlled nanoparticles have specific surface truncations; for example, the surface of Pt nanoparticles with a cubic or tetrahedral structure is terminated exclusively by (100) and (111) facets, respectively. (334) Such nanoparticles have been used as well-defined single crystal surfaces to overcome a material gap. (334) Although shape-controlled synthesis of monometallic nanoparticles has been established, (335) that of intermetallic nanoparticles is highly challenging and in an early phase of development. (247) The difficulty lies in the simultaneous reduction of two metal precursors of which reduction potentials and rates are very different. Successive alloying of monometallic nanoparticles to intermetallic analogues with the polyol synthesis method (43) is also applicable to this goal. This method allows low-temperature synthesis of intermetallic nanoparticles without any sintering or aggregation. Using shape-controlled monometallic nanoparticles as the starting materials for the polyol synthesis might be a possible approach to the synthesis of shape-controlled intermetallic nanoparticles.
5.3 Challenge to Enantioselective Conversions
The steric effects imposed by the specific structure of intermetallic compounds allows stereoselective and chemoselective conversions as shown in section 4.3. Applying such types of specific surface structures will enable the development of similarly sophisticated catalysis, such as regioselective conversions. How about enantioselective conversions? To develop a catalytically active site allowing enantioselective conversion, one must construct reaction environments capable of chiral recognition at an atomic level as observed for metal complexes. To this day, a number of heterogeneous catalysts for enantioselective conversion have been reported. However, they employed certain organic molecules such as cinchona alkaloids (336, 337) or β-ketoesters (336) as chiral sources. In this context, it is a long-standing goal to achieve enantioselective conversion using an all-inorganic chiral catalyst. Although some inorganic materials such as quartz, (338) ITQ-37 zeolite, (338) and chiral metalorganic frameworks (339) have been known to possess chirality, their chiral units are on the order of several nanometers, which is too large to recognize the chirality of small molecules. Recently, Gellman et al. reported enantioselective autocatalytic decomposition of tartaric acids over chiral Cu(643)R(S) and analogous surfaces. (340) In this case, insufficient chiral recognition at the kink sites of the monometallic chiral surface (Figure 26) was amplified by autocatalysis to achieve high enantioselectivity. To provide a sufficient chiral recognition capability by inorganic materials, a far more specific and ordered reaction environment is needed. One promising candidate is an intermetallic compound belonging to a chiral space group, such as PdGa, PtGa, and RhSn (P213 space group). Their surfaces (e.g., PdGa(111)) display enantiomorphic atomic arrangements of catalytically active metals, as shown in Figure 15. PdGa has two types of enantiomeric crystal forms named PdGa:A and PdGa:B. The complementary enantiomer of the PdGa:A(111) surface is the PdGa:B(111) surface. (341) The chiral arrangement of each surface is designated by the cyan and red triangles, which indicate the 3-fold Pd and Ga sites in the subsurface, respectively. Very recently, Widmer et al. reported highly enantioselective adsorption of a prochiral molecule, 9-ethynylphenanthrene (9-EP), on these all-inorganic chiral surfaces. (341) The adsorption of 9-EP on the PdGa:A(111) and B(111) surface at room temperature forms chiral (R) and (S) adsorption complexes. For adsorption on PdGa:A(111), the (R) surface enantiomer dominates the adsorption configuration. Conversely, the excess of the (S) configuration is observed for PdGa:B(111). The statistical analysis for R and S configuration revealed an enantiomeric excess of 94% and 98% on PdGa:A(111) and PdGa:B(111), respectively. (341) Thus, the chiral intermetallic surface is indeed capable of chiral recognition. Although achieving enantioselective catalytic conversion such as hydrogenation remains a highly challenging task, it may be achieved in the near future.

6 Concluding Remarks
In this review, we have summarized the fundamental concepts related to intermetallic compounds for catalyst design and their applicability to a variety of chemical conversions, including hydrogenation, oxidation, reforming, and electrocatalysis. The intermetallic catalysts typically exhibit catalytic performances superior to those of monometallic catalysts or enables highly difficult molecular transformations that cannot be achieved by conventional metal catalysts. By surveying the catalytic performances and the key roles of the active intermetallic phases, we can identify several effects, such as electronic, geometric, steric, and ordering effects, as the fundamental functions that govern catalysis. In particular, steric and ordering effects are observed only for intermetallic compounds and not for disordered alloys, because these effects rely on the orderedness and specific structures of the intermetallic phases. In terms of electronic effects, we showed that electronic structures such as the d band center or electron density can be controlled broadly by changing the second metal. An appropriate choice of the bimetallic combination and composition enables good control of the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, the stability of surface structures should also be considered, particularly for combinations containing a highly oxidizable metal. Based on the aforementioned overview, we summarize the advantages of intermetallic compounds for inorganic catalyst materials as follows:
Control of the electronic structure
Specific and ordered structure at an atomic level
Homogeneity of the geometric and electronic structures
These factors are necessary to produce a well-designed reaction environment. Appropriate combination of these factors However, we note that conventional inorganic materials for heterogeneous catalytic systems poorly satisfy these requirements. Moreover, the ordered structures of intermetallic compounds are suitable to construct theoretical model structures for computational approaches. Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials for developing well-structured catalysts and they entail various novel concepts in relation to fundamental catalytic chemistry. Further investigations to obtain more efficient catalysts and deeper understanding will establish new strategies for designing bimetallic catalysts and begin the next stage of catalytic chemistry.
