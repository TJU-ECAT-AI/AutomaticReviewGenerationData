[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles."

[2] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character."

[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

[4] "Electronic and geometric effects are generally observed for both alloys and intermetallic compounds. This means that the orderedness of intermetallic phases is not essential to these effects."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Geometric effects alter the surface structure by incorporating less active metals, reducing coordination numbers and ensemble sizes of active sites. This can enhance selectivity by suppressing undesired reactions requiring larger ensembles.

2. Electronic effects modify the d-band structure of active metals, changing adsorption energies and reaction barriers. The d-band center position relative to the Fermi level governs reactivity according to the d-band theory.

3. The combination of geometric and electronic effects allows fine-tuning of catalytic properties. By choosing appropriate second metals and compositions, both surface geometry and electronic states can be controlled.

4. Intermetallic compounds offer additional control through their ordered structures, enabling more precise design of active sites.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Rational design of bimetallic catalysts based on d-band theory predictions.

2. Engineering specific surface structures in intermetallic compounds to create unique active sites.

3. Developing synthesis methods for shape-controlled intermetallic nanoparticles to expose desired facets.

4. Combining computational modeling with in-situ characterization to understand structure-property relationships.

5. Exploring ternary or more complex alloy systems to further expand the design space.

6. Utilizing the ordering effect in intermetallic compounds to enhance stability and create novel electronic structures.

By leveraging these synergistic effects, researchers can develop catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability that outperform traditional monometallic systems across a wide range of reactions.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 几何效应通过引入活性较低的金属来改变表面结构，减少活性位点的配位数和集合大小。这可以通过抑制需要较大集合的不希望发生的反应来提高选择性。

2. 电子效应修改活性金属的d带结构，改变吸附能和反应能垒。根据d带理论，d带中心相对于费米能级的位置决定了反应活性。

3. 几何效应和电子效应的结合允许对催化性能进行精细调节。通过选择适当的第二种金属和组成，可以同时控制表面几何结构和电子态。

4. 金属间化合物通过其有序结构提供额外的控制，使活性位点的设计更加精确。

利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括：
