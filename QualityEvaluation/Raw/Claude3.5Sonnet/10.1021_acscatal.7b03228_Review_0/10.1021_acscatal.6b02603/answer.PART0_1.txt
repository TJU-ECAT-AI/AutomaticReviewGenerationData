[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles."

[2] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character."

[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Geometric effects alter the surface structure by incorporating less active metals, reducing coordination numbers and ensemble sizes of active metal sites. This can enhance selectivity by limiting undesired reactions requiring large ensembles.

2. Electronic effects modify the d-band structure of active metals, changing adsorption energies and reaction barriers. The d-band center position relative to the Fermi level is a key descriptor of reactivity.

3. The combination of geometric and electronic effects allows fine-tuning of catalytic properties. By choosing appropriate second metals and compositions, both surface geometry and electronic structure can be optimized.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Rational design of intermetallic compounds with specific atomic arrangements to create well-defined active sites.

2. Using computational modeling to predict optimal electronic structures and guide alloy composition.

3. Developing synthesis methods for shape-controlled bimetallic nanoparticles to expose desired facets.

4. Creating core-shell or surface alloy structures to combine geometric and electronic effects.

5. Exploring ternary alloys to further expand the tunability of catalytic properties.

By leveraging the synergy between geometric and electronic effects, these strategies can produce highly efficient and selective catalysts that outperform traditional monometallic systems across a wide range of reactions.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能:

1. 几何效应通过引入较不活跃的金属来改变表面结构，降低活性金属位点的配位数和集合体大小。这可以通过限制需要大集合体的不需要的反应来提高选择性。

2. 电子效应修改活性金属的d带结构，改变吸附能和反应势垒。d带中心相对于费米能级的位置是反应活性的关键描述符。

3. 几何效应和电子效应的结合允许对催化性能进行精细调节。通过选择适当的第二种金属和成分，可以同时优化表面几何结构和电子结构。

利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括:

1. 理性设计具有特定原子排列的金属间化合物，以创建明确定义的活性位点。

2. 使用计算机模型预测最佳电子结构并指导合金成分。

3. 开发形状可控的双金属纳米粒子的合成方法，以暴露所需的晶面。

4. 创建核-壳或表面合金结构，以结合几何和电子效应。

5. 探索三元合金，进一步扩大催化性能的可调性。

通过利用几何效应和电子效应之间的协同作用，这些策略可以产生高效和选择性的催化剂，在各种反应中优于传统的单金属系统。
