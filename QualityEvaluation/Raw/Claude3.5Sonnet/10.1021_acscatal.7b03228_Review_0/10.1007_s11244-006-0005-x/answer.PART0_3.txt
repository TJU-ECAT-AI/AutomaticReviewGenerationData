[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components"

[4] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single components"

[5] "Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[6] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. The ensemble effect, where certain reactions require specific groupings of active sites.

2. The ligand effect, arising from electronic interactions between alloy components. 

3. Modifications of interatomic distances due to lattice mismatch, which can significantly alter catalytic activity.

4. Some bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the individual components, while others like PdCu behave as a new metal with intermediate properties.

5. Depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive one with a larger lattice constant can enhance reactivity beyond either pure metal.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalysts:

1. Carefully select metal combinations based on reactivity and lattice constants to achieve desired synergistic effects.

2. Create surface alloys or supported clusters to tune the balance of geometric and electronic effects.

3. Use bifunctional catalysts where different components activate different reactants.

4. Develop core-shell nanoparticles to combine bulk and surface properties.

5. Apply strain engineering to modify interatomic distances and electronic structure.

6. Use computational screening to predict promising bimetallic combinations before experimental testing.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems, enabling more efficient and tunable catalytic processes.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 集合效应，即某些反应需要特定的活性位点组合。

2. 配体效应，源于合金组分之间的电子相互作用。

3. 由于晶格失配导致的原子间距离的改变，这可能显著改变催化活性。

4. 一些双金属系统如PtRu表现出超出单个组分的性能，而其他如PdCu则表现为具有中间性质的新金属。

5. 将更具反应性的金属沉积在具有更大晶格常数的较不活泼金属上，可以将反应性提高到超出任一纯金属的水平。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化剂：

1. 根据反应性和晶格常数仔细选择金属组合，以实现所需的协同效应。

2. 创建表面合金或支持的簇，以调节几何效应和电子效应的平衡。

3. 使用双功能催化剂，其中不同的组分激活不同的反应物。

4. 开发核-壳纳米粒子，结合体相和表面性质。

5. 应用应变工程来修改原子间距离和电子结构。

6. 在实验测试之前使用计算筛选来预测有前景的双金属组合。

这些策略可以带来比传统单金属系统具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂，从而实现更高效和可调的催化过程。
