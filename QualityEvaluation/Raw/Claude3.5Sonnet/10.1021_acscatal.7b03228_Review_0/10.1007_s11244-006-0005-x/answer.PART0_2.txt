[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experimentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."

[4] "Experimentally, it was demonstrated for CO and oxygen adsorbed on Ru(0001) that the expansion of the substrate lattice leads to a preferential adsorption while compression causes a depletion of the adsorbate layer"

[5] "The deviations for many systems between the overlayer and the one-layer slab calculations indicate that pure strain effects are not sufficient in order to explain in general the modified reactivity of pseudomorphic overlayers."

[6] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[7] "Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[8] "Hence both PtMo and PtSn can act as real bifunctional catalysts, with one element binding preferentially the first reactant, and the other element the second reactant."

[9] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts. They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."

[10] "The NiAu catalyst is slightly less reactive but much more robust and stable due to its higher resistance to graphite formation. Fundamental theoretical results together with experimental studies have thus led to the design of a new catalyst that has been patented"

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Ensemble and ligand effects: The arrangement of different metal atoms on the surface (ensemble effect) and their electronic interactions (ligand effect) both contribute to catalytic activity.

2. Strain effects: Lattice mismatch between components causes strain, which can significantly modify reactivity by altering interatomic distances and electronic structure.

3. Electronic coupling: Direct electronic interactions between components can enhance or suppress reactivity beyond what would be expected from strain alone.

4. Bifunctional catalysis: Some bimetallic systems (e.g. PtMo, PtSn) can act as bifunctional catalysts, with different components preferentially binding different reactants.

5. Formation of novel alloys: In some cases (e.g. CuPd), strong interactions between components lead to the formation of a homogeneous alloy with intermediate properties.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tailoring surface composition and structure to optimize ensemble and ligand effects for specific reactions.

2. Engineering strain through careful selection of components with appropriate lattice mismatches.

3. Designing bifunctional catalysts by pairing metals with complementary binding preferences.

4. Developing alloys with novel electronic properties intermediate between pure components.

5. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental studies to rationally design catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, as demonstrated by the NiAu catalyst for steam reforming.

These approaches allow for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with tunable properties that can outperform traditional monometallic catalysts in efficiency, selectivity, and stability for targeted reactions.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 集合效应和配体效应：表面上不同金属原子的排列（集合效应）和它们之间的电子相互作用（配体效应）都对催化活性有贡献。

2. 应变效应：组分之间的晶格失配导致应变，通过改变原子间距和电子结构，可以显著改变反应活性。

3. 电子耦合：组分之间的直接电子相互作用可以增强或抑制反应活性，超出单纯应变效应的预期。

4. 双功能催化：某些双金属系统（如PtMo、PtSn）可以作为双功能催化剂，不同组分优先结合不同的反应物。

5. 新型合金的形成：在某些情况下（如CuPd），组分之间的强相互作用导致形成具有中间性质的均匀合金。

利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括：

1. 调整表面组成和结构，以优化特定反应的集合效应和配体效应。

2. 通过谨慎选择具有适当晶格失配的组分来设计应变。

3. 通过配对具有互补结合偏好的金属来设计双功能催化剂。

4. 开发具有纯组分之间新型中间电子性质的合金。

5. 结合理论计算和实验研究，理性设计具有增强稳定性和选择性的催化剂，如已证明的用于蒸汽重整的NiAu催化剂。

这些方法允许创造具有可调性质的双金属催化剂，在效率、选择性和稳定性方面可以超越传统的单金属催化剂，以满足特定反应的需求。
