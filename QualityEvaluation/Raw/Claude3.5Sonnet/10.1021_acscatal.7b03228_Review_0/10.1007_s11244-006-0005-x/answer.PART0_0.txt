[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "Upon expansion of the substrate lattice, the width of the d-band decreases because of the reduced overlap between the atomic orbitals. If the d-band is more than half-filled, charge conservation leads to an up-shift of the d-band and to larger adsorbate binding energies."

[4] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[5] "As far as the direct interaction between Pd and Au is concerned, it leads to a further increase in the binding strength. The relative weak interaction between Pd and Au makes the Pd overlayer more reactive which is also reflected by a further upshift of the d-band compared to the expanded pure Pd(111) surface."

[6] "Either its properties are beyond those of the single components or they are in between. The list of bimetallic systems addressed by electronic structure calculations is certainly far from being exhausted. Still the available DFT studies suggest that if a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, then a bimetallic system will result that, e.g., binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component in a comparable structure."

[7] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Ensemble effects: The presence of different metal atoms affects the number and arrangement of active sites available for catalysis. 

2. Ligand effects: Electronic interactions between different metal atoms modify their electronic structure and reactivity.

3. Strain effects: Lattice mismatch between metals induces strain, altering the d-band structure and binding energies.

4. Bifunctional mechanisms: Different metals can adsorb different reactants, enabling new reaction pathways.

Strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tailoring lattice mismatch: Combining metals with specific size differences to induce beneficial strain.

2. Tuning electronic interactions: Selecting metal combinations with complementary electronic properties.

3. Controlling surface composition: Optimizing the ratio and distribution of different metals on the surface.

4. Nanostructure engineering: Creating specific geometries (e.g. core-shell structures) to maximize synergistic effects.

5. Alloying reactive and inert metals: Combining metals with contrasting properties to achieve enhanced or intermediate reactivity.

6. Utilizing DFT modeling: Employing computational screening to predict promising bimetallic combinations.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic systems, enabling more efficient and tunable catalytic processes.
