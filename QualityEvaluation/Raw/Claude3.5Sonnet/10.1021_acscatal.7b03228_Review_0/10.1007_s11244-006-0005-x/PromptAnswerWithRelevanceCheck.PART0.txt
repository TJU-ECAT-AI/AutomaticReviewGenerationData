[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "Upon expansion of the substrate lattice, the width of the d-band decreases because of the reduced overlap between the atomic orbitals. If the d-band is more than half-filled, charge conservation leads to an up-shift of the d-band and to larger adsorbate binding energies."

[4] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[5] "As far as the direct interaction between Pd and Au is concerned, it leads to a further increase in the binding strength. The relative weak interaction between Pd and Au makes the Pd overlayer more reactive which is also reflected by a further upshift of the d-band compared to the expanded pure Pd(111) surface."

[6] "Either its properties are beyond those of the single components or they are in between. The list of bimetallic systems addressed by electronic structure calculations is certainly far from being exhausted. Still the available DFT studies suggest that if a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, then a bimetallic system will result that, e.g., binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component in a comparable structure."

[7] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Ensemble effects: The presence of different metal atoms affects the number and arrangement of active sites available for catalysis. 

2. Ligand effects: Electronic interactions between different metal atoms modify their electronic structure and reactivity.

3. Strain effects: Lattice mismatch between metals induces strain, altering the d-band structure and binding energies.

4. Bifunctional mechanisms: Different metals can adsorb different reactants, enabling new reaction pathways.

Strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tailoring lattice mismatch: Combining metals with specific size differences to induce beneficial strain.

2. Tuning electronic interactions: Selecting metal combinations with complementary electronic properties.

3. Controlling surface composition: Optimizing the ratio and distribution of different metals on the surface.

4. Nanostructure engineering: Creating specific geometries (e.g. core-shell structures) to maximize synergistic effects.

5. Alloying reactive and inert metals: Combining metals with contrasting properties to achieve enhanced or intermediate reactivity.

6. Utilizing DFT modeling: Employing computational screening to predict promising bimetallic combinations.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic systems, enabling more efficient and tunable catalytic processes.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. The ensemble effect, where certain reactions require specific arrangements of active sites.

2. The ligand effect, arising from electronic interactions between alloy components that modify catalytic activity and selectivity. 

3. Geometric effects due to changes in interatomic distances, which can significantly impact catalytic activity.

These effects can produce bimetallic systems with properties beyond those of the individual components (e.g. PtRu) or create novel metals with intermediate properties (e.g. PdCu).

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Carefully engineering surface compositions and structures to tailor reactivity.

2. Designing bifunctional catalysts where different alloy components activate different reactants.

3. Using strain effects by creating pseudomorphic overlayers to tune electronic properties.

4. Developing supported nanoparticles with modified properties due to size effects and substrate interactions.

5. Combining theoretical modeling and experimental studies to rationally design new catalysts with enhanced performance.

By understanding and leveraging these synergistic geometric and electronic effects, researchers can create bimetallic catalysts with improved efficiency, selectivity, and tunability compared to traditional monometallic systems. The interplay between theory and experiment is crucial for realizing the full potential of these complex systems.

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experimentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."

[4] "Experimentally, it was demonstrated for CO and oxygen adsorbed on Ru(0001) that the expansion of the substrate lattice leads to a preferential adsorption while compression causes a depletion of the adsorbate layer"

[5] "The deviations for many systems between the overlayer and the one-layer slab calculations indicate that pure strain effects are not sufficient in order to explain in general the modified reactivity of pseudomorphic overlayers."

[6] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[7] "Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[8] "Hence both PtMo and PtSn can act as real bifunctional catalysts, with one element binding preferentially the first reactant, and the other element the second reactant."

[9] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts. They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."

[10] "The NiAu catalyst is slightly less reactive but much more robust and stable due to its higher resistance to graphite formation. Fundamental theoretical results together with experimental studies have thus led to the design of a new catalyst that has been patented"

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Ensemble and ligand effects: The arrangement of different metal atoms on the surface (ensemble effect) and their electronic interactions (ligand effect) both contribute to catalytic activity.

2. Strain effects: Lattice mismatch between components causes strain, which can significantly modify reactivity by altering interatomic distances and electronic structure.

3. Electronic coupling: Direct electronic interactions between components can enhance or suppress reactivity beyond what would be expected from strain alone.

4. Bifunctional catalysis: Some bimetallic systems (e.g. PtMo, PtSn) can act as bifunctional catalysts, with different components preferentially binding different reactants.

5. Formation of novel alloys: In some cases (e.g. CuPd), strong interactions between components lead to the formation of a homogeneous alloy with intermediate properties.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tailoring surface composition and structure to optimize ensemble and ligand effects for specific reactions.

2. Engineering strain through careful selection of components with appropriate lattice mismatches.

3. Designing bifunctional catalysts by pairing metals with complementary binding preferences.

4. Developing alloys with novel electronic properties intermediate between pure components.

5. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental studies to rationally design catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, as demonstrated by the NiAu catalyst for steam reforming.

These approaches allow for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with tunable properties that can outperform traditional monometallic catalysts in efficiency, selectivity, and stability for targeted reactions.
