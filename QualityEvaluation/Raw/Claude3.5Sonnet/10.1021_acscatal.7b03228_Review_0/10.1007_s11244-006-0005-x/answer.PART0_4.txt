[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "The modifications in the catalytic activity and selectivity caused by the electronic interactions between the components of a bimetallic system are described by the term ligand effect."

[3] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[4] "These findings are in agreement with the enhanced CO binding found on Pt/Au(111) (see figure 2). Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[5] "Because of the strong interaction between Pt and Ru, Pt atoms bind adsorbates less strongly. At the Ru sites, it is the other way around. The PtRu interaction is weaker than the RuRu interaction, therefore the Ru atom becomes more reactive due to the presence of neighboring Pt atoms."

[6] "Hence both PtMo and PtSn can act as real bifunctional catalysts, with one element binding preferentially the first reactant, and the other element the second reactant."

[7] "Fundamental theoretical results together with experimental studies have thus led to the design of a new catalyst that has been patented"

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. The ensemble effect, where certain reactions require specific groupings of active sites.

2. The ligand effect, where electronic interactions between alloy components modify catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Modifications of interatomic distances in bimetallic systems can significantly impact catalytic activity.

4. Depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive one can enhance reactivity of the overlayer.

5. Strong interactions between alloy components can lead to complex changes in reactivity, sometimes making one component more reactive and the other less so.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts:

1. Create bifunctional catalysts where different alloy components bind different reactants preferentially.

2. Tune lattice strain and electronic coupling to optimize reactivity.

3. Use theoretical modeling alongside experimental studies to rationally design new catalyst compositions.

4. Explore combinations of reactive and inert metals with mismatched lattice constants to achieve properties beyond those of single components.

5. Consider surface segregation and alloying effects in supported nanoparticle catalysts.

These strategies can lead to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by taking advantage of the unique properties that emerge from bimetallic combinations.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能:

1. 集合效应,某些反应需要特定的活性位点组合。

2. 配体效应,合金组分之间的电子相互作用改变催化活性和选择性。

3. 双金属系统中原子间距离的改变可以显著影响催化活性。

4. 将更活泼的金属沉积在不太活泼的金属上可以增强覆盖层的反应活性。

5. 合金组分之间的强相互作用可导致反应活性的复杂变化,有时会使一个组分更具反应性,而另一个组分反应性降低。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂:

1. 创建双功能催化剂,不同的合金组分优先结合不同的反应物。

2. 调节晶格应变和电子耦合以优化反应活性。

3. 结合理论模型和实验研究,理性设计新的催化剂组成。

4. 探索具有不匹配晶格常数的活性和惰性金属组合,以实现超越单一组分性能的特性。

5. 考虑负载型纳米粒子催化剂中的表面偏析和合金效应。

这些策略可以利用双金属组合产生的独特性质,开发出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统。
