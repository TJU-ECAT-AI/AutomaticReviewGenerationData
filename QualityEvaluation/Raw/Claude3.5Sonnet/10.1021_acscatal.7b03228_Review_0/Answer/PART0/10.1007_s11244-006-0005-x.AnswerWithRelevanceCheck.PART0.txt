          [1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "Upon expansion of the substrate lattice, the width of the d-band decreases because of the reduced overlap between the atomic orbitals. If the d-band is more than half-filled, charge conservation leads to an up-shift of the d-band and to larger adsorbate binding energies."

[4] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[5] "As far as the direct interaction between Pd and Au is concerned, it leads to a further increase in the binding strength. The relative weak interaction between Pd and Au makes the Pd overlayer more reactive which is also reflected by a further upshift of the d-band compared to the expanded pure Pd(111) surface."

[6] "Either its properties are beyond those of the single components or they are in between. The list of bimetallic systems addressed by electronic structure calculations is certainly far from being exhausted. Still the available DFT studies suggest that if a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, then a bimetallic system will result that, e.g., binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component in a comparable structure."

[7] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

[8] "The modifications in the catalytic activity and selectivity caused by the electronic interactions between the components of a bimetallic system are described by the term ligand effect."

[9] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experimentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."

[10] "Experimentally, it was demonstrated for CO and oxygen adsorbed on Ru(0001) that the expansion of the substrate lattice leads to a preferential adsorption while compression causes a depletion of the adsorbate layer"

[11] "Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[12] "Hence both PtMo and PtSn can act as real bifunctional catalysts, with one element binding preferentially the first reactant, and the other element the second reactant."

[13] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts. They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."

[14] "The NiAu catalyst is slightly less reactive but much more robust and stable due to its higher resistance to graphite formation. Fundamental theoretical results together with experimental studies have thus led to the design of a new catalyst that has been patented"

          Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Ensemble effect: Specific arrangements of active sites are required for certain reactions.

2. Ligand effect: Electronic interactions between alloy components modify catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Strain effect: Lattice mismatch induces strain, altering the d-band structure and binding energies.

4. Electronic coupling: Direct interactions between components can enhance or suppress reactivity.

5. Bifunctional catalysis: Different components can preferentially bind different reactants.

6. Formation of novel alloys: Strong interactions can lead to homogeneous alloys with intermediate properties.

Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include:

1. Tailoring surface composition and structure to optimize ensemble and ligand effects.

2. Engineering strain through careful selection of components with appropriate lattice mismatches.

3. Designing bifunctional catalysts by pairing metals with complementary binding preferences.

4. Developing alloys with novel electronic properties.

5. Creating core-shell nanoparticles to combine bulk and surface properties.

6. Applying strain engineering to modify interatomic distances and electronic structure.

7. Using computational screening to predict promising bimetallic combinations.

8. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental studies for rational catalyst design.

These approaches allow for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with tunable properties that can outperform traditional monometallic catalysts in efficiency, selectivity, and stability for targeted reactions. The interplay between theory and experiment is crucial for realizing the full potential of these complex systems.
