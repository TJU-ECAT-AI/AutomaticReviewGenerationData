          [1] "The d-band theory of Hammer and Nrskov [6,7] provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the evaluation of adsorbate properties from clean surface properties. In the simplest version of that theory, binding energies and transition state energies can be estimated from a single clean-surface parameter, the surface d-band center [811]."

[2] "Several physical factors affect these d-band centers, including strain, ligand, and ensemble effects [1217]. By carefully accounting for each of these effects, it is in principle possible to estimate the d-band center of a clean alloy surface and, thence, to determine the properties of adsorbates on that surface."

[3] "Given the importance of parameters such as binding energies in determining trends in catalytic activities, it is imperative to have efficient means of estimating the magnitude of these parameters for a variety of metals and alloys."

[4] "A simple scheme for the estimation of oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys is presented. It is shown that a d-band center model of the alloy surfaces is a convenient and appropriate basis for this scheme; variations in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects are all incorporated into the binding energy analysis through this parameter."

          Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through their impact on the d-band center of the alloy surface. This parameter incorporates strain, ligand, and ensemble effects, which collectively determine adsorbate binding energies and transition state energies. These factors combine to determine key parameters like binding energies, which strongly correlate with catalytic activity trends.

To exploit this interplay in designing better catalysts, several innovative strategies can be developed:

1. Use the d-band center as a descriptor to rapidly screen many alloy compositions.
2. Develop simple models that capture the combined effects of composition, strain, and ligand interactions on the d-band center.
3. Apply computational screening to explore a wide range of binary and more complex alloys.
4. Design alloys with optimized d-band centers for specific reactions.
5. Create catalysts with tunable electronic properties by controlling surface composition and structure.
6. Exploit strain engineering to fine-tune catalytic properties.
7. Develop "smart" alloys that can dynamically modify their surface during reactions.
8. Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify optimal combinations of geometric and electronic effects for specific catalytic reactions.
9. Design core-shell nanoparticles with tailored strain and ligand effects to achieve desired catalytic properties.
10. Combine experimental and theoretical approaches to validate and refine models linking geometric and electronic effects to catalytic performance.

These strategies leverage the synergistic geometric and electronic effects in alloys to potentially create catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and tunability compared to monometallic systems. The ability to rapidly estimate key parameters like binding energies for many alloys enables efficient computational screening and rational catalyst design.

          过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过影响合金表面的d带中心来协同影响催化性能。这个参数包含了应变、配体和集成效应，这些效应共同决定了吸附质的结合能和过渡态能量。这些因素结合起来决定了关键参数，如结合能，而这些参数与催化活性趋势高度相关。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更好的催化剂，可以开发几种创新策略：

1. 使用d带中心作为描述符，快速筛选多种合金成分。
2. 开发简单模型，捕捉成分、应变和配体相互作用对d带中心的综合影响。
3. 应用计算筛选来探索广泛的二元和更复杂的合金。
4. 设计具有针对特定反应优化的d带中心的合金。
5. 通过控制表面成分和结构，创造具有可调电子性质的催化剂。
6. 利用应变工程来微调催化性质。
7. 开发可以在反应过程中动态修改其表面的"智能"合金。
8. 利用机器学习算法为特定催化反应确定几何和电子效应的最佳组合。
9. 设计具有定制应变和配体效应的核-壳纳米粒子，以实现所需的催化性能。
10. 结合实验和理论方法来验证和完善连接几何和电子效应与催化性能的模型。

这些策略利用合金中协同的几何和电子效应，有潜力创造出比单金属系统具有更高活性、选择性和可调性的催化剂。能够快速估算多种合金的关键参数（如结合能）的能力，使得高效的计算筛选和理性催化剂设计成为可能。
