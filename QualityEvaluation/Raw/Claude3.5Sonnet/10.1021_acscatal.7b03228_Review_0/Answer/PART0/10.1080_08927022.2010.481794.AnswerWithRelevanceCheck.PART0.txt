          [1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."

[3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces, it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."

[4] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment"

[5] "Here, the ligand effect is incorporated into the matrix element in the numerator through the rd of each metal, whereas the strain is included in the denominator through the distance between atoms."

          Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through several mechanisms:

1. Surface properties: The reactivity of transition metals is determined by their surface properties, which affect the ability to form and break bonds with adsorbates.

2. d-band model: Variations in catalytic activity are largely explained by differences in the coupling between metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is sensitive to the d-band center.

3. Strain effects: Changes in interatomic distances due to lattice mismatch or surface reconstruction alter the overlap of electronic orbitals, affecting the d-band width and center.

4. Ligand effects: The presence of different metal atoms in an alloy modifies the local electronic environment, changing the characteristic orbital sizes and interactions.

5. Ensemble effects: The specific arrangement of different metal atoms on the surface creates unique adsorption sites.

To exploit this interplay in designing more efficient catalytic systems:

1. Use computational modeling to rapidly screen alloy combinations, optimizing both composition and structure.

2. Design core-shell nanoparticles with tuned strain and ligand effects.

3. Create surface alloys with controlled distributions of atoms to fine-tune local electronic environments.

4. Utilize high-entropy alloys to access complex electronic structures.

5. Develop adaptive catalysts that can dynamically modify their geometric and electronic structure under reaction conditions.

6. Employ machine learning-aided design to rapidly screen and predict alloy compositions with optimal geometric and electronic properties for specific reactions.

7. Explore metastable alloy phases to access unique electronic structures not available in thermodynamically stable alloys.

These strategies can lead to catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to traditional monometallic systems by precisely tuning the synergistic interactions between geometric and electronic effects.

          过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过以下几种机制协同影响催化性能：

1. 表面性质：过渡金属的反应性由其表面性质决定，这些性质影响与吸附物形成和断裂键的能力。

2. d带模型：催化活性的变化主要由金属d态与吸附物轨道之间耦合的差异来解释，这种耦合对d带中心很敏感。

3. 应变效应：由于晶格失配或表面重构导致的原子间距离变化会改变电子轨道的重叠，从而影响d带宽度和中心位置。

4. 配体效应：合金中不同金属原子的存在会改变局部电子环境，改变特征轨道大小和相互作用。

5. 集合效应：表面上不同金属原子的特定排列创造了独特的吸附位点。

为了利用这种相互作用设计更高效的催化系统，可以采取以下策略：

1. 使用计算模型快速筛选合金组合，同时优化成分和结构。

2. 设计具有调谐应变和配体效应的核壳纳米粒子。

3. 创建具有受控原子分布的表面合金，以精细调节局部电子环境。

4. 利用高熵合金获得复杂的电子结构。

5. 开发可以在反应条件下动态修改其几何和电子结构的自适应催化剂。

6. 采用机器学习辅助设计，快速筛选和预测具有最佳几何和电子性质的合金组成，以用于特定反应。

7. 探索亚稳态合金相，获得热力学稳定合金中无法获得的独特电子结构。

通过战略性地结合这些方法，可以设计出在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于传统单金属催化剂的催化系统，精确调节几何和电子效应之间的协同作用。
