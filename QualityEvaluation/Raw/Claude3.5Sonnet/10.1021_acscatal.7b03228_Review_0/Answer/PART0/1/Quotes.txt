[1] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."

[2] "Therefore, alloying can result in both electronic effects (degree of charge transfer and hybridization) and geometric effects due to the creation of specific reaction ensembles."

[3] "At the same time, the orbital extent or the size of the valence orbitals of the alloying elements is different, resulting in changes in the overlap between the bonding orbitals."

[4] "The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydrogenation does not."

[5] "Improved selectivity and stability were the main benefits that PdZn catalysts exhibited for these various reactions. These improvements were credited to both geometric changes caused by zinc altering the catalyst surface by expanding the palladium bond distance and electronic effects observed by the weakening of the PdCO bond [12,18]."

[1] "However, it was also recognized from the beginning that perturbation of reactivity through alloying involved both geometric effects involving creation of specific reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and electronic effects due to changes in electron density and bonding due to charge transfer and hybridization effects in alloying."

[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."

[3] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[4] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[5] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed."

[6] "PtSn is the primary example of an intermetallic system (multiple intermetallic compounds of PtSn exist with varying stoichiometry) that has found extensive use in the field. For example, PtSn alloys have found use commercially in hydrocarbon re-forming and propane dehydrogenation, while academics have demonstrated their success in selective hydrogenation and CO-tolerant fuel cell electrodes."

[1] "The activity of bimetallic catalysts is often discussed using the concept of the ensemble versus the ligand effect"

[2] "In addition to the pure electronic or ligand effect, the modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity"

[3] "Upon expansion of the substrate lattice, the width of the d-band decreases because of the reduced overlap between the atomic orbitals. If the d-band is more than half-filled, charge conservation leads to an up-shift of the d-band and to larger adsorbate binding energies."

[4] "These results show that both the electronic interaction and the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can contribute significantly to the modified reactivity of bimetallic overlayer system"

[5] "As far as the direct interaction between Pd and Au is concerned, it leads to a further increase in the binding strength. The relative weak interaction between Pd and Au makes the Pd overlayer more reactive which is also reflected by a further upshift of the d-band compared to the expanded pure Pd(111) surface."

[6] "Either its properties are beyond those of the single components or they are in between. The list of bimetallic systems addressed by electronic structure calculations is certainly far from being exhausted. Still the available DFT studies suggest that if a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, then a bimetallic system will result that, e.g., binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component in a comparable structure."

[7] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

[8] "The modifications in the catalytic activity and selectivity caused by the electronic interactions between the components of a bimetallic system are described by the term ligand effect."

[9] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experimentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."

[10] "Experimentally, it was demonstrated for CO and oxygen adsorbed on Ru(0001) that the expansion of the substrate lattice leads to a preferential adsorption while compression causes a depletion of the adsorbate layer"

[11] "Thus depositing a more reactive metal on a less reactive metal makes the overlayer even more reactive."

[12] "Hence both PtMo and PtSn can act as real bifunctional catalysts, with one element binding preferentially the first reactant, and the other element the second reactant."

[13] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts. They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."

[14] "The NiAu catalyst is slightly less reactive but much more robust and stable due to its higher resistance to graphite formation. Fundamental theoretical results together with experimental studies have thus led to the design of a new catalyst that has been patented"

[1] "The intermetallic compound PdZn plays an important role as catalyst in the steam reforming of methanol"

[2] "The formation of the intermetallic compound was detected in situ when applying Pd/ZnO as a catalyst, accompanied with a huge increase in selectivity."

[3] "Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach reveals charge transfer from zinc to palladium and proves direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane to be the main reason for the tetragonal distortion of the cubic CsCl-type structural pattern for ZnPd."

[4] "Investigating chemical bonding by means of the electron-localization approach has proven to be an efficient tool in exploring chemical stability and catalytic properties of intermetallic compounds"

[5] "The density of states of ZnPd and other compounds realizing the CuAu- or CsCl-type of structures was used to draw conclusions about their catalytic properties in the steam reforming of methanol"

[6] "Integration of the electron density obtained by the FPLO calculation yields Zn0.4+Pd0.4 and reveals the important role of the charge transfer in the formation of the cubic and tetragonally distorted body-centered-like structural patterns in the system Zn/Pd."

[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds"

[2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."

[3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces, it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."

[4] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment"

[5] "Here, the ligand effect is incorporated into the matrix element in the numerator through the rd of each metal, whereas the strain is included in the denominator through the distance between atoms."

[1] "Although progress in the use of alloys to elucidate the electronic factor in metal catalysis has been slow, interest in bimetallic systems has not declined. In fact, there has been a great revival of interest in the field in recent years, for reasons other than a renewed probing into the electronic factor alone. These include (a) the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis, i.e., markedly different behavior toward different types of reactions, and (b) the development of the idea of highly dispersed bimetallic systems, i.e., bimetallic cluster catalysts."

[2] "While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel, it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis. Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by Sachtler."

[3] "If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites."

[4] "In general, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal has been observed to decrease hydrogenolysis activity markedly but to have a much smaller effect on such other reactions as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and isomerization of hydrocarbons. Selectivity is clearly an important aspect of hydrocarbon catalysis by alloys."

[5] "Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect. The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts."

[6] "While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity."

[7] "If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface."

[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."

[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 Ã 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 Ã 2) alloy, compared with that on the â3 alloy."

[3] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."

[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111)"

[1] "The d-band theory of Hammer and Nrskov [6,7] provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the evaluation of adsorbate properties from clean surface properties. In the simplest version of that theory, binding energies and transition state energies can be estimated from a single clean-surface parameter, the surface d-band center [811]."

[2] "Several physical factors affect these d-band centers, including strain, ligand, and ensemble effects [1217]. By carefully accounting for each of these effects, it is in principle possible to estimate the d-band center of a clean alloy surface and, thence, to determine the properties of adsorbates on that surface."

[3] "Given the importance of parameters such as binding energies in determining trends in catalytic activities, it is imperative to have efficient means of estimating the magnitude of these parameters for a variety of metals and alloys."

[4] "A simple scheme for the estimation of oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys is presented. It is shown that a d-band center model of the alloy surfaces is a convenient and appropriate basis for this scheme; variations in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects are all incorporated into the binding energy analysis through this parameter."

[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."

[2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."

[3] "For example, it has been shown recently that the catalytic activity of Pt can be changed significantly by combining Pt with 3d metals to form 3d-M/Pt skin alloys."

[4] "When used as electrodes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the 3d-M/Pt alloys exhibit higher tolerance to CO and lower over-potential losses associated with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt."

[5] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles."

[2] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character."

[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

[4] "Electronic and geometric effects are generally observed for both alloys and intermetallic compounds. This means that the orderedness of intermetallic phases is not essential to these effects."

[5] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen."

[6] "Thus, in general, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."

[7] "The formation of intermetallic or alloy phases is generally accompanied not only by ensemble effects but also by ligand effects. This is because the incorporation of the second metal, whose character differs significantly from the parent metal, typically induces a drastic change in the electronic structure and hence in the adsorption strength and reaction profiles as well."

"Both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."

"From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles."

"A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."

"DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."

"Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

"The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[1] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals.

[4] "When used as electrodes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the 3d-M/Pt alloys exhibit higher tolerance to CO and lower over-potential losses associated with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt."

[5] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles."

[2] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character."

[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

[4] "Electronic and geometric effects are generally observed for both alloys and intermetallic compounds. This means that the orderedness of intermetallic phases is not essential to these effects."

[5] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen."

[6] "Thus, in general, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."

[7] "The formation of intermetallic or alloy phases is generally accompanied not only by ensemble effects but also by ligand effects. This is because the incorporation of the second metal, whose character differs significantly from the parent metal, typically induces a drastic change in the electronic structure and hence in the adsorption strength and reaction profiles as well."

"Both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."

"From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles."

"A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."

"DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface."

"Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

"The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."
