{"Quotes": "\"Both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum.\"\n\n\"From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles.\"\n\n\"A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal.\"\n\n\"DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface.\"\n\n\"Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support.\"\n\n\"The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal.\"", "English": "Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways:\n\n1. Geometric effects: \n   - The addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn to Pt) reduces the size of platinum nanoparticles and ensembles.\n   - This suppresses unwanted side reactions like isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coke formation.\n   - It also minimizes metal sintering, improving catalyst stability.\n\n2. Electronic effects:\n   - Electron transfer from the alloying metal (e.g., Sn) to Pt modifies its electronic structure.\n   - This alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal.\n   - It can weaken the binding of hydrocarbons and reduce the heat of adsorption of hydrogen.\n\n3. Synergistic interplay:\n   - The combination of geometric and electronic effects leads to improved catalytic properties.\n   - It facilitates the migration of coke precursors from the metal to the support.\n   - It enhances hydrogen atom diffusion on the catalyst surface.\n   - The alloy can neutralize support acidity, further influencing catalyst behavior.\n\nTo exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems:\n\n1.
