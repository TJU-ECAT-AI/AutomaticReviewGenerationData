[1] "One of the early themes of the Sinfelt work was the invocation of reaction ensembles to explain differences in hydrogenolysis behavior between monometallic and bimetallic systems. (1) However, it was also recognized from the beginning that perturbation of reactivity through alloying involved both geometric effects involving creation of specific reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and electronic effects due to changes in electron density and bonding due to charge transfer and hybridization effects in alloying."

[2] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[4] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed. Furthermore, these systems have an enthalpic driving force (often driven by charge transfer) to remain in their prescribed positions, which prevents (or at least retards) surface segregation in response to adsorption events (which often plague homogeneous alloys)."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering both the reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and the electron density and bonding characteristics of the catalyst surface. This interplay allows for the creation of specific reaction sites and modifications to adsorbate binding strengths, which can lead to improved catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts.

However, relying solely on electronic effects has limitations, as it often affects the binding strengths of all reactants and products similarly. To overcome these limitations and exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects, three innovative strategies have emerged:

1. Intermetallic compounds: These offer precise control over the spatial arrangement of metal atoms, creating fixed reaction ensembles and preventing surface segregation. This allows for better tuning of adsorbate configurations and binding strengths.

2. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): This approach involves dispersing individual atoms of one metal within a host metal, creating unique active sites with distinct geometric and electronic properties.

3. Coadsorbed structural modifiers: This strategy involves introducing additional species that can alter the local geometry of the catalyst surface, influencing adsorbate binding and reactivity.

By employing these strategies, researchers can design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that break free from the limitations of traditional monometallic catalysts. These approaches allow for greater control over both the geometric arrangement of active sites and the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, enabling the development of catalysts with optimized performance for specific reactions.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应协同影响催化性能，通过改变反应集合（原子位点）以及催化剂表面的电子密度和键合特性。这种相互作用允许创建特定的反应位点并修改吸附物的结合强度，从而可能导致比单金属催化剂更高的催化活性和选择性。

然而，仅仅依赖电子效应存在局限性，因为它通常会同时影响所有反应物和产物的结合强度。为了克服这些限制并利用几何效应和电子效应之间的相互作用，出现了三种创新策略：

1. 金属间化合物：这种方法可以精确控制金属原子的空间排列，创建固定的反应集合并防止表面偏析。这允许更好地调节吸附物构型和结合强度。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）：这种方法涉及将一种金属的单个原子分散在宿主金属中，创建具有独特几何和电子性质的活性位点。

3. 共吸附结构修饰剂：这种策略涉及引入额外的物种，可以改变催化剂表面的局部几何结构，从而影响吸附物的结合和反应性。

通过采用这些策略，研究人员可以设计出更高效、更具选择性和可调性的催化系统，摆脱传统单金属催化剂的限制。这些方法允许更好地控制活性位点的几何排列和催化剂表面的电子性质，从而能够开发出针对特定反应优化性能的催化剂。
