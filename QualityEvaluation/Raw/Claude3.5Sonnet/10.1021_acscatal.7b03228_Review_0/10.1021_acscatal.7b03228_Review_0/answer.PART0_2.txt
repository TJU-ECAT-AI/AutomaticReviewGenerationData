[1] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."

[2] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[4] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed."

[5] "PtSn is the primary example of an intermetallic system (multiple intermetallic compounds of PtSn exist with varying stoichiometry) that has found extensive use in the field. For example, PtSn alloys have found use commercially in hydrocarbon re-forming and propane dehydrogenation, while academics have demonstrated their success in selective hydrogenation and CO-tolerant fuel cell electrodes."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering both the strength of adsorbate interactions and the bonding configurations on the catalyst surface. Electronic effects primarily affect the strength of adsorbate binding, while geometric effects change the spatial arrangement and bonding configuration of adsorbates.

To exploit this interplay and design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, several innovative strategies have emerged:

1. Intermetallic compounds: These materials offer precise control over the spatial arrangement of metal atoms, allowing for tailored adsorbate configurations. Unlike homogeneous alloys, intermetallics maintain their structure due to enthalpic driving forces, preventing surface segregation.

2. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): This approach involves dispersing individual atoms of one metal within a matrix of another, potentially offering unique catalytic properties.

3. Coadsorbed structural modifiers: This strategy involves introducing additional species that can alter the surface geometry and affect adsorbate bonding.

PtSn intermetallic compounds serve as a prime example of how these strategies can be applied successfully. PtSn alloys have found commercial use in hydrocarbon reforming and propane dehydrogenation, as well as academic applications in selective hydrogenation and CO-tolerant fuel cell electrodes. By controlling the Pt:Sn ratio, researchers can tune the ensemble size and adsorbate geometry, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to traditional monometallic catalysts.

These approaches allow for breaking away from the limitations of traditional scaling relationships in catalysis, offering new avenues for designing catalysts with enhanced selectivity and efficiency. By carefully manipulating both electronic and geometric effects, researchers can create catalytic systems that outperform their monometallic counterparts in various applications.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过改变吸附质与催化剂表面的相互作用强度以及键合构型，协同影响催化性能。电子效应主要影响吸附质结合的强度，而几何效应改变吸附质在催化剂表面的空间排列和键合构型。

为了利用这种相互作用并设计出更高效、更有选择性和可调节的催化系统，已经出现了几种创新策略：

1. 金属间化合物：这些材料可以精确控制金属原子的空间排列，从而实现定制的吸附质构型。与均质合金不同，金属间化合物由于焓驱动力而保持其结构，防止表面偏析。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）：这种方法涉及将一种金属的单个原子分散在另一种金属的基质中，可能提供独特的催化性能。

3. 共吸附结构修饰剂：这种策略涉及引入额外的物种，可以改变表面几何结构并影响吸附质键合。

PtSn金属间化合物是成功应用这些策略的一个典型例子。PtSn合金已在碳氢化合物重整和丙烷脱氢等商业领域得到应用，在学术界也被证明在选择性加氢和CO耐受燃料电池电极方面取得了成功。通过控制Pt:Sn比例，研究人员可以调节集合体大小和吸附质几何构型，从而实现比传统单金属催化剂更优越的催化性能。

这些方法允许突破传统催化中的标度关系限制，为设计具有增强选择性和效率的催化剂提供了新途径。通过仔细操纵电子效应和几何效应，研究人员可以创造出在各种应用中优于单金属催化剂的催化系统。
