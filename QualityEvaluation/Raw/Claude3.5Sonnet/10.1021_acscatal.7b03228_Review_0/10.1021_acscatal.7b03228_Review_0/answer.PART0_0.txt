[1] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."

[2] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[4] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed."

[5] "PtSn is the primary example of an intermetallic system (multiple intermetallic compounds of PtSn exist with varying stoichiometry) that has found extensive use in the field. For example, PtSn alloys have found use commercially in hydrocarbon re-forming (15) and propane dehydrogenation, (16) while academics have demonstrated their success in selective hydrogenation (17) and CO-tolerant fuel cell electrodes.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by modifying both the strength of adsorbate interactions and the bonding configurations on the catalyst surface. While electronic effects can positively affect catalysis by altering binding strengths, they often affect all reactants and products similarly, limiting potential improvements. To overcome this limitation, innovative strategies focus on exploiting geometric effects to perturb bonding configurations.

Three main strategies have emerged to exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects:

1. Intermetallic compounds: These materials have fixed spatial relationships between metal atoms, allowing for precise control of adsorbate configurations. This approach can lead to more efficient and selective catalysts by tailoring specific reaction sites.

2. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Though not elaborated on in the given text, SAAs likely offer unique catalytic properties by isolating individual atoms of one metal within a matrix of another.

3. Coadsorbed structural modifiers: These can alter the surface geometry to influence adsorbate bonding.

An example of successful implementation is the PtSn intermetallic system, which has found commercial use in hydrocarbon reforming and propane dehydrogenation, as well as academic success in selective hydrogenation and CO-tolerant fuel cell electrodes. The fixed positions of metal atoms in intermetallic compounds allow for tuning of ensemble sizes, which can dramatically affect adsorption energies and configurations of reactants.

By combining these strategies, researchers can design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by taking advantage of both electronic and geometric effects in a controlled manner.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过改变吸附质相互作用的强度和催化剂表面的键合构型，协同影响催化性能。虽然电子效应可以通过改变结合强度对催化产生积极影响，但它们通常会以类似的方式影响所有反应物和产物，从而限制了潜在的改进。为了克服这一限制，创新策略着重于利用几何效应来扰动键合构型。

已经出现了三种主要策略来利用几何和电子效应之间的相互作用：

1. 金属间化合物：这些材料在金属原子之间具有固定的空间关系，允许精确控制吸附质构型。这种方法可以通过定制特定的反应位点来产生更高效和选择性的催化剂。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）：虽然在给定的文本中没有详细说明，但SAAs可能通过将一种金属的单个原子隔离在另一种金属的基质中来提供独特的催化性能。

3. 共吸附结构修饰剂：这些可以改变表面几何形状以影响吸附质键合。

成功实施的一个例子是PtSn金属间化合物系统，它在商业上用于碳氢化合物重整和丙烷脱氢，在学术上也在选择性加氢和耐CO燃料电池电极方面取得了成功。金属间化合物中金属原子的固定位置允许调整集合体大小，这可以显著影响反应物的吸附能和构型。

通过结合这些策略，研究人员可以设计出更高效、更具选择性和可调性的催化系统，通过以受控方式利用电子和几何效应，使其性能优于传统的单金属催化剂。
