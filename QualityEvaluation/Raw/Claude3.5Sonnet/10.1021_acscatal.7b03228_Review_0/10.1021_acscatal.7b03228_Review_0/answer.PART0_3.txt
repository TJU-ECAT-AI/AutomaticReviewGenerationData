[1] "However, it was also recognized from the beginning that perturbation of reactivity through alloying involved both geometric effects involving creation of specific reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and electronic effects due to changes in electron density and bonding due to charge transfer and hybridization effects in alloying."

[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."

[3] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[4] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[5] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering both the bonding configuration and the strength of adsorbate interactions with the metal surface. While electronic effects can positively affect catalysis by modifying adsorbate binding strength, they often impact all reactants and products similarly, limiting potential improvements. To overcome this limitation, innovative strategies focus on perturbing the bonding configuration of adsorbates.

Three main strategies have emerged to exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects:

1. Intermetallic compounds: These materials have fixed spatial relationships between metal atoms, allowing for precise control of adsorbate configurations.

2. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): This approach involves dispersing individual atoms of one metal within a matrix of another, creating unique catalytic sites.

3. Coadsorbed structural modifiers: This method involves introducing additional species that alter the surface structure and adsorbate geometry.

These strategies aim to create more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems by manipulating both the electronic properties and geometric arrangement of active sites. By carefully designing alloy compositions and structures, researchers can potentially break free from the limitations of traditional monometallic catalysts and access a wider range of catalytic behaviors.

过渡金属合金中的几何效应和电子效应通过改变吸附质与金属表面的键合构型和相互作用强度，协同影响催化性能。虽然电子效应可以通过修改吸附质结合强度来积极影响催化作用，但它们通常对所有反应物和产物产生类似的影响，限制了潜在的改进。为了克服这一限制，创新策略集中于扰动吸附质的键合构型。

已经出现了三种主要策略来利用几何效应和电子效应之间的相互作用：

1. 金属间化合物：这些材料在金属原子之间具有固定的空间关系，允许精确控制吸附质构型。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）：这种方法涉及将一种金属的单个原子分散在另一种金属的基质中，创造独特的催化位点。

3. 共吸附结构修饰剂：这种方法涉及引入额外的物种来改变表面结构和吸附质几何构型。

这些策略旨在通过操纵活性位点的电子性质和几何排列，创造更高效、更具选择性和可调节的催化系统。通过仔细设计合金成分和结构，研究人员有可能突破传统单金属催化剂的局限性，获得更广泛的催化行为范围。
