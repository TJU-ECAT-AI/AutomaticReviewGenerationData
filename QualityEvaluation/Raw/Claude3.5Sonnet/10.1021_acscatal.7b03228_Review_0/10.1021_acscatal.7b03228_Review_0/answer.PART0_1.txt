[1] "However, it was also recognized from the beginning that perturbation of reactivity through alloying involved both geometric effects involving creation of specific reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and electronic effects due to changes in electron density and bonding due to charge transfer and hybridization effects in alloying."

[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."

[3] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[4] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding). At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[5] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration. Unlike homogeneous alloys (fully miscible solid solutions, often called random alloys), the metals are located in distinct positions within a unit cell such that the spatial relationship between the metal atoms is fixed."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance through the creation of specific reaction ensembles and changes in electron density and bonding. While electronic effects primarily affect the strength of adsorbate interactions with the metal surface, geometric effects determine the bonding configuration.

However, relying solely on electronic modifications can be limiting, as it often affects the binding strengths of all reactants and products similarly. To overcome this limitation and achieve more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, strategies that focus on changing the adsorbate's bonding configuration have emerged.

Three innovative strategies to exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects are:

1. Intermetallic compounds: These compounds offer fixed spatial relationships between metal atoms, allowing for precise control of adsorbate configurations.

2. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): This approach involves dispersing individual atoms of one metal within a host metal, potentially offering unique catalytic properties.

3. Coadsorbed structural modifiers: This strategy involves introducing additional species that can modify the surface structure and influence adsorbate bonding.

By employing these strategies, researchers can design catalytic systems that break away from traditional scaling relationships and potentially outperform monometallic catalysts. The ability to independently tune geometric and electronic effects allows for greater control over reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in catalytic processes.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过创建特定的反应集合以及改变电子密度和键合来协同影响催化性能。虽然电子效应主要影响吸附质与金属表面相互作用的强度，但几何效应决定了键合构型。

然而，仅依靠电子改性可能会受到限制，因为它通常会以类似的方式影响所有反应物和产物的结合强度。为了克服这一限制并实现更高效、选择性和可调节的催化系统，已经出现了一些专注于改变吸附质键合构型的策略。

三种利用几何和电子效应相互作用的创新策略是：

1. 金属间化合物：这些化合物提供了金属原子之间固定的空间关系，允许精确控制吸附质构型。

2. 单原子合金（SAAs）：这种方法涉及将一种金属的单个原子分散在主体金属中，可能提供独特的催化性质。

3. 共吸附结构改性剂：这种策略涉及引入额外的物种，可以改变表面结构并影响吸附质键合。

通过采用这些策略，研究人员可以设计突破传统定标关系的催化系统，并可能超越单金属催化剂的性能。能够独立调节几何和电子效应允许对反应途径进行更大程度的控制，可能导致催化过程中选择性和效率的提高。
