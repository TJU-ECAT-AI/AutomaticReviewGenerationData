The given literature does not provide detailed information to answer the question about geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys and their influence on catalytic performance. While the document mentions bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts, it does not discuss the specific synergistic effects or innovative strategies for exploiting these interactions. To properly address this question, more specialized research on the electronic and geometric properties of multi-metallic catalysts would be needed.
