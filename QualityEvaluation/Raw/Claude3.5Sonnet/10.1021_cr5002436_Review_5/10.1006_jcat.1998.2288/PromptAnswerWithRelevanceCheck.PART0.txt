<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of C1 and C2 hydrocarbon species on platinum clusters, particularly for ethane hydrogenolysis. It does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps.

To properly answer this question, additional information from other sources would be required to explain the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its four main steps, the debate about the rate-limiting step, and why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

给定的科学文献中不包含有关催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息。该文档主要关注铂簇上C1和C2烃类物种的密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，特别是乙烷氢解反应。它没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。

要正确回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息，以解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其四个主要步骤、关于速率限制步骤的争论，以及为什么它仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the adsorption of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons on platinum clusters, rather than the specific mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step based on this text.

给定的文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注C1和C2烃类在铂簇上吸附的密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，而不是脱氢反应的具体机理。因此，我无法根据这篇文本详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理或讨论关于其速率限制步骤的持续争论。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not explicitly discussed in the given literature, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First hydrogen abstraction: One hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed molecule, forming an adsorbed alkyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen abstraction: Another hydrogen atom is removed, forming the dehydrogenated product still adsorbed on the surface.

4. Desorption: The product molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, with some researchers arguing it's the first hydrogen abstraction, while others believe it's the second. This mechanism remains controversial despite nearly a century of study due to the complexity of surface reactions and the difficulty in directly observing intermediates under reaction conditions. Advances in surface science techniques and computational methods continue to provide new insights, leading to refinements and challenges to the original mechanism. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism's enduring scientific interest stems from its fundamental importance in understanding heterogeneous catalysis and its wide applicability to various catalytic processes beyond dehydrogenation.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理虽然在给定的文献中没有明确讨论，但它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：反应分子吸附到催化剂表面。

2. 第一次氢原子提取：从吸附分子中移除一个氢原子，形成吸附的烷基中间体。

3. 第二次氢原子提取：再移除一个氢原子，形成仍吸附在表面的脱氢产物。

4. 脱附：产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，仍存在争议，一些研究人员认为是第一次氢原子提取，而其他人则认为是第二次。尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，该机理仍然存在争议，这是由于表面反应的复杂性以及在反应条件下直接观察中间体的困难。表面科学技术和计算方法的进步不断提供新的见解，导致对原始机理的改进和挑战。Horiuti-Polanyi机理持续引起科学兴趣，源于其在理解多相催化方面的基础重要性，以及其在脱氢反应之外的各种催化过程中的广泛适用性。
