The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of C1 and C2 hydrocarbon species adsorption on platinum clusters, rather than discussing specific reaction mechanisms. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its debate regarding the rate-limiting step are not mentioned. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or discuss the ongoing scientific interest and controversy surrounding it based on the information given in this document.

给定的文献中没有描述催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注C1和C2烃类物种在铂簇上吸附的密度泛函理论(DFT)计算,而不是讨论特定的反应机理。文中没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理及其关于速率限制步骤的争论。因此,我无法根据本文档中提供的信息详细解释这一机理,也无法讨论围绕它的持续科学兴趣和争议。
