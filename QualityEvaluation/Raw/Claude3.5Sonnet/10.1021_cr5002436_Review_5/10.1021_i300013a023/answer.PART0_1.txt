The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document appears to focus on the pyrolysis of hydrogenated gas oils and does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or analyze the debate regarding its rate-limiting step based on the given text. The literature does not address why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

给定的文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制。该文档似乎主要关注氢化气油的热解，不包含有关Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤的信息。因此，我无法根据给定的文本详细解释这种机制或分析关于其速率限制步骤的争论。文献也没有提到为什么这种机制仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。
