The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be explained based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about this mechanism, its steps, or the debate surrounding its rate-limiting step. The text appears to be about pyrolysis and hydrogenation of gas oils, which is unrelated to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of this topic using the given information.

根据所给的文献无法解释Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。该文档不包含任何关于这种机理、其步骤或其速率限制步骤争议的信息。文本似乎是关于气油的热解和加氢，这与Horiuti-Polanyi机理无关。因此，我无法使用所给信息对这个主题提供详细的解释或分析。
