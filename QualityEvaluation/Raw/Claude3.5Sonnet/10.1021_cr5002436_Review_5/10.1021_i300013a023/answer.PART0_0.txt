The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be focused on the pyrolysis of hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated gas oils, discussing their yields and properties. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps, nor does it discuss any debates about rate-limiting steps in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given document.

给定的科学文献中没有包含任何关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制的信息。该文档似乎主要关注氢化和非氢化气油的热解,讨论了它们的产率和性质。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其步骤,也没有讨论有关催化脱氢反应中速率限制步骤的任何争论。因此,我无法根据给定的文档回答这个问题。
