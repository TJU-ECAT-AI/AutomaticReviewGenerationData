The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed
oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,
a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity
is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed
resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2
addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative
adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in
H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge-
nation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which
remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was
formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found
between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane
than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.
Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded
that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.
The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a
higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.

1. Introduction
Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred
to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the
dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19].
Such materials are hydrothermally stable and are capable of dis-
persing small Pt particles due to the presence of Al cations at the
support surface [10]. The basic character of the support is also
desirable, since it minimizes coke formation. Several investigators
have shown, though, that in the absence of a promoter, Pt
supported on Mg(Al)O and other supports have poor alkene
selectivity and accumulate coke rapidly due to readsorption of
the alkene on the Pt surface [8,1118]. High alkene selectivity,
minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be
achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports
with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18].
Hydrotalcites were prepared with Ga cations substituting for Al,
i.e., Mg(Ga)(Al)O following the procedure described in [19]. When
Pt was dispersed on these materials and reduced at 873 K, Ga3+ cat-
ions present at the surface of the support were reduced to Ga
atoms, which then formed PtGa alloys with the dispersed Pt
nanoparticles. The presence of such alloys was confirmed by
EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM. In this study, we
report
the
performance
of
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O
catalysts
for
the
dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, and we compare the
activity, selectivity, stability, and coking characteristics of these
catalysts to Pt/Mg(Al)O, PtGa/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts were prepared according to the proce-
dure described in Ref. [19]. The performance of these catalysts was
compared with PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The preparation of the
PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalyst was identical to that described by Galvita
et al. [9]. In short, Pt was introduced into calcined Mg(Al)O by
incipient wetness impregnation of a toluene solution of Pt(acetyl-
acetonate)2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) dissolved in toluene (2.7 mL
toluene/g catalyst). Pt(acac)2 was chosen as the catalyst precursor,
since it can be dissolved in an organic solvent. This source of Pt is
preferred over an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 which is acidic and
as a result leaches Mg and Al from the support. After drying and
reduction to form metallic Pt, Sn was added using tetra-n-butyl
tin (Alfa Aesar, 94%) dissolved in decane (10 mL solvent/g support)

under flowing 10% H2/Ar atmosphere (120 cc/min) [9]. The catalyst
was then dried and reduced. PtGa catalysts were synthesized using
the same procedure outlined in Part I, but Ga addition was done
using Ga(acetylacetonate)3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) dissolved in
toluene (2.7 mL toluene/g catalyst). The catalyst was dried and re-
duced in flowing H2 at 873 K.
2.2. Catalyst testing
Reactions were carried out in a quartz reactor with an inner
diameter of 7 mm. Prior to testing, the catalyst (0.025 g, 0.25
0.5 mm particle size, diluted with quartz particles of the same par-
ticle size in a 1:4 ratio) was heated at 10 K/min to 873 K in 20% H2
in He and then maintained at this temperature for 1 h. The catalyst
bed was heated by a three-zone furnace (Applied Test System, Inc.)
controlled by Watlow 988 controllers. The temperature of the cat-
alyst bed was measured by two thermocouples centered axially in-
side the reactor, one at the top and one at the bottom of the
catalyst bed. Brooks Mass Flow Controllers (MFC) were used to de-
liver a defined flow of each gas. All experiments were performed in
the kinetic regime. Internal mass transport limitations were not
observed as evidenced by a linear Arrhenius plot and satisfaction
of the WeiszPrater criterion [20].
Coke deposition occurred during the exposure of the catalyst to
ethane or propane. The amount of coke deposited was determined
by combustion of the deposited material. Prior to combustion, the
catalyst (0.025 g) was purged with flowing He (60 cm3/min) at
873 K for 5 min, and then exposed it to a mixture of 5% O2 in He
flowing at 60 cm3/min. The CO2 generated was monitored by on-
line mass spectrometry (MS). The amount of deposited coke was
calculated from the amount of generated CO2. Regeneration of
the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a flow of 10%
O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 20 min and then reducing the catalyst
in a flow of 20% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min. Prior to the
changing the gas composition, the reactor was flushed with
helium.
For time-on-stream measurements of coke deposition, the cata-
lysts were reduced as described previously, then place under reac-
tion conditions for a set amount of time. Following use, the catalyst
was purged with flowing He (60 cm3/min) at 873 K for 5 min, then
exposed it to a mixture of 5% O2 in He flowing at 60 cm3/min to
burn off coke deposits. CO and CO2 evolutions were monitored
by mass spectrometry. After oxidation, the catalyst was re-reduced
for 20 min and then used again.
CO chemisorption by the reduced catalyst was measured as fol-
lows. The catalyst was first reduced in a mixture of 20% H2 in He
flowing at 60 cm3/min while it was heated at 10 K/min to 873 K
and then maintained at this temperature for 1 h, after which the
gas flow was switched to 60 cm3/min He, and the catalyst was
cooled to 293 K. Pulses (5 cm3) of 1% CO in He were passed over
the catalyst bed, and the effluent pulse was analyzed by mass spec-
trometry. When no more CO uptake was observed, pulsing was
stopped and amount of CO adsorbed was calculated. The catalyst
was then heated back up to 873 K in 20% H2 in He, and upon stabi-
lizing at 873 K either ethane or propane was passed over the cata-
lyst for 2 h. After reaction, the catalyst was cooled under flowing
He to 293 K, and pulses of 1% CO in He were passed through the
catalyst bed to determine the change in CO adsorption capacity.
Reactants and products were analyzed online using a gas chro-
matograph-mass spectrometer (Varian, Inc., Model 320) equipped
with a 14-port sampling valve and three sample loops. One sample
loop was injected into an Alumina PLOT column, and eluting prod-
ucts were detected by a flame ionization detector (FID). The con-
tents of the second sample loop were injected into a second
Alumina Plot column and were detected and analyzed by mass
spectrometry. The contents of the third sample loop were injected
into a Hayesep N column (used to adsorb CO2, H2O, and heavy
hydrocarbons) connected in series with a Mol Sieve 5A packed col-
umn. The products eluting from this column were detected by a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was
varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total flow constant by
appropriate addition of He. Experiments conducted with the empty
reactor showed that the conversion of ethane and propane was less
than 0.05% at 893 K.
The selectivity to ethene was determined from Eq. (1) and the
selectivity to propene was determined from Eq. (2):
SC2H4 %  C2H4=C2H4  0:5CH4  100%
1
SC3H6 %  C3H6=C3H6  2=3C2H4  1=3CH4
 2=3C2H6  100%
2
Deactivation of the catalysts was calculated by comparing the per-
centage change in alkene concentration at the outlet between 1 and
120 min time on stream:
Dalkene  alkene1 min  alkene120 min=alkene1 min  100%

3. Results
3.1. Ethane dehydrogenation
Fig. 1a and b compares the rate of ethene formation and the
selectivity to ethene, respectively, for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O and Pt/
Mg(Al)O, as a function of time on stream. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibits
an activity at time zero that is 40% higher than that of Pt/Mg(Al)O.
The initial ethene selectivity for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, and Pt/Mg(Al)O is
99%, whereas that for Pt/Mg(Al)O is only 39%, with 61% selectivity
to methane. After two hours time on stream, all catalysts deacti-
vate by 37%. Selectivity to ethene is a monotonic function, reach-
ing 100% for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O after 2 h on stream, and reaching
60% for Pt/Mg(Al)O.

The decrease in activity with time on stream seen in Fig. 1a is
accompanied by the buildup of coke, as shown in Fig. 2. After 2 h
under
reaction
conditions,
the
accumulation
of
carbon
Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O reaches a plateau at the equivalent of 20 C atoms
of coke per total Pt atoms, or equivalently 30 C atoms of coke
per exposed Pt atom. By contrast, the formation of coke on Pt/
Mg(Al)O increases monotonically, with a final value after 2 h of
100 C/Pt.
The activity and the selectivity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O as a function
of the bulk Ga/Pt ratio are shown in Fig. 3. With increasing Ga/Pt
ratio, the rate of ethene formation increases steadily up to a max-
imum value for Ga/Pt = 5.4, beyond which the rate of ethene for-
mation
decreases
monotonically.
By
contrast,
the
ethene
selectivity increases rapidly with increasing Ga/Pt, reaching a value
of nearly 100% for Ga/Pt > 5.4. Fig. 4 shows that the accumulation
of coke is also affected by the Ga/Pt ratio; the C/Pt ratio decreases
from a value of about 70 in the absence of Ga to a value of about 30
for Ga/Pt > 5.4.
Previous studies have shown that the activity of PtSn/Mg(Al)O
can be enhanced by adding H2 to the feed [8,21,22]. Fig. 5a shows
that rate of ethene formation over Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O increases by
approximately tenfold when the ratio of H2 to C2H6 is increased
from 0 to 0.26. Above H2/C2H6 = 0.58, the rate of ethene formation
decreases monotonically. Fig. 5b shows the effect of H2/C2H6 ratio
on the ethene concentration. Also shown in this figure is the equi-
librium concentration of ethene. The patterns seen in Fig. 5a and b
are very similar to those reported for PtSn/Mg(Al)O [9]. Also similar
to what was observed for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, the addition of H2 to the
feed reacted over Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O has no effect on the ethene selec-
tivity, which remains at nearly 100%, as seen in Fig. 5c.
3.2. Propane dehydrogenation
The effects of time on stream on the activity and selectivity of
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O for propane dehydrogenation are
presented in Fig. 6. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibit an initial propene activ-
ity that is about 2.5 higher than that of Pt/Mg(Al)O. However, after
2 h TOS, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O loses 30% of its initial activity and Pt/
Mg(Al)O looses 40% of its original activity, a significantly higher
extent of deactivation than was observed during ethane dehydro-
genation. The propene selectivity was 99% for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O but
only 87% for Pt/Mg(Al)O after 2 h of time on stream, with the bal-
ance of the products being a mixture of ethane, ethene, and meth-
ane.
For
identical
reaction
conditions,
the
rate
of
propene
formation is roughly 2.5 times higher than that for ethene forma-
tion for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, and slightly lower for PtSn/Mg(Al)O,
whereas the rate of propene formation to ethene formation was
only roughly 1.4 times higher for Pt/Mg(Al)O. A propene selectivity
of approximately 99% is achieved on Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, but both the
initial and the final selectivities observed for propene were higher
than those for ethene produced on Pt/Mg(Al)O.
The decrease in activity with time on stream is again accompa-
nied by a buildup of coke on catalyst, as shown in Fig. 7. Similar to
ethane dehydrogenation, Pt/Mg(Al)O formed more coke than Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O, and at a slightly faster rate. However, despite the lar-
ger deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation com-
pared to ethane, the total coke buildup after 2 h time on stream
was less, for both Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O.
The effect of the Ga/Pt ratio on the activity and selectivity of Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O is shown in Fig. 8. As seen in Fig. 3 for ethane dehy-
drogenation, the activity for propane dehydrogenation reaches a
maximum value at Ga/Pt = 5.4; however, the increase in activity
relative to Ga/Pt = 0 is nearly 3 for propene dehydrogenation ver-
sus only 1.3 for ethane dehydrogenation. The influence of Ga/Pt ra-
tio on propene selectivity also differs from what is seen in Fig. 3b
for ethene selectivity. The propene selectivity rises rapidly from
87% to 99% when the Ga/Pt ratio is increased from 0 to 5.4, but then
the propene selectivity decreases down to 97% with further in-
crease in Ga/Pt ratio.

The influence of Ga/Pt ratio on the accumulation of coke for pro-
pane dehydrogenation is similar to that observed for ethane dehy-
drogenation. Fig. 9 shows that the C/Pt ratio decreases from about
47 to about 15 as the Ga/Pt ratio is increased from 0 to 5.4, and
then remains more or less constant for higher Ga/Pt ratios.

Fig. 10a illustrates the effects of H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate of pro-
pene formation and the propene selectivity. The addition of H2 to
the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a
H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25. It is notable that while the effect of H2 addi-
tion on the rate of propene formation is qualitatively similar to that
seen for ethene formation (Fig. 5a), the maximum in propene for-
mation occurs at H2/C3H8 = 1.25, whereas the maximum in ethene
formation occurs at H2/C2H6 = 0.58. A plot of the concentration of
propene versus at H2/C2H6 ratio is presented in Fig. 10b. Unlike
the case of ethene dehydrogenation, the product concentration of
propene does not approach that predicted for equilibrium conver-
sion of the feed. The H2/C3H8 ratio has a somewhat larger effect on
the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene pro-
duced by ethane dehydrogenation (compare Figs. 10c and 5c),
but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the
highest at H2/C3H8 ratio.
Fig. 11 shows the effects of reductionreactionoxidation cycles
on catalyst activity during ethane and propane dehydrogenation.
For ethane dehydrogenation, there is a slight increase in activity
compared to the first cycle after the second, but a decrease in activ-
ity in the following third cycle. The loss in activity between the first
and third cycles at 120 min TOS is 2.1%. For propane dehydrogena-
tion, the trend changes to a constant decrease in activity with re-
peated cycles, the loss in activity between the first and third
cycles after 120 min TOS amounting to 14.8%.
The activity, selectivity, deactivation, and carbon formation
after 2 h TOS is presented in Table 1 for Pt, PtSn, and PtGa sup-
ported on Mg(Al)O) and for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O. For ethane dehydroge-
nation, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, PtSn/Mg(Al)O, and PtGa/Mg(Al)O display
comparable activity, selectivity, and deactivation; however, the
deposition of coke is 50% less than that observed for the other three
catalysts.
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O
creates
about
50%
less
coke.
Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O also exhibits superior activity for propane dehydroge-
nation, as well as less coke buildup and a lower extent of deactiva-
tion. In all cases, modified catalysts have higher activity, and
selectivity, and lower deactivation and coke formation than Pt/
Mg(Al)O.
4. Discussion
4.1. Catalyst activity and selectivity
Figs. 3 and 8 show a strong dependence of the rates of ethene
and propene formation as a function of the bulk Ga/Pt ratio in Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O. The maximum activity in both cases is reached for
Ga/Pt = 2.0, but the maximum activity is more than twofold higher
for propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, under
equivalent reaction conditions. The alkene selectivity for both sys-
tems reaches nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. However, while the selec-
tivity to ethene remains constant for higher Ga/Pt ratios, the
selectivity to propene decreases slowly. In Part I of this work it
was shown that upon H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at 873 K,
Ga3+ cations present near the surface of the support are reduced
and form PtGa alloys, the amount of Ga associated with the Pt
increasing with increasing bulk Ga/Pt ratio [19]. Therefore, the ef-
fects observed in Figs. 3 and 8 can be attributed to the formation of
PtGa alloys. What is not known, however, is the Ga/Pt ratio at the
surface of the bimetallic particles and, hence, it is not possible to
relate the effects of surface Ga/Pt ratio to catalyst activity and
selectivity.

The observation of a maximum in catalyst activity with increas-
ing Ga/Pt ratio very likely reflects the influence of a monotonic de-
crease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the
supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused
by the presence of Ga atoms at the catalyst surface. A similar phe-
nomenon has been observed for ethane dehydrogenation on PtSn/
Mg(Al)O, albeit the peak in activity is not as sharp as that seen for
Ga in Fig. 3 [9]. Studies of PtSn alloys have also shown that the
presence of Sn reduces the energy of adsorption for ethene, thereby
minimizing the readsorption of ethene and the subsequent dissoci-
ation of the C-C bond to form CHx species [2325]. These CHx spe-
cies contribute to the formation of CH4 and to the loss in ethene
selectivity. As was shown previously for PtSn/Mg(Al)O, CHx species
formed from the readsorption of ethene are responsible for the
deposition of coke [8,9]. It is quite plausible then to propose that
the addition of Ga to Pt has similar effects to those of Sn.
The notably higher activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O (Ga/Pt = 2.86) for
propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is likely due to the easier
initiation of the later reaction. As discussed in Ref. [9], the rate-lim-
iting step for alkane dehydrogenation is dissociative adsorption of
the alkane to form adsorbed alkyl species and atomic hydrogen.
Since the CH bond of the methylene group in propane is weaker
than the CH bond of the methyl group in ethane, initiation of pro-
pane should occur more easily than for ethane, resulting in a high-
er rate of propane dehydrogenation.
The ratio of H2 to alkane influences the activity and selectivity
of alkene formation on Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O (Ga/Pt = 5.4) (see Figs. 5
and 10). This effect was noted earlier in our studies of ethane
and propane dehydrogenation on Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O
[9]. In all cases, the rate of alkene formation increases with
increasing H2/alkane ratio and then passes through a maximum.
In our studies of ethane dehydrogenation on Pt/Mg(Al)O and
PtSn/Mg(Al)O, we proposed that at low hydrogen partial pres-
sures the increase in adsorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface
contributes to the removal of the second hydrogen atom from
adsorbed alkyl species, thereby accelerating the rate of alkene
formation [9]. At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydro-
genation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant,
leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate
of alkene formation. As this latter process occurs, the overall con-
centration of alkene in the products approaches that expected at
equilibrium.
4.2. Carbon formation and deactivation
A loss in alkane dehydrogenation activity and the accumulation
of coke was observed with time on stream for all the catalysts
investigated in this study. Similar patterns were noted in our study
on ethane dehydrogenation of Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O [9]. In
the present work, it was found that the loss in activity for ethane
dehydrogenation after 2 h on stream was minimal (3%) in the
case of Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(A-
l)O but much more significant in the case of propane dehydrogena-
tion (2545%) (Table 1). The presence of Ga compared to Sn
reduced the deactivation and the amount of coke deposited during
both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The results presented
in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation be-
tween loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation.
Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are
much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most
of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only
a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles.
The loss of dehydrogenation activity due to sintering of the metal
particles is likely minimal. This conclusion is based on the observa-
tion that the loss in activity after three cycles for ethane dehydro-
genation is only 2.1% (and an increase in activity was noted during
the second cycle). While the final loss in activity for propane dehy-
drogenation after three cycles was 14.8%, the loss in initial activity
after each cycle was minimal (Fig. 11). These results lead suggest
that catalyst deactivation may be due to the accumulation of a
small amount of coke on the active metal particles, while most of
the coke lies on the support.
Further insights into the differences in carbon formation
between ethane and propane dehydrogenation with Pt can be
drawn from surface sciences investigations of ethene and pro-
pene. Studies on Pt(1 1 1) and Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces have shown
that the energies of adsorption for ethene and propene on
Pt(1 1 1) differ negligibly [23,24,26]. In an inert atmosphere, the
extent of propene decomposition on Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces is high-
er than that of ethene for all Sn coverages tested (00.33) [24].
However, as noted previously, when H2 is adsorbed onto the sur-
face of Pt(1 1 1), the decomposition product of propene, propyli-
dyne, is rehydrogenated far more readily than ethylidyne [27,28].
Thus, the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the
amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation
of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke
formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to
ethane dehydrogenation. The effects of Sn in Sn/Pt(1 1 1) on the
adsorption energies of ethene and propene show that the main
electronic effect of the modifier is to reduce the desorption bar-
riers of the desired products, and given the qualitative agreement
in catalyst activity between PtSn/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O,
we hypothesize that the manner in which Ga affects the surface
is similar to that of Sn (Table 1) [24].
It has been shown that the overall amount of coke formed is
greater during ethane dehydrogenation than during propane,
but the deactivation is greater during propane dehydrogenation
than during ethane; therefore, the total amount of coke formed
cannot be responsible for the increased deactivation. However,
it is possible that the transfer of carbonaceous species from the
metal active site to the support may be less efficient for such spe-
cies originating from propane than those originating from ethane.
The amount of CO chemisorbed before and after alkane dehydro-
genation for 2 h was measured for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O (Ga/Pt = 5.4) in
an attempt to determine the loss in active sites. The data in Table
2 show after ethane 44% sites capable of CO chemisorption are
lost after ethane dehydrogenation, but 98% of such sites are lost
after propane dehydrogenation. While these data show a qualita-
tive correlation between loss of CO chemisorption sites and dehy-
drogenation activity, the loss in CO chemisorptions capacity is
greater than the loss in dehydrogenation activity for both alkanes.
We hypothesize that coke not only alters the number of sites for
CO adsorption, but also decreases the heat of CO adsorption. Con-
sistent with the latter idea, CO adsorption experiments on
Pt(1 1 1), (5 5 7) and (13, 1, 1) surfaces before and after hydrocar-
bon reactions have shown that there is a decrease in the CO
desorption temperature after hydrocarbon reaction, indicating
that the deposited carbonaceous species weaken the binding of
CO [29,30]. Thus, we conclude that the more significant decrease
in CO chemisorption than decrease in activity is due to carbon on
the surface decreasing the binding energy of CO, and not entirely
because of surface coverage by carbon. Our measurements of the
loss in CO chemisorptions capacity do show, however, that more

of the metal surface is affected by carbonaceous species derived
from propane that from ethane. Thus, we hypothesize that less
mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a
larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a lar-
ger deactivation.
5. Conclusion
We have shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the
method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane
dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation
of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. We
have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deac-
tivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts,
such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O. The enhanced activity,
selectivity, and resistance to coke formation of the Ga-modified
Pt catalysts are attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys. In Part
I of this series it was shown that such alloys are formed upon
reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at 873 K. The peak in activity seen
for bulk Ga/Pt ratios of 1.45.4 is attributed to dilution of Pt
ensembles by Ga, which enhance the adsorption of the reactant al-
kane and inhibits the adsorption of product alkene. Suppressing
the latter process is important, since it contributes to the formation
product hydrogenolysis (e.g. the conversion of ethene to methane).
Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to
enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl
species. However, as the concentration of alkene in the product
approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene for-
mation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of
the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increas-
ing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with
time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogena-
tion. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane
than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited
on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt
atoms. The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and
carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accu-
mulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that
the bulk accumulates on the support. The lower coke formation
during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydroge-
nation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli-
dyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between
decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed
during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater cover-
age of the surface of the active metal particle by coke.
