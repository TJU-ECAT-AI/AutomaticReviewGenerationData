The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on the surface chemistry of ethylene on platinum surfaces, including its conversion to ethylidyne and hydrogenation to ethane, but does not provide details on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The document also does not mention any ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism based on the given text.

给定的文献中没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理。该文本主要关注乙烯在铂表面的表面化学反应,包括其转化为乙叉基和氢化为乙烷的过程,但没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个主要步骤的详细信息。文档也没有提到有关速率限制步骤的任何持续讨论,或者为什么这种机制仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。因此,我无法根据给定的文本提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的详细解释或分析。
