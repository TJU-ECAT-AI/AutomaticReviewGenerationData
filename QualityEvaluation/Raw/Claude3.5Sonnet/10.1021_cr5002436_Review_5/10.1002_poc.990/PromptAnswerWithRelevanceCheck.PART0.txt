The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be directly answered from the given scientific literature, as it does not discuss this specific mechanism. The document focuses on a different mechanism involving oxidative addition for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium-silica catalysts. 

However, based on general knowledge about catalytic mechanisms, I can provide some information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism:

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism typically consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. Dissociation: One C-H bond of the adsorbed molecule breaks, forming an adsorbed alkyl group and a surface-bound hydrogen atom.

3. Desorption of hydrogen: Two surface-bound hydrogen atoms combine and desorb as H2 gas.

4. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon of the adsorbed alkyl group transfers to the catalyst surface, forming the alkene product which then desorbs.

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, with some researchers arguing it's the initial C-H bond breaking, while others suggest it's the β-hydride elimination step. The mechanism remains a topic of interest because understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for improving catalyst design and reaction efficiency.

The controversy persists due to the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis, difficulties in directly observing surface intermediates, and variations in behavior across different catalyst systems and reaction conditions. Continued advancements in surface science techniques and computational modeling contribute to ongoing refinements and debates about the details of this mechanism.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理无法直接从给定的科学文献中回答，因为文献并未讨论这一具体机理。该文档主要关注铬-硅催化剂上乙烷脱氢的氧化加成机理。

然而，基于对催化机理的一般了解，我可以提供一些关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息：

Horiuti-Polanyi机理通常包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：反应分子吸附到催化剂表面。

2. 解离：吸附分子的一个C-H键断裂，形成吸附的烷基基团和表面结合的氢原子。

3. 氢气脱附：两个表面结合的氢原子结合并以H2气体形式脱附。

4. β-氢消除：吸附烷基基团β-碳上的氢转移到催化剂表面，形成烯烃产物，然后脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，存在持续的争论，一些研究人员认为是初始C-H键断裂，而其他人则认为是β-氢消除步骤。该机理仍然是一个研究热点，因为理解速率限制步骤对改进催化剂设计和提高反应效率至关重要。

争议持续存在的原因包括多相催化的复杂性、直接观察表面中间体的困难，以及不同催化剂系统和反应条件下行为的变化。表面科学技术和计算模拟的持续进步促进了对该机理细节的不断完善和争论。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on a different mechanism involving oxidative addition for ethane dehydrogenation on chromium-silica catalysts. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four steps.

The literature describes a mechanism with the following main steps for ethane dehydrogenation:
1. CH activation by oxidative addition 
2. Stereochemical rearrangement
3. β-hydrogen transfer to form H2
4. Ethene desorption

The rate-limiting step in this mechanism is identified as the stereochemical rearrangement step following CH activation. 

While this mechanism shares some similarities with the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in terms of involving adsorption, CH bond activation, and product desorption, it follows a different reaction pathway specific to the chromium catalyst system studied.

The document does not provide information to address the ongoing debate about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or why it remains controversial after decades of study. The focus is on comparing different potential mechanisms for the specific chromium-silica catalyst system rather than discussing broader mechanistic debates in catalysis.

本文献中没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。该文档主要关注铬-硅胶催化剂上乙烷脱氢的另一种机理,即氧化加成机理。文中没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个步骤。

文献描述了乙烷脱氢的以下主要步骤:
1. 通过氧化加成进行CH活化
2. 立体化学重排
3. β-氢转移形成H2
4. 乙烯脱附

在这个机理中,速率限制步骤被确定为CH活化后的立体化学重排步骤。

虽然这个机理在吸附、CH键活化和产物脱附方面与Horiuti-Polanyi机理有一些相似之处,但它遵循了特定于所研究的铬催化剂体系的不同反应途径。

该文档没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续争论或为什么它在经过数十年的研究后仍然存在争议的信息。文章的重点是比较特定铬-硅胶催化剂体系的不同潜在机理,而不是讨论催化领域更广泛的机理争论。
