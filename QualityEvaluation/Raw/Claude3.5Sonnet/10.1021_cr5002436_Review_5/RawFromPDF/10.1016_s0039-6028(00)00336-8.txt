Abstract
The adsorption of propylene on Pt(111) single-crystal surfaces was characterized by reﬂection-absorption infra-
red spectroscopy (RAIRS). The uptake of propylene on the surface at 90 K results in the development of at least
four adsorption species as a function of coverage. Signiﬁcant rehybridization of the CNC double bond of propylene
takes place at low coverages, so the molecule primarily interacts with the metal via two s metalMcarbon bonds.
Below half-saturation, the molecule mainly bonds through the central carbon atom, but at higher coverage, the CMC
bond becomes ﬂat, and the terminal methyl group tilts towards a more vertical orientation. Further dosing of
propylene after saturation of the di-s state leads to the build-up of a ﬂat p-bonded second layer. Ultimately, a layer
of condensed propylene could be grown on the surface under the vacuum conditions of the experiment as long as the
temperature was kept below 80 K. Annealing of the low-temperature propylene-saturated Pt(111) surface ﬁrst induces
the desorption of the weakly held p species, and later, between 230 and 250 K, to the dehydrogenation and
rearrangement of the remaining di-s species to propylidyne (Pt3OCMCH2MCH3). The details of the conversion of
propylene to propylidyne change somewhat with the conditions under which this transformation is carried out, and
appear to involve a stable and identiﬁable intermediate [2-propyl, CH3MCH(Pt)MCH3, and/or propylidene,
Pt2NCHMCH2MCH3]. Propylene p-bonding is also possible on propylidyne-saturated Pt(111) surfaces under vacuum.

of condensed propylene because of its well-deﬁned
adsorption geometry, and with a distinct desorp-
tion temperature and kinetics in temperature-pro-
grammed desorption experiments (see below).
It is interesting to note that because the desorp-
tion of condensed propylene under vacuum starts
below 90 K (the vapor pressure of propylene at
90 K is about 4×10−6 Torr [39]), it is quite diﬃ-
cult to build up a thick propylene layer in our
system. Indeed, because the crystal in the RAIRS
apparatus could only be cooled to about 90 K, no

could in principle bring into question the identiﬁ-

physisorbed state, except that a number of distin-
guishing features can be used to diﬀerentiate
between weakly p-bonded propylene and con-

Both the transition from propylene to propyli-

one, the RAIRS data for propylidyne prepared by
deposition of propylene at high temperatures are
slightly diﬀerent to those obtained by adsorption
