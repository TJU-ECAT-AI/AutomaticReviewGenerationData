The given scientific literature does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on computational studies of alkane dehydrogenation on small platinum clusters, but does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature does not address the ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting in this mechanism, nor does it explain why the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. As such, the question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

给定的科学文献中不包含有关催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息。该文档主要关注小型铂簇上烷烃脱氢的计算研究，但没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献没有涉及关于该机理中哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论，也没有解释为什么该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。因此，无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。
