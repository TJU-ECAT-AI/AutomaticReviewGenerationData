Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a title and partial citation for an article about density functional theory study on propane and propene adsorption on platinum surfaces. There is no content related to the specific mechanism, its steps, or debates about rate-limiting steps. Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot answer the question about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息。这份文档似乎是一篇关于丙烷和丙烯在铂表面吸附的密度泛函理论研究的文章标题和部分引用。文中没有涉及具体机理、其步骤或关于限速步骤的争论的内容。由于提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理的问题，也无法讨论为什么它仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a brief snippet about a density functional theory study on propane and propene adsorption on platinum and platinum-tin alloy surfaces. It does not provide any details about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, or the debate surrounding its rate-limiting step. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the mechanism or discuss why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.
