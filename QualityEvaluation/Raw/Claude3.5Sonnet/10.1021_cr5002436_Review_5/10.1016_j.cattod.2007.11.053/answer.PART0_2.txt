The provided literature does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The text focuses on PtSn/TiO2 catalysts and their behavior in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, which is a different reaction. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its steps are not mentioned or discussed in this document. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism, its steps, or analyze the debate about the rate-limiting step based on the given text. The literature also does not discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

提供的文献不包含关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息。文本主要关注PtSn/TiO2催化剂及其在巴豆醛选择性加氢中的行为,这是一个不同的反应。文中没有提到或讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理及其步骤。因此,我无法根据给定的文本详细解释该机理、其步骤,或分析关于速率限制步骤的争论。文献也没有讨论为什么这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。
