[1] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[2] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[3] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of one C-H bond to form an alkyl species and adsorbed hydrogen
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond to form the alkene
4. Desorption of the alkene product

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some studies have identified the elimination of β-hydrogen from the alkyl intermediate (step 3) as rate-determining. Others have proposed the initial C-H bond dissociation (step 2) or even the adsorption of the alkane (step 1) as rate-limiting.

This mechanism remains controversial despite decades of study for several reasons:

1. Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-determining steps.
2. The surface structure and particle size of the catalyst can influence which step is slowest.
3. Advanced characterization techniques continue to provide new insights into surface species and reaction intermediates.
4. Computational modeling allows for detailed analysis of each elementary step.
5. The mechanism's broad applicability to many catalytic systems maintains interest in refining our understanding.

The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the need for systematic studies across different catalyst materials and structures. Resolving these mechanistic questions is crucial for rational catalyst design and optimization of industrial dehydrogenation processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. 一个C-H键断裂形成烷基物种和吸附氢
3. 第二个C-H键断裂形成烯烃
4. 烯烃产物脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤仍存在争议。一些研究认为从烷基中间体消除β-氢(第3步)是速率决定步骤。其他研究则提出初始C-H键断裂(第2步)甚至烷烃吸附(第1步)是速率限制步骤。

尽管研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率决定步骤。
2. 催化剂的表面结构和粒径可能影响哪一步最慢。
3. 先进的表征技术不断为表面物种和反应中间体提供新的见解。
4. 计算机模拟允许对每个基元步骤进行详细分析。
5. 该机理广泛适用于许多催化体系，保持了对完善我们理解的兴趣。

持续的争论突出了多相催化的复杂性，以及需要在不同催化剂材料和结构上进行系统研究。解决这些机理问题对于理性催化剂设计和优化工业脱氢过程至关重要。
