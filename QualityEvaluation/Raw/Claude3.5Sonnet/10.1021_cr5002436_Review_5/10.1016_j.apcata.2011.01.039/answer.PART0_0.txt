[1] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[2] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[3] "Propene is chemically adsorbed on Pt by binding two surface Pt atoms through its unsaturated CC bond."

[4] "More interestingly, it was found that surface hydrogen has a remarkable influences on the overall reactions by promoting propene desorption and hindering propene dehydrogenation."

[5] "By assuming the surface reaction (I3) as the rate-determining step, the rate of propane conversion is:"

[6] "If the first CH bond cleavage of propane (II1) is the rate-determining step, the rate expression can be derived as:"

[7] "If the second step with second CH bond cleavage of propane (II2) is the rate-limiting step, the rate expression is:"

[8] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[9] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[10] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[11] "However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of a C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate 
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond to form the alkene product
4. Desorption of the alkene product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Different studies have proposed various rate-determining steps:

- Elimination of β-hydrogen from the propyl radical
- Conversion of propyl radical to π-bonded propene 
- Dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane
- First C-H bond cleavage
- Second C-H bond cleavage

The debate persists because experimental results have been inconsistent across different catalyst systems. Factors like catalyst structure, particle size, and surface orientation may influence which step is rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains controversial because:

1. It is fundamental to understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions
2. Identifying the rate-limiting step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization
3. Advanced characterization techniques continue to provide new insights
4. Computational modeling allows for more detailed mechanistic studies
5. The mechanism's applicability across diverse catalyst systems is still being explored

The ongoing scientific interest stems from the mechanism's importance in industrial processes and the potential to develop improved catalysts through a deeper understanding of the reaction steps. Resolving the debate could lead to significant advancements in catalyst technology for dehydrogenation reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃分子在催化剂表面吸附
2. C-H键断裂形成烷基中间体
3. 第二个C-H键断裂形成烯烃产物
4. 烯烃产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，存在持续的争论。不同的研究提出了各种速率决定步骤：

- 从丙基自由基中消除β-氢
- 丙基自由基转化为π键合的丙烯
- 吸附丙烷的脱氢
- 第一个C-H键的断裂
- 第二个C-H键的断裂

这场争论持续存在，因为在不同的催化剂系统中，实验结果不一致。催化剂结构、粒子大小和表面取向等因素可能影响哪一步是速率限制步骤。尽管研究近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 它是理解催化脱氢反应的基础
2. 确定速率限制步骤对催化剂设计和优化至关重要
3. 先进的表征技术不断提供新的见解
4. 计算机模拟允许进行更详细的机理研究
5. 该机理在不同催化剂系统中的适用性仍在探索中

持续的科学兴趣源于该机理在工业过程中的重要性，以及通过深入理解反应步骤来开发改进催化剂的潜力。解决这场争论可能会导致脱氢反应催化剂技术的重大进展。
