[1] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[2] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[3] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of a C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond to form an alkene
4. Desorption of the alkene product

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some studies suggest the second C-H bond breaking (step 3) is rate-determining, while others propose the first C-H dissociation (step 2) or even the initial adsorption as rate-limiting.

This mechanism remains controversial despite decades of study for several reasons:

1. Experimental challenges in directly observing surface intermediates
2. Dependence on specific catalyst properties (e.g. metal, particle size, support)
3. Variations with reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)
4. Difficulty in isolating individual mechanistic steps
5. Advances in theoretical/computational methods providing new insights

The continuing interest stems from the industrial importance of dehydrogenation reactions and the need to develop improved catalysts. A deeper mechanistic understanding could enable better catalyst design. Additionally, as a prototypical surface reaction, it serves as a model system for heterogeneous catalysis more broadly.

The debate highlights the complexity of surface reactions and the need for complementary experimental and theoretical approaches. Resolving the rate-determining step conclusively may require advanced in-situ spectroscopic techniques combined with detailed kinetic modeling.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. C-H键断裂形成烷基中间体
3. 第二个C-H键断裂形成烯烃
4. 烯烃产物脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤存在持续争论。一些研究表明第二个C-H键断裂(步骤3)是速率决定步骤，而其他研究则提出第一个C-H解离(步骤2)甚至初始吸附是速率限制步骤。

尽管研究了几十年，这个机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 直接观察表面中间体的实验挑战
2. 对特定催化剂性质的依赖性(如金属、粒径、载体)
3. 随反应条件(温度、压力等)的变化
4. 分离单个机理步骤的困难
5. 理论/计算方法的进步提供了新的见解

持续关注源于脱氢反应的工业重要性以及开发改进催化剂的需求。更深入的机理理解可能有助于更好的催化剂设计。此外，作为一个典型的表面反应，它可作为更广泛的多相催化的模型系统。

这场争论突显了表面反应的复杂性以及互补实验和理论方法的必要性。要确定速率决定步骤可能需要先进的原位光谱技术结合详细的动力学建模。
