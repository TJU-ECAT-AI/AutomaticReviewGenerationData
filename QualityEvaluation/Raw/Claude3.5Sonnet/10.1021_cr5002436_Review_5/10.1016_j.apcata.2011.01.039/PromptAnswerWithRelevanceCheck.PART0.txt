[1] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[2] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[3] "Propene is chemically adsorbed on Pt by binding two surface Pt atoms through its unsaturated CC bond."

[4] "More interestingly, it was found that surface hydrogen has a remarkable influences on the overall reactions by promoting propene desorption and hindering propene dehydrogenation."

[5] "By assuming the surface reaction (I3) as the rate-determining step, the rate of propane conversion is:"

[6] "If the first CH bond cleavage of propane (II1) is the rate-determining step, the rate expression can be derived as:"

[7] "If the second step with second CH bond cleavage of propane (II2) is the rate-limiting step, the rate expression is:"

[8] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[9] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[10] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[11] "However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of a C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate 
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond to form the alkene product
4. Desorption of the alkene product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Different studies have proposed various rate-determining steps:

- Elimination of β-hydrogen from the propyl radical
- Conversion of propyl radical to π-bonded propene 
- Dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane
- First C-H bond cleavage
- Second C-H bond cleavage

The debate persists because experimental results have been inconsistent across different catalyst systems. Factors like catalyst structure, particle size, and surface orientation may influence which step is rate-limiting. Despite nearly a century of study, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains controversial because:

1. It is fundamental to understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions
2. Identifying the rate-limiting step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization
3. Advanced characterization techniques continue to provide new insights
4. Computational modeling allows for more detailed mechanistic studies
5. The mechanism's applicability across diverse catalyst systems is still being explored

The ongoing scientific interest stems from the mechanism's importance in industrial processes and the potential to develop improved catalysts through a deeper understanding of the reaction steps. Resolving the debate could lead to significant advancements in catalyst technology for dehydrogenation reactions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of the alkane to form an alkyl intermediate and adsorbed hydrogen
3. β-hydrogen elimination from the alkyl intermediate to form an alkene
4. Desorption of the alkene product

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Different studies have proposed various rate-determining steps:

- Elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical
- Conversion of propyl radical to π-bonded propene
- Dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The mechanism involves multiple elementary steps on complex catalyst surfaces, making it challenging to isolate and study individual steps.

2. Diversity of catalysts: Different catalysts (e.g., platinum, chromium) may exhibit different rate-limiting steps or reaction pathways.

3. Experimental limitations: Advanced techniques are required to observe short-lived intermediates and elucidate reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.

4. Theoretical challenges: Accurately modeling surface reactions and accounting for factors like coverage effects and lateral interactions remain challenging for computational studies.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding and optimizing dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for many industrial processes, driving continued research efforts.

6. Advances in characterization techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into reaction mechanisms, sometimes challenging established views.

The ongoing debate and research surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the importance of understanding fundamental reaction steps for catalyst design and process optimization.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of one C-H bond, forming an adsorbed alkyl species
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond, forming the alkene product
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some studies have identified the elimination of β-hydrogen from the adsorbed alkyl species (step 3) as rate-determining. Others have suggested that the initial dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane (step 2) is rate-limiting. 

The controversy persists because experimental results have been inconsistent across different catalyst systems. For example, studies on chromium and platinum catalysts have yielded conflicting conclusions about the rate-determining step. This suggests that the rate-limiting step may depend on factors like catalyst structure, particle size, and surface properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest nearly a century after its proposal for several reasons:

1. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding heterogeneous catalysis.
2. Identifying the rate-determining step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization.
3. Advanced experimental and computational techniques continue to provide new insights.
4. The mechanism's applicability to various catalytic systems is still being explored.
5. Understanding the details of each mechanistic step can inform the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

The ongoing controversy highlights the complexity of catalytic processes and the need for continued research to fully elucidate reaction mechanisms across different catalyst systems. A systematic study considering catalyst structure and composition is necessary to resolve the debate and develop a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Advances in theoretical/computational methods providing new insights

The continuing interest stems from the industrial importance of dehydrogenation reactions and the need to develop improved catalysts. A deeper mechanistic understanding could enable better catalyst design. Additionally, as a prototypical surface reaction, it serves as a model system for heterogeneous catalysis more broadly.

The debate highlights the complexity of surface reactions and the need for complementary experimental and theoretical approaches. Resolving the rate-determining step conclusively may require advanced in-situ spectroscopic techniques combined with detailed kinetic modeling.
