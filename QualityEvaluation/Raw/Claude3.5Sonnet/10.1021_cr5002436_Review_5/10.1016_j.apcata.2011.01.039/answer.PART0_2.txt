[1] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[2] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[3] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of one C-H bond, forming an adsorbed alkyl species
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond, forming the alkene product
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some studies have identified the elimination of β-hydrogen from the adsorbed alkyl species (step 3) as rate-determining. Others have suggested that the initial dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane (step 2) is rate-limiting. 

The controversy persists because experimental results have been inconsistent across different catalyst systems. For example, studies on chromium and platinum catalysts have yielded conflicting conclusions about the rate-determining step. This suggests that the rate-limiting step may depend on factors like catalyst structure, particle size, and surface properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest nearly a century after its proposal for several reasons:

1. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding heterogeneous catalysis.
2. Identifying the rate-determining step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization.
3. Advanced experimental and computational techniques continue to provide new insights.
4. The mechanism's applicability to various catalytic systems is still being explored.
5. Understanding the details of each mechanistic step can inform the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

The ongoing controversy highlights the complexity of catalytic processes and the need for continued research to fully elucidate reaction mechanisms across different catalyst systems. A systematic study considering catalyst structure and composition is necessary to resolve the debate and develop a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附
2. 一个C-H键断裂，形成吸附的烷基物种
3. 第二个C-H键断裂，形成烯烃产物
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究认为从吸附的烷基物种中消除β-氢（第3步）是速率决定步骤。其他研究则认为吸附的烷烃的初始脱氢（第2步）是速率限制步骤。

这一争议持续存在，因为在不同的催化剂系统中实验结果并不一致。例如，在铬和铂催化剂上的研究得出了关于速率决定步骤的矛盾结论。这表明速率限制步骤可能取决于催化剂结构、粒子大小和表面性质等因素。

Horiuti-Polanyi机理提出近一个世纪后仍然是科学兴趣的话题，原因如下：

1. 它为理解多相催化提供了基本框架。
2. 确定速率决定步骤对催化剂设计和优化至关重要。
3. 先进的实验和计算技术不断提供新的见解。
4. 该机理在各种催化系统中的适用性仍在探索中。
5. 理解每个机理步骤的细节可以指导开发更高效和选择性的催化剂。

持续的争议突显了催化过程的复杂性，以及需要继续研究以充分阐明不同催化剂系统中的反应机理。需要进行考虑催化剂结构和组成的系统研究，以解决这一争议，并对催化脱氢反应形成更全面的理解。
