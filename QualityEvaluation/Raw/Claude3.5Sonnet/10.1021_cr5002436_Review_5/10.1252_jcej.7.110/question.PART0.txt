In isopentane
dehydrogenation
over chromia-alumina
catalyst,
the
conversion
of
isopentane
and the
yield
of isopentenes
decreased
rapidly
with
process
time
while
that
o
f
isoprene
did
so very slowly.
Coke deposition
on catalyst
and
catalyst
fouling
occurred
in an integral
catalytic
reactor,
and coke distribution
was observed
along
the
axial
direction
of the
reactor.
For
isopentane
dehydrogenation
a kinetic
model
in
which
the
main
reaction
was
consecutive
and the
sub-reaction
was parallel
is proposed.
For estimating
distributed
kinetic
parameters
with
catalyst
fouling,
an algorithm
that
involves
two calculating
steps
is introduced.
Applying
an activity
factor
which
accounts for
catalyst
fouling
and
which
is
a linear
function
of coke
content,
the
kinetic
parameters
were estimated.
Using
these
parameters,
the
changes
of the
concentration
and
the
distribution
of
coke
content
with
process
time were simulated
fairly
well.
Introduction
In
catalytic
reactions,
cracking20)
, isomerization22)
,
hydrogenation19),
and
so on,
an activity
distribution
along
the
axial
direction
of the
reactor
usually
occurs
due
to coke
deposition
on catalyst,
and
it varies
with
process
time.
Froment
and
Bischoff4)
treated
the
dis-
tribution
of the
catalyst
activity
feteoretically
in
the
reactor.
Several
studies9'14'17'19)
dealing
with
re-
actions
with
fouling,
discussed
the
catalyst
activity
as a
function
of an average
coke
content.
Recently,
to
aid
process
design3'23'24)
and
to
obtain
optimization15'18),
an
expression
of the
catalyst
activity
as a function
of
process
time
was introduced.
The
derived
optimal
policies
or kinetic
model
would
include
uncertainties
of
the
deactivation
model
and discrepancy
between
the
observed
and
the
evaluated
values
because
of simplifi-
cation
of
the
catalyst
fouling
and
coke
formation.
It
is
necessary
to represent
the
catalyst
activity
profile
pre-
cisely,
but
there
have
been
only
a few studies
that
ana-
lyze
complex
reaction
kinetics
with
catalyst
fouling.
Gavalas
et al.1
dealt
with
the
problem
of estimating
catalyst
activity
profiles
from
current
operating
reactor
data
of naphtha
reforming
by
a parametrization
tech-
nique.
Tone
et al.20)
developed
a kinetic
model
for
the
relation
between
methylcyclohexane
cracking
and coke
formation,
and
showed
that
by
the
activity
factor,
which
was expressed
as a function
of coke content,
the
calculated values of both the productand coke content
distribution in a fixed bed agreed fairly well with the
observed values.
 The purpose of this study was to develop a kinetic
model for the dehydrogenation of isopentane that is
useful for process design and optimization. The de-
hydrogenation ofisopentane was studied in an integral
packed reactor at various levels of temperature and
contact time, and the distribution of coke content was
measured. A kinetic model including coke formation
was assumed. The kinetic parameters in the model are
estimated by a new algorithm which is constructed by
two calculating steps. Firstly, under an assumption that
the rate constants are uniform through the reactor,
average or lumped kinetic parameters were evaluated
by the non-linear least square method. The function of
activity factor was determined from the lumped rate
constants, relating to the average coke content. Second-
ly, the activity factor with coke content could be
used to represent the coke distribution in the catalytic
bed, and as a result a simulation of the reaction kinetics
was accomplished. From the best-fits between the ex-
perimental and calculated values, the proposed kinetic
model was useful to simulate isopentane dehydroge-

Mainly
the
16-32

was used.

Apparatus
and
procedure
for
dehydroge-
n
ation
of
isopentane
To study
the dehydrogenation
of isopentane,
a flow
system
was used as shown in Fig.
1, operating
essential-
ly
at
atmospheric
pressure.
The
reactor,
which
was a
10
mm
I.D.
by
325
mm long- quartz
tube,
contained
catalysts
fixed
by
quarts
wobl.
The
reactor
was placed
in
a
fluidized
sand
bath
which
was maintained
at
constant
temperature
by means of a P.I.D.
controller.
Two stainless
sealed
chromel-alumel
thermocouples,
1
mm
O.D., were
positioned
along
the
axis
of
the
reactor
to measure the temperatures
within
the
catalyst
b
ed;
these
were recorded
continuously.
The
hydrocarbons
used
were ultrapure
grade
iso-
pentane,
2-methyl
2-butene
(2M2B),
2-methyl
1-
butene
(2M1B),
or
isoprene.
As the
boiling
points
of
the
materials
were
close
to
30G,
a
syringe
ofa
micro-
feeder
was set
in
an
ice
bath
to
prevent
the
materials
escaping
in
vapor.
When
the
reactor
reached
a given
temperature,
nitrogen
gas
was
exchanged
with
feed
gas
of definite
composition
of hydrocarbon
diluted
with
nitrogen.
A contact
time
(r)
was
defined
by
z\Uv
on
the
space
velocity
at
300G,
ranging
from 0.06
to 3.6
sec.
The
products
were
analyzed
on
line
by
gas
chromatography;
the
total
effluent from the
reactor
passed
through
the
heated
(at
50C)
gas
sampler
(HGS-2
Shimadzu).
Isopentane,
isopentenes
(2M1B,
2M2B
and
3M1B)
and
isoprene
were separated
in
a
column
containing
15%
-'-oxydipropionitrile
on a-
alumina.
The
experimental
conditions
are shown in
Table
1. Three
sizes
of catalysts
and
the
pellet
were
tested
to determine
the
resistance
of intraparticle
dif-
fusion
on
conversion
at
a
reaction
temperature
of
536G.
For
catalyst
particle
less
than
16-32
mesh,
re-
sistance
of
intraparticle
diffusion
was
negligible,
and
the
16-32
mesh
catalyst
was used
for measurement
of
reaction
rates
for
all
runs.
1.
3 Measurement
of coke
content
After
a reaction
run was over,
the
catalyst
bed
was
divided
into
equal
sections
about
1.5
cm long
(about
1.0
g)
along
the
reactor.
The
coke-deposited
catalyst
of
the
section
was drawn out by vacuum line
one after
another.
An average
coke
content
of the
m-th section
from
the
inlet
of
the
reactor
was ncm.A coke content,
ncm as shown in Figs.
2-4,
was given
as an arithmetic
m
ean
ofncm_1
and
ncm.
The
weight
of the
coke
on the
catalyst
was deter-
mined
in a thermogravimetric
balance
by burning
off
coke
with
air.
Furthermore,
to measure
the
ratio
of
carbon
to hydrogen
in coke,
experiments
of coke
com-
bustion
were carried
out
by
the
same
apparatus
as
shown
in
Fig.
1. About
3 g of coke
catalyst
was placed
into
the
reactor.
After
idBsorption
of
the
adsorbed
water
by
nitrogen
at
250C,
200
cc/min
of
dried
air
was passed
through
the
reactor
at about
620G.
GO
and
CO2 were separated
in a column
containing
silica
gel-activated
carbon

Experimental
Results
To examine
the
reaction
models,
three
kinds
of
hydrocarbons,
i.e.
isopentane,
2M2B
and
isoprene,
were
used
under
differential
reactor
conditions.
In the
feed
of isopentane,
coke formation
was negligible,
but
in
the
feed
of
2M2B
or
isoprene
considerable
coke
deposited
on the
catalyst.
With
an integral
reactor
(contact
time
0.6
sec,
at
536C
and
for
process
time
70
min),
the
average
coke
deposition
from isopentane
was
about
40
mg-coke/g-cat.,
that
from
2M2B
was
about
220
mg-coke/g-cat.,
and
that
from isoprene
was
250
mg-coke/g-cat.
In the
dehydrogenation
of isopen-
tane
in an integral
reactor,
a rapid
rise
of temperature
to
60G
was observed
in the
catalyst
bed
during
1 to
3
min of process
time.
It
was considered
that
there
might
be
exothermic
reactions
at
an initial
process
time-rapid
coke
formation,
polymerization
and
so
forth.
At least
five minutes
was allowed
for the
system
to
reach
steady
state,
so sample
for
reactant
was taken
ten
minutes
later.
Isopentanes
were 2M2B,
2M1B
and
3M1B,
and
ratios
of each
conifjnent
were not dependent
on pro-
cess
time,
but
only
on
temperature.
Isopentenes
(2M1B,
2M2B
and
3M1B)
are
in
equilibrium
with
each
other
as
reported
by
Ishii
et
al.1V).

Kinetic
model
The dehydrogenation
of isopentane
was reported
by
Mavity
et al.12)
as a consecutive
reaction
(isopentane
->isopentenes->isoprene)
under
condition
of
various
feed
rates,
pressure
and
so on. According
to
Ishii
et
10,ll)
jt
was noted
that
dehydrogenation
from iso-
pentane
to isopentenes
was a first-order
reaction,
and
that
2M1B
and
3M1B
were the
intermediates
to
iso-
prene.
The
dehydrogenation
was accompanied
by coke
for-
mation
during
the
process.
Coke
is not
only formed
via
olefin as reported
by
Takeuchi
et al.19),
Eberly
et al.5),
Otake
et
al.10),
but
also
via
diolefin,
as obtained
from

the
experimental
results.
The
reaction
includes
thermal
cracking,
isomeri-
zation,
polymerization,
etc.
It
is assumed
thatdehydro-
genation
ofisopentane
takes
place
in consecutive
steps,
that
cracking
occurs
in
parallel
from isopeiitane,
and
that
coke
formation
is
via
both
isopentenes
and
iso-
prene.
The

thus
assumed
is shown

Coke
and
activation
energy
From the
chemical
analysis
of
the
coke
component,
C1 0H0>05-G1#0H0>15
was obtained.
It
was
reported
that
the
coke component on silica-alumina
catalyst15)
was
Ci.0H0.5-Gi.oHi.o,
and
C1>0H0.5-C1>0H1>0
for
the
cracking
of methylcyclohexane
on silica-alumina
cata-
lyst21)
and
C1 0H0>75 for
the
dehydrogenation
of
n-
butane
on chromia-alumina
catalyst13).
The
reason
why
the
values
of G/H
(carbon/hydrogen)
were differ-
ent
among investigators
might
be
due
to the
compli-
cated
mechanism
of such
processes
polymerization
and
adsorption.
Ishii
et
tf/.10'n)
reported
that
the
reaction
kinetics
from isopentane
to isopentenes
was first-order
with
respect
to each
component
and that
the
activation
energy
was 21.4
kcal/g-mol
for
isopentane
with
hydro-
gen
carrier
gas.
The
evaluated
activation
energy
was
17.3
kcal/g-mol
with
nitrogen
carrier
gas.
The
differ-
ence between
the former
and the
latter
might
be owing
to
the
influence
of the
kind
of carrier
gas.
As to
the
activation
energy
of
coke
formation,
it
was
reported
that
for
the
hydrogenation
of
72-butene1}
and
iso-
butene19),
respectively,
the
activation
energies
had
values
of
-3.3
kcal/g-mol
and
1.5
kcal/g-mol.
The
values
of
23.1
kcal/g-mol
and
34.6
kcal/g-mol
were
reported,
respectively,
for
the
dehydrogenation
of n-

butane16)
and
cyclohexane14).
For
the
cracking
of
methylcyclohexane20)
,
the
activation
energy
of
-3.36
kcal/g-mol
was reported.
In
the
present
work,
for
the
activation
energy
of
coke
formation,
the
value
of
12.6
kcal/g-mol
via
isopentenes
and
that
of
-10.6
kcal/g-
mol
via isoprene
were obtained.
The
differences
among
the
values
of the
activation
energy
might
come from
the
complexity
of the
coke
formation
mechanism
for
each
reaction.

Kinetic
parameters
and expression
of ac-
t
ivity
factor
For the
expression
of catalyst
fouling,
several
types
offunction
of coke content
were presented
by Anderson
and
Whitehouse2).
The
lumped
activity
factor,
Eq.
(16-2),
used
in
several
studies
because
of
its
simple
form,
was
shown
to
be
useful
for
less
coke
content.
Froment
and
Bischoff6)
discussed
theoretically
in sim-
ple
reaction
models
the differences
of the
distribution
of
the
reactant
and
the
coke
content
using
the
activity
factor,
Eq.(29).
Morioka
et
al.14)
derived
the
above
activity
factor
by
Poisson
distribution
of
coke
accumu-
lation,
and
used
it
for
cyclohexane
dehydrogenation.
i=exp(-ic)
If
the
decay
constant,
a,
is
small,
Eq.(29)
can
be
re-
duced
to
Eq.(16-2)
or
Eq.(17-2)
by
Taylor's
expan-
sion16).
In
dehydrogenation
of isopentane,
Eqs.(16-2)
and
(17-2)
were
usable
to estimate
the
changes
of con-
centration.
In
the
case
of both
lower
temperature
and
less
coke
content,
it
is
sufficient
to use
Eq.(16-2)
and,
also,
it
may
be
permissible
that
the
reaction
orders,
(p,
q),
are
(1,1)
according
to
Fig.
10.
Recently,
the
lumped
activity
factors
as functions
of process
time
have
been
developed
for
the
design3'23'24)
or
the
optimi-
zation15'18)
of
the
reactor.
Eq.(16-2)
can
be
reduced
to
the
lumped
activity
factor
as a function
of process
time,
but
as
shown
in
Figs.
2-4,
if
there
are
distri-
butionsofcoke
content
in the reactor
length,
the
activi-
ty
factor,
i.e.
Eq.(1
7-2),
is useful
to predict
distribution
of
catalyst
activity
through
the
reactor.
Conclusion
In
isopentane
dehydrogenation
over
chromia-
alumina
catalyst,
the
conversion
of isopentane
and the
yields
of
isopentenes
decreased
rapidly
with
process
time
while
that
of isoprene
did
so very
slowly.
Coke
deposition
on the
catalyst
and
catalystfouling
occurred
in
an integral
catalytic
reactor,
and
axial
coke
distri-
bution
was observed
along
the
reactor.
For isopentane
dehydrogenation
a
kinetic
model
was proposed
in
which
the
main
reaction
was consecutive
and the
sub-
reaction
was parallel.
To
evaluate
distributed
kinetic
parameters
with
catalyst
fouling,
an
algorithm
in-
volving
two calculating
steps
was introduced.
The pa-
rameter
estimation
method
was applicable
to
isopen-
tane
dehydrogenation.
Activity
factors
evaluated
were
different
from
each
other,
so the
fouling
was
selective
aging.
The
activity
factor
was revealed
as a linear
function
of
coke content.

An internal-recycle
catalytic
reactor
is
described
which
can be operated
under
per-
fectly
mixed
conditions.
The
reactor
is
suitable
for
evaluating
intraparticle
mass
transfer
effects
on reaction
rate
and
yield
in
the
consecutive
hydrogenation
of mesityl
oxide
over a copper-chromium
oxide
catalyst.
The
reactor
has
the
advantages
that
accurate
reaction
rates
are
directly
obtained,
and
that
mathematical
formulation
is
simpler
than
with
an integral
reactor.
Effective
diffusivities
are
determined
from
conversion
data
and
compared
with
those
calculated
by
a parallel-pore
model
and a
random-pore
model.
The
effective
diffusivities
predicted
by both
models
closely
agree
with
each
other,
and these
values
are
close
to those
experimentally
determined.
The
tortuosity
factors
determined
from
the
parallel-pore
model
range
from
1.4
to
3.4.
These
values
fall
within
the
range
of
previously
published
values.
The
calculated
conversion
and yield
show relatively
good
agreement
with
the
experimental
results.
Introduction
The
overall
reaction
rate
and
the
selectivity
in
a
catalytic
reaction
within
a porous
solid
are
markedly
influenced
by
the
intraparticle
mass and heat
transfer,
and
a large
number
of studies
have
been
published
on
this
problem17).
Many
of
these,
however,
were con-
cerned
with
rather
simplified
reactionkinetics.
Recent-
ly much attention
has
been
paid
to the
effect
ofintra-
particle
diffusion
on catalytic
reactions
in
which
the
kinetics
is
represented
by
a
rate
equation
of the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood
type
(L-H
type)6'15'16).
How-
ever,
very few papers10'11)
dealt
with
the
selectivity
problems
ofmultiple-reaction
systems
with
the
L-H
type
rate
expression.
Integral
tubular
reactors
are often employed
for ki-
netic studies. However, even if isothermal
conditions
prevail
in an integral
reactor,
the concentration
distri-
butions
along
an axial
direction
as well
as within
the
catalyst
pellet
have to be considered.
This
fact
leads
to
a
complicated
mathematical
formulation.
On the other
hand,
by the
use of a catalytic
reactor
under perfectly
mixed
conditions
the amount of computation
is greatly
reduced,
because
the
concentration
in
the
bulk
fluid
phase
-is uniform
throughout
the
reactor.
Furthermore,
this
type
of reactor
has the advantages
that
point
reaction
rates
of a multiple-reaction
system
are
directly
evaluated
from large
differences

<questions>


Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
