The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be explained based on the given literature, as it does not contain any information about this topic. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of isopentane over a chromia-alumina catalyst and discusses reaction kinetics, coke formation, and catalyst fouling. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism, its four main steps, or analyze the debate regarding the rate-limiting step based on this document. The ongoing scientific interest and controversy surrounding this mechanism are also not addressed in the given text.

基于给定的文献无法解释催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理,因为它不包含有关该主题的任何信息。该文档主要关注异戊烷在氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂上的脱氢反应,并讨论了反应动力学、积碳形成和催化剂失活。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。因此,我无法基于这份文件详细解释该机理、其四个主要步骤,或分析关于速率限制步骤的争论。文中也没有提到围绕这一机理的持续科学兴趣和争议。
