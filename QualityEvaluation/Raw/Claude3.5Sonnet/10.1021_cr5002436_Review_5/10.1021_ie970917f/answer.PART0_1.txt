[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombinative desorption of hydrogen

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step primarily focuses on whether the dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) or the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species (step 2) is the slowest step. In this study, the authors conclude that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step based on deuterium tracing results.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of catalyst surfaces: The heterogeneous nature of catalyst surfaces makes it challenging to generalize findings across different catalytic systems.

2. Diversity of reactants: Different alkanes may exhibit varying behavior on the same catalyst, leading to inconsistent conclusions about the rate-limiting step.

3. Reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step may change depending on temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

4. Advanced analytical techniques: The development of new experimental and computational methods continues to provide fresh insights into the mechanistic details.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for optimizing industrial processes, driving ongoing research and debate.

6. Theoretical implications: The mechanism serves as a model for understanding other catalytic processes, making its elucidation important for broader catalysis research.

The continued study and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its fundamental importance in catalysis and the ongoing challenges in fully understanding complex catalytic processes at the molecular level.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论主要集中在烷烃的解离吸附（步骤1）或吸附烷基物种的脱氢（步骤2）哪一个是最慢的步骤。在这项研究中，作者根据氘示踪结果得出结论，异丁烷的解离吸附是慢步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 催化剂表面的复杂性：催化剂表面的异质性使得难以将研究结果推广到不同的催化体系。

2. 反应物的多样性：不同的烷烃在同一催化剂上可能表现出不同的行为，导致对速率限制步骤的结论不一致。

3. 反应条件：速率限制步骤可能随温度、压力和反应物浓度的变化而改变。

4. 先进的分析技术：新的实验和计算方法的发展不断为机理细节提供新的见解。

5. 工业相关性：理解该机理对优化工业过程至关重要，推动了持续的研究和争论。

6. 理论意义：该机理作为理解其他催化过程的模型，使其阐明对更广泛的催化研究很重要。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了它在催化领域的基础重要性，以及在分子水平上全面理解复杂催化过程的持续挑战。
