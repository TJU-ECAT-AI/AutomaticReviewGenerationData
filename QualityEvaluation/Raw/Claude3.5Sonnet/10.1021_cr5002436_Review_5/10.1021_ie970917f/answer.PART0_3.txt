[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene (e.g., isobutene) from the catalyst surface
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers on whether step 1 (dissociative adsorption) or step 2 (dehydrogenation) is slower. In this study, the authors conclude that dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step based on deuterium tracing results. This aligns with findings from other researchers like Lok et al.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The mechanism involves multiple elementary steps, making it challenging to definitively identify the rate-limiting step across all catalysts and conditions.

2. Catalyst variability: Different catalysts can alter the energetics of individual steps, potentially changing which one is rate-limiting.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations can influence the relative rates of each step.

4. Analytical challenges: Advanced techniques like isotope tracing are required to probe the mechanism at a molecular level.

5. Theoretical interest: The mechanism serves as a model system for understanding heterogeneous catalysis more broadly.

6. Industrial relevance: Improving catalytic dehydrogenation processes has significant economic implications, driving continued research.

7. Evolving analytical capabilities: New experimental and computational tools continually provide fresh insights into the mechanism.

The ongoing study of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflects both its fundamental importance in catalysis and the challenges in fully elucidating complex surface reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃（如异丁烷）在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附烷基物种的脱氢形成吸附烯烃
3. 烯烃（如异丁烯）从催化剂表面脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论集中在步骤1（解离吸附）或步骤2（脱氢）哪个更慢。在本研究中，作者根据氘示踪结果得出结论，异丁烷的解离吸附是慢步骤。这与Lok等人的研究结果一致。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：该机理涉及多个基元步骤，使得难以明确识别所有催化剂和条件下的速率限制步骤。

2. 催化剂可变性：不同的催化剂可以改变各个步骤的能量学，可能改变哪一步是速率限制的。

3. 反应条件：温度、压力和反应物浓度可以影响每个步骤的相对速率。

4. 分析挑战：需要先进的技术如同位素示踪来在分子水平上探测机理。

5. 理论兴趣：该机理作为理解多相催化的模型系统。

6. 工业相关性：改进催化脱氢过程具有重要的经济意义，推动持续研究。

7. 不断发展的分析能力：新的实验和计算工具不断为机理提供新的见解。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究反映了它在催化领域的基础重要性，以及充分阐明复杂表面反应的挑战。
