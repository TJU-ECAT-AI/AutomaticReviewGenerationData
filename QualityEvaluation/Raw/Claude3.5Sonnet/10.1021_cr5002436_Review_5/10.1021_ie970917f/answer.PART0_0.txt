[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Historically, the second step (dehydrogenation) was often considered rate-limiting. However, this study and some others have found evidence that the first step (dissociative adsorption of the alkane) may be rate-limiting instead. 

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. It applies to many important industrial catalytic processes
2. The rate-limiting step can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties
3. Advanced experimental techniques continue to provide new insights
4. Understanding the mechanism at a fundamental level is crucial for catalyst design and optimization
5. There are still some aspects that are not fully understood or agreed upon by researchers

The ongoing research and debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the challenges in definitively determining reaction mechanisms at the molecular level. New analytical methods and computational modeling continue to shed light on the detailed steps involved.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤一直存在争议。historically，第二步（脱氢）通常被认为是速率限制步骤。然而，本研究和其他一些研究发现证据表明第一步（烷烃的解离吸附）可能是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于许多重要的工业催化过程
2. 速率限制步骤可能因反应条件和催化剂性质而异
3. 先进的实验技术不断提供新的见解
4. 从根本上理解该机理对催化剂设计和优化至关重要
5. 仍有一些方面尚未被研究人员完全理解或达成一致

持续的研究和争论突显了多相催化的复杂性，以及在分子水平上确定反应机理的挑战。新的分析方法和计算机模拟继续阐明所涉及的详细步骤。
