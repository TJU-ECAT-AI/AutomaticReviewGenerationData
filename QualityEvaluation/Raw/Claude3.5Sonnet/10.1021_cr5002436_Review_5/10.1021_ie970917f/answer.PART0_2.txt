[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombinative desorption of hydrogen

The debate regarding the rate-limiting step has been ongoing, with different studies proposing various steps as rate-determining. In this particular study, the dissociative adsorption of isobutane (step 1) is considered the slow step based on deuterium tracing results. However, this conclusion may not be universally applicable to all catalytic systems or reaction conditions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of catalytic systems: The mechanism can vary depending on the catalyst, support, and reaction conditions.

2. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods for studying surface reactions continue to provide fresh insights into the mechanism.

3. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in petrochemical and other industries.

4. Theoretical challenges: The mechanism involves multiple elementary steps and intermediates, making it difficult to develop comprehensive models.

5. Ongoing debates: Different research groups often reach conflicting conclusions about the rate-limiting step or the exact nature of surface intermediates.

6. Potential for improvement: A deeper understanding of the mechanism could lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes.

The continued study of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflects its fundamental importance in heterogeneous catalysis and the persistent challenges in fully elucidating complex surface reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理用于描述催化脱氢反应，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的复合脱附

关于限速步骤的争论一直持续，不同的研究提出了各种步骤作为决速步骤。在这项特定研究中，基于氘示踪结果，认为异丁烷的解离吸附（步骤1）是慢步骤。然而，这一结论可能并不适用于所有催化体系或反应条件。

尽管Horiuti-Polanyi机理已经研究了近一个世纪，但它仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 催化体系的复杂性：机理可能因催化剂、载体和反应条件而异。

2. 分析技术的进步：研究表面反应的新方法不断为机理提供新的见解。

3. 在工业应用中的重要性：了解机理对优化石油化工和其他行业的催化过程至关重要。

4. 理论挑战：该机理涉及多个基元步骤和中间体，难以开发全面的模型。

5. 持续的争论：不同的研究小组经常对限速步骤或表面中间体的确切性质得出矛盾的结论。

6. 改进的潜力：对机理的深入了解可能导致更高效的催化剂和过程的开发。

持续研究Horiuti-Polanyi机理反映了它在多相催化中的基础重要性，以及在全面阐明复杂表面反应方面持续存在的挑战。
