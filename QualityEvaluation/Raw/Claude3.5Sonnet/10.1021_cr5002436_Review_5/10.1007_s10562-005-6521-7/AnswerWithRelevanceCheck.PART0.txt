          [1] "Figure 1 shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site."

[2] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "This result is different from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was concluded to be the rate-determining step [21]."

[4] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions typically consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The alkane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.
2. First C-H bond cleavage: One C-H bond breaks, forming an alkyl species bound to the catalyst.
3. Second C-H bond cleavage (β-hydrogen elimination): Another C-H bond breaks, forming the alkene.
4. Desorption: The alkene product desorbs from the catalyst surface, and H2 is formed.

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. The literature provides conflicting evidence:

1. For ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3, the study suggests that ethane adsorption (step 1) is the rate-limiting step.
2. For isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, β-H transfer (step 3) was reported to be rate-determining.
3. Another source proposed that hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr (similar to step 3) is the rate-determining step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of catalytic systems: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to varying rate-limiting steps.
2. Difficulty in direct observation: The transient nature of surface intermediates makes it challenging to study the mechanism in real-time.
3. Relevance to industrial processes: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for optimizing industrial dehydrogenation processes.
4. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods allow for more detailed investigations, potentially revealing new insights.
5. Theoretical modeling: Computational studies can provide new perspectives on the energetics of each step.

The ongoing research and debates surrounding this mechanism highlight the importance of understanding fundamental catalytic processes for both scientific knowledge and industrial applications.

          Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理通常包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：烷烃分子吸附在催化剂表面。
2. 第一个C-H键断裂：一个C-H键断裂，形成与催化剂结合的烷基物种。
3. 第二个C-H键断裂（β-氢消除）：另一个C-H键断裂，形成烯烃。
4. 脱附：烯烃产物从催化剂表面脱附，同时形成H2。

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，目前仍存在争议。文献提供了相互矛盾的证据：

1. 对于Cr/Al2O3上的乙烷脱氢，研究表明乙烷吸附（步骤1）是速率限制步骤。
2. 对于纯Cr2O3上的异丁烷脱氢，有报道称β-H转移（步骤3）是速率决定步骤。
3. 另一个来源提出，烷基向Cr的氢转移（类似于步骤3）是速率决定步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，原因如下：

1. 催化系统的复杂性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤。
2. 直接观察的困难：表面中间体的瞬态性质使得实时研究机理变得具有挑战性。
3. 与工业过程的相关性：理解该机理对优化工业脱氢过程至关重要。
4. 分析技术的进步：新方法允许进行更详细的研究，可能揭示新的见解。
5. 理论建模：计算研究可以为每个步骤的能量学提供新的视角。

围绕这一机理的持续研究和争论突出了理解基本催化过程对科学知识和工业应用的重要性。
