[1] "Figure 1 shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site."

[2] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "This result is different from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was concluded to be the rate-determining step [21]."

The document does not directly discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does describe a similar mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which can be used to explain the concept and ongoing debates.

The mechanism described in the document involves four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethane reacts with an unsaturated Cr3+ center.
2. C-H bond activation: A new O-H group and a Cr-alkyl bond are formed.
3. β-H transfer: Hydrogen transfers from the alkyl to Cr, forming the alkene.
4. Desorption and regeneration: H2 is formed and desorbs, regenerating the Cr3+-O active site.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step is evident in this document. While some studies suggest that β-H transfer is the rate-determining step, the results presented here indicate that ethane adsorption is rate-limiting for the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. This discrepancy highlights why the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

The continued study of this mechanism is important because understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization. Different catalysts and reaction conditions may lead to different rate-limiting steps, which explains the ongoing debate and research in this field. Additionally, as new analytical techniques and theoretical models become available, researchers can gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanism, potentially resolving long-standing controversies and improving catalyst performance.

该文档并未直接讨论Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。然而，它确实描述了一个类似的Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机理，可以用来解释这个概念和正在进行的争论。

文档中描述的机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烷与不饱和的Cr3+中心反应。
2. C-H键活化：形成新的O-H基团和Cr-烷基键。
3. β-H转移：氢从烷基转移到Cr，形成烯烃。
4. 脱附和再生：形成H2并脱附，再生Cr3+-O活性位点。

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论在本文中也有体现。虽然一些研究表明β-H转移是速率决定步骤，但本文提出的结果表明，对于Cr/Al2O3催化剂，乙烷吸附是速率限制步骤。这种差异突出了为什么该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。

继续研究这一机理很重要，因为了解速率限制步骤对于催化剂设计和优化至关重要。不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤，这解释了该领域持续的争论和研究。此外，随着新的分析技术和理论模型的出现，研究人员可以对反应机理有更深入的了解，可能解决长期存在的争议并提高催化剂性能。
