[1] "Figure 1 shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site."

[2] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of a C-H bond, forming an alkyl intermediate
3. β-hydrogen elimination to form the alkene
4. Desorption of the alkene product

The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting continues due to conflicting evidence from different studies. Some researchers suggest β-hydrogen elimination is rate-limiting, while others propose adsorption or desorption as the slowest step. 

The literature provided focuses on a chromium-based catalyst rather than the general Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. It suggests ethane adsorption as the rate-limiting step for Cr/Al2O3, contradicting some previous studies on other catalysts. This highlights the ongoing controversy in the field.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its broad applicability to various catalytic systems
2. The complex interplay between catalyst properties and reaction conditions
3. Challenges in directly observing reaction intermediates
4. Implications for catalyst design and optimization
5. Advances in experimental techniques and computational modeling enabling new insights

Continued research aims to reconcile conflicting results, develop more accurate mechanistic models, and guide the design of improved catalysts for industrially important dehydrogenation processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. C-H键断裂，形成烷基中间体
3. β-氢消除形成烯烃
4. 烯烃产物脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，因为不同研究得出了矛盾的证据。一些研究者认为β-氢消除是速率限制步骤，而其他人则提出吸附或脱附是最慢的步骤。

所提供的文献主要关注铬基催化剂，而不是一般的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。它提出乙烷吸附是Cr/Al2O3催化剂的速率限制步骤，这与之前对其他催化剂的一些研究结果相矛盾。这突出了该领域持续存在的争议。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于各种催化体系
2. 催化剂性质与反应条件之间的复杂相互作用
3. 直接观察反应中间体的挑战
4. 对催化剂设计和优化的影响
5. 实验技术和计算建模的进步使得新的见解成为可能

持续的研究旨在调和矛盾的结果，开发更准确的机理模型，并指导改进工业重要脱氢过程的催化剂设计。
