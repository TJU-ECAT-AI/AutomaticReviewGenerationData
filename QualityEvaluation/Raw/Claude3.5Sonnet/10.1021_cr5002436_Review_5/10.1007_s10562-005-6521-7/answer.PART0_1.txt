[1] "Figure 1 shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site."

[2] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

The literature does not directly discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. However, it does describe a similar mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which can be used to partially address the question.

The mechanism described involves:
1. Adsorption of alkane on a Cr3+ center
2. C-H bond activation forming a Cr-alkyl bond and OH group
3. Hydrogen transfer from alkyl to Cr, forming alkene
4. H2 formation and regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site

There is ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step. The paper initially suggests that hydrogen transfer from alkyl to Cr (step 3) is thought to be rate-determining. However, the authors' experimental results indicate that ethane adsorption (step 1) is actually the rate-limiting step for their Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.

The paper also mentions an alternative "hydridocomplex route" involving ethane adsorption onto a Cr-H site, which adds further complexity to determining the rate-limiting step.

While the literature doesn't explicitly address why this mechanism remains controversial after decades of study, the conflicting results regarding the rate-limiting step suggest that the details of the mechanism are still not fully understood and may depend on the specific catalyst system used. This ongoing uncertainty likely contributes to continued scientific interest in elucidating the precise mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个主要步骤。然而，它确实描述了一个类似的Cr/Al2O3催化剂上乙烷脱氢的机理，这可以用来部分回答这个问题。

所描述的机理包括：
1. 烷烃在Cr3+中心上的吸附
2. C-H键活化，形成Cr-烷基键和OH基
3. 氢从烷基转移到Cr，形成烯烃
4. H2形成和Cr3+-O活性位的再生

关于速率限制步骤仍存在争议。该文章最初提出氢从烷基转移到Cr（步骤3）被认为是速率决定步骤。然而，作者的实验结果表明，对于他们的Cr/Al2O3催化剂，乙烷吸附（步骤1）实际上是速率限制步骤。

该文还提到了一种替代的"氢化物络合物路线"，涉及乙烷在Cr-H位点上的吸附，这进一步增加了确定速率限制步骤的复杂性。

虽然文献没有明确说明为什么这种机理在经过数十年的研究后仍然存在争议，但关于速率限制步骤的矛盾结果表明，该机理的细节仍未完全理解，可能取决于所使用的特定催化剂系统。这种持续的不确定性可能contributes to了对阐明催化脱氢反应精确机理的持续科学兴趣。
