The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, not dehydrogenation as stated in the question, is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on the adsorption and thermal decomposition of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, rather than providing details about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. However, based on the information provided in the text, we can infer some relevant points:

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins is a complex process that has been studied for over a century.

2. There is ongoing debate about the nature of reactive species in olefin hydrogenation on transition-metal surfaces.

3. Both di-σ and π-bonded olefin species have been proposed as intermediates in catalytic reactions.

4. The document mentions the importance of weakly adsorbed π-bonded species in hydrogenation reactions.

5. The rate-limiting step in olefin hydrogenation is generally believed to be hydrogen adsorption.

While these points relate to catalytic hydrogenation, they do not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The ongoing scientific interest and controversy surrounding olefin hydrogenation mechanisms stem from the complexity of the surface processes involved and the difficulty in directly observing reaction intermediates under catalytic conditions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理是针对催化加氢反应的，而非问题中所述的脱氢反应。所给文献并未明确描述该机理。文档主要关注丙烯在Pt(111)表面上的吸附和热分解，而非详细介绍Horiuti-Polanyi机理。然而，根据文本提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些相关要点：

1. 烯烃的催化加氢是一个复杂的过程，已经被研究了一个多世纪。

2. 关于过渡金属表面烯烃加氢反应中活性物种的本质，仍存在争议。

3. 双σ键合和π键合的烯烃物种都被提出可能是催化反应的中间体。

4. 文档提到弱吸附的π键合物种在加氢反应中的重要性。

5. 烯烃加氢反应的限速步骤通常被认为是氢气的吸附。

虽然这些点与催化加氢有关，但它们并未提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的详细解释或其四个主要步骤。烯烃加氢机理持续引起科学界兴趣和争议的原因在于表面过程的复杂性，以及在催化条件下直接观察反应中间体的困难。
