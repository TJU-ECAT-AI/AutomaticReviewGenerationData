The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on the adsorption and thermal conversion of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, but does not provide information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-limiting step. The literature does not contain relevant information to answer this question or discuss why the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

给定的文献中没有描述Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理。该文档主要关注丙烯在Pt(111)表面上的吸附和热转化,但没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其步骤或关于速率限制步骤争论的信息。文献中不包含回答这个问题或讨论为什么该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议话题的相关信息。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on the adsorption and thermal decomposition of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, rather than explaining the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or analyze the debate about its rate-limiting step based on the given information.

However, the literature does mention some relevant aspects of olefin hydrogenation:

1. The text mentions that p-bonded olefins are believed to play a central role in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

2. It discusses the importance of weakly bonded states in hydrogenation, as clean metal surfaces are too reactive and tend to dehydrogenate alkenes to alkylidynes.

3. The document mentions that hydrogen adsorption is generally believed to be the rate-limiting step in olefin hydrogenation processes.

4. The text highlights the ongoing scientific interest in understanding the exact mechanisms of catalytic hydrogenation reactions, including the role of different adsorbed species and surface intermediates.

While these points don't directly explain the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, they do provide some context for the complexity and ongoing research in the field of catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机制对于催化加氢反应的解释在给定的文献中并未直接讨论。该文本主要集中在丙烯在Pt(111)表面上的吸附和热分解，而不是解释Horiuti-Polanyi机制。因此，我无法基于给定信息提供这一机制的详细解释或分析其速率限制步骤的争议。

然而，文献中确实提到了一些与烯烃加氢相关的方面：

1. 文本提到π键合的烯烃被认为在催化加氢反应中起着核心作用。

2. 它讨论了弱键合状态在加氢中的重要性，因为清洁的金属表面反应性太强，倾向于将烯烃脱氢成烷基化物。

3. 文件提到氢气吸附通常被认为是烯烃加氢过程中的速率限制步骤。

4. 文本强调了科学界对理解催化加氢反应确切机制的持续兴趣，包括不同吸附物种和表面中间体的作用。

虽然这些要点并不直接解释Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但它们确实为催化加氢反应领域的复杂性和持续研究提供了一些背景。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, not dehydrogenation as stated in the question, is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on the adsorption and thermal decomposition of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, rather than providing details about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. However, based on the information provided in the text, we can infer some relevant points:

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of olefins is a complex process that has been studied for over a century.

2. There is ongoing debate about the nature of reactive species in olefin hydrogenation on transition-metal surfaces.

3. Both di-σ and π-bonded olefin species have been proposed as intermediates in catalytic reactions.

4. The document mentions the importance of weakly adsorbed π-bonded species in hydrogenation reactions.

5. The rate-limiting step in olefin hydrogenation is generally believed to be hydrogen adsorption.

While these points relate to catalytic hydrogenation, they do not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The ongoing scientific interest and controversy surrounding olefin hydrogenation mechanisms stem from the complexity of the surface processes involved and the difficulty in directly observing reaction intermediates under catalytic conditions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理是针对催化加氢反应的，而非问题中所述的脱氢反应。所给文献并未明确描述该机理。文档主要关注丙烯在Pt(111)表面上的吸附和热分解，而非详细介绍Horiuti-Polanyi机理。然而，根据文本提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些相关要点：

1. 烯烃的催化加氢是一个复杂的过程，已经被研究了一个多世纪。

2. 关于过渡金属表面烯烃加氢反应中活性物种的本质，仍存在争议。

3. 双σ键合和π键合的烯烃物种都被提出可能是催化反应的中间体。

4. 文档提到弱吸附的π键合物种在加氢反应中的重要性。

5. 烯烃加氢反应的限速步骤通常被认为是氢气的吸附。

虽然这些点与催化加氢有关，但它们并未提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的详细解释或其四个主要步骤。烯烃加氢机理持续引起科学界兴趣和争议的原因在于表面过程的复杂性，以及在催化条件下直接观察反应中间体的困难。

Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism, its steps, or the debate about the rate-limiting step based on the information in this document.

However, the literature does mention some related concepts that are relevant to catalytic hydrogenation reactions:

1. The text discusses different adsorption states of propylene on Pt(111), including di-σ and π-bonded species, which are important in understanding surface reactions.

2. It mentions the formation of propylidyne (Pt3≡C-CH2-CH3) from propylene at higher temperatures, which is a common surface intermediate in hydrocarbon reactions on metal surfaces.

3. The document discusses the possibility of weakly adsorbed π-bonded propylene on top of propylidyne layers, which may be relevant to catalytic hydrogenation processes.

4. The text mentions that hydrogen adsorption is generally believed to be the rate-limiting step in olefin hydrogenation processes, although this is not directly related to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

While these points provide some context for understanding surface reactions of hydrocarbons on platinum surfaces, they do not offer enough information to fully explain the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the ongoing debates surrounding it.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论催化加氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制。文本主要集中于丙烯在Pt(111)表面的吸附和热转化，而不是详细介绍Horiuti-Polanyi机制。因此，基于这篇文献中的信息，我无法提供该机制的详细解释、其步骤或关于速率限制步骤的争论。

然而，这篇文献确实提到了一些与催化加氢反应相关的概念：

1. 文本讨论了丙烯在Pt(111)上的不同吸附状态，包括di-σ和π键合物种，这对理解表面反应很重要。

2. 它提到了在较高温度下丙烯形成丙烯基(Pt3≡C-CH2-CH3)，这是金属表面碳氢化合物反应中的常见表面中间体。

3. 文献讨论了在丙烯基层上方弱吸附π键合丙烯的可能性，这可能与催化加氢过程有关。

4. 文本提到，氢气吸附通常被认为是烯烃加氢过程中的速率限制步骤，尽管这与Horiuti-Polanyi机制并不直接相关。

虽然这些点为理解碳氢化合物在铂表面的反应提供了一些背景，但它们并不足以完全解释Horiuti-Polanyi机制或围绕它的持续争论。
