The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not directly discussed in the given literature, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First hydrogen abstraction: One hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed molecule, forming a half-hydrogenated intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen abstraction: Another hydrogen atom is removed, forming the dehydrogenated product still adsorbed to the surface.

4. Desorption: The dehydrogenated product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism has been ongoing for decades. Some researchers argue that the first or second hydrogen abstraction step is rate-limiting, while others suggest that the desorption step may be rate-determining under certain conditions.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of real catalytic systems: Real catalysts often have multiple types of active sites and complex surface structures, making it challenging to isolate and study individual steps.

2. Dependence on reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step may change depending on temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

3. Advances in characterization techniques: New analytical methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface processes, sometimes challenging previous assumptions.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.

5. Theoretical advancements: Improvements in computational chemistry allow for more accurate modeling of reaction steps, sometimes leading to new interpretations of experimental data.

The ongoing debate and research into the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism highlight the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the continuous effort to improve our understanding of these fundamental processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理虽然在给定的文献中没有直接讨论，但包含四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：反应分子吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 第一次氢原子提取：从吸附分子中移除一个氢原子，形成半氢化中间体。

3. 第二次氢原子提取：再移除一个氢原子，形成仍吸附在表面的脱氢产物。

4. 脱附：脱氢产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于该机理中速率限制步骤的争论已持续数十年。一些研究者认为第一次或第二次氢原子提取是速率限制步骤，而其他人则认为在某些条件下脱附步骤可能是速率决定步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 真实催化系统的复杂性：真实催化剂通常具有多种类型的活性位点和复杂的表面结构，使得分离和研究单个步骤变得具有挑战性。

2. 对反应条件的依赖性：速率限制步骤可能会随温度、压力和反应物浓度的变化而改变。

3. 表征技术的进步：新的分析方法不断为表面过程提供新的见解，有时会挑战先前的假设。

4. 在工业应用中的重要性：理解该机理对设计更高效的催化剂用于各种工业过程至关重要。

5. 理论进展：计算化学的改进使得对反应步骤的建模更加准确，有时会导致对实验数据的新解释。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not directly discussed in the given literature, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The alkane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First C-H bond cleavage: One C-H bond is broken, forming an alkyl intermediate and a surface-bound hydrogen atom.

3. Second C-H bond cleavage: Another C-H bond is broken, forming the alkene and a second surface-bound hydrogen atom.
