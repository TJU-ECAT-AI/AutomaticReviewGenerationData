The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on a different proposed mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethane over chromium-silica catalysts, involving CH activation, β-H transfer, and regeneration of the chromium site. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four steps. The literature also does not discuss any ongoing debate about rate-limiting steps in this particular mechanism, nor why it remains controversial after long study. As such, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

给定的文献中没有描述Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。该文档主要关注在铬-硅胶催化剂上乙烷脱氢的一种不同的提议机理,涉及CH键活化、β-H转移和铬位点的再生。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个步骤。文献也没有讨论关于该特定机理中速率限制步骤的任何持续争论,也没有解释为什么在长期研究后它仍然存在争议。因此,仅基于本文档提供的信息无法完整回答这个问题。
