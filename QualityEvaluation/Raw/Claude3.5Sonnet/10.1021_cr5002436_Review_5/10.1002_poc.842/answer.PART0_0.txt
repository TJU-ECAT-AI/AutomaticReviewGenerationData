The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on a different proposed mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethane over chromium-silica catalysts. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The literature also does not discuss any ongoing debate about which step in this mechanism is rate-limiting, nor does it address why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains controversial after nearly a century of study. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism based on the given text.

给定的文献中没有明确描述Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。该文档主要关注铬-硅胶催化剂上乙烷脱氢的另一种提议机理。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个主要步骤。文献也没有讨论关于该机理中哪一步是速率限制步骤的任何持续争论，也没有说明为什么Horiuti-Polanyi机理在近一个世纪的研究后仍然存在争议。因此，我无法根据给定的文本提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的详细解释或分析。
