The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on a different proposed mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethane over chromium-silica catalysts. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The literature also does not discuss any ongoing debate about which step in this mechanism is rate-limiting, nor does it address why the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains controversial after nearly a century of study. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism based on the given text.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on a different dehydrogenation mechanism for ethane over chromium-silica catalysts, not the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step based on the information in this document.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on a different proposed mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethane over chromium-silica catalysts, involving CH activation, β-H transfer, and regeneration of the chromium site. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four steps. The literature also does not discuss any ongoing debate about rate-limiting steps in this particular mechanism, nor why it remains controversial after long study. As such, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

给定的文献中没有描述催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注铬-二氧化硅催化剂上乙烷脱氢的不同机理。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个步骤。文献讨论了涉及C-H活化、β-氢转移和铬位点再生的替代机理，但这些与Horiuti-Polanyi机理不对应。因此，我无法根据给定的文本详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理或讨论关于其速率限制步骤的争论。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, which focuses on dehydrogenation of ethane over chromium-silica catalysts. The document does not provide information about the four main steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or debates regarding its rate-limiting step. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of this mechanism based solely on the information in the given text.

However, the literature does discuss a related dehydrogenation mechanism for ethane over chromium catalysts. This mechanism involves:

1. C-H activation of ethane through σ-bond metathesis
2. β-H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene
3. Regeneration of the chromium site with evolution of H2

The document indicates there is debate about which step is rate-limiting, with calculations suggesting β-H transfer (step 2) may be rate-determining in some cases. The text also proposes an alternative mechanism involving C-H activation at a hydridochromium complex.

While not directly addressing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, this research demonstrates that catalytic dehydrogenation mechanisms remain an active area of study and debate in catalysis science, as researchers work to elucidate the detailed steps and identify rate-determining factors for different catalyst systems.

给定的文献没有明确讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制，而是集中讨论了铬-硅胶催化剂上乙烷的脱氢作用。文档没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制的四个主要步骤或其速率限制步骤争论的信息。因此，我无法仅根据给定文本中的信息提供对这种机制的详细解释或分析。

然而，该文献确实讨论了铬催化剂上乙烷脱氢的相关机制。这种机制包括：

1. 通过σ键复分解实现乙烷的C-H活化
2. β-H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯
3. 伴随着H2的释放，再生铬位点

文档指出，对于哪一步是速率限制步骤存在争议，计算结果表明在某些情况下β-H转移（步骤2）可能是速率决定步骤。文本还提出了一种涉及氢化铬络合物上C-H活化的替代机制。

虽然没有直接讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制，但这项研究表明，催化脱氢机制仍然是催化科学中一个活跃的研究和争论领域，因为研究人员正在努力阐明不同催化剂系统的详细步骤并确定速率决定因素。
