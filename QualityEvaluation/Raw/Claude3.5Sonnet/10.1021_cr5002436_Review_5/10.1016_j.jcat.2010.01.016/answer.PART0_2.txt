The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on ethane dehydrogenation over Pt and PtSn catalysts, but does not provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss its four main steps. The literature also does not mention any ongoing debate about the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains controversial. To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism would be needed.

文献中没有明确描述催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注Pt和PtSn催化剂上的乙烷脱氢,但没有详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理或讨论其四个主要步骤。文献也没有提到关于速率限制步骤的任何持续争论,或者为什么这种机制仍然存在争议。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理的资料。
