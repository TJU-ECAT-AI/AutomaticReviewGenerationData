The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given literature. However, I can provide a general explanation of this mechanism and its significance:

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, describes the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. It consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First hydrogen transfer: One hydrogen atom is transferred between the adsorbed molecule and the catalyst surface.

3. Second hydrogen transfer: A second hydrogen atom is transferred, completing the addition or removal of hydrogen.

4. Desorption: The product molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting, with some researchers arguing it's the first hydrogen transfer, while others suggest it's the second transfer or even the adsorption/desorption steps.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The actual process can be more complex than the simplified four-step model, involving multiple intermediate states.

2. Catalyst dependence: Different catalysts can alter the energetics of each step, potentially changing the rate-limiting step.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations can influence which step becomes rate-limiting.

4. Advanced analytical techniques: Modern surface science and computational methods continue to provide new insights into the molecular-level details of the mechanism.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding and optimizing this mechanism is crucial for many industrial processes involving hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

The ongoing research and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism highlight the importance of continually refining our understanding of fundamental catalytic processes to improve industrial applications and develop new catalytic technologies.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理是描述催化氢化和脱氢反应的一种机制，虽然给定的文献中没有直接讨论，但我可以提供这个机理的一般性解释及其重要性：

Horiuti-Polanyi机理由Horiuti和Polanyi于1934年提出，用于描述不饱和烃类的催化氢化和脱氢过程。它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：反应物分子吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 第一次氢转移：一个氢原子在吸附分子和催化剂表面之间转移。

3. 第二次氢转移：第二个氢原子转移，完成氢的加成或脱除。

4. 脱附：产物分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究者认为是第一次氢转移，而其他人则认为是第二次转移，甚至是吸附/脱附步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：实际过程可能比简化的四步模型更为复杂，涉及多个中间状态。

2. 催化剂依赖性：不同的催化剂可以改变每个步骤的能量学，可能改变速率限制步骤。

3. 反应条件：温度、压力和反应物浓度可以影响哪个步骤成为速率限制步骤。

4. 先进的分析技术：现代表面科学和计算方法不断为机理的分子水平细节提供新的见解。

5. 工业相关性：理解和优化这个机理对许多涉及氢化和脱氢反应的工业过程至关重要。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论突显了不断完善我们对基本催化过程理解的重要性，以改进工业应用并开发新的催化技术。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on ethane dehydrogenation over Pt and PtSn catalysts, but does not provide details about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism specifically. 

However, based on the information provided in the literature, we can extend our answer to describe a related mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation:

The mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation described in the document involves four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5S species on the catalyst surface.
2. Dehydrogenation of C2H5S to form adsorbed C2H4S2 species, either through direct H abstraction or reaction with adsorbed H.
3. Desorption of C2H4 (ethene) from the surface.
4. Recombination and desorption of H2.

The document does not explicitly state which step is rate-limiting. However, it suggests that the presence of adsorbed hydrogen can promote the dehydrogenation of C2H5S species, indicating that this step may be important for determining the overall reaction rate.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its complexity and the various side reactions that can occur, such as the formation of methane and coke. The effects of catalyst composition (e.g., addition of Sn to Pt) and reaction conditions (e.g., H2/C2H6 ratio) on the reaction pathways and product selectivity are still being investigated to optimize the catalytic process for industrial applications.

文献中没有直接讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注Pt和PtSn催化剂上的乙烷脱氢,但没有具体提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的细节。

然而,根据文献提供的信息,我们可以扩展回答,描述一个相关的乙烷脱氢机理:

文档中描述的乙烷脱氢机理包括四个主要步骤:

1. 乙烷的解离吸附,在催化剂表面形成C2H5S物种。
2. C2H5S脱氢形成吸附的C2H4S2物种,可通过直接H抽取或与吸附H反应。
3. C2H4(乙烯)从表面脱附。
4. H2的重组和脱附。

文档没有明确指出哪一步是速率限制步骤。但是,它表明吸附氢的存在可以促进C2H5S物种的脱氢,这表明这一步骤可能对决定整体反应速率很重要。

由于该机理的复杂性以及可能发生的各种副反应(如甲烷和焦炭的形成),它仍然是科学研究的一个热点话题。催化剂组成(例如,向Pt中添加Sn)和反应条件(例如,H2/C2H6比率)对反应途径和产物选择性的影响仍在研究中,以优化工业应用的催化过程。
