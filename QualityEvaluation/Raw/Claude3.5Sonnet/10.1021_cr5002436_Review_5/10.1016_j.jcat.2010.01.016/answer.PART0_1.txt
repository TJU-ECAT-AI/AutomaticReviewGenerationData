The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on ethane dehydrogenation over Pt and PtSn catalysts, but does not provide details about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism specifically. 

However, based on the information provided in the literature, we can extend our answer to describe a related mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation:

The mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation described in the document involves four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of ethane to form C2H5S species on the catalyst surface.
2. Dehydrogenation of C2H5S to form adsorbed C2H4S2 species, either through direct H abstraction or reaction with adsorbed H.
3. Desorption of C2H4 (ethene) from the surface.
4. Recombination and desorption of H2.

The document does not explicitly state which step is rate-limiting. However, it suggests that the presence of adsorbed hydrogen can promote the dehydrogenation of C2H5S species, indicating that this step may be important for determining the overall reaction rate.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest due to its complexity and the various side reactions that can occur, such as the formation of methane and coke. The effects of catalyst composition (e.g., addition of Sn to Pt) and reaction conditions (e.g., H2/C2H6 ratio) on the reaction pathways and product selectivity are still being investigated to optimize the catalytic process for industrial applications.

文献中没有直接讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注Pt和PtSn催化剂上的乙烷脱氢,但没有具体提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的细节。

然而,根据文献提供的信息,我们可以扩展回答,描述一个相关的乙烷脱氢机理:

文档中描述的乙烷脱氢机理包括四个主要步骤:

1. 乙烷的解离吸附,在催化剂表面形成C2H5S物种。
2. C2H5S脱氢形成吸附的C2H4S2物种,可通过直接H抽取或与吸附H反应。
3. C2H4(乙烯)从表面脱附。
4. H2的重组和脱附。

文档没有明确指出哪一步是速率限制步骤。但是,它表明吸附氢的存在可以促进C2H5S物种的脱氢,这表明这一步骤可能对决定整体反应速率很重要。

由于该机理的复杂性以及可能发生的各种副反应(如甲烷和焦炭的形成),它仍然是科学研究的一个热点话题。催化剂组成(例如,向Pt中添加Sn)和反应条件(例如,H2/C2H6比率)对反应途径和产物选择性的影响仍在研究中,以优化工业应用的催化过程。
