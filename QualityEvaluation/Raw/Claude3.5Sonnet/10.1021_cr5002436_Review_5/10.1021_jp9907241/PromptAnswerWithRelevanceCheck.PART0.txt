[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

[4] "The reason the π-bonded ethylene has been detected by SFG but not by IRAS under similar condition is probably attributed to the observations of different species."

[5] "If di-σ-bonded ethylene is a precursor of the rate-determining step, the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene may reflect the reaction rate. The rate of hydrogenation over Pt(111) is not related to the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene and the di-σ-bonded ethylene is not a precursor in front of the activation barrier of the hydrogenation reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen and alkene on the catalyst surface
2. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the alkene, forming an alkyl intermediate
3. Addition of a second hydrogen atom to form the alkane product  
4. Desorption of the alkane product

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Initially, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that hydrogen activation and/or hydrogenation of the alkyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, more recent studies have questioned this.

The mechanism remains controversial despite decades of study for several reasons:

1. Difficulty in directly observing reaction intermediates under catalytic conditions
2. Conflicting experimental evidence from different spectroscopic techniques 
3. Complexity of the reaction on real catalyst surfaces with multiple adsorption sites
4. Challenges in reconciling surface science studies with high-pressure catalytic data
5. Ongoing debates about the nature and role of adsorbed alkene species

Recent work has shown that neither di-σ-bonded nor π-bonded ethylene coverage correlates with hydrogenation rates on Pt catalysts, suggesting the rate-determining step may not involve these species directly. The activation of hydrogen or surface diffusion processes may play a more important role than previously thought.

Overall, while the general Horiuti-Polanyi framework remains useful, many mechanistic details are still actively debated. Continuing improvements in surface characterization techniques under reaction conditions will likely be needed to fully resolve these long-standing questions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢气和烯烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. 一个氢原子加到烯烃上，形成烷基中间体
3. 第二个氢原子加上形成烷烃产物
4. 烷烃产物脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤一直存在争议。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢活化和/或烷基中间体的氢化是速率决定步骤。然而，最近的研究对此提出了质疑。

尽管研究了几十年，该机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 难以在催化条件下直接观察反应中间体
2. 不同光谱技术得出的实验证据相互矛盾
3. 实际催化剂表面存在多个吸附位点，反应复杂
4. 难以调和表面科学研究与高压催化数据
5. 关于吸附烯烃物种的性质和作用的争论仍在继续

最近的工作表明，在Pt催化剂上，无论是di-σ键合还是π键合的乙烯覆盖度都与氢化速率无关，这表明速率决定步骤可能不直接涉及这些物种。氢的活化或表面扩散过程可能比之前认为的更重要。

总的来说，虽然Horiuti-Polanyi框架仍然有用，但许多机理细节仍在积极讨论中。要完全解决这些长期存在的问题，可能还需要在反应条件下不断改进表面表征技术。

[3] "The present authors have, on the other hand, examined the behavior of π-bonded ethylene in the presence of 103 Pa of ethylene using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), and revealed the presence of the π-bonded ethylene on the surface at only below 180 K."

[4] "Both di-σ-bonded and π-bonded ethylene are concluded not to be the precursor of the rate-determining step of hydrogenation, although the authors cannot completely exclude the possibility of the presence of IRAS-undetectable species on the surface."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface
2. Adsorption of the alkene (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to form the final alkane product

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step stems from conflicting experimental evidence. Initially, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that either hydrogen activation or the final hydrogenation step was rate-limiting. However, subsequent studies have suggested various possibilities, including alkene adsorption or the first hydrogen addition step.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface chemistry: The interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces are complex and can vary depending on conditions.

2. Difficulty in directly observing intermediates: Many proposed intermediates are short-lived and challenging to detect experimentally.

3. Variation across catalysts and conditions: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-limiting steps.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New spectroscopic and microscopic methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface processes.

5. Importance for industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, which are widely used in industry.

The literature provided shows that even with advanced techniques like IRAS, there is still uncertainty about the exact nature of adsorbed species and their role in the rate-determining step. This ongoing research demonstrates the continued relevance and complexity of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in catalysis studies.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢气在催化剂表面吸附
2. 烯烃（如乙烯）在催化剂表面吸附
3. 加入一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体（如乙基）
4. 加入第二个氢原子形成最终的烷烃产物

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论源于相互矛盾的实验证据。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢气活化或最后的氢化步骤是速率限制步骤。然而，后续研究提出了各种可能性，包括烯烃吸附或第一个氢原子加成步骤。

尽管研究近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面化学的复杂性：吸附质和催化剂表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且可能随条件而变化。

2. 直接观察中间体的困难：许多提出的中间体寿命短暂，难以通过实验检测。

3. 催化剂和条件的变化：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤。

4. 分析技术的进步：新的光谱和显微方法不断为表面过程提供新的见解。

5. 工业应用的重要性：理解该机理对设计更高效的氢化反应催化剂至关重要，而这些反应在工业中广泛使用。

提供的文献显示，即使使用像IRAS这样的先进技术，关于吸附物种的确切性质及其在速率决定步骤中的作用仍存在不确定性。这项持续的研究表明了Horiuti-Polanyi机理在催化研究中的持续相关性和复杂性。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface
2. Adsorption of the unsaturated hydrocarbon (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the adsorbed hydrocarbon to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to complete the hydrogenation

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. Historically, the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate were proposed as rate-determining. However, more recent studies suggest the activation of hydrogen may play an important role, while the rate appears independent of ethylene coverage.

This mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual process likely involves multiple steps and intermediates that are challenging to observe directly.

2. Dependence on reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step may change based on temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

3. Advances in experimental techniques: New methods allow for more detailed observations of surface species and reaction kinetics, sometimes yielding conflicting results.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for improving catalysts and reaction efficiency in many industrial processes.

5. Theoretical interest: The mechanism serves as a model system for understanding heterogeneous catalysis more broadly.

The continued study and debate around this mechanism highlight the challenges in fully understanding complex surface reactions and the importance of ongoing research in catalysis.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkene (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst 
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to form an alkyl intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to form the alkane product (e.g. ethane)

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Originally, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that either hydrogen activation or hydrogenation of the alkyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, this remains controversial nearly a century later.

The quotes suggest that on Pt(111), the rate is not related to coverage of adsorbed ethylene species like di-σ-bonded ethylene. Instead, hydrogen activation may play an important role, with the rate being independent of ethylene coverage. 

This mechanism remains of scientific interest because:

1. The rate-limiting step is still debated and may vary for different catalysts/conditions
2. Understanding it is crucial for improving catalytic processes
3. Modern surface science techniques allow new insights into the elementary steps
4. It serves as a model system for studying more complex catalytic reactions

The ongoing controversy stems from the difficulty in directly observing short-lived intermediates and elementary steps under reaction conditions. Different experimental techniques can give seemingly contradictory results, leading to continued debate about mechanistic details even for this relatively simple reaction.

3. 添加一个氢原子形成烷基中间体（如乙基）
4. 添加第二个氢原子形成烷烃产物（如乙烷）

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢活化或烷基中间体的氢化是速率决定步骤。然而，近一个世纪后，这仍然存在争议。

引文表明，在Pt(111)上，反应速率与吸附的乙烯物种（如二-σ键合乙烯）的覆盖度无关。相反，氢的活化可能起重要作用，反应速率与乙烯覆盖度无关。

这种机理仍然具有科学意义，因为：

1. 速率限制步骤仍有争议，可能因催化剂/条件不同而异
2. 理解它对改进催化过程至关重要
3. 现代表面科学技术可以对基元步骤提供新的见解
4. 它作为研究更复杂催化反应的模型系统

持续的争议源于难以在反应条件下直接观察短寿命中间体和基元步骤。不同的实验技术可能会得出看似矛盾的结果，导致即使对这种相对简单的反应，关于机理细节的争论仍在继续。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen and olefin on the catalyst surface
2. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the adsorbed olefin, forming a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
3. Addition of a second hydrogen atom to form the fully hydrogenated product 
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Horiuti and Polanyi originally proposed that hydrogen activation and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, more recent studies have suggested hydrogen activation may be the key rate-limiting step, independent of ethylene coverage.

This mechanism remains controversial after nearly 100 years of study for several reasons:
1. The difficulty in directly observing short-lived surface intermediates under reaction conditions
2. The complex interplay between adsorbates, surface structure, and reaction conditions
3. Differences between model catalyst systems and industrial catalysts
4. Advances in surface science techniques allowing new insights
5. The fundamental importance of this reaction as a model catalytic system

Ongoing research aims to definitively identify rate-limiting steps and reaction intermediates to guide catalyst design. The persistence of debate highlights the complexity of even seemingly simple catalytic reactions.
