[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene,3 and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The activation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of ethylene may play an important role in the ethylene hydrogenation under the catalytic condition, 24 and the rate of hydrogenation is probably independent of the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen and olefin on the catalyst surface
2. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the adsorbed olefin, forming a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
3. Addition of a second hydrogen atom to form the fully hydrogenated product 
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Horiuti and Polanyi originally proposed that hydrogen activation and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, more recent studies have suggested hydrogen activation may be the key rate-limiting step, independent of ethylene coverage.

This mechanism remains controversial after nearly 100 years of study for several reasons:
1. The difficulty in directly observing short-lived surface intermediates under reaction conditions
2. The complex interplay between adsorbates, surface structure, and reaction conditions
3. Differences between model catalyst systems and industrial catalysts
4. Advances in surface science techniques allowing new insights
5. The fundamental importance of this reaction as a model catalytic system

Ongoing research aims to definitively identify rate-limiting steps and reaction intermediates to guide catalyst design. The persistence of debate highlights the complexity of even seemingly simple catalytic reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢气和烯烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. 一个氢原子加到吸附的烯烃上,形成半氢化中间体(如乙基)
3. 第二个氢原子加入形成完全氢化产物
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤仍存在争议。Horiuti和Polanyi最初提出氢活化和/或乙基中间体的氢化是速率决定步骤。然而,最近的研究表明氢活化可能是关键的速率限制步骤,与乙烯覆盖度无关。

这种机理在近100年的研究后仍然存在争议,原因如下:
1. 难以在反应条件下直接观察短寿命表面中间体
2. 吸附物、表面结构和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用
3. 模型催化剂系统与工业催化剂之间的差异
4. 表面科学技术的进步带来新的见解
5. 这种反应作为模型催化系统的基础重要性

持续的研究旨在明确识别速率限制步骤和反应中间体,以指导催化剂设计。争论的持续突显了即使看似简单的催化反应也具有复杂性。
