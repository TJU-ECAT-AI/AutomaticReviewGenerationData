[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

[4] "The reason the π-bonded ethylene has been detected by SFG but not by IRAS under similar condition is probably attributed to the observations of different species."

[5] "If di-σ-bonded ethylene is a precursor of the rate-determining step, the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene may reflect the reaction rate. The rate of hydrogenation over Pt(111) is not related to the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene and the di-σ-bonded ethylene is not a precursor in front of the activation barrier of the hydrogenation reaction."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen and alkene on the catalyst surface
2. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the alkene, forming an alkyl intermediate
3. Addition of a second hydrogen atom to form the alkane product  
4. Desorption of the alkane product

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Initially, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that hydrogen activation and/or hydrogenation of the alkyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, more recent studies have questioned this.

The mechanism remains controversial despite decades of study for several reasons:

1. Difficulty in directly observing reaction intermediates under catalytic conditions
2. Conflicting experimental evidence from different spectroscopic techniques 
3. Complexity of the reaction on real catalyst surfaces with multiple adsorption sites
4. Challenges in reconciling surface science studies with high-pressure catalytic data
5. Ongoing debates about the nature and role of adsorbed alkene species

Recent work has shown that neither di-σ-bonded nor π-bonded ethylene coverage correlates with hydrogenation rates on Pt catalysts, suggesting the rate-determining step may not involve these species directly. The activation of hydrogen or surface diffusion processes may play a more important role than previously thought.

Overall, while the general Horiuti-Polanyi framework remains useful, many mechanistic details are still actively debated. Continuing improvements in surface characterization techniques under reaction conditions will likely be needed to fully resolve these long-standing questions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢气和烯烃在催化剂表面吸附
2. 一个氢原子加到烯烃上，形成烷基中间体
3. 第二个氢原子加上形成烷烃产物
4. 烷烃产物脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤一直存在争议。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢活化和/或烷基中间体的氢化是速率决定步骤。然而，最近的研究对此提出了质疑。

尽管研究了几十年，该机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 难以在催化条件下直接观察反应中间体
2. 不同光谱技术得出的实验证据相互矛盾
3. 实际催化剂表面存在多个吸附位点，反应复杂
4. 难以调和表面科学研究与高压催化数据
5. 关于吸附烯烃物种的性质和作用的争论仍在继续

最近的工作表明，在Pt催化剂上，无论是di-σ键合还是π键合的乙烯覆盖度都与氢化速率无关，这表明速率决定步骤可能不直接涉及这些物种。氢的活化或表面扩散过程可能比之前认为的更重要。

总的来说，虽然Horiuti-Polanyi框架仍然有用，但许多机理细节仍在积极讨论中。要完全解决这些长期存在的问题，可能还需要在反应条件下不断改进表面表征技术。
