[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The absence of the band due to π-bonded ethylene under the hydrogenation conditions at 220320 K clearly indicates that the coverage of π-bonded ethylene under the conditions is less than one tenth of the saturation coverage if it is present on the surface."

[4] "The activation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of ethylene may play an important role in the ethylene hydrogenation under the catalytic condition, and the rate of hydrogenation is probably independent of the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface
2. Adsorption of the unsaturated hydrocarbon (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the adsorbed hydrocarbon to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to complete the hydrogenation

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. Historically, the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate were proposed as rate-determining. However, more recent studies suggest the activation of hydrogen may play an important role, while the rate appears independent of ethylene coverage.

This mechanism remains a topic of interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual process likely involves multiple steps and intermediates that are challenging to observe directly.

2. Dependence on reaction conditions: The rate-limiting step may change based on temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

3. Advances in experimental techniques: New methods allow for more detailed observations of surface species and reaction kinetics, sometimes yielding conflicting results.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for improving catalysts and reaction efficiency in many industrial processes.

5. Theoretical interest: The mechanism serves as a model system for understanding heterogeneous catalysis more broadly.

The continued study and debate around this mechanism highlight the challenges in fully understanding complex surface reactions and the importance of ongoing research in catalysis.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢在催化剂表面吸附
2. 不饱和烃（如乙烯）在催化剂表面吸附
3. 一个氢原子加到吸附的烃上形成半氢化中间体（如乙基）
4. 第二个氢原子加入完成氢化

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，目前仍存在争议。历史上，氢的活化和/或乙基中间体的氢化被认为是速率决定步骤。然而，最近的研究表明，氢的活化可能起重要作用，而反应速率似乎与乙烯覆盖度无关。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是一个备受关注和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：实际过程可能涉及多个难以直接观察的步骤和中间体。

2. 对反应条件的依赖性：速率限制步骤可能随温度、压力和催化剂性质而变化。

3. 实验技术的进步：新方法允许对表面物种和反应动力学进行更详细的观察，有时会产生相互矛盾的结果。

4. 在工业应用中的重要性：了解该机理对于改进许多工业过程中的催化剂和反应效率至关重要。

5. 理论兴趣：该机理作为理解更广泛的多相催化的模型系统。

对这一机理的持续研究和争论突出了充分理解复杂表面反应的挑战，以及催化研究持续进行的重要性。
