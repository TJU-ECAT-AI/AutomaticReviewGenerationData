[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene,"

[3] "If di-σ-bonded ethylene is a precursor of the rate-determining step, the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene may reflect the reaction rate. The rate of hydrogenation over Pt(111) is not related to the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene and the di-σ-bonded ethylene is not a precursor in front of the activation barrier of the hydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The activation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of ethylene may play an important role in the ethylene hydrogenation under the catalytic condition, and the rate of hydrogenation is probably independent of the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkene (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst 
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to form an alkyl intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to form the alkane product (e.g. ethane)

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Originally, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that either hydrogen activation or hydrogenation of the alkyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, this remains controversial nearly a century later.

The quotes suggest that on Pt(111), the rate is not related to coverage of adsorbed ethylene species like di-σ-bonded ethylene. Instead, hydrogen activation may play an important role, with the rate being independent of ethylene coverage. 

This mechanism remains of scientific interest because:

1. The rate-limiting step is still debated and may vary for different catalysts/conditions
2. Understanding it is crucial for improving catalytic processes
3. Modern surface science techniques allow new insights into the elementary steps
4. It serves as a model system for studying more complex catalytic reactions

The ongoing controversy stems from the difficulty in directly observing short-lived intermediates and elementary steps under reaction conditions. Different experimental techniques can give seemingly contradictory results, leading to continued debate about mechanistic details even for this relatively simple reaction.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烯烃（如乙烯）在催化剂表面吸附
2. 氢在催化剂上解离吸附
3. 添加一个氢原子形成烷基中间体（如乙基）
4. 添加第二个氢原子形成烷烃产物（如乙烷）

关于哪个步骤是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢活化或烷基中间体的氢化是速率决定步骤。然而，近一个世纪后，这仍然存在争议。

引文表明，在Pt(111)上，反应速率与吸附的乙烯物种（如二-σ键合乙烯）的覆盖度无关。相反，氢的活化可能起重要作用，反应速率与乙烯覆盖度无关。

这种机理仍然具有科学意义，因为：

1. 速率限制步骤仍有争议，可能因催化剂/条件不同而异
2. 理解它对改进催化过程至关重要
3. 现代表面科学技术可以对基元步骤提供新的见解
4. 它作为研究更复杂催化反应的模型系统

持续的争议源于难以在反应条件下直接观察短寿命中间体和基元步骤。不同的实验技术可能会得出看似矛盾的结果，导致即使对这种相对简单的反应，关于机理细节的争论仍在继续。
