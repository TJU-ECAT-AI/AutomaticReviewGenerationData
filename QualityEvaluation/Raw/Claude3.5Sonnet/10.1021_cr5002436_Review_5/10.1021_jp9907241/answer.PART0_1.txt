[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The present authors have, on the other hand, examined the behavior of π-bonded ethylene in the presence of 103 Pa of ethylene using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), and revealed the presence of the π-bonded ethylene on the surface at only below 180 K."

[4] "Both di-σ-bonded and π-bonded ethylene are concluded not to be the precursor of the rate-determining step of hydrogenation, although the authors cannot completely exclude the possibility of the presence of IRAS-undetectable species on the surface."

[5] "The activation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of ethylene may play an important role in the ethylene hydrogenation under the catalytic condition, and the rate of hydrogenation is probably independent of the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface
2. Adsorption of the alkene (e.g. ethylene) on the catalyst surface
3. Addition of one hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate (e.g. ethyl)
4. Addition of the second hydrogen atom to form the final alkane product

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step stems from conflicting experimental evidence. Initially, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that either hydrogen activation or the final hydrogenation step was rate-limiting. However, subsequent studies have suggested various possibilities, including alkene adsorption or the first hydrogen addition step.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface chemistry: The interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces are complex and can vary depending on conditions.

2. Difficulty in directly observing intermediates: Many proposed intermediates are short-lived and challenging to detect experimentally.

3. Variation across catalysts and conditions: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-limiting steps.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New spectroscopic and microscopic methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface processes.

5. Importance for industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, which are widely used in industry.

The literature provided shows that even with advanced techniques like IRAS, there is still uncertainty about the exact nature of adsorbed species and their role in the rate-determining step. This ongoing research demonstrates the continued relevance and complexity of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism in catalysis studies.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢气在催化剂表面吸附
2. 烯烃（如乙烯）在催化剂表面吸附
3. 加入一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体（如乙基）
4. 加入第二个氢原子形成最终的烷烃产物

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论源于相互矛盾的实验证据。最初，Horiuti和Polanyi提出氢气活化或最后的氢化步骤是速率限制步骤。然而，后续研究提出了各种可能性，包括烯烃吸附或第一个氢原子加成步骤。

尽管研究近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面化学的复杂性：吸附质和催化剂表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且可能随条件而变化。

2. 直接观察中间体的困难：许多提出的中间体寿命短暂，难以通过实验检测。

3. 催化剂和条件的变化：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤。

4. 分析技术的进步：新的光谱和显微方法不断为表面过程提供新的见解。

5. 工业应用的重要性：理解该机理对设计更高效的氢化反应催化剂至关重要，而这些反应在工业中广泛使用。

提供的文献显示，即使使用像IRAS这样的先进技术，关于吸附物种的确切性质及其在速率决定步骤中的作用仍存在不确定性。这项持续的研究表明了Horiuti-Polanyi机理在催化研究中的持续相关性和复杂性。
