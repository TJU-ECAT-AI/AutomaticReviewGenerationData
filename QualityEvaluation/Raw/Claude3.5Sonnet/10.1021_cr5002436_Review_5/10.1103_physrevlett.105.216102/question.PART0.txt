R30 graphene commensurate with a Pt(111) substrate. A
combination of experimental techniques with ab initio density functional theory indicates that this
structure is related to a reconstruction at the Pt surface, consisting of an ordered vacancy network formed
in the outermost Pt layer and a graphene layer covalently bound to the Pt substrate. The formation of this
reconstruction is enhanced if low temperatures and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are used as
molecular precursors for epitaxial growth of the graphene layers.

Recent experiments on epitaxial graphene layers grown
on metal surfaces have raised hopes of developing a large
number of applications [1,2]. Therefore, understanding the
growth, morphology, and structure of these layers is an
active research subject owing to its fundamental and prac-
tical interest. Graphene layers can be efficiently grown by
thermal decomposition of small organic molecules, usually
ethylene, on transition metals, such as Ru(0001) [3,4], Ir
(111) [5], Rh(111) [6], and Pt(111) [7,8]. The morphology
and structure of the graphene layer are intensively dis-
cussed in the literature, and the strength and nature of the
interaction of the layer with the metal substrate is still
under debate. The formation of nanometric size graphene
in the form of islands, patches, or defective areas with the
supporting metallic substrate could give rise to tailored
electronic properties, as it has been recently reported
[911]. This interaction is directly related to the distance
between the metal surface and the graphene layer, and
determines, for instance, the amount of rippling for
Moire
 patterns. Earlier theoretical models have used a
simple parametrized tight-binding approach relying on a
weak interaction (large separation) between both systems,
while other models based in ab initio approaches have
argued in favor of shorter distances and a stronger interac-
tion (e.g., [4]).
Typical for graphene on transition metal surfaces is the
development of Moire
 patterns exhibiting large surface
unit supercells with periodicities of about 23 nm. Ru
and Ir surfaces develop extended single-domain graphene
layers, as depicted by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) images [3,5]. Pt, on the contrary, shows incommen-
surate domains coexisting with Moire
 patterns of different
periodicities on the same surface [7,8]. In this work we
focus on the formation and structure of previously reported
graphene regions, which are commensurate with a Pt(111)
substrate in small crystallographic ratios, i.e., forming a
ffiffiffi
3
p

R30 periodicity [7]. We will show that this
structure is the result of a large surface-overlayer interac-
tion that accommodates its large mismatch by inducing a
strong reconstruction on the Pt surface. These regions,
presenting smaller crystallographic ratios than the Moire
counterpart, make the system amenable to be explored by
ab initio calculations, an important tool to accurately in-
terpret the chemistry and physics of epitaxial graphene
[4,11,12]. Therefore, this system offers a unique opportu-
nity to test theories and structural parameters that are
relevant to understand the interaction of graphene with
transition metal surfaces.

(9001000 K) and the use of large polycyclic aromatic
precursors, such as C60H30 [13] or C60 fullerenes, instead
of the standard ethylene, strongly favor the amount of the

regions. Each of these regions has been identified by high

R30 phase coexists with Moire
 regions of dif-
ferent periodicities [see Fig. 1(b)], and it has never been

image where the atomic features forming the

R30 reconstruction are clearly identified. These im-
ages are characterized by bright points and depressions
aligned along the 1 1 
2 surface crystallographic direction.
This structure exhibits large atomic corrugation in the STM
images, ranging from 0.60 to 0.15 A
 , about 5 times higher
than those we have obtained for the corresponding Moire
regions under the same conditions (< 0:1 
A) [3]. Since
electronic effects are important in the image appearance,
the atomic assignment of the STM features shown in
Fig. 1(c) is not trivial and requires the use of first-principles
calculations.
We have used ab initio density functional theory (DFT)
to locate the equilibrium ground state of the system by
searching for a total energy global minimum. Wave func-
tions are expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff of 350 eV
and are sampled on a Monkhorst-Pack 6  6  1 mesh
inside the Brillouin zone (see Ref. [14] for more details).
C and Pt atoms are described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials,
and the local density approximation is used for exchange
and correlation. DFT calculations are performed with the
CASTEP code [15]. This formalism yields lattice parameters
for bulk fcc platinum of 2.774 A
 (fractional error 0:05%)
and for an isolated graphene layer of 2.440 A
 (fractional
error 0:87%). The clean Pt(111) surface shows an out-
wards relaxation of 1:0% and a second layer contraction
of 0:2%, in good agreement with previous experimental
determinations (  0:8% and 0:0%).
A 30 rotation between the Pt and C structures reduces
the mismatch between Pt and graphene meshes from 11%
to about 3%. Such a mismatch, however, is still large and
elastic distortions in the graphene layer result in an in-
crease of the total energy, which can be interpreted as an
effective repulsive interaction between graphene and plati-
num. Under these conditions the graphene layer stays at a
relatively large distance from the outermost Pt(111) layer
(3.31 A
 ), remaining atomically flat with very little buckling
(z  0:01 
A). These values are similar to those calculated
for the low-interacting Moire
 regions [3,12], and in con-
trast to large atomic corrugation measured in the STM
images [Fig. 1(c)].
A different way to release stress is to induce a recon-
struction on the Pt(111) surface. We have found that the
formation of an ordered network of Pt vacancies at the
outermost layer leads to an energetically stable structure
compatible with the STM images. After trying many differ-
ent structures (including lateral shifts in the graphene layer,
extra carbon atoms, and vacancies in both layer and sur-
face), our best-fit model is depicted in Fig. 2. In this model
one surface Pt atom is missing per 
ffiffiffi

cell, and the rest of the Pt atoms are alternatively in top or
hollow positions with respect to the graphene layer. DFT
calculations show that graphene binds more strongly to the
platinum surface in the presence of vacancies. The inter-
action becomes 3 times larger (  0:60 eV per unit cell),
and the bond length between the C near a top Pt shortens to
2.28 A
 (see Fig. 2, side view). The remaining seven C
atoms in the unit cell relax outwards, producing a maxi-
mum buckling in the C layer of z  0:2 
A. This number
is about 7 times smaller than the one quoted for long-range
ripples in graphene [11]. The outermost Pt layer goes from
expansion to 8:1% contraction.

To accurately relate this structural model with the ex-
perimental STM images we have performed theoretical
simulations using a non-equilibrium Keldysh Green func-
tion formalism in which multiple scattering events have
been considered. The FIREBALL program has been used to
compute a DFT Hamiltonian based on a linear combination
of orbitals [16]. A tip made with 105 tungsten atoms
forming a pyramidal cluster ending in a single atom on a
W(100) terrace has been used. STM simulations have been
performed on the structural model previously optimized
using the more accurate plane-waves formalism. Figure 3
compares the calculated STM image with a high-resolution
experimental one. Important features observed in our ex-
periments, i.e., the bright spots and the depressions sur-
rounded by a tiny halo, are very well reproduced in our
simulations, and even quantitative agreement can be seen
in the scan lines (see Ref. [14] for details). The total
corrugation of the theoretical model for different tip dis-
tances range from 0.1 to 0.3 A
 , in good agreement with the
experimental values. Although C atoms are more than 2 A
above the outermost Pt layer, it is important to notice that
the STM image essentially reflects the Pt atoms because of
the large difference in the density of states (DOS) contri-
bution around the Fermi level. Additionally, the tip-surface
distance has been reduced more than 1 A
 with respect to the
Moire
 regions, increasing the Pt-tip hopping by a factor
of 16, which prevents the measurement of atomic corruga-
tion from the C atoms in the STM images of the 
ffiffiffi

p
R30 superstructure [16]. The calculation shows the Pt
on hollow positions presents the strongest contribution,
appearing as the brightest in the image. Finally, the C
atoms from the graphene layer produce multiple scattering
processes in the tunneling current, which are responsible
for the tiny circular features observed in the STM images
around the Pt vacancies that have a C on top [Fig. 3].
This atomic model agrees very well with STM images,
and it is also supported by high-resolution x-ray photo-
electron
spectroscopy
(XPS)
data
recorded
in
the
SuperESCA beam line of the synchrotron radiation facility
Elettra. Figure 4 shows the C 1s core level spectra of
graphene prepared by ethylene dissociation following the
standard recipe described in Refs. [3,4,6] (upper spec-
trum), and the one grown using C60 as molecular precur-
sors (lower spectrum). In the latter case the STM images
show the coexistence of several phases, including the
ffiffiffi
3
p
ffiffiffi
3
p
R30 reconstruction. The peak corresponding
to the ethylene preparation shows a single component
centered at 284.0 eV, whereas the lower peak correspond-
ing to graphene grown with C60 shows extra components at
both sides of the main peak (284.3 and 283.7 eV). Thus, the
main peak corresponds to the low-interacting Moire
 re-
gions, and its binding energy is in agreement with previ-
ously published results [6]. The small components can be
related to the existence of the covalently bonded structures.
It has been shown that the core level peak of C atoms
interacting with transition metal substrate is shifted to-
wards higher binding energies [6,17]. In the model pro-
posed in Fig. 2 for the 
ffiffiffi
3
p
ffiffiffi
3
p
R30 phase there are
three different types of C atoms: over a Pt vacancy, on top
of a surface Pt, and in bridge position. These three C atoms
present different total charges, as depicted by CASTEP
calculations: 4:08e, 4:15e, and 4:08e, respec-
tively. We expect this charge redistribution, including final
state effects, to be reflected in the final binding energy of
the C 1s core level peak, similar to the example shown in
Ref. [17]. Moreover, a XPS calculation of the areas in-
volved in the different structures gives a value of about
21% of the sample covered with these covalently bound
phases, in good agreement with the STM observation of
15%20% for these experimental conditions.
In this structural model, graphene forms new bonds with
Pt atoms as it has been observed by analyzing the charge
density difference for the optimum configuration displayed
in Fig. 2: C pz orbitals interact with Pt dz2 ones accumu-
lating charge in the intermediate region. The main effect of
vacancies on the Pt electronic structure is a subtle one: the
d band narrows and moves down in energy towards the
Fermi energy by about 0.3 eV. Therefore, the center of
mass for the Pt d band gets closer to the C  band,
increasing hybridization and chemical interaction. From
the point of view of the electronic structure of carbon

atoms the main change is an important increase in the DOS
at the Fermi level for  bands, which could enhance the
local catalytic properties of these reconstructed regions.
At first glance, the proposed Pt surface reconstruction
might be thought unlikely since it involves kinetic barriers
larger than 3 eV. However, the existence of a network of
vacancies after deposition and decomposition of large
organic molecules is widely supported by different experi-
mental observations. First, it has been shown that a gra-
phene layer interacting with the substrate via weak
van der Waals forces tends to form ripples with large
spatial periodicities [18]. However, the 
ffiffiffi
3
p
ffiffiffi
3
p
R30
regions shown in Fig. 1 do not show ripples, but a large
atomic corrugation (more than 5 times larger than the
Moire
 regions). This suggests that covalent bonds have
been formed between the layer and the substrate. Second,
STM images for clean Pt(111) show typical large terraces
separated by steps running parallel to the surface crystallo-
graphic directions. STM experiments for graphene on Ru
(0001) and Ir(111) show that steps remain sharp and ad-
justed to surface crystallographic directions after the gra-
phene layer has been created [3,5]. In our case, however,
when the 
ffiffiffi
3
p
ffiffiffi

p
R30 phase is on the surface, we
observe a rounding of the surface steps, as can be seen in
Fig. 1(a) for an incomplete coverage. Steps separating Pt
terraces are straight, whereas the ones separating graphene
regions are curved. See the supplementary material [14] for
more STM images showing this effect. The step smoothing
process
has
been
observed
for
different
graphene
overlayers. For instance, in the case of the

ffi

ffi

p
R23:4 formed after decomposition of benzene at
high temperature, a reorganization of the last Pt layer has
been suggested [8]. Rounding of steps is usually associated
with transport of Pt atoms from the terraces, and we
introduce the following model to explain this experimental
evidence: upon annealing the molecular precursor, a Pt
atom per 
ffiffiffi
3
p
ffiffiffi

p
R30 unit cell is removed from the
surface and diffuses towards the step edges, leaving a
vacancy behind [8,19]. The energy necessary to overcome
the large kinetic barrier should be found in the complex
reorganization of the large carbon-based precursors.
Indeed, it has been reported in the literature that annealing
at lower temperatures of different organic molecules, such
as fullerenes, results in the ejection of Pt atoms out of the
surface, creating vacancies on the Pt surface layer [19].
The same mechanism has been proposed for C60 on Pd
(110) [20], and more recently for Ag(111) [21] and Pt(110)
[22]. In these cases, the C60 adsorbs with a hexagon on the
vacancy maximizing the number of C-Pt bonds. However,
in our case, the orientation of the C layer with respect to the
substrate is imposed by minimization of the stress between
both structures resulting in a C atom placed on top of the
vacancy. Furthermore, the clean Pt(111) surface is known
to show a tendency to reconstruct at high temperatures
[23]. The organic polycyclic molecules used as precursors
get enough energy to facilitate the breaking of strong C-C
bonds and decompose once in contact with the reactive
surface Pt atoms. The adsorption, bond breaking, and
interaction of carbon species modifies the energetic bal-
ance resulting in the formation of new binding forces,
inducing the formation of vacancies. Thus we conclude
that the mechanism of vacancy formation in Pt(111) upon
annealing is likely when large carbonaceous species inter-
act with the Pt surface, as it has also been reported for other
transition metals.
