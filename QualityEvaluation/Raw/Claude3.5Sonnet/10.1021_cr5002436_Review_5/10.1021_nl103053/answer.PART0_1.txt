The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be directly answered from the given literature, as it does not contain information about this specific mechanism. The document focuses on the growth of graphene on a Rhodium surface and does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in detail.

To properly answer this question would require information not present in the given text. A complete answer would need to explain:

1. The four main steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism
2. The ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting
3. Why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy

Without additional sources, it's not possible to provide an accurate and detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or address the specific points requested in the question.

从给定的文献中无法直接回答有关催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机制的问题,因为文献中不包含有关这一特定机制的信息。该文档主要关注石墨烯在铑表面的生长,并未详细讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制或催化脱氢反应。

要正确回答这个问题需要文中未提供的信息。一个完整的答案需要解释：

1. Horiuti-Polanyi机制的四个主要步骤
2. 关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论
3. 为什么这个机制仍然是科学界感兴趣和争议的话题

没有额外的资料来源,无法对Horiuti-Polanyi机制提供准确详细的解释,也无法解答问题中要求的具体点。
