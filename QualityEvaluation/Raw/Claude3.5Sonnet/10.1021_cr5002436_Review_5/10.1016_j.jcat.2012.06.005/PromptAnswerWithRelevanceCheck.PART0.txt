The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not directly discussed in the given literature, can be explained as follows:

1. Adsorption: The alkane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First C-H bond cleavage: One C-H bond breaks, forming an alkyl species bound to the catalyst and a surface-bound hydrogen atom.

3. Second C-H bond cleavage: Another C-H bond breaks, forming the alkene and a second surface-bound hydrogen atom.

4. Desorption: The alkene and hydrogen molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.

The debate over which step is rate-limiting continues due to the complexity of the reaction and variations in catalyst types and reaction conditions. Some studies suggest the first C-H bond cleavage is rate-limiting, while others point to the second C-H bond cleavage or even the desorption step.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Catalyst diversity: Different catalysts may exhibit different rate-limiting steps.

2. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations can affect the rate-limiting step.

3. Difficulty in direct observation: The short-lived intermediates are challenging to observe experimentally.

4. Theoretical complexities: Quantum mechanical calculations of transition states are computationally intensive and sensitive to model assumptions.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for important industrial processes.

6. Academic interest: The mechanism serves as a model system for studying heterogeneous catalysis in general.

Continued research on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism aims to refine our understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation, potentially leading to improved catalyst design and more efficient industrial processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理虽然在给定的文献中没有直接讨论，但可以解释如下：

1. 吸附：烷烃分子吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 第一个C-H键断裂：一个C-H键断裂，形成与催化剂结合的烷基物种和一个表面结合的氢原子。

3. 第二个C-H键断裂：另一个C-H键断裂，形成烯烃和第二个表面结合的氢原子。

4. 脱附：烯烃和氢分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，这是由于反应的复杂性以及催化剂类型和反应条件的变化。一些研究表明第一个C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则指向第二个C-H键断裂甚至是脱附步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 催化剂多样性：不同的催化剂可能表现出不同的速率限制步骤。

2. 反应条件：温度、压力和反应物浓度可能影响速率限制步骤。

3. 直接观察的困难：短暂的中间体在实验中很难观察到。

4. 理论复杂性：过渡态的量子力学计算在计算上很密集，并且对模型假设很敏感。

5. 工业相关性：理解该机理对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要，这些催化剂用于重要的工业过程。

6. 学术兴趣：该机理作为研究一般异相催化的模型系统。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究旨在完善我们对催化脱氢的理解，可能导致改进的催化剂设计和更高效的工业过程。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not directly discussed in the given literature, is a fundamental model in heterogeneous catalysis. It consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The reactant molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface.

2. First hydrogen abstraction: One hydrogen atom is removed from the adsorbed molecule, forming an alkyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen abstraction: Another hydrogen atom is removed, forming the desired alkene product.

4. Desorption: The alkene product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some researchers argue it's the first hydrogen abstraction, while others suggest it's the second. This controversy persists due to the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing intermediates on the catalyst surface.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest despite nearly a century of study because it provides a fundamental framework for understanding catalytic dehydrogenation. Advances in surface science techniques and computational methods continue to provide new insights into the detailed molecular processes involved. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for important industrial processes like propane dehydrogenation, which is the focus of the given literature.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, the study of different catalysts (VOx, CrOx, and PtSn) for propane dehydrogenation implicitly relies on this mechanistic understanding. The differences in catalyst performance and deactivation behavior observed in the study likely relate to how these different materials facilitate the steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理虽然在给定文献中没有直接讨论，但它是多相催化中的一个基本模型。它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：反应分子吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 第一次氢抽提：从吸附的分子中移除一个氢原子，形成烷基中间体。

3. 第二次氢抽提：移除另一个氢原子，形成所需的烯烃产物。

4. 脱附：烯烃产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，存在持续的争议。一些研究人员认为是第一次氢抽提，而其他人则认为是第二次。这种争议持续存在是由于反应的复杂性和直接观察催化剂表面中间体的困难。

尽管Horiuti-Polanyi机理已经研究了近一个世纪，但它仍然是科学兴趣的主题，因为它为理解催化脱氢提供了基本框架。表面科学技术和计算方法的进展继续为涉及的详细分子过程提供新的见解。理解这一机理对于设计更高效的催化剂至关重要，特别是对于像文献中关注的丙烷脱氢这样重要的工业过程。

虽然文献没有明确讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理，但对不同催化剂（VOx、CrOx和PtSn）进行丙烷脱氢的研究隐含地依赖于这种机理理解。研究中观察到的催化剂性能和失活行为的差异很可能与这些不同材料如何促进Horiuti-Polanyi机理的步骤有关。

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Some argue it is the initial C-H bond breaking, while others propose it is the second C-H cleavage or even desorption of the product. This remains controversial because:

2. The rate-limiting step may vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

3. Computational studies sometimes conflict with experimental results.

4. There may be multiple pathways operating simultaneously.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of interest nearly 100 years after its proposal because:

1. It provides a framework for understanding and improving catalysts.

2. New analytical techniques allow for more detailed mechanistic studies.

3. It has implications for other catalytic reactions beyond dehydrogenation.

4. A full understanding could enable more efficient industrial processes.

5. It exemplifies fundamental concepts in heterogeneous catalysis.

Overall, while the general steps are agreed upon, the details of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism continue to be refined and debated as our understanding of surface chemistry advances.
