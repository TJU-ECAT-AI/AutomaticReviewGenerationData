<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on propylene reactions on platinum surfaces, but does not provide detailed information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its ongoing debates. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or analyze the controversies surrounding it based solely on the information given in this text.

给定的文献中没有直接讨论催化加氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注丙烯在铂表面上的反应，但没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其相关争议的详细信息。因此，仅基于这篇文本中给出的信息，我无法对这个机理进行详细解释或分析围绕它的争议。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not directly discussed in the given scientific literature. The document focuses on the thermal chemistry and HD exchange of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, but does not provide detailed information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its ongoing debates. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the provided text.

However, some aspects of the propylene reactions described in the document align with steps similar to those in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, such as the adsorption of propylene on the surface, formation of propyl intermediates, and subsequent reactions to form propane or exchanged propylene. But without explicit discussion of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its four main steps, rate-limiting step debates, or reasons for continued scientific interest, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be provided using only the information in this literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

Horiuti-Polanyi催化加氢反应机制在给定的科学文献中没有直接讨论。该文件主要关注丙烯在Pt(111)表面上的热化学和HD交换反应，但没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机制或其持续争论的详细信息。因此，仅基于所提供的文本无法完全回答这个问题。

然而，文档中描述的一些丙烯反应方面与Horiuti-Polanyi机制中的步骤相似，例如丙烯在表面上的吸附、丙基中间体的形成以及随后形成丙烷或交换丙烯的反应。但由于没有明确讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机制、其四个主要步骤、速率限制步骤的争论或持续科学兴趣的原因，仅使用本文献中的信息无法对该问题提供全面的回答。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions is not explicitly described in the given literature. The document focuses on the thermal chemistry and deuterium exchange of propylene on Pt(111) surfaces, but does not provide detailed information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its ongoing debate. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

However, the literature does discuss some aspects of propylene hydrogenation and exchange reactions that are related to steps in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The document mentions a stepwise hydrogenation process involving propyl intermediates, competitive β-hydride elimination, and reductive elimination. It also notes the importance of surface hydrogen coverage in determining reaction rates and product distributions. These observations are consistent with some elements of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, but the text does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the mechanism or address the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化加氢反应机理在给定的文献中没有明确描述。该文档主要关注丙烯在Pt(111)表面的热化学和氘交换反应，但没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其持续争议的详细信息。因此，无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

然而，文献确实讨论了一些与Horiuti-Polanyi机理步骤相关的丙烯加氢和交换反应的方面。文档提到了涉及丙基中间体的逐步加氢过程、竞争性β-氢消除和还原消除。它还指出了表面氢覆盖率在决定反应速率和产物分布方面的重要性。这些观察结果与Horiuti-Polanyi机理的一些要素是一致的，但文本并没有提供该机理的全面解释，也没有涉及关于其速率限制步骤的持续争议。
