[1] "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

[2] "Basically two types of heterogeneous catalytic reactions have been widely studied for both fundamental understanding and practical applications. First there are those that are characterized by a set of unidirectional steps. These include such reactions as the cracking of petroleum compounds and their oxidation. The second class of systems are those in which reversible reactions such as the synthesis of ammonia and of sulfuric acid as well as dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions occur."

[3] "Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."

[4] "Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9 l and i-C4H81."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of one hydrogen atom from the adsorbed molecule
3. Desorption of the remaining hydrogen atom, forming the unsaturated product
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of these reactions and the difficulty in establishing a single rate-controlling step, especially for non-metallic catalysts. This study provides evidence for a single rate-controlling step involving the interconversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9l) to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8l) and its reverse.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to several factors:

1. Complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions
2. Differences between metallic and non-metallic catalysts
3. Challenges in experimentally determining the rate-limiting step
4. Importance of understanding reaction mechanisms for catalyst design and optimization
5. Ongoing development of new experimental and theoretical techniques to study these reactions

The continued study of this mechanism contributes to both fundamental understanding and practical applications in catalysis, which is crucial for various industrial processes such as petroleum refining, chemical synthesis, and energy production.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附
2. 吸附分子中一个氢原子的解离
3. 剩余氢原子的脱附，形成不饱和产物
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论源于这些反应的复杂性以及难以确定单一速率控制步骤，特别是对于非金属催化剂而言。本研究提供了证据，表明存在一个单一的速率控制步骤，涉及半氢化吸附物种（i-C4H9l）到吸附异丁烯（i-C4H8l）的相互转化及其反向过程。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 多相催化反应的复杂性
2. 金属和非金属催化剂之间的差异
3. 实验确定速率限制步骤的挑战
4. 理解反应机理对催化剂设计和优化的重要性
5. 研究这些反应的新实验和理论技术的持续发展

对该机理的持续研究有助于催化领域的基础理解和实际应用，这对石油精炼、化学合成和能源生产等各种工业过程至关重要。
