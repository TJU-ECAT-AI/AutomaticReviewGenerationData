[1] "Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."

[2] "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

[3] "It consists of the following elementary steps:

i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI
i-C4H9/ + l - i-C4H8/+ HI
i-C4H8/ --- i-C4H8 + l
2H/ H2l+l
H21 H2+l."

[4] "Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9 l and i-C4H81."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed molecule to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom to form the dehydrogenated product
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the difficulty in establishing a single rate-controlling step in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions, especially with non-metallic catalysts. This is because non-metallic catalysts often have fewer active sites than supported metals, making the identification of the rate-limiting step more challenging.

In this study, the authors found evidence for a single rate-controlling step involving the interconversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9l) and chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8l). This step corresponds to the second and third steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism combined.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of heterogeneous catalysis: The interactions between reactants, intermediates, and catalyst surfaces are complex and can vary depending on the specific catalytic system.

2. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide more detailed insights into reaction mechanisms, sometimes challenging or refining existing models.

3. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in various industries, driving ongoing research and debate.

4. Variability among catalytic systems: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-limiting steps, making it difficult to generalize findings across all systems.

5. Dual-site mechanisms: As demonstrated in this study, some catalytic systems may involve dual-site mechanisms, adding another layer of complexity to the traditional Horiuti-Polanyi model.

The continued study and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism contribute to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes and help guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction systems.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面
2. 从吸附分子中移除一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 移除第二个氢原子形成脱氢产物
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论源于在复杂的可逆多相催化反应中确定单一速率控制步骤的困难，特别是对于非金属催化剂而言。这是因为非金属催化剂通常比负载金属催化剂具有更少的活性位点，使得确定速率限制步骤更具挑战性。

在这项研究中，作者发现了涉及半氢化化学吸附物种（i-C4H9l）和化学吸附异丁烯（i-C4H8l）之间相互转化的单一速率控制步骤的证据。这一步骤对应于Horiuti-Polanyi机理的第二和第三步骤的结合。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 多相催化的复杂性：反应物、中间体和催化剂表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且可能因具体的催化体系而异。

2. 分析技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法继续提供对反应机理更详细的洞察，有时会挑战或完善现有模型。

3. 在工业应用中的重要性：了解速率限制步骤对于优化各种行业的催化过程至关重要，推动了持续的研究和争论。

4. 催化体系之间的可变性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤，使得难以将发现推广到所有系统。

5. 双位点机理：如本研究所示，某些催化体系可能涉及双位点机理，为传统的Horiuti-Polanyi模型增加了另一层复杂性。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论有助于深入理解催化过程，并有助于指导开发更高效的催化剂和反应系统。
