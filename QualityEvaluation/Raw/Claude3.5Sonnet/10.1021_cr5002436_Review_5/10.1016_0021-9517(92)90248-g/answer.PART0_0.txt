[1] "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

[2] "The overall reaction is
i-C4Hr0 = i-C4H8 + H2."

[3] "It consists of the following elementary steps:
i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI
i-C4H9l + l - i-C4H8/+ HI  
i-C4H8l --- i-C4H 8 + l
2H/  H2l+l
H21  H2+l"

[4] "Perhaps the most important result from this study is the demonstration that a reversible reaction can be well modeled using transient tracing regardless of how overall kinetics may be correlated"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Abstraction of a second hydrogen atom to form the unsaturated product (e.g., isobutene)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step stems from the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing surface intermediates. Historically, different steps have been proposed as rate-limiting depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst used.

This study provides evidence that the conversion between the half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9l) and the chemisorbed product (i-C4H8l) is the rate-controlling step for the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction over a chromia catalyst. This corresponds to step 3 in the general mechanism.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its broad applicability to various hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions
2. The challenge of directly observing surface intermediates and their kinetics
3. The complex interplay between reaction steps and their dependence on reaction conditions
4. Its implications for catalyst design and optimization
5. The ongoing development of new experimental and computational techniques to probe reaction mechanisms

The study demonstrates that transient isotopic tracing can provide valuable insights into the mechanism and kinetics of reversible reactions, offering a powerful tool to address long-standing questions in heterogeneous catalysis.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物(如异丁烷)在催化剂表面吸附
2. 抽取一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 抽取第二个氢原子形成不饱和产物(如异丁烯)
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论源于反应的复杂性和直接观察表面中间体的困难。历史上，根据具体的反应条件和所使用的催化剂，不同的步骤被提出为速率限制步骤。

这项研究提供了证据，表明半氢化物种(i-C4H9l)和化学吸附产物(i-C4H8l)之间的转化是异丁烷脱氢反应在氧化铬催化剂上的速率控制步骤。这对应于一般机理中的第3步。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它对各种氢化/脱氢反应的广泛适用性
2. 直接观察表面中间体及其动力学的挑战
3. 反应步骤之间的复杂相互作用及其对反应条件的依赖性
4. 对催化剂设计和优化的影响
5. 不断发展的新实验和计算技术，用于探索反应机理

这项研究表明，瞬态同位素示踪可以为可逆反应的机理和动力学提供有价值的见解，为解决多相催化领域长期存在的问题提供了强有力的工具。
