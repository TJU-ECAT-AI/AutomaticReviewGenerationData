[1] "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

[2] "Basically two types of heterogeneous catalytic reactions have been widely studied for both fundamental understanding and practical applications. First there are those that are characterized by a set of unidirectional steps. These include such reactions as the cracking of petroleum compounds and their oxidation. The second class of systems are those in which reversible reactions such as the synthesis of ammonia and of sulfuric acid as well as dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions occur."

[3] "i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI
i-C4H9l + l - i-C4H8/+ HI
i-C4H81 --- i-C4H8 + l
2H/ H2l+l
H21 H2+l"

[4] "Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9 l and i-C4H81."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom to form the adsorbed product (e.g., isobutene)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers on which of these steps is slowest and therefore controls the overall reaction rate. Traditionally, the second hydrogen removal step (step 3) was often considered rate-limiting. However, this study provides evidence that the interconversion between the half-hydrogenated intermediate (i-C4H9l) and the adsorbed product (i-C4H8l) is the rate-controlling step for isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia catalyst.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. It applies to a wide range of important industrial reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization.
2. The mechanism involves multiple steps and intermediates, making it challenging to definitively determine which step is rate-limiting.
3. The rate-limiting step may vary depending on the specific catalyst, reactants, and reaction conditions.
4. Advanced experimental techniques and theoretical models continue to provide new insights into the details of the mechanism.
5. Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization of industrial processes.

The ongoing research in this area reflects the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the importance of understanding fundamental reaction mechanisms for practical applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物（如异丁烷）在催化剂表面上的吸附
2. 移除一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 移除第二个氢原子形成吸附产物（如异丁烯）
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论集中在哪一个步骤最慢，从而控制整个反应速率。传统上，第二个氢原子移除步骤（步骤3）通常被认为是速率限制步骤。然而，本研究提供了证据，表明半氢化中间体（i-C4H9l）和吸附产物（i-C4H8l）之间的相互转化是氧化铬催化剂上异丁烷脱氢反应的速率控制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于广泛的重要工业反应，包括氢化、脱氢和异构化。
2. 该机理涉及多个步骤和中间体，使得确定哪个步骤是速率限制步骤具有挑战性。
3. 速率限制步骤可能因特定的催化剂、反应物和反应条件而异。
4. 先进的实验技术和理论模型不断为机理细节提供新的见解。
5. 理解速率限制步骤对催化剂设计和工业过程优化至关重要。

这一领域的持续研究反映了多相催化的复杂性，以及理解基本反应机理对实际应用的重要性。
