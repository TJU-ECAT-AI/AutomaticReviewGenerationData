The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Abstraction of a second hydrogen atom to form the unsaturated product (e.g., isobutene)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step stems from the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing surface intermediates. Historically, different steps have been proposed as rate-limiting depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst used.

This study provides evidence that the conversion between the half-hydrogenated species (i-C4H9l) and the chemisorbed product (i-C4H8l) is the rate-controlling step for the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction over a chromia catalyst. This corresponds to step 3 in the general mechanism.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its broad applicability to various hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions
2. The challenge of directly observing surface intermediates and their kinetics
3. The complex interplay between reaction steps and their dependence on reaction conditions
4. Its implications for catalyst design and optimization
5. The ongoing development of new experimental and computational techniques to probe reaction mechanisms

The study demonstrates that transient isotopic tracing can provide valuable insights into the mechanism and kinetics of reversible reactions, offering a powerful tool to address long-standing questions in heterogeneous catalysis.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物(如异丁烷)在催化剂表面吸附
2. 抽取一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 抽取第二个氢原子形成不饱和产物(如异丁烯)
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论源于反应的复杂性和直接观察表面中间体的困难。历史上，根据具体的反应条件和所使用的催化剂，不同的步骤被提出为速率限制步骤。

这项研究提供了证据，表明半氢化物种(i-C4H9l)和化学吸附产物(i-C4H8l)之间的转化是异丁烷脱氢反应在氧化铬催化剂上的速率控制步骤。这对应于一般机理中的第3步。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它对各种氢化/脱氢反应的广泛适用性
2. 直接观察表面中间体及其动力学的挑战
3. 反应步骤之间的复杂相互作用及其对反应条件的依赖性
4. 对催化剂设计和优化的影响
5. 不断发展的新实验和计算技术，用于探索反应机理

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule onto the catalyst surface
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom from the adsorbed molecule to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom to form the dehydrogenated product
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the difficulty in establishing a single rate-controlling step in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions, especially with non-metallic catalysts. This is because non-metallic catalysts often have fewer active sites than supported metals, making the identification of the rate-limiting step more challenging.

In this study, the authors found evidence for a single rate-controlling step involving the interconversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9l) and chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8l). This step corresponds to the second and third steps of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism combined.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of heterogeneous catalysis: The interactions between reactants, intermediates, and catalyst surfaces are complex and can vary depending on the specific catalytic system.

2. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide more detailed insights into reaction mechanisms, sometimes challenging or refining existing models.

3. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in various industries, driving ongoing research and debate.

4. Variability among catalytic systems: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-limiting steps, making it difficult to generalize findings across all systems.

5. Dual-site mechanisms: As demonstrated in this study, some catalytic systems may involve dual-site mechanisms, adding another layer of complexity to the traditional Horiuti-Polanyi model.

The continued study and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism contribute to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes and help guide the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction systems.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子吸附到催化剂表面
2. 从吸附分子中移除一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 移除第二个氢原子形成脱氢产物
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论源于在复杂的可逆多相催化反应中确定单一速率控制步骤的困难，特别是对于非金属催化剂而言。这是因为非金属催化剂通常比负载金属催化剂具有更少的活性位点，使得确定速率限制步骤更具挑战性。

在这项研究中，作者发现了涉及半氢化化学吸附物种（i-C4H9l）和化学吸附异丁烯（i-C4H8l）之间相互转化的单一速率控制步骤的证据。这一步骤对应于Horiuti-Polanyi机理的第二和第三步骤的结合。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 多相催化的复杂性：反应物、中间体和催化剂表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且可能因具体的催化体系而异。

2. 分析技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法继续提供对反应机理更详细的洞察，有时会挑战或完善现有模型。

3. 在工业应用中的重要性：了解速率限制步骤对于优化各种行业的催化过程至关重要，推动了持续的研究和争论。

4. 催化体系之间的可变性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤，使得难以将发现推广到所有系统。

5. 双位点机理：如本研究所示，某些催化体系可能涉及双位点机理，为传统的Horiuti-Polanyi模型增加了另一层复杂性。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论有助于深入理解催化过程，并有助于指导开发更高效的催化剂和反应系统。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom to form the adsorbed product (e.g., isobutene)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers on which of these steps is slowest and therefore controls the overall reaction rate. Traditionally, the second hydrogen removal step (step 3) was often considered rate-limiting. However, this study provides evidence that the interconversion between the half-hydrogenated intermediate (i-C4H9l) and the adsorbed product (i-C4H8l) is the rate-controlling step for isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia catalyst.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. It applies to a wide range of important industrial reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization.
2. The mechanism involves multiple steps and intermediates, making it challenging to definitively determine which step is rate-limiting.
3. The rate-limiting step may vary depending on the specific catalyst, reactants, and reaction conditions.
4. Advanced experimental techniques and theoretical models continue to provide new insights into the details of the mechanism.
5. Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for catalyst design and optimization of industrial processes.

The ongoing research in this area reflects the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the importance of understanding fundamental reaction mechanisms for practical applications.
