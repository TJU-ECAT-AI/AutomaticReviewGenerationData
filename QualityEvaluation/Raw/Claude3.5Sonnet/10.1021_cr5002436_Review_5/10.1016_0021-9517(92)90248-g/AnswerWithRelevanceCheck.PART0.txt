          "We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

"It consists of the following elementary steps:
i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI
i-C4H9l + l - i-C4H8/+ HI  
i-C4H8l --- i-C4H 8 + l
2H/  H2l+l
H21  H2+l"

"Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."

"Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9 l and i-C4H81."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant (e.g., isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Removal of a hydrogen atom to form a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom to form the adsorbed product (e.g., isobutene)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting stems from the complexity of these reactions and the difficulty in establishing a single rate-controlling step, especially for non-metallic catalysts. This study provides evidence for a single rate-controlling step involving the interconversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9l) to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8l) and its reverse.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of heterogeneous catalysis
2. Diversity of catalytic systems
3. Advances in analytical techniques
4. Importance in industrial applications
5. Fundamental scientific interest
6. Difficulty in directly observing intermediates
7. Influence of catalyst structure and composition
8. Challenges in experimentally determining the rate-limiting step
9. Ongoing development of new experimental and theoretical techniques
10. Variability of rate-limiting steps depending on specific catalysts, reactants, and conditions

The continued study of this mechanism contributes to both fundamental understanding and practical applications in catalysis, which is crucial for various industrial processes such as petroleum refining, chemical synthesis, and energy production.

          Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物（如异丁烷）在催化剂表面上的吸附
2. 移除一个氢原子形成半氢化中间体
3. 移除第二个氢原子形成吸附产物（如异丁烯）
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论源于这些反应的复杂性以及难以确定单一速率控制步骤，特别是对于非金属催化剂而言。本研究提供了证据，表明存在一个单一的速率控制步骤，涉及半氢化吸附物种（i-C4H9l）到吸附异丁烯（i-C4H8l）的相互转化及其反向过程。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 多相催化的复杂性
2. 催化系统的多样性
3. 分析技术的进步
4. 在工业应用中的重要性
5. 基础科学兴趣
6. 直接观察中间体的困难
7. 催化剂结构和成分的影响
8. 实验确定速率限制步骤的挑战
9. 研究这些反应的新实验和理论技术的持续发展
10. 速率限制步骤可能因特定的催化剂、反应物和反应条件而异

对该机理的持续研究有助于催化领域的基础理解和实际应用，这对石油精炼、化学合成和能源生产等各种工业过程至关重要。
