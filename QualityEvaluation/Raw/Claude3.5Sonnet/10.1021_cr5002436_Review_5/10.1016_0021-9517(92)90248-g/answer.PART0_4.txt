The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of one hydrogen atom from the adsorbed molecule, forming a half-hydrogenated intermediate
3. Removal of a second hydrogen atom, forming the dehydrogenated product still adsorbed on the surface
4. Desorption of the product molecule from the catalyst surface

The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting has been a topic of scientific interest and controversy for nearly a century. This study provides evidence for a single rate-controlling step involving the interconversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species (i-C4H9l) to chemisorbed isobutene (i-C4H8l) and its reverse.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of heterogeneous catalysis: The mechanism involves multiple steps occurring on a complex surface, making it challenging to isolate and study individual steps.

2. Diversity of catalytic systems: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to variations in the rate-limiting step, making generalizations difficult.

3. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental methods and computational tools continue to provide fresh insights into the mechanism, sometimes challenging previous assumptions.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in various industries, driving ongoing research.

5. Fundamental scientific interest: The mechanism touches on fundamental concepts in surface chemistry, kinetics, and thermodynamics, making it an important model system for theoretical studies.

6. Difficulty in directly observing intermediates: The short-lived nature of surface intermediates makes their direct observation challenging, leading to ongoing debates about their exact nature and role.

7. Influence of catalyst structure and composition: The mechanism can be affected by the catalyst's surface structure, composition, and defects, adding another layer of complexity to the study.

This study's findings contribute to this ongoing debate by providing evidence for a specific rate-controlling step in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction over a chromia catalyst, demonstrating the continued relevance and importance of research into the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面吸附
2. 吸附分子上的一个氢原子解离，形成半氢化中间体
3. 第二个氢原子被移除，形成仍吸附在表面上的脱氢产物
4. 产物分子从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论近一个世纪以来一直是科学兴趣和争议的话题。本研究提供了证据，表明存在一个单一的速率控制步骤，涉及半氢化吸附物种（i-C4H9l）到吸附异丁烯（i-C4H8l）的相互转化及其逆过程。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 多相催化的复杂性：该机理涉及在复杂表面上发生的多个步骤，使得单独研究各个步骤具有挑战性。

2. 催化系统的多样性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致速率限制步骤的变化，使得难以做出概括。

3. 分析技术的进步：新的实验方法和计算工具不断为机理提供新的见解，有时会挑战先前的假设。

4. 在工业应用中的重要性：理解速率限制步骤对于优化各种行业的催化过程至关重要，推动了持续的研究。

5. 基础科学兴趣：该机理涉及表面化学、动力学和热力学的基本概念，使其成为理论研究的重要模型系统。

6. 直接观察中间体的困难：表面中间体的短暂性质使其直接观察具有挑战性，导致对它们的确切性质和作用的持续争论。

7. 催化剂结构和成分的影响：催化剂的表面结构、成分和缺陷可能影响机理，为研究增加了另一层复杂性。

本研究的发现通过提供异丁烷在氧化铬催化剂上脱氢反应的特定速率控制步骤的证据，为这一持续的争论做出了贡献，展示了对Horiuti-Polanyi机理研究的持续相关性和重要性。
