[1] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]. Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombinative desorption of hydrogen

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism centers around whether step 1 (dissociative adsorption) or step 2 (dehydrogenation) is slower. Traditionally, step 2 was often considered rate-limiting, but more recent studies, including the one discussed in this paper, suggest that step 1 may be rate-limiting under certain conditions.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its wide applicability: The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism applies to many catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, making it fundamental to understanding these processes.

2. Complexity of real systems: Real catalytic systems are often more complex than the idealized mechanism, with factors like support materials, promoters, and reaction conditions affecting the relative rates of each step.

3. Difficulty in direct observation: The elementary steps occur rapidly on catalyst surfaces, making direct observation challenging and necessitating indirect methods of study.

4. Implications for catalyst design: Understanding which step is rate-limiting has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts.

5. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into the mechanism, sometimes challenging long-held assumptions.

6. Importance in industrial processes: The mechanism's relevance to important industrial processes, such as the production of alkenes, ensures ongoing interest in refining our understanding of it.

The continued study and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its central importance in catalysis science and the ongoing efforts to optimize catalytic processes for industrial applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组脱附

关于该机理中速率限制步骤的持续争论主要集中在步骤1（解离吸附）或步骤2（脱氢）哪个更慢。传统上，步骤2通常被认为是速率限制步骤，但最近的研究，包括本文讨论的研究，表明在某些条件下步骤1可能是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，原因如下：

1. 广泛适用性：Horiuti-Polanyi机理适用于许多催化氢化和脱氢反应，是理解这些过程的基础。

2. 实际系统的复杂性：实际催化系统通常比理想化的机理更复杂，支撑材料、助剂和反应条件等因素会影响每个步骤的相对速率。

3. 直接观察的困难：基本步骤在催化剂表面迅速发生，使直接观察变得困难，需要间接的研究方法。

4. 对催化剂设计的影响：了解哪个步骤是速率限制步骤对设计更有效的催化剂有重要影响。

5. 分析技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法不断为该机理提供新的见解，有时挑战长期以来的假设。

6. 在工业过程中的重要性：该机理与重要的工业过程（如烯烃的生产）相关，确保了持续改进我们对它的理解的兴趣。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了它在催化科学中的核心重要性，以及为工业应用优化催化过程的持续努力。
