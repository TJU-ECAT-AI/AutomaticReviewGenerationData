[1] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]."

[2] "Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:"

C4H9+ 2C4H8+ H (Step 2)
C4H8C4H8 + 2 (Step 3)

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane (e.g. isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombinative desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Traditionally, the second step (dehydrogenation) was often considered rate-limiting. However, the literature here suggests that for isobutane dehydrogenation, the first step (dissociative adsorption) may be rate-limiting based on deuterium tracing studies.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. It applies to many important industrial catalytic processes
2. The rate-limiting step can vary depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst
3. Advanced experimental techniques continue to provide new insights into the elementary steps
4. Understanding the mechanism at a molecular level is crucial for rational catalyst design
5. There are still debates about the nature of adsorbed intermediates and transition states
6. The mechanism intersects with fundamental questions in surface science and catalysis

The ongoing research aims to elucidate how factors like catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence the elementary steps and overall kinetics. This mechanistic understanding is vital for developing improved catalysts and optimizing industrial processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃(如异丁烷)在催化剂表面上的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤一直存在争议。传统上，第二步(脱氢)通常被认为是速率限制步骤。然而，这里的文献表明，对于异丁烷脱氢反应，基于氘示踪研究，第一步(解离吸附)可能是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于许多重要的工业催化过程
2. 速率限制步骤可能因具体反应条件和催化剂而异
3. 先进的实验技术不断为基元步骤提供新的见解
4. 在分子水平上理解机理对于理性催化剂设计至关重要
5. 关于吸附中间体和过渡态的性质仍存在争议
6. 该机理与表面科学和催化领域的基本问题相交叉

持续的研究旨在阐明催化剂组成、结构和反应条件等因素如何影响基元步骤和整体动力学。这种机理理解对于开发改进的催化剂和优化工业过程至关重要。
