[1] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]. Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane (e.g. isobutane) on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step stems from conflicting experimental evidence across different catalytic systems. While traditionally Step 2 (dehydrogenation) was considered rate-limiting, more recent studies like the one described in this paper suggest Step 1 (dissociative adsorption) may be rate-limiting in some cases.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its broad applicability to many catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions
2. The difficulty in directly observing surface intermediates and elementary steps
3. The sensitivity of the mechanism to catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions
4. Its importance in industrial processes like petroleum refining and petrochemical production
5. Ongoing advances in surface science techniques that allow for more detailed mechanistic studies

Understanding the intricacies of this mechanism is crucial for rational catalyst design and process optimization in many important chemical processes. The continuing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the need for further research in this field.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃（如异丁烷）在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论源于不同催化体系中相互矛盾的实验证据。虽然传统上认为步骤2（脱氢）是速率限制步骤，但最近的研究（如本文所述）表明，在某些情况下，步骤1（解离吸附）可能是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它广泛适用于许多催化氢化/脱氢反应
2. 直接观察表面中间体和基元步骤的困难
3. 该机理对催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的敏感性
4. 它在石油精炼和石油化工生产等工业过程中的重要性
5. 表面科学技术的持续进步，使更详细的机理研究成为可能

理解这种机理的复杂性对于许多重要化学过程中的理性催化剂设计和过程优化至关重要。持续的争论突显了多相催化的复杂性以及该领域进一步研究的必要性。
