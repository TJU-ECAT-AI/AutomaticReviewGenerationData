[1] "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]. Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:"

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers around whether step 1 (alkane adsorption) or step 2 (C-H bond breaking) is slower. Traditionally, step 2 was considered rate-limiting, but more recent studies have suggested step 1 may be rate-determining in some cases.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Its applicability to a wide range of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions
2. The difficulty in directly observing surface intermediates and transition states
3. The dependence of the rate-limiting step on specific catalyst properties and reaction conditions
4. Its importance in understanding and optimizing industrial catalytic processes
5. Advances in surface science and computational methods allowing for more detailed mechanistic investigations

The continued study of this mechanism provides insights into fundamental surface chemistry and helps guide the development of improved catalysts for important industrial processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论集中在步骤1（烷烃吸附）或步骤2（C-H键断裂）哪个更慢。传统上认为步骤2是速率限制步骤，但最近的研究表明在某些情况下步骤1可能是速率决定步骤。

尽管经过近一个世纪的研究，这一机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于广泛的氢化/脱氢反应
2. 直接观察表面中间体和过渡态的困难
3. 速率限制步骤取决于特定的催化剂性质和反应条件
4. 它对理解和优化工业催化过程的重要性
5. 表面科学和计算方法的进步允许进行更详细的机理研究

对这一机理的持续研究提供了对基础表面化学的洞察，并有助于指导改进重要工业过程中催化剂的开发。
