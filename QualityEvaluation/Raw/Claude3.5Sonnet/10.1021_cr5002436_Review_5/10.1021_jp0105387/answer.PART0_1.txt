The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: The alkene and hydrogen molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface.

2. First hydrogen addition: One hydrogen atom is added to the alkene, forming a half-hydrogenated alkyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen addition: The second hydrogen atom is added, completing the hydrogenation. 

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated alkane product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Traditionally, the second hydrogen addition was thought to be rate-determining. However, some studies have suggested the first addition or even desorption could be rate-limiting in certain cases. The debate continues due to the complexity of real catalytic systems.

This mechanism remains of interest nearly a century after its proposal because:

1. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding heterogeneous catalysis.

2. Ongoing advances in surface science techniques allow for more detailed study of each step.

3. Understanding the mechanism is crucial for rational catalyst design.

4. There are still unresolved questions about the details of each step and how they vary with different catalysts and reactants.

5. The mechanism has implications beyond just hydrogenation reactions, informing understanding of other catalytic processes.

The continued study and debate around this mechanism highlights both its importance and the challenges in fully understanding complex catalytic processes at the molecular level.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：烯烃和氢分子吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 第一个氢原子加成：一个氢原子加到烯烃上，形成半氢化的烷基中间体。

3. 第二个氢原子加成：第二个氢原子加成，完成氢化过程。

4. 脱附：完全氢化的烷烃产物从催化剂表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。传统上认为第二个氢原子加成是速率决定步骤。然而，一些研究表明，在某些情况下，第一个氢原子加成甚至脱附可能是速率限制步骤。由于实际催化系统的复杂性，这一争论仍在继续。

尽管这一机理提出已近一个世纪，但它仍然备受关注，原因如下：

1. 它为理解多相催化提供了基本框架。

2. 表面科学技术的不断进步使得对每个步骤的更详细研究成为可能。

3. 理解这一机理对于理性催化剂设计至关重要。

4. 关于每个步骤的细节以及它们如何随不同催化剂和反应物而变化，仍有未解决的问题。

5. 这一机理不仅对氢化反应有影响，还为理解其他催化过程提供了见解。

围绕这一机理的持续研究和争论突显了它的重要性，以及在分子水平上充分理解复杂催化过程的挑战。
