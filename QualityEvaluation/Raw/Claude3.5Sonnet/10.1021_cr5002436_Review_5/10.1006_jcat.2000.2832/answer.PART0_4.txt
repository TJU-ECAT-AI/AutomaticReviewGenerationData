The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts, and does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature does not provide information about the ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism would be needed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文档主要关注在钒氧化物催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢,并未提及Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献也没有提供关于限速步骤的持续争论,或为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题的信息。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理的资料。
