The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts and kinetic isotope effects, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The document does not provide information about the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in this mechanism, nor does it discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. As such, the question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

给定的文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文本主要关注于钒氧化物催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢反应和动力学同位素效应，但没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个主要步骤。文档没有提供关于这种机理中哪个步骤被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论的信息，也没有讨论为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。因此，仅基于本文档提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
