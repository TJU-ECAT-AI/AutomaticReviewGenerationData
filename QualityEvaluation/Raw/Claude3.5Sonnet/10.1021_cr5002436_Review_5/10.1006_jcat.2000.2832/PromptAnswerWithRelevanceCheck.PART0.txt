Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts, studying kinetic isotope effects. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature does not provide information to answer questions about this specific mechanism, its rate-limiting step debates, or why it remains a topic of interest after nearly 100 years. The content is not relevant to explaining or analyzing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注钒氧化物催化剂上丙烷的氧化脱氢,研究动力学同位素效应。它没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献没有提供回答有关这一特定机理、其速率限制步骤争论或为何在近100年后仍然是一个感兴趣话题的信息。内容与解释或分析催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理无关。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on kinetic isotope effects in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or analyze the debate regarding its rate-limiting step based on the given text.
