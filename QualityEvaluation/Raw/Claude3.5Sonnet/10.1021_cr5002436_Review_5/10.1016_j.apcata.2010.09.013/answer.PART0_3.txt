The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on chromia-alumina catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation but does not provide details on the specific Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature also does not discuss any debate regarding the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism based solely on the information given in this document.

该文献中没有描述催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文档主要关注了用于轻烷烃脱氢的铬-氧化铝催化剂,但没有提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其具体步骤的详细信息。文献也没有讨论有关速率限制步骤的任何争论,或者为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。因此,我无法仅根据本文档中给出的信息对Horiuti-Polanyi机理提供详细的解释或分析。
