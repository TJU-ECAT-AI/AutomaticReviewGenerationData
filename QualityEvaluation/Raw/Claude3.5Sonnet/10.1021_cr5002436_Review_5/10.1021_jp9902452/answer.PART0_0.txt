The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be directly answered from the given literature, as it does not contain specific information about this mechanism. The document focuses on ethylene adsorption on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts, rather than discussing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in detail. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism, its four main steps, or analyze debates about the rate-limiting step based solely on the information in this document.

根据所给文献,无法直接回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理的问题。该文献主要关注乙烯在铂和铂-锡催化剂上的吸附,而没有详细讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理或催化脱氢反应。因此,仅基于本文档中的信息,我无法详细解释该机理、其四个主要步骤,或分析关于速率限制步骤的争论。
