The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, a fundamental concept in catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, continues to be a subject of intense scientific scrutiny and debate. This mechanism, which elucidates the process of hydrogen removal from organic compounds, consists of four primary steps: adsorption of the reactant onto the catalyst surface, dissociation of one C-H bond, rotation of the adsorbed species, and desorption of the product. While these steps are well-established, there remains considerable controversy surrounding the identification of the rate-limiting step, with various researchers proposing different stages as the critical bottleneck in the overall reaction. This ongoing discussion has spurred numerous studies and computational models aimed at resolving the debate. Despite the uncertainty, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism's enduring significance in scientific literature is undeniable, serving as a cornerstone for understanding heterogeneous catalysis and guiding the development of more efficient catalytic systems for industrial applications, particularly in the petrochemical and energy sectors.
