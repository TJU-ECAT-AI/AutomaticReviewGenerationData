          [1] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[2] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[3] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

[5] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[6] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the alkane molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociation of a C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate 
3. Dissociation of a second C-H bond to form the alkene product
4. Desorption of the alkene product from the catalyst surface

There is ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Different studies have proposed various rate-determining steps:

- Elimination of β-hydrogen from the propyl radical
- Conversion of propyl radical to π-bonded propene 
- Dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane
- First C-H bond cleavage
- Second C-H bond cleavage

The debate persists because experimental results have been inconsistent across different catalyst systems. Factors like catalyst structure, particle size, and surface orientation may influence which step is rate-limiting.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The mechanism involves multiple elementary steps on complex catalyst surfaces, making it challenging to isolate and study individual steps.
2. Diversity of catalysts: Different catalysts may exhibit different rate-limiting steps or reaction pathways.
3. Experimental limitations: Advanced techniques are required to observe short-lived intermediates and elucidate reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.
4. Theoretical challenges: Accurately modeling surface reactions and accounting for factors like coverage effects and lateral interactions remain challenging for computational studies.
5. Industrial relevance: Understanding and optimizing dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for many industrial processes, driving continued research efforts.
6. Advances in characterization techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into reaction mechanisms, sometimes challenging established views.

The ongoing debate and research surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the importance of understanding fundamental reaction steps for catalyst design and process optimization.

          Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃分子在催化剂表面的吸附
2. C-H键断裂形成烷基中间体
3. 第二个C-H键断裂形成烯烃产物
4. 烯烃产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，存在持续的争论。不同的研究提出了各种速率决定步骤：

- 从丙基自由基中消除β-氢
- 丙基自由基转化为π键合的丙烯
- 吸附丙烷的脱氢
- 第一个C-H键的断裂
- 第二个C-H键的断裂

这场争论持续存在，因为在不同的催化剂系统中，实验结果不一致。催化剂结构、粒子大小和表面取向等因素可能影响哪一步是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：该机理涉及复杂催化剂表面上的多个基元步骤，使得分离和研究单个步骤具有挑战性。
2. 催化剂的多样性：不同的催化剂可能表现出不同的速率限制步骤或反应途径。
3. 实验限制：需要先进的技术来观察短寿命中间体并阐明分子水平的反应机理。
4. 理论挑战：准确模拟表面反应并考虑覆盖度效应和侧向相互作用等因素对计算研究仍然具有挑战性。
5. 工业相关性：理解和优化脱氢反应对许多工业过程至关重要，推动了持续的研究努力。
6. 表征技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法不断为反应机理提供新的见解，有时挑战既定观点。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续争论和研究反映了多相催化的复杂性，以及理解基本反应步骤对催化剂设计和过程优化的重要性。
