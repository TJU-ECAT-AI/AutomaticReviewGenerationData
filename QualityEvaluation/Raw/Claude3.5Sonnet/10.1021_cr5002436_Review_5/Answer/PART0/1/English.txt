1. Adsorption of hydrogen and alkene on the catalyst surface
2. Addition of one hydrogen atom to the alkene, forming an alkyl intermediate
3. Addition of a second hydrogen atom to form the alkane product

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Initially, Horiuti and Polanyi proposed that hydrogen activation and/or hydrogenation of the alkyl intermediate was rate-determining. However, more recent studies have questioned this.

The mechanism remains controversial despite decades of study for several reasons:

Recent work has shown that neither di-σ-bonded nor π-bonded ethylene coverage correlates with hydrogenation rates on Pt catalysts, suggesting the rate-determining step may not involve these species directly. The activation of hydrogen or surface diffusion processes may play a more important role than previously thought.

Overall, while the general Horiuti-Polanyi framework remains useful, many mechanistic details are still actively debated. Continuing improvements in surface characterization techniques under reaction conditions will likely be needed to fully resolve these long-standing questions.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step primarily focuses on whether the dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) or the dehydrogenation step (step 2) is rate-limiting. In this study, based on deuterium tracing results, the authors conclude that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in the process. This conclusion is supported by similar findings from other researchers, such as Lok et al.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Chemisorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface, producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.

2. Chemisorption of the unsaturated compound (with a double bond) on the catalyst surface. This involves opening the double bond and forming new links with the catalyst.

3. Transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming a half-hydrogenated state.

4. Either:
   a) Removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon in the half-hydrogenated state, leading to replacement (dehydrogenation), or
   b) Attachment of another hydrogen atom to a different carbon atom, resulting in hydrogenation.
