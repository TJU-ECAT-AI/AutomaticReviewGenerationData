[1] "Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of -hydrogen from propyl radical."

[2] "Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy."

[3] "Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane."

[4] "The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese."

[5] "Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom."

[6] "Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate."

[1] "Figure 1 shows the dehydrogenation mechanism based on such mononuclear Cr3+-O site supported on a high-surface oxide, as recently discussed by Lillehaug et al. [13]. The activation of the CH bond starts with the reaction of the alkane with a coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ centre leading to the formation of a new OH group and a Cr-alkyl bond. The alkene is then formed as a result from a hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to Cr, and this reaction is thought to be rate determining. The reaction cycle is completed by the formation of H2 and the regeneration of the Cr3+-O active site."

[2] "Together, when assuming that all surface Cr sites are active, the results obtained in this work indicate that ethane adsorption is the rate-limiting step of reaction over a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."

[3] "This result is different from that reported by Kao et al. for isobutane dehydrogenation over pure Cr2O3, where b-H transfer was concluded to be the rate-determining step [21]."

[4] "Turning again to the recent theoretical work of Lillehaug et al. [13], this conclusion would favour the hydridocomplex route, in which ethane is adsorbed onto a CrH site, leading to the formation of CrC2H5 and a hydrogen molecule, with subsequent reformation of CrH and release of ethene."

[1] "A mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation over supported metal catalysts was first proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi as that the activation of hydrogen and/or hydrogenation of the ethyl intermediate was proposed to be the rate-determining step."

[2] "An ethyl intermediate is considered to be in equilibrium with adsorbed ethylene, and great attention has been given to the nature of adsorbed ethylene."

[3] "The issue of which specific species determines the rate of hydrogenation is still debatable."

[4] "If di-σ-bonded ethylene is a precursor of the rate-determining step, the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene may reflect the reaction rate. The rate of hydrogenation over Pt(111) is not related to the coverage of di-σ-bonded ethylene and the di-σ-bonded ethylene is not a precursor in front of the activation barrier of the hydrogenation reaction."

[5] "The activation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of ethylene may play an important role in the ethylene hydrogenation under the catalytic condition, and the rate of hydrogenation is probably independent of the coverage of any ethylene species on the mechanism."

"We find that a single rate-controlling step that consists of the conversion of the half-hydrogenated chemisorbed species i-C4H9I to chemisorbed isobutene i-C4H8/and the reverse exists."

"It consists of the following elementary steps:
i-C4H10 + 2l - i-C4H9/+ HI
i-C4H9l + l - i-C4H8/+ HI  
i-C4H8l --- i-C4H 8 + l
2H/  H2l+l
H21  H2+l"

"Whether a single rate-controlling step exists in complex reversible heterogeneous catalytic reactions is difficult to establish, especially with non-metallic catalysts, which often possess fewer active sites than supported metals."

"Evidence is presented for the existence of a dual-site mechanism for isobutane dehydrogenation with a single rate-controlling step involving interconversion of i-C4H9 l and i-C4H81."

"According to the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are required for the conversion of adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at least two of these sites are associated with a pair of adjacent metal atoms."

"For the further discussion we thus assume that step ii is the rate-determining step, namely, conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin."

"Therefore, we propose that the two sites required for the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin are located on one and the same Pt atom."

"From our results E and B, we then conclude that for the alloys mechanism Bl is to be preferred to the two other mechanisms discussed."

"Apart from result E, which is the outcome of chemisorption measurements, there is also evidence from alkane-deuterium exchange (9) and from calculations (24) suggesting that alloy surfaces might well be comparatively deficient in hydrogen."

[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

"To review our discussion-the essential processes which we have postulated are :
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.
2. The chernisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond compound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.
3. The transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state ; a process which may be followed by
4(a) the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or
4(b) the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation."

"The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

"Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)"

"Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

[1] "As noted above, the combined results from reaction kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation can explained by a HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below (Cortright et al., 1996):"

[2] "On the basis of the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process (Cortright et al., 1996). A similar conclusion was reached by Lok et al. (1986) in their investigation of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts."

[3] "Therefore, we may assume that steps 24 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions:"

[4] "Accordingly, a quantitative description of the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions may be determined for a given catalyst in terms of six parameters: S1, SH*, SiC4H8**, ΔH1, ΔH3, and ΔH4."
