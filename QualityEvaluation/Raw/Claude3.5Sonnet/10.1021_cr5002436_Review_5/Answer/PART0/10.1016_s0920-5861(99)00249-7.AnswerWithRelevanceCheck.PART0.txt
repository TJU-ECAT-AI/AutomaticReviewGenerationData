          "Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the slow step in this process [13]. Therefore, we may assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated for the experimental conditions of the present study, leading to the following rate expression for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:"

          The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

          1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane (e.g. isobutane) on the catalyst surface
          2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
          3. Desorption of the alkene product
          4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

          The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step centers around whether step 1 (dissociative adsorption) or step 2 (dehydrogenation) is slower. Traditionally, step 2 was often considered rate-limiting, but more recent studies, including the one discussed in this paper, suggest that step 1 may be rate-limiting under certain conditions, particularly for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts.

          This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

          1. Its wide applicability to many catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions
          2. The complexity of real catalytic systems, with factors like support materials, promoters, and reaction conditions affecting the relative rates of each step
          3. The difficulty in directly observing surface intermediates and elementary steps
          4. Its importance in understanding and optimizing industrial catalytic processes
          5. The implications for rational catalyst design
          6. Ongoing advances in surface science techniques and computational methods that allow for more detailed mechanistic studies
          7. The sensitivity of the mechanism to catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions
          8. The interplay between different steps, which can be affected by catalyst modifications
          9. Open questions about the details of surface species and transition states involved

          The continued study and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its central importance in catalysis science and the ongoing efforts to optimize catalytic processes for industrial applications. Understanding the intricacies of this mechanism is crucial for rational catalyst design and process optimization in many important chemical processes.

          Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

          1. 烷烃（如异丁烷）在催化剂表面的解离吸附
          2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
          3. 烯烃产物的脱附
          4. 氢的重组和脱附

          关于速率限制步骤的持续争论集中在步骤1（解离吸附）或步骤2（脱氢）哪个更慢。传统上，步骤2通常被认为是速率限制步骤，但最近的研究，包括本文讨论的研究，表明在某些条件下步骤1可能是速率限制步骤，特别是对于基于Pt催化剂的异丁烷脱氢反应。

          尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，原因如下：

          1. 它广泛适用于许多催化氢化和脱氢反应
          2. 实际催化系统的复杂性，支撑材料、助剂和反应条件等因素会影响每个步骤的相对速率
          3. 直接观察表面中间体和基元步骤的困难
          4. 它在理解和优化工业催化过程中的重要性
          5. 对理性催化剂设计的影响
          6. 表面科学技术和计算方法的持续进步，使更详细的机理研究成为可能
          7. 该机理对催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的敏感性
          8. 不同步骤之间的相互作用，可能受到催化剂修饰的影响
          9. 关于表面物种和过渡态细节的未解之谜

          对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了它在催化科学中的核心重要性，以及为工业应用优化催化过程的持续努力。理解这种机理的复杂性对于许多重要化学过程中的理性催化剂设计和过程优化至关重要。
