Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a brief citation or reference to a scientific article about propane dehydrogenation over a Ga2O3 surface, but it does not provide any details about reaction mechanisms or steps. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its four main steps, the debate about the rate-limiting step, or why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

提供的文献中没有关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的任何信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于在Ga2O3表面上丙烷脱氢的科学文章的简短引用或参考，但它没有提供任何关于反应机理或步骤的详细信息。由于给定文本中没有相关信息，我无法提供Horiuti-Polanyi机理的详细解释，其四个主要步骤，关于速率限制步骤的争论，或为什么它仍然是一个科学兴趣和争议的话题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be focused on a different topic - a periodic density functional theory study of propane dehydrogenation over a Ga2O3(100) surface. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its four main steps, the debate regarding the rate-limiting step, or discuss why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.
