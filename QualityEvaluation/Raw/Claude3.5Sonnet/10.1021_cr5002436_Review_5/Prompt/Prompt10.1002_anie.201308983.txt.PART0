Polymerization of Ethylene by Silica-Supported Dinuclear CrIII Sites through an Initiation Step Involving CH Bond Activation
Graphical Abstract
Three is better than two: CrIII silicates, in contrast to the CrII analogues, were found to be efficient ethylene-polymerization catalysts that initiate the reaction without a cocatalyst through the heterolytic splitting of an ethylene CH bond across a CrO bond (see picture). This study provides clues about the active sites and initiation mechanism of the industrial Phillips catalyst.
Abstract
The insertion of an olefin into a preformed metalcarbon bond is a common mechanism for transition-metal-catalyzed olefin polymerization. However, in one important industrial catalyst, the Phillips catalyst, a metalcarbon bond is not present in the precatalyst. The Phillips catalyst, CrO3 dispersed on silica, polymerizes ethylene without an activator. Despite 60years of intensive research, the active sites and the way the first CrC bond is formed remain unknown. We synthesized well-defined dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites on silica. Whereas the CrII material was a poor polymerization catalyst, the CrIII material was active. Poisoning studies showed that about 65% of the CrIII sites were active, a far higher proportion than typically observed for the Phillips catalyst. Examination of the spent catalyst and isotope labeling experiments showed the formation of a Si(μ-OH)CrIII species, consistent with an initiation mechanism involving the heterolytic activation of ethylene at CrIIIO bonds.
Olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts contain a metalcarbon (or a metalhydride) bond and an open coordination site to accommodate incoming molecules of ethylene (Scheme1, A). Coordination of ethylene forms the alkylethylene complex B, which undergoes olefin insertion to give C. Growth of the polymer chain is a repetition of this step until chain transfer occurs. Chain transfer depends on the conditions and chosen catalyst, but generally takes place through β-hydride elimination, transmetalation to an alkyl aluminum species, hydrogenolysis, or through a direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene molecule.1 The metal product then reenters the catalytic cycle.

Generally accepted mechanism for ethylene polymerization by metalalkyl complexes.
Generation of the catalytically active polymerization species containing the necessary metalcarbon bond, whether ZieglerNatta catalysts or more well defined systems, requires the treatment of the precatalyst, typically a supported or ligated metal chloride, with alkyl aluminum reagents, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or triethylaluminum.2 Alternatively, metalalkyl derivatives are treated with a Lewis acid to abstract one of the alkyl groups to generate the active species.3
Exploitation of this general mechanism has led to a large family of catalysts that can polymerize olefins with control of the polymer molecular-weight distribution,4 incorporate long-chain branches,5 and stereoselectively polymerize α-olefins.6 This mechanism applies to chain-shuttling catalysis,7 surface-supported organometallic species,8 and cationic/neutral nickel9 and palladium10 complexes that can tolerate polar functionalities.11
The chromium-based Phillips catalyst seemingly defies this mechanism. This catalyst, discovered in 1951, currently accounts for 4050% of global linear high-density polyethylene (PE).12 The catalyst precursor is prepared by dispersing CrO3 on silica; exposure to ethylene forms a reduced chromium active site that polymerizes ethylene without a cocatalyst. The absence of a preformed CrC bond in this composition separates this class of catalysts from the family of olefin-insertion catalysts mentioned above.
Spectroscopic analysis of the Phillips catalyst involves multiple techniques (IR, UV/Vis, EPR, XAS, etc.) to obtain data about the surface Cr species.13 Since only about 10% of the chromium present is active in polymerization,14 the spectroscopic information relates mostly to inactive sites. Due to this obstacle, even fundamental information about the Phillips catalyst, such as the active-site structure and the functional oxidation state, remain controversial. From spectroscopic studies, the major species observed in the reduced Phillips catalyst are isolated CrII sites, which are often interpreted as active species.15 Related empirical studies have shown that silica-supported CrIII salts are ethylene-polymerization catalysts.16 These complications limit the understanding of this catalyst. The grafting of inorganic chromium compounds17 or organometallic chromium complexes onto silica18 has also been investigated, although in each case access to isolated CrII or CrIII silicates was not possible owing to the incorporation of ligands around the metal center. Herein, we describe the formation and detailed characterization of silica-supported dinuclear CrII and CrIII sites. We found that the CrIII silicates are highly active, in contrast to the CrII analogues, and we propose that ethylene polymerization initiates through the heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on a CrO bond.
The ligand environment around the chromium center is critical for metal-silicate formation. We chose tri-tert-butoxysiloxy (OSi(OtBu)3) as a ligand for the coordination of chromium because these complexes are known to decompose at relatively low temperatures (ca. 200C) into silica materials through the loss of isobutene, tert-butanol, and water.19 We envisioned that the grafting of a hypothetical CrII complex containing only OSi(OtBu)3 ligands on silica dehydroxylated at 700C (ca. 0.8SiOHnm1), followed by thermal treatment, would yield well-defined CrII sites on the silica surface without additional ligands.
Cr{N(SiMe3)2}22THF20 was treated with two equivalents of HOSi(OtBu)3 to give the blue crystalline CrII dimer [{Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)2}2] (1) in 60% yield. The 1HNMR spectrum of 1 in C6D6 contained a broad signal at δ=1.77ppm (ν1/2=530Hz, μeff=5.99μB). Compound 1 crystallized as two independent molecules in the unit cell with similar bond lengths and angles; one of the molecules is shown in Scheme2. Compound 1 contains two chromium atoms in distorted square-planar geometries, typical for high-spin CrII species. The CrCr distance in 1 is 2.884(2)Å, which is outside the range for significant metalmetal bonding. The terminal Cr(2A)O(1A) and Cr(1A)O(4A) bonds have a length of 1.934(4) and 1.984(4)Å, respectively, similar to other chromium siloxide complexes.21 The bridging CrO(2A) and CrO(3A) distances are slightly longer than the terminal CrO bonds. Besides the terminal and bridging chromiumoxygen bonds in 1, two OSi(OtBu)3 ligands coordinate through a OtBu fragment to satisfy the distorted square-planar geometry; these distances are longer (2.109(4) and 2.167(4)Å, respectively).

Grafting of 1 on SiO2700 to form [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) and thermal decomposition under high vacuum to yield [(SiO)4Cr2] (3). The solid-state structure obtained by X-ray diffraction for an independent molecule of 1 is shown at 50% probability. Methyl groups of OSi(OtBu)3 ligands and Hatoms have been removed for clarity.
When a blue solution of 1 in benzene was brought in contact with silica (Aerosil-200) partially dehydroxylated at 700C (0.26mmolSiOHg1), immediate blue coloration of the solid resulted. A combination of mass-balance (0.16mmolSiOHg1) and elemental analysis (0.31mmolCrg1; 18Catoms per Cratom) was consistent with the presence of chromium dimers on the silica surface and indicated that [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2; Scheme2) had formed. Thermal treatment of [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) under high vacuum (105mbar) yielded the blue solid [(SiO)4Cr2] (3; Scheme2). Analysis of the volatile products gave 3.6equivalents of isobutene and 1.1equivalents of tBuOH per Cratom, which is close to the expected value of 4.5 C4products per Cratom. The infrared spectrum of this material lacked νCH bands but did contain new silanol vibrations. Exposure of [(SiO)4Cr2] (3) to excess CO resulted in one νCO band at 2189cm1, thus indicating a rather narrow distribution of surface species. This particular vibration has been observed for the reduced Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst upon exposure to CO, although multiple other vibrations are also observed because many Cr sites are present in the Phillips catalyst.22
We performed XAS experiments at the Cr K-edge to gain deeper insight into the structure and oxidation state of the grafted species. X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES) spectra for the molecular precursor 1, [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(SiO)4Cr2] (3) are shown in Figure1. The XANES spectrum of the molecular species 1 is nearly identical to those of [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2) and [(SiO)4Cr2] (3), thus indicating that the oxidation state and the local geometric structure of chromium in these materials is very similar to those in molecular precursor 1.

XANES spectra (collected in the transmission mode) of 1, [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), [(SiO)4Cr2] (3), [(SiO)6Cr2] (4), and 5.
The results of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of 1, [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(SiO)4Cr2] (3) are summarized in Table1. The CrO, CrSi, and CrCr scattering paths used in our model correspond to the nearest neighbors present in 1. To reduce the number of variables, we used oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the average CrO distance in each species (Table1). For 1, we compared the average CrO fit with a fit based on four independent oxygen scattering paths corresponding to the CrO distances in the crystal structure of 1. The quality of both fits (see the Supporting Information) was statistically similar. We used this approach for all structures, which explains the higher effective DebyeWaller factors for the Ocoordination shell (Table1).

We anticipated that [(SiO)4Cr2] (3) would initiate ethylene polymerization because this material contains CrII sites on silica. The polymerization activity of [(SiO)4Cr2] was monitored at a low ethylene pressure (ca. 300mbar) in a glass reactor equipped with an IR cell. To accurately determine the polymerization activities, we used Sylopol-948, an amorphous silica support composed of particles that fragment when polymer is formed, to avoid mass-transfer limitations. [(SiO)4Cr2] has a low initial polymerization activity of 1.6kgPE(molCr)1h1. The addition of 4-methylpyridine (20mol%) to this material resulted in negligible polymerization activity. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum of [(SiO)4Cr2] at 100K contained a weak EPR signal that is characteristic CrIII, suggesting that the active sites on [(SiO)4Cr2] could arise from small amounts of CrIII. This result was surprising owing to the wealth of literature that has implicated CrII as the active site during polymerization catalysis.12,15b,23
The treatment of [(SiO)4Cr2] with N2O, as inspired by a recent report showing that N2O increases the ethylene-polymerization activity of the reduced Phillips catalyst,24 led to the formation of the CrIII dimer [(SiO)6Cr2] (4; Scheme3c). The Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] (Figure1) was shifted relative to those of 1, [(SiO)Cr2(OSi(OtBu)3)3] (2), and [(SiO)4Cr2] (3). Also, a pre-edge feature at 59905992eV appeared. Exposure of [(SiO)6Cr2] (4) to ethylene at 25C resulted in the rapid saturation of the νCH region in the IR spectrum and the formation of a white film on the pellet, thus indicating ethylene polymerization.

Although the XANES spectrum is consistent with the oxidation of [(SiO)4Cr2] (3) by N2O to give [(SiO)6Cr2] (4), we confirmed this proposal by preparing the corresponding molecular analogue. Exposure of the CrII dimer 1 to N2O resulted in purple single crystals of 5 (Scheme3a,b). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the two five-coordinate CrIII centers had different geometries: Cr(1) adopted a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, whereas the Cr(2) center had a square-pyramidal geometry typical of five-coordinate metal species. The CrCr distance in 5 was 2.966(1)Å and thus slightly longer than in 1. Importantly, the Cr K-edge XANES spectrum of 5 contained similar edge and pre-edge features to those of [(SiO)6Cr2] (4). This result confirms that the chromium centers in [(SiO)6Cr2] are in the +3 oxidation state and have a similar coordination geometry to those in 5. The results of the EXAFS analysis of 5 and [(SiO)6Cr2] are given in Table1 and show similar environments between the molecular and the surface species.
The [(SiO)6Cr2] surface species displayed an initial ethylene-polymerization activity of 19kgPE(molCr)1h1, roughly one order of magnitude higher than that found for [(SiO)4Cr2]. The higher activity of CrIII is not surprising in view of what has been shown in homogeneous catalysis.25 In a fixed-bed reactor at 70C under gas-phase polymerization conditions, the activity increased to 107kgPE(molCr)1h1 at an ethylene pressure of 6bar. The polymer obtained under high-pressure conditions had a number-average molecular weight of Mn=5500gmol1, a weight-average molecular weight of Mw=52000gmol1, and a dispersity =Mw/Mn=9.4. The 1H and 13CNMR spectra of the polymer were consistent with linear polyethylene containing 1.5branches per 1000 Catoms as well as olefin and methyl end groups. The broad polymer dispersity indicates multisite behavior. Despite the well-defined first coordination sphere in [(SiO)6Cr2] as established by XAS, there are probably small variations in the chromium environment as a result of the amorphous silica surface; these variations would impact the rate of polymerization and/or chain transfer.26
We also evaluated the number of active sites in [(SiO)6Cr2] by carrying out poisoning experiments with 4-methylpyridine (see the Supporting Information for details). The ethylene-polymerization activity, monitored by IR spectroscopy under a low ethylene pressure, decreased linearly with increasing amounts of catalyst poison. The estimated number of active sites present in [(SiO)6Cr2] on the basis of this method is at least 65%. This result indicates that the surface chromium(III) sites in [(SiO)6Cr2], characterized by XANES and EXAFS, are related to the active sites.
[(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene contains some intriguing features. The XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene is identical to that of pristine [(SiO)6Cr2]. The IR spectrum of this material contains the expected νCH and δCH vibrations associated with the polymer chain, and a vibration observed at 3692cm1 for surface silanols interacting with the polymer chain.27 Two new OH bands are also present: a major vibration at approximately 3605cm1 and a minor vibration at 3640cm1. These vibrations, which we assign to Si(μ-OH)CrIII interactions, are typical of SiOH groups interacting with an adjacent Lewis acidic metal center and are often observed for crystalline zeolitic materials.28 The formation of Si(μ-OH)CrIII interactions would arise from the CH activation of ethylene across a CrOSi bond. Consistent with this proposal, when [(SiO)6Cr2] was brought into contact with C2D4, an isotopically shifted Si(μ-OD)CrIII band was observed at 2580cm1 (expected at 2575cm1; see the Supporting Information).
From these results, we propose the following polymerization mechanism (Scheme4): Polymerization is initiated through CH bond activation of ethylene across one of the CrO bonds in [(SiO)6Cr2] (4). This reaction results in the formation of a surface chromium(III) species 6 that contains a chromiumvinyl group, two anionic siloxides, and one SiOH group. The intermediate 6 can insert ethylene, and chain growth continues through a classical CosseeArlman insertion mechanism. Chain termination could be the microreverse of the initiation step, proton transfer from the coordinated silanol to the carbon atom bound to Cr, or through direct β-proton transfer to a coordinated ethylene to liberate a polymer chain containing olefinic and methyl end groups with regeneration of the neutral CrIII site.

Proposed mechanism for ethylene polymerization by [(SiO)6Cr2].
The key step in this mechanism is the heterolytic CH activation of ethylene, a process that conserves the oxidation state of chromium and is consistent with the XANES spectrum of [(SiO)6Cr2] exposed to ethylene. On metal-oxide surfaces, the activation of CH bonds often occurs heterolytically by σ-bond-metathesis-type mechanisms.29 Trivalent Lewis acid sites are particularly prone to activate CH bonds; for example, tricoordinate Al sites of highly dehydroxylated γ-Al2O3 activate methane and other hydrocarbons at low temperatures.30 Alkane dehydrogenation over Cr/Al2O3 or Ga/Zn-zeolite were also proposed to occur through CH activation and the formation of metalalkyl surface species as key intermediates.29,31
We have described the formation of isolated CrII and CrIII dinuclear surface species by a molecular approach. The well-defined CrII sites are not efficient olefin-polymerization catalysts, but CrIII sites do polymerize ethylene. Like the Phillips catalyst, these materials polymerize ethylene in the absence of alkyl aluminum cocatalysts or preformed CrC bonds. The formation of the first CrC bond, key to ethylene polymerization, occurs through heterolytic CH bond activation of ethylene on the CrIII silicates in [(SiO)6Cr2]. This mechanistic insight clearly distinguishes chromium-based catalysts from other olefin-insertion polymerization catalysts and opens new avenues for the manipulation of these materials to produce a wider range of polymer properties.
