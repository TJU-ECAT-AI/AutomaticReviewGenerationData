A new cell capable of obtaining infrared spectra of molecules adsorbed on catalysts within a wide temperature range has been
described. The cell was used to obtain spectra between 100 and 294 K from physically and chemically adsorbed ethene on a 16%
w/w platinum-on-silica catalyst with metal particle sizes predominantly in the range 515 nm.
Between 129 and 189 K, the spectra of the chemisorbed species were attributed to the presence of two closely related p-
adsorbed ethene species with absorptions at 3022(medium)/1500(medium) and 3016(medium to weak)/1496(medium to weak)
cm1, respectively; and to another pair of
adsorbed species (M \ metal atom), designated di-r* and di-r, respec-
MCH2CH2M
tively, with absorptions at 2922(medium to strong)/2830(weak)/ca. 1428(medium to strong, broad) and 2906(medium to strong)/
ca. 2820/ca. 1419(medium to strong, broad) cm1.
Between 206 and 294 K, the spectrum of the di-r species was gradually replaced by new absorptions at 2883(strong)/
2795(weak)/1342(very strong) cm1 attributed to the ethylidyne species
that widely occurs on triangular adsorption
CH3CM3
sites of [111] faces. It is deduced that the di-r species also occurs on facets of this type on the metal particles. It is assumed that
the more stable di-r* species occurs on other types of facet such as [100] or [110]. An alternative, but less preferred attribution
to the di-r* designated spectrum is to an ethylylidyne species, M3CCH2M.
A strong shoulder to the 2922/2906 cm1 di-r*/di-r absorptions at ca. 2958 cm1 is tentatively attributed to another l(CH2)-s
mode of the p-adsorbed species. A less-preferred alternative would be to a
of an ethyl group. Reasons are given for not
l(CH3)-as
attributing this absorption to an ethylidene species, CH3CHM2 .

Introduction
The adsorption and reactivity of ethene (ethylene) on nely
divided particles of oxide-supported metal catalysts have been
studied extensively in the past using IR spectroscopy in
pursuit of an understanding of the mechanisms of the metal-
catalysed reactions of alkenes.1 These studies have shown that
spectral complexities frequently appear due to the occurrence
of a number of adsorbed species, rather than a single one.
These dierent species are related to dierent types of adsorp-
tion sites on amorphous or crystalline but multi-faceted metal
particles. This type of problem has been usually overcome
with the help of simplied spectra obtained from ethene
adsorption
on
particular
planes
of
single-crystal
metal-
surfaces, and from hydrocarbon ligands of well known struc-
tures in metal-cluster compounds.2 The analyses of these
spectra have implied the application of the metal surface selec-
tion rule (MSSR).3,4 This determines that the intensity of an
absorption depends only on the square of the electrical dipole
change perpendicular to at metal surfaces, or on large metal
particles with diameter [2 nm.5,6 The vibrational modes in
question are always the completely symmetrical ones of the
surface complex.7
In this work, which extends our earlier studies,8,9 we report
in situ IR spectroscopic measurements of the adsorption and
dehydrogenation of ethene on a silica-supported platinum
catalyst under dynamic conditions of warming from 100 K to
ambient temperature.

nated silica powder (Cabosil-H5, Cabot Corporation, Boston,
USA) was pressed into a self-supporting circular disc of 25
mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness. The sample disc was
placed in an evacuable cell (see Section 2.2). This was con-
nected to a stationary vacuum line that routinely achieved
pressures of 106 Torr (1 Torr \ 133.3 Pa). The disc was then
reduced in hydrogen for 6 h at 673 K to give a ca. 16% w/w
Pt-on-silica sample. After the reduction, the sample was evac-
uated overnight at 673 K to give a hydrogen-depleted Pt/SiO2
catalyst. Transmission and scanning electron micrographs of
this catalyst were recorded using a JEOL Jem-100 CX micro-
scope operating at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and with
magnications of up to 5 ] 105. The micrographs showed
particles with diameters mostly in the range 515 nm. The
larger particles showed crystalline faces with rounded edges.

Description of the cell for spectroscopic work
The cell is shown in Fig. 1.11 It consists of two parts joined by
a Teon O-ring between two metal anges. It is held in place
by three-bolt couplings to ensure a seal for high vacuum.
The upper part of the cell is of Pyrex glass except for the
sample-disc holder assembly. This is a 1.3 ] 1.3 in stainless-
steel ring which was screwed into the cavity in such a way that
a 0.02 in gap was left close to the sample. The block also
contains two externally machined pockets in opposite sites,
which are 0.075 in deep and have an inside diameter of 0.875
in; each pocket accommodates eight turns of 8.86 ) m1
Nichrome wire (A. B. Kanthal, Hallstahammar, Sweden) for
the purpose of heating the disc with a glass-bre sleeve. The
block is soldered to a stainless-steel socket with low-melting
cadmium-free silver solder, and joined to a Pyrex tube, which
acts as a coolant reservoir. The heating and cooling tem-
peratures were measured with a chromel/alumel thermocouple
and

The use of a movable vacuum-line11 permitted the per-
formance of in situ experiments with the IR cell positioned

Spectroscopic procedure
The procedure used to obtain the spectra was as follows. The
sample
was
cooled
to
the
lowest
possible
temperature
obtained in the cell using liquid nitrogen (ca. 100 K). The
sample was then allowed to warm from low to ambient tem-
perature by IR radiation and by gradual loss of liquid nitro-
gen.
During
this
process,
26
successive
single-beam
backgrounds of the sample were collected using a Digilab
FT-20

spectrometer,

spectra \ 8 s). After collection of these spectra, the sample was
again cooled to 100 K. Then, the surface of the sample was
saturated with a dose of ethene (\1 Torr) that produced a
patchy deposit of small white crystals (melting point ca. 104
K12) followed by a repeat of the warming experiment from
low to ambient temperature. Again, 26 successive single-beam
spectra of the sample plus adsorbed species plus gas phase
were collected using the same spectral parameters described
for collection of the single-beam backgrounds of the sample.
The temperatures that corresponded to the end of the scan-
ning time of each individual spectrum were recorded during
the warming experiment. Each single-beam spectrum of this
series was then ratioed against the best matched single-beam
background of the sample yielding the spectra shown in Fig. 2
and 3. Obviously these spectra contain information from all
frequencies within the accessible wavenumber range (4000
1300 cm1) of the system, which is limited by the
trans-
SiO2
mission. This includes bands from the adsorbed species as well
as bands of gas-phase ethene produced by the gradual transfer
of the multilayer from the surface of the sample to the cooler
metallic cavity of the cell, and at higher temperatures solely to
the gas phase. To obtain the spectra of the adsorbed species,
shown in Fig. 3 (without contributions from the gas phase),
separate experiments were performed in which a typical dose
of ethene was condensed on the metallic walls of the empty
cavity of the cell using liquid nitrogen. The cell, which was
then acting as a reservoir of ethene, was allowed to warm by
the gradual loss of liquid nitrogen, and once again 26 suc-
cessive single-beam spectra of the gas phase were collected
with the same parameters that were used for the adsorbed
species plus gas phase. Each of these single-beam spectra was
later ratioed against the corresponding single-beam back-
ground of the empty cell. Some of these spectra were then
used for subtraction of the gas-phase features from the spectra
of the adsorbed species plus gas phase at selected tem-
peratures, namely 160, 189 and 294 K. However, this method
produced some residual spectra miscancellations. They are
marked by the asterisks in Fig. 4.

Results and Discussion

IR spectrum of the ethene multilayer on the Pt/SiO2
catalyst at 100 K
Fig. 2 shows the dierence spectrum of the
catalyst
Pt/SiO2
before and after the addition of ethene at 100 K. Table 1 col-
lects the spectral information relevant to the ethene multi-
layer, and compares it with analogous data for polycrystalline
ethene deposited on an AgCl window at 65 K,12,13,14 and on
an
sample at 200 K.15 It also lists the vibrational data of
SiO2
ethene in the gas phase.16,17 Fig. 2 shows that the ethene
deposit physically perturbs the surface OH groups of the SiO2
support as the sharp band at 3747 cm1 [which is attributed
to the l(OH) of the surface OH groups free of hydrogen
bonding18] is replaced by a new band at 3628 cm1 with a
very much greater bandwidth (ca. 83 cm1). This band is
associated with weak interactions (hydrogen-bonding-like)
between the ethene deposit and the surface silanol groups.
This type of interaction also aects the ethene molecules
because their vibrational wavenumbers are perturbed from the
gas-phase values as discussed in the following sections.

xCH2
number values listed in Table 1 show that two IR- and one
Raman-active

tals of ethene are activated upon adsorption, and that their
maximum absorptions are shifted systematically towards
lower wavenumbers compared with the gas-phase values, i.e.

There is another band at 3070 cm1 but it is too low in fre-

value.

Alternative access to such low-frequency fundamentals is by
analysis of their combinations that, although weak, are detect-
able in regions where the sample absorbance is low. In our
case, it is possible to observe the absorptions of the (l8 ] l12)

Such bands are shifted from ca. 2387 to 2349 cm1, and from
ca. 2168 to 2146 cm1, respectively, with respect to the gas
phase. These values indicate that the corresponding xCH2
wag and
rock wavenumbers are both shifted down-
xCH2
wards.
On comparing our ethene data (vibrational activities, wave-
numbers, intensities and bandwidths) with those of Table 1,
we conclude that the multilayer deposit is amorphous (i.e. dis-
ordered and glass-like) rather than crystalline, and that further
distortions occur within the rst few layers that enhance the
intensities of the vibrational forbidden modes due to inter-
actions with the
surface of the catalyst.

IR spectroscopic identication of the chemisorbed species
from ethene on the
catalyst between 100 and 294 K
Pt/SiO2
Before we discuss the results from the chemisorbed species of
ethene on the
catalyst, note should be taken of the
Pt/SiO2
strong negative absorption at ca. 2087 cm1 and the much
weaker positive absorptions at ca. 2060, 2040, 1880 and 1840
cm1 that appear in the dierence spectrum of Fig. 2. These
were brought about by adsorption of residual CO in the
vacuum line. A recent IR spectroscopic exploration10 of the
Pt crystallites of the same catalyst that is used here indicates
that these absorptions belong to linear CO species (those in
the range 20902040 cm1) and bridged or multiply bonded
CO species (those at 1880 and 1840 cm1). These assignments
were supported on the spectra of CO ligands in metal coordi-
nation compounds or clusters of well known X-ray crystallo-
graphic structures.19,20 This exploration suggests that the
absorptions from the bridged CO species can be associated
with [111] facets, and with a minor proportion of [100] and
[110] facets of the Pt crystallites.10 Our present spectrum
clearly indicates that the ethene condensation desorbed a pro-
portion of CO into the gas phase and modied the remaining
CO adlayer. This in turn provided free space on the Pt facets
for the chemisorption of ethene. An examination of the spec-
trum in Fig. 2 shows the presence of two strongly overlapping
bands at 2922 and 2906 cm1, and another weaker band at
1500 cm1, which are not associated with the ethene multi-
layer.
Fig.
3
shows
selected
spectra
in
the
and
l(CH2)
regions obtained during the thermal evolu-
l(CxC)/d(CH2)
tion of the ethene adlayer between 100 and 294 K. Notice that
these spectra also show features from gas-phase ethene (Q-
branches at 3106, 2988 and 1443 cm1 accompanied by
vibrationrotation PR wings), which indicate the removal of
the ethene multilayer to the gas phase. Notice also that the
bands at 2922, 2906 and 1500 cm1 remain between 100 and
160 K without large changes in frequencies and intensities.
However, on warming from 160294 K, the band at 2906
cm1 disappears gradually while new absorptions appear at
2883, 2795 and 1342 cm1. These observations indicate that
these bands must be associated with chemisorbed species, and
that a further reaction of the adsorbed species occurs on the
catalyst above 189 K. It now remains to identify the
Pt/SiO2
chemical nature of the several species. This is possible as a
result of extensive earlier vibrational spectroscopic and dif-
fractometric work on the chemical nature of the adsorbed
species from ethene on single-crystal Pt surfaces,21h46 and
from hydrocarbon ligands in cluster compounds.47h58 The rel-
evant information from these studies is summarized in Table
2, where the band positions are compared with our experi-
mental data. The overall agreement is satisfactory, and allows
us to classify the chemisorbed species on the

also observed in the IRVIS sum frequency generation (SFG)
spectrum during the dynamic ethene hydrogenation over a
Pt[111] surface at 295 K.33 There is now general agreement
that these bands correspond to p-ethene complexes (structure
I in Fig. 5), which are relatively weakly perturbed by the
single-crystal platinum surfaces.59
The IR spectra obtained from adsorption of ethene on the
catalyst conform very well to the above expectations
Pt/SiO2
(see Fig. 4). After subtraction of the gas-phase ethene-
absorption features, the low-temperature spectrum at 189 K
reveals bands at 3022 and 1500 cm1. By 294 K, these bands
appear at 3016 and 1496 cm1. It is worth noting that the
bands at 3016 and 1496 cm1 can be accommodated in the
tails of the stronger bands at 3022 and 1500 cm1. This sug-
gests that there are two p-ethene complexes in our sample at
low temperature, probably on slightly dierent sites, one of
which is desorbed at ambient temperature. The spectroscopic
data indicate that the remaining, stable p-complex has slightly
more of a metallocyclopropane character (see structure II in
Fig. 5)49 than the desorbed p-complex.

species could be ethylylidyne.21,22,24 An organometallic ana-
logue of this (structure VII, Fig. 5) has been isolated,56 but it
has not yet been characterized spectroscopically.
The IR spectra from ethene adsorption on the
cata-
Pt/SiO2
lyst between 100 and 200 K (see Fig. 3 and 4) show three pairs
of adjacent bands at 2922 and 2906, 2830 and 2820, 1428 and
1419 cm1 above the silica cut-o (at ca. 1300 cm1). Notice
that the bands at 2906, 2820 and 1419 cm1 decreased in pro-
portion to the increases in intensity of the new absorptions at
2883, 2795 and 1342 cm1 (assigned to ethylidyne as dis-
cussed below) as temperature of the sample was raised from
ca. 206 K to ambient. Notice also that the 2922, 2830 and
1428 cm1 bands remained. We have earlier interpreted these
changes in the light of data from single-crystal platinum sur-
faces as indicating that two di-r
complexes occur at low
C2H4
temperature on two dierent platinum sites, only one of which
is converted to ethylidyne at ambient temperature.8 The other
complex (previously referred to as the di-r*
complex1(a))
C2H4
remains. The comparable intensities of the 2922 and 2906
cm1 bands at low temperature suggest that at ambient tem-
perature there are an approximately equal number of di-r*
complexes and derived ethylidyne species. It is very
C2H4
probable that the di-r
to ethylidyne process occurs on
C2H4
triangular sites of [111]-like facets. The remaining di-r*
species was presumed to occur on less symmetrical sites, such
as those provided by the [100], [110], [210] facets, of the
platinum particles of our catalyst. As mentioned above, since
our earlier paper,8 bands in the ca. 2940 cm1 region have
been alternatively assigned to ethylylidyne,
from
M3CCH2M,
VEELS data on Pt[110] and Pt[210] surfaces.22,24 Although
such species could conceivably be responsible for the 2920
cm1 band, we prefer our original suggestion of a di-r* C2H4
species.

related to dipolar coupling eects within the ethylidyne
adlayer. This has been demonstrated in an IR study of isotopi-
cally substituted ethylidynes
and
(13CH3w12C

adsorbed on a
catalyst,60 which clearly showed
Pt/Al2O3
dipolar coupling of the umbrella mode of the ethylidyne
species, as expected for side-by-side adsorption on at [111]
surface facets. A recent study by scanning tunnelling micros-
copy (STM)61 has shown that the thermal conversion of the
di-r
complex to ethylidyne on Pt[111] may depend on
C2H4
the availability of the appropriated ensemble of metal atoms,
since the reaction appears to take place preferentially on the
boundaries between the islands formed by the di-r
and
C2H4
ethylidyne
species.
The
same
phenomenon
is
perhaps
occurring on the [111] facets of our catalyst.
Possible structural assignments for the ca. 2958 cm1
absorption. There remains a medium-strength shoulder at ca.
2958 cm1 (Fig. 4, spectral le 10) for attribution to a chemi-
sorbed species. In group-frequency terms this is likely to cor-
respond to the bond-stretching mode of a
or a
CH2
CH3
group. If the surface species is of an alkyl nature, the absorp-
tion would correspond to an asymetrical stretching mode of a
group, which give their strongest absorption within the
CH3
29702950 cm1 range. Two such possibilities are ethyl
or ethylidene

the same position (2957 cm1) has recently been observed by
SFG in a temperature-dependent study of the di-r to ethyl-
idyne transformation on Pt[111],32,33 where it was attributed
to ethylidene as the intermediate in the reaction. However, in
that case the absorption was at its maximum intensity when
the di-r to ethylidyne transformation was at its greatest,
whereas in the present case the 2958 cm1 shoulder occurs in
the spectrum that, as yet, shows no trace of ethylidyne absorp-
tion at ca. 2880 cm1. Also, in so far as the spectrum from the
model compound is a reliable guide to intensities, a second
absorption near 2850 cm1 should have an intensity only
slightly less than that of the
mode at 2950 cm1.
l(CH3)-as
Only a very weak absorption at ca. 2830 cm1 is discernible
in the spectrum of Fig. 4 (le 10). A surface ethyl group,
formed from adsorbed ethene and hydrogen retained by the
catalyst, remains a possible choice for the attribution to the
2958 cm1 absorption as observed at 189 K.64,66
In terms of possible unsaturated surface species, vinyl or
vinylidene seem to be unlikely candidates as their CH-
stretching absorptions occur above 2990 cm1, judging from
the

a cor-
Pt/Al2O3
responding band at 2955 cm1 has been attributed by Mohsin
et al.70 to this mode with an intensity not much less than that
of the completely symmetrical mode at 3018 cm1 (3022 cm1
in Fig. 4, le 10). Furthermore, in a comparison of two such
spectra from ethene adsorbed on the present type of large-
particle Pt catalyst, Fig. 6A71 and 6B8 of ref. 1(a), of which
our present spectrum is Fig. 6B (with the temperature erron-
ously quoted as 195 K rather than 189 K), it is seen that the
spectrum at 128 K of Fig. 6A has weaker versions of both the
3020 and ca. 2955 cm1 absorptions. It is also seen by com-
parison with the spectrum of Fig. 4, le 25, that once again
both the 3016 and 2958 cm1 absorptions have weakened
relative to their intensities in le 10, although the true inten-
sity of this is difficult to evaluate because of a possible broad
background absorption.
We have previously assumed that the application of the
MSSR to such large-particle catalysts would only allow
observation of the completely symmetrical
mode of the
l(CH2)
p-complex at ca. 3020 cm1. However, selective observation
of the ca. 2958 cm1
band would still be consistent with
(b3u)
operation of the MSSR if the CC axis of the p-complex was
tilted towards the surface. This could be the case on rough
parts of the metal particles and such tilting away from the
surface normal is well established for CO adsorbed on [110]
metal surfaces.71h73
Again it is possible that other less symmetrical l(CH2)
modes of the di-r
complex could occur in the 2950
C2H4
cm1 region, but then one would not expect the observed
intensity variability of the di-r/di-r* absorptions with respect
to the ca. 2920 and 2906 cm1 bands.
Clearly more experimental work is necessary to identify reli-
ably the surface species that gives rise to the 2958 cm1
feature, but at this stage we prefer the hypothesis that it rep-
resents a second absorption of the p-complex. In a number of
spectra from ethene on
or
[Fig. 6 and 7 of
Pt/SiO2
Pt/Al2O3
ref. 1(a)] there is a reasonable relationship between the inten-
sities of this and the ca. 3020 cm1 feature.

Comparison with other IR spectroscopic studies on nely
divided oxide-supported platinum catalysts
The above interpretations of the spectra of the chemisorbed
species occurring on our
catalyst with metal particles
Pt/SiO2
in the 515 nm range are consistent with the MSSR. In a
related study of the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethene
on a
catalyst with smaller metal particles (\2 nm)
Pt/Al2O3
between 140 K and ambient temperature, the same conclu-
sions were drawn by Mohsin et al.70 for the di-r
to
C2H4
ethylidyne conversion on [111] facets, but the second set of
di-r* bands at 2922, 2830 and 1428 cm1 were not observed.
In that case only a single
complex and a single di-r
p-C2H4
species absorbing at 3073/3018/2998/2955/1498 cm1
C2H4
and 2912/1427 cm1, respectively, were found at 180 K. Upon
warming to ambient temperature, the di-r form rearranges to
produce ethylidyne, which shows the well characterized bands
at 2884, 2795 and 1339 cm1. Moreover, the lower wavenum-
ber transmission of
also allowed identication of the
Al2O3
other coupled
mode of the
complex
l(CxC)/d(CH2)
p-C2H4
at 1203 cm1, and of the totally symmetrical l(CwC) mode at
1128 cm1 of ethylidyne. The continuing occurrence of the
di-r* (or ethylylidine) complex on our catalyst at ambient
temperature possibly reects the presence of more and larger
crystalline facets with sections of non-[111] morphology on
the larger platinum particles.

Conclusions
The new design of an IR cell has been successfully used to
obtain spectra from ethene adsorbed on a
catalyst
Pt/SiO2
between 100 and 294 K.
Below ca. 200 K the spectra of the chemisorbed species
(which below 189 K coexist with spectra from physically
adsorbed ethene) can be interpreted in terms of the presence of
pairs of p-adsorbed and di-r*/di-r adsorbed species on dier-
ent sites on the metal particle. Between 189 and 294 K, one of
the p-adsorbed species is desorbed. The di-r designated spec-
trum is gradually transformed into one from the ethylidyne
species, known to occur on [111] surface facets. Its di-r pre-
cursor is assumed to also occur on such facets and the more

stable di-r* to be associated with other sites, perhaps those on
[100] or [110] surfaces. It is considered less likely that the

(M3CCH2M)
A shoulder to the di-r*/di-r absorptions at ca. 2958 cm1
is tentatively attributed to another
mode of the p-
l(CH2)-s
adsorbed species. A less preferred assignment of this band
would be to a
of an ethyl surface group, which is
l(CH3)-as
formed from adsorbed ethene and hydrogen retained by the
catalyst. There are spectroscopic reasons for not attributing
this absorption to an ethylidene species,
despite a

close similarity in band position.
