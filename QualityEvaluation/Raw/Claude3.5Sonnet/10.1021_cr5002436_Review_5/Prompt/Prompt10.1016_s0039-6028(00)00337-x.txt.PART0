Abstract
The thermal chemistry of propylene on Pt(111) single-crystal surfaces was studied under vacuum by using temperature-
programmed desorption spectroscopy. Besides molecular desorption and hydrogen production from propylene dehydro-
genation (first to propylidyne and eventually to surface carbon), a small amount of propane from self-hydrogenation of
the olefin is detected at about 280 K. Hydrogen coadsorption weakens the adsorption of propylene on the surface, and
enhances the production of propane. In addition to deuteration to propane, deuterium coadsorption with propylene
leads to HD exchange. Multiple exchange is evidenced by the formation of all possible deuterium-substituted propylenes
and propanes, including propylene-d6 and propane-d8. A detailed analysis of the data provided support for a mechanism
where the slow half-hydrogenation of propylene to propyl species is followed by competitive b-hydride and reductive
elimination, to (exchanged) propylene and propane, respectively. The unexpectedly low yields of propylene-d5 and
propane-d7 suggest a preferential hydrogenation at the central carbon atom. Most of the propylene that remains on the
surface above 350 K dehydrogenates to propylidyne (Pt3OCMCH2MCH3). A small fraction of that species rehydro-
genates to propane at 430 K, while the rest undergoes stepwise dehydrogenation to surface carbon. Arguments against
the formation of an allylic intermediate are provided, and a comparison with the chemistry of ethylene on the same
surface is included.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane has been
proposed to take place via the rate-limiting inser-
tion of the olefin into a platinumhydrogen bond
followed by fast hydrogenation of the resulting
ethyl groups [46]. A similar mechanism is likely
to apply for propylene.
Also in analogy with the ethylene case, hydro-
genation of propyl (the half-hydrogenated inter-
mediate from ethylene insertion) to propane is
expected to compete with b-hydride elimination
back to propylene. TPD experiments with propyl
iodide (a precursor for propyl surface groups) on
Pt(111) do show the production of comparable
amounts of propane and propylene at around
250 K [57]. The interconversion between propylene
and propyl groups provides a vehicle for HD
exchange within the adsorbed olefin. Notice that
the production of some of the propane in the TPD
experiments is accompanied by desorption of H

Indeed, preadsorption of hydrogen on the Pt(111)

to detect on surfaces exposed to 15.0 L of deute-
surface reduces the temperature of that process to
approximately 255 K, and increases the yield of

in fact produced in catalytic experiments with
the resulting propane. Moreover, a large excess of
surface hydrogen triggers the start of a second

<questions>


Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
