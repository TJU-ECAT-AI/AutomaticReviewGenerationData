Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane de-
hydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed
oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas
composition have been varied. Three different peaks were identi-
fied from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to
different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal,
coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The amounts
of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation
of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles
increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hy-
drogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation. The amount
of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with tem-
perature and propane partial pressure. A model is discussed where
a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst. This coke is formed
in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the
TPO experiments. The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not
formed through this route. The experiments with different time on
stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after
about 15 h, while the second one still increased. Hydrogen was very
efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could
not remove coke already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenoly-
sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation
are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The addition of tin to a platinum catalyst has proved to be
an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent
deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming
andalkanedehydrogenationreactions(15).Therefore,the
bimetallic platinum-tin catalyst has received considerable
attention in the last few decades. The goal in most investi-
gations carried out with Pt and PtSn catalysts has been to
study the performance in the reforming process. However,
dehydrogenation of light paraffins is commercially done at
a relatively high temperature, 770900 K (6), and the deac-

tivation rate and coke formation may differ from those in
experiments conducted at lower temperatures.
Many authors have studied the effect of tin in the
formation and composition of the coke by temperature-
programmed oxidation (TPO) (5, 713). The different
peaks found in the TPO profiles have been proposed to
be coke with different locations and different composition.
The effect of the catalyst composition, for example load-
ing of tin, on the coke formed has been investigated in
great detail (9). When tin is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst,
an increased total amount of coke is usually found (1, 4, 5,
14, 15). The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the coke and the
relation of the different peaks in the TPO profiles have
also been analyzed, but often with contradicting results
(5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16).
The issues we have tried to address in this study are: how
will the deactivation change over time and with altered
reaction conditions; are different types of coke formed;
and if so, does the ratio between the types depend on the
conditions; and how does the coke influence the catalyst.
In this paper we present two different studies of deac-
tivated Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation cata-
lysts, where the coke has been deposited using different re-
action conditions. In the first study, the reaction conditions
were held constant except for the deactivation time. In the
second set of experiments, deactivation time has been kept
constant but reaction conditions such as flows and temper-
atures have been changed.
METHODS
Pt/Al2O3 and Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incip-
ient wetness impregnation of a commercial Î³ -alumina sup-
port with aqueous solutions containing either H2PtCl6 or
SnCl2. The bimetallic PtSn catalyst was prepared from the
calcined Sn/Al2O3 catalyst by impregnation with H2PtCl6.
Table 1 shows data from the characterization of the cata-
lysts. The details of preparation and characterization can
be found elsewhere (17).

TPO after Different Times on Stream
Deactivation during different times on stream (TOS)
followed by temperature-programmed oxidation was car-
ried out in the microbalance reactor consisting of a tubular
quartz reactor (15 mm i.d.) fitted to the balance (CI Elec-
tronics Mark 2B).
The catalyst (approx. 55 mg) was placed in a quartz bas-
ket (6 mm i.d.) and suspended from the balance using thin
quartz fibers. The reactor was heated in a vertical electri-
cal furnace, controlled by a thermocouple located immedi-
ately below the basket. Mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst
HI-TEC) regulated the gas flows. All experiments in the re-
actor were performed at atmospheric pressure. For further
details of the reaction setup, see (18).
Reduction was carried out prior to the coking in N2:
20 ml/min and H2: 10 ml/min. A ramp from room temper-
ature to the reduction temperature (789 K), at a speed of
4 K/min, was used. The catalyst was then kept at this tem-
perature for 4 h.
After the reduction, propane and propene were added
to the flow of nitrogen and hydrogen at 789 K. To avoid
concentration gradients in the catalyst bed, an equilibrium
mixture of propane, propene, and hydrogen, diluted with
nitrogen, was used to generate the coke deposition on the
catalysts (C3H8: 20.3 ml/min, C3H6: 7.5 ml/min, H2: 7.5
ml/min, and N2: 64.7 ml/min). The coking was carried out
for different times on stream (from 5 min to 41.5 h).
After the deactivation the reactor was cooled to room
temperature in N2. The TPO experiment was then immedi-
ately performed in the same reactor without exposing the
catalyst to the moisture in the air. The rate of the tempera-
ture ramp was 10 K/min and 5% O2 was used (O2: 5 ml/min,
N2: 95 ml/min). The TPO was allowed to continue until a
final temperature of about 920 K was reached.
In some experiments, the effects of hydrogen on a coked
catalyst were studied by flushing hydrogen through the re-
actor for 30 min immediately after the coking at the reac-
tion temperature. The experiments were then continued by
TPO.
TPO after Different Deactivation Conditions
The propane dehydrogenation and the TPO experiments
were performed in a fully automated flow reactor system.
The system was equipped with a GC-MS system (TRIO-
1) and a GC with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu,
GC-mini 3 with a Chrompack, Plot fused silica Al2O3/KCl,
column). The setup had two main gas lines, and an air-
actuated four-way valve made it possible to switch quickly
between these two flows. The hydrocarbons were analyzed
during the propane dehydrogenation using the GC. The
MS in the GC-MS system was used to follow the CO2 sig-
nal at m/e 44 and to confirm the absence of uncombusted
hydrocarbons and CO. Mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst
HI-TEC) controlled the gas flow rates.
The 19 propane dehydrogenation experiments were per-
formed as a full factorial design of experiments (19) with
four independent variables, one center point, and two addi-
tional experiments at the center point conditions but at the
lower temperature. The total flow rate was always 50 ml/min
and the pressure atmospheric. The levels of the variables
are shown in Table 2 and the whole design can be found in
Table 3.
About 100 mg of the catalyst was reduced in flowing hy-
drogen for 145 min at 841 K. After this the temperature of
the system was adjusted to the reaction temperature and
allowed to stabilize for 20 min before the flow was switched
to the reaction mixture. For all experiments the total time
on stream was 10 h, and the reaction conditions were kept
constant during each run.
After the propane dehydrogenation reaction, the reactor
was cooled down and a TPO experiment was performed
in the same apparatus. A gas mixture of 2% O2 in Ar at
a total flow rate of 25 ml/min was used. The heating rate
was 10 K/min up to 1123 K. After the TPO experiment the
heated catalyst was used to burn a mixture containing acety-
lene and oxygen in argon. Details about this calibration
procedure that made it possible to determine the amount
of coke on the catalyst can be found elsewhere (20).
Measurement of the Free Metal Surface
Using CO Adsorption
The effect of hydrogen treatment on the coke covering
the metal surface was also studied. This was done in the
fixed-bed reactor. After reduction, the Pt catalyst was deac-
tivated using the same flow rates as in the experiments con-
ducted in the microbalance for 13 h. After the deactivation,
temperature-programmed hydrogenation was performed;

c One broad peek was detected in the TPO experiment. The total coke content is given.
d The experiment was unsuccessful and the data was not used in the analysis.
i.e., the catalyst was treated in a hydrogen-containing gas
mixture (H2: 5.0 ml/min and N2: 10 ml/min) during a tem-
perature ramp (20 K/min) to 773 K. The reactor was kept
at 773 K for 30 min and then cooled again. The free metal
surface was studied by carbon monoxide absorption (21)
on fresh, deactivated, and hydrogenated catalyst.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
TPO after Different TOS
Figure 1 shows the weight increase for different runs with
the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts as solid lines. More
coke accumulates on the latter catalyst, which is consistent
with earlier findings (1, 4, 5, 14, 15). The coke accumulation
is very fast in the beginning, but slows down and reaches a
more constant rate after about 5 h.
The TPO experimental results are shown in Fig. 2. Two
peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic
PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger
peak. For both catalysts the peak temperatures shifted up-
wards when the deactivation increased. Also, more severe
coking caused the beginning of the gasification to shift to
higher temperature.
Duprez et al. (22) studied how the different peaks in
TPO profiles, derived from a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst coked by
cyclopentane at 673 K, changed with time on stream. They
identified three different peeks, and showed that the first
peak (543593 K) disappears when the temperature during
coking is increased to at least 753 K (23). They conclude

that the peak shifts to a higher temperature due to a larger
degree of graphitization of the coke on the metal, at the el-
evated temperature. The shape of the peaks on the catalyst
deactivated at 773 K by Duprez et al. (23) is similar to the
ones in Fig. 2 for the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
We agree with a model, earlier proposed by others
(10, 22, 24, 25), that only a small part of the coke is located
on the metal, while a larger part is placed close to the metal
and is assisted by the platinum in the combustion. We be-
lieve that the last part of the coke is deposited on the carrier
and is combusted without any influence by the metal.
Lin et al. (8) identified two different types of coke when
comparing Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3. Our results are con-
sistent with their findings that the relation between the two
peaks is different for the Pt and the PtSn catalysts. Rel-
atively more coke belongs to the first peak on the former
catalyst than it does on the latter one. The same effect has
also been observed for platinum catalysts modified with Re
and Ir (26).
Lok et al. (16) have discussed the role of coke accumu-
lated in the metal-carrier boundary. They found that the
coking rate consists of two regimes, just as that in this study.
The coke formation rate is very high in the beginning of the
run, but later reaches a regime with a lower, almost constant
rate. Lok et al. (16) proposed a model where coke precur-
sors migrate to the boundary between the platinum and the
carrier. They suggested that when most of the sites in the
boundary are being occupied, the coke formation rate is re-
duced. It was also proposed that the role of tin is to improve
the migration of coke and coke precursors from the metal
and the metal-carrier boundary to the carrier.
The bimetallic PtSn catalyst is more resistant to de-
activation by coke formation, than the monometallic Pt.
Lieske et al. (27) and Lin et al. (8) suggest that one reason is
that hydrocarbons bind more strongly to Pt/Al2O3 than to
PtSn/Al2O3. If the first peak in the TPO spectra was caused
by coke being deposited on the metal and in the metal-
support boundary, then the weakened metal-hydrocarbon
binding by the addition of tin, would explain the significant
reduction of the first peak.
The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance
were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of
power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in
detail by Querini and Fung (28). Two different types of
cokes (type 1 and 2, from the low and the high temperature
peaks, respectively) and constant oxygen pressure were as-
sumed. The reason for the latter assumption is the excess
of oxygen used in the experiment. The results from the de-
convolution are incorporated in Fig. 1.
Figure1demonstrateshowthecoke,associatedwithpeak
1, increases in the beginning, but reaches a constant level
after a period of deactivation. In contrast, the second type
of coke increases continuously.
We suggest that a part of the coke belonging to peak 1
is responsible for the deactivation of the active sites on the
metal and that it hinders the transport of coke precursors
to the support which thus increases the coke accumulation
on the platinum. The addition of tin to the platinum cata-
lyst reduces the metalcarbon bond, leaving a larger metal
surface free (8, 17), and promotes the migration of coke
precursors to the carrier.
The change in gas composition from the reaction mixture
to hydrogen at the reaction temperature did not affect the
weightofthecoke.TheTPOcurvesfromtheruns,wherethe
catalysts were exposed to hydrogen after the reaction, were
compared with experiments without hydrogen treatment
for approximately the same TOS. No systematic differences
were found.
The experiments, where the free metal surface was mea-
sured on fresh and deactivated catalyst and on catalyst ex-
posed to hydrogen, showed that the free metal surface on
the deactivated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was not changed signifi-
cantly by treatment with hydrogen at 773 K. Fresh catalyst
adsorbed 2.4 mol CO/g catalyst, and both the deactivated
catalyst and the deactivated catalyst treated with hydrogen
absorbed about 0.05 mol CO/g catalyst. The conclusion
from the different experiments with hydrogen treatment of
coked catalysts must be that hydrogen has little effect on
the coke formed during the experiments.
TPO Profiles after Different Reaction Conditions
All experiments were done using the same amount of the
PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the same total flow rate and a total
time on stream of 10 h. Figure 3 shows an example of a run
and additional data can be found in Table 3.
The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1
to 8 wt%. Examples of typical TPO profiles can be found
in Fig. 4a, and two or three different peaks can be iden-
tified in the curves. The high temperature peak of about
950 K is seldom found on catalysts. However, by react-
ing 1,5-hexadiene on Î³ -alumina at 723 K, S
ark
any et al.
(10) achieved one single peak with a maximum at about
48

980 K. They did not find this peak for catalysts containing
platinum. By IR studies on the coked alumina carrier they
found condensed aromatic ring compounds. Bacaud et al.
(29) detected a peak with a maximum at around 1000 K
for graphite mixed mechanically with a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
The peak at 950 K in Fig. 4a is probably from the coke with
a graphitic structure, which is mainly formed under severe
conditions.
The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian
curves assuming two or three different types of coke. An
example of the latter case is found in Fig. 4b. The fit was
excellent for all the experiments apart from the two with
higher coke loadings (8 wt%). In those experiments one
very broad peak was observed because of the lack of oxy-
gen, and/or mass transfer limitations. These two experi-
ments were omitted in the analysis of the different peaks.
In the following analysis the first two types of coke were
treated together, named C1+2, and the last type separately,
C3. The major part of the coke belonged to the first two
types of coke.
The data from the TPO experiments and the GC analysis
were used in a linear regression analysis. Linear models of
the type shown in Eq. [1] have been tested:
y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b12x1x2.
[1]
In the analysis, the independent variables were centered
and scaled to the range 1 to 1, and the significance was
tested for all linear predictor variables and cross-products.

tion conditions found in Table 2. The numbers in the figure refer to Table 3.
(b) Example of deconvolution using Gaussian curves for experiment 14.
Furthermore, the experimental design, an almost orthogo-
nal plan, made model-building very simple. The data con-
cerning the amount of coke, were analyzed separately at
high and low temperature, because the absolute errors were
much larger for the high temperature. The temperature is
by far the most important variable controlling the forma-
tion of coke. In fact, more than four times as much coke
was formed at the high temperature.
Separate analyses were performed for the different types
of coke. The first two peaks were treated as a sum, C1+2. The
model for C1+2 as a function of the gas flow rates can be
found in Fig. 5a for the experiments performed at low tem-
perature. A corresponding model with significant param-
eters was not possible to achieve for the experiments per-
formed at the high temperature, although the relationship
was similar. In Fig. 5 (and also Figs. 6 and 11) nonsignificant
variables have been left out. Only the flows of hydrogen
(decrease in C1+2) and propene (increase in C1+2) influ-
enced the formation of coke C1+2. The amount of the third
type of coke was also studied as a function of the flow rates.
For the low temperature no correlation was found. For the
high temperature it was possible to relate the propane flow
to C3, as shown in Fig. 5b. Because the partial pressure of
propane is several times larger than the partial pressure of
propene in the experiments, it was difficult to determine if
it was the sum of the hydrocarbons or only propane that
caused the formation of C3.

per carbon converted, was also analyzed in the same way.
The model can be found in Fig. 6a. It is obvious that adding
propeneincreasesthecokeselectivitybyreducingthedehy-
drogenation rate and increasing the coke formation. Again,
it is obvious why adding propane will decrease the coke se-
lectivity. However, it is worth noting that adding hydrogen
decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention
effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate. In-
creasing the temperature will cause much more coke and,
even if the propane conversion increases, the first effect is
more pronounced, and the coke selectivity increases.

We have correlated the deactivation rate with the exper-
imental conditions and the amount of coke. First, a model
for the normalized activity (Î³ 10); i.e., the ratio between the
activity for propane dehydrogenation after 10 h on stream
and the initial activity, related to the experimental condi-
tions, was obtained (see Fig. 6b). It was found that hydrogen
helps maintain the activity. However, increased propene
partial pressure and higher temperature increased the de-
activation. Next, a model relating the propane conversion
integrated over 10 h to the experimental conditions was de-
rived (see Fig. 6c). It showed that even if the addition of
hydrogen was expected to decrease the initial conversion,
the conversion integrated over the whole time period in-
creased when the high hydrogen level was used. This effect
was more pronounced at the high temperature.
It was also possible to relate the deactivation to the
amount of coke. In Fig. 7a the normalized activity after
10 h (Î³ 10) has been plotted against the sum of coke one and
two (C1+2) after 10 h. The equations for the lines are
Î³10 = ebmcoke,
[2]
where b is a constant determined by regression, and mcoke
is the amount of coke in weight percent. The equations
have been determined separately for the high and the low
temperatures. The same graphs are made for coke of type
three (see Fig. 7b). The lower curves in the figures belong
to ethane activity.
There are at least three explanations for why the relation
between deactivation and amount of coke one and two fol-
lows one line for each temperature (see Fig. 7a). First, it is
possible that the catalyst withstands more coke at the same
degree of deactivation at the higher temperature because
the nature of the coke is different. The second explanation
is that the nature of the coke is unchanged, but that the
effect of the coke is different when the reaction is carried
out at the higher temperature. Finally, it is possible that
only a small part of the coke causes the deactivation, and
that the major part of the coke has hardly any effect on
the activity. The formation of this main part of the coke,
the part determined in TPO, is a function of activity and
the present reaction conditions, and the formation is not
directly coupled to the deactivation mechanism.
In order to examine which explanation is correct,
propane dehydrogenation was carried out at different tem-
peratures. After a time of deactivation, the temperatures
were changed to a reference temperature (789 K), keeping
the gas phase composition constant. The reaction condi-
tions and initial activities are given in Table 4. In Fig. 8,
the activity of propene formation has been normalized by
dividing with initial activity. The vertical lines indicate that
the temperatures were changed to the reference tempera-
ture, and the activity been related to the initial activity for
the experiment performed at 789 K.
Figure 8 indicates that the degree of deactivation re-
mained almost unchanged when the temperature was
changed. The explanation proposed above, that the nature
of the coke would change with reaction temperature, can-
not be correct. If so, then the normalized activity would
have changed considerably. Also the second explanation,
that the nature of the coke is the same, but the effect of the
coke changes with reaction temperature, would demand a
considerable change in degree of deactivation with chang-
ing the temperature.

a The initial TOFs were calculated by extrapolation to time = 0.
We suggest that the major part of the coke is not responsi-
ble for the deactivation. Instead we propose a model where
the coke active in deactivating the catalyst is formed in par-
allel with the main coke formation. Figure 9 illustrates a
possible reaction scheme in this case. The coke precursor is
considered to be formed from the products, but the follow-
ing discussion would also be valid if the coke was formed
from a reactant or an intermediate. The coke precursor may
be formed either in a reversible or irreversible reaction.
Coke A is the main part of the coke formed during the re-
action, but it is not responsible for the deactivation. Coke
B is the coke that causes the deactivation of the catalyst.
This part of the coke is small and cannot be distinguished
in the TPO experiments.
If we assume that the deactivation is caused by Coke B
in Fig. 9, the change in normalized activity Î³ over time can
be written as
dÎ³
dt = kCBÎ³ f (CP),
[3]
where kCB is a constant and f (CP) is any function of the
precursor concentration on the catalyst. The differential
equation can be solved for the reaction time 10 h and since

Earlier has the activity been related to the amount of coke
by
ln(Î³10) = bmcoke,
[6]
where b was the slope in Fig. 7a. If we consider the amount
of coke to be formed according to Eq. [5] and also uses the
expression for ln(Î³10) in Eq. [4], we achieve the following
expression for b:

We can now explain the straight lines in Fig. 7 for the first
types of coke by the constant ratio in the equation above
because the change in gas composition will not change the
ratio. It is important to stress that the deactivation times
were the same in all experiments and that different deacti-
vation times would not result in a straight line in Fig. 7a. A
difference in activation energies, where ECA > ECB, would
account for the different slopes at different temperatures.
We know that the rate of the coke precursor formation, rCP
in Fig. 9, is related to the gas composition. The use of a high
hydrogen and low propene partial pressure will decrease
the formation, resulting in less coke and less deactivation.
This can also be seen from the models presented in Figs. 5a
and 6b.

For the coke in peak three, the results differ. For the
low-temperatureexperiments,theactivityversuscokefunc-
tion follows the equation above, although more scattered
(Fig. 7b). However, for the experiments performed at the
high temperature, the activity is higher for higher amount
of coke and follows the equation,
Î³10 = bmcoke + c,
[8]
where b and c are constants.
The third type of coke found, C3, is not formed by the
mechanism stated in Fig. 9. It is probably formed by a direct
route from propane (and perhaps also from propene). This
explains both why a more active catalyst can contain more
coke and why only the temperature and the propane flow
were important in the formation of the coke (Fig. 5b).
Deactivation of Ethane and Ethene Formation
We also studied the deactivation of the side reactions
for ethene and ethane formation. Both ethene and ethane
must be formed by some kind of cracking of C3 because
the sum of ethane and ethene production is equal to the
formation of methane, except for the first 15 min. As seen
in Fig. 3, the ethene formation is almost constant over the
whole time period. But on the other hand, the ethane pro-
duction deactivates very fast. The ethane production graph
(see Fig. 10) shows three groups: (1) high temperature and
high level of propane; (2) high temperature and low level
of propane; and finally (3) low temperature. The activ-
ity remains almost constant and even increases for some
experiments done at the higher temperature. In Fig. 11
the deactivation of ethane production has been related to
the experimental conditions. The model showed that for
the deactivation of ethane formation, in contrast to the de-
activation of propene production, the temperature is not a
significant parameter. The deactivation rate of ethane for-
mation is also faster than the deactivation rate for propane
dehydrogenation.
A correlation of ethene formation activity with amount
of coke cannot be obtained. The ethane formation activity,

slowly increasing is the one with high levels in all variables (experiment

on the other hand, can be related to the amount of coke.
In the latter case, the situation is very much the same as
for propane dehydrogenation, Figs. 7a and 7b, except that
the deactivation is even more pronounced. If Eq. [7] is ap-
plied to the ethane formation, the steeper slopes, resulting
in higher values on the constant b, are explained by a higher
kCB in the ethane formation than in the propane dehydro-
genation. The absence of temperature dependence in the
deactivation rate indicates that the activation energy, ECB,
for the deactivation during the ethane formation is close to
zero.
We have earlier investigated the formation of ethane and
etheneduringpropanedehydrogenationunderdifferentre-
action conditions (17). Pt/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, Sn/Al2O3,
and Al2O3 catalysts were studied (see Fig. 12). The results
showed a very slow deactivation of the ethene formation
reaction on the PtSn catalyst. The activity was higher for
both the ethene and ethane formation on the monometal-
lic catalyst than on the bimetallic one. The presence of tin
decreased both the ethane and ethene formation also when

the metal was added to the alumina. Tin in known to re-
duce the acidity of the carrier (2, 3, 30, 31) and to decrease
hydrogenolysis reactions on the metal (3, 32).
We suggest the following explanation for the ethane and
ethene formation results. Ethene is mainly formed from
cracking on the carrier. The slow deactivation is caused by
coke accumulated on the active sites. On the Pt catalyst a
part of the ethene is formed on the metal, but this process
deactivates quickly. The ethane is formed by hydrogenoly-
sis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both
reactions taking place on the metal. Ethane is not formed
on the carrier except very early in the experiments. The
observation that the ethane formation deactivates faster
than the propane dehydrogenation can be explained if we
considerthattheformerprocessistakingplaceonlargeren-
sembles than the latter (3335) and that coke also is formed
preferentially on these sites (34, 36, 37).
The Effect of Hydrogen
Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining
the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke
formation. On the other hand, it was not possible to re-
move any coke after the reaction stopped. The conclusion
must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma-
tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke
already formed. The latter does not agree with the results
of Biswas et al. (38). By treatment with hydrogen at 773 K
they succeeded in removing a considerable part of the coke
formed on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst by cyclohexane conversion at
753 K. The coke formed in the experiments presented in this
study has, because of a higher temperature and longer time
on stream during the coking, probably been more deeply
dehydrogenated and strongly bound to the catalyst. During
the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke pre-
cursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al.
called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation
(38). This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata-
lytic activity.
CONCLUSIONS
Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles.
The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of
the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and
the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier. We sug-
gested a model which proposes that the coke observed is
not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel.
The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and
the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas
composition, but it is dependent on the temperature. The
graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a sep-
arate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the
main reaction. Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate
and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing
coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke
already formed on the catalyst.
