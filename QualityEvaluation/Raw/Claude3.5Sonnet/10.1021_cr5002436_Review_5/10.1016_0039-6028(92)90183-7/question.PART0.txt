Received 27 September 1991; accepted for publication 28 October 1991 
STM has provided new insight into the nucleation, growth and nature of the graphite layer formed on Pt(ll1) by hydrocarbon 
decomposition. 
Annealing an ethylene covered surface to 800 K results in the formation of small (about 20-30 w in diameter) 
graphite islands which are initially uniformly distributed over the surface. With further annealing above 1000 K, the graphite is 
observed to accumulate, forming a layer at the lower step edges and also forming large, regularly shaped islands on the terraces. It 
has been determined that hydrocarbon decomposition at elevated temperatures results in formation of a single layer of graphite on 
the Pt surface. It is interesting to note that in the STM images of this single layer of graphite only three of the six carbon atoms in 
the graphite lattice are visible. This result cannot be accounted for by the usual explana$on given in terms of inequivalent carbons 
atoms for the bulk graphite surface. Superstructures with periodicities varying up to 22 A are evident on the graphite areas and are 
due to a higher order commensurability of the graphite and Pt lattices at different relative rotations. 
1. Introduction 
Graphite has been the subject of many studies 
in the field of surface 
science. The study of 
graphite formation on Pt is of great importance 
in catalytic reactions and, its formation from hy- 
drocarbon 
decomposition 
has been studied by a 
wide variety of surface science techniques [1,21. 
Graphite can be formed on metal surfaces in two 
ways. One way is adsorption of a hydrocarbon 
at 
room temperature 
which is subsequently 
dehy- 
drogenated 
and eventually 
forms graphite with 
annealing. Another way is to expose a crystal at 
elevated temperatures 
to a background pressure 
of a hydrocarbon. 
It is known that a graphite 
covered 
Pt surface has a very low activity for 
catalytic hydrocarbon decomposition compared to 
that of clean Pt [1,2]. It is therefore important to 
understand the mechanism of graphite formation, 
nucleation and growth on the Pt surface. LEED 
has typically been used to detect graphite forma- 
tion on surfaces. The characteristic 
graphite ring 
diffraction pattern is observed by LEED follow- 
ing hydrocarbon 
decomposition 
at T 
> 
800 
K. 
With further annealing some segmentation of the 
ring pattern is observed indicating that there is a 
preferential 
alignment of the graphite with the Pt 
substrate. From LEED studies several models for 
graphite formation on Pt have evolved predicting 
both limited multilayer formation [3] and growth 
of the graphite layer on top of an intercalated 
layer of carbidic carbon [4]. Although much infor- 
mation has been obtained with LEED, there are 
still many open questions regarding graphite for- 
mation on the Pt surface. 
In our studies we have used the knowledge 
about graphite obtained from many surface sci- 
ence techniques including scanning tunneling mi- 
croscopy (STM) studies on the surface of bulk 
graphite to try and understand 
details of graphite 
formation 
on the Pt surface. The flatness and 
inertness 
of the cleaved graphite 
(0001) plane 
make it an ideal substrate for surface science and 
STM applications. The semi-metal properties

T.A. Land et al. / STM of the graphite layer on Pt(1 II) produced by hydrocarbon decomposition 
graphite have also made it the focal point for 
many theoretical 
and experimental 
studies. The 
electronic structure of the bulk is we11 
known 151, 
and total energy and local charge density of states 
on the surface have been the subject of many 
intensive calculations 
[6-91. In spite of the vast 
amount of studies, there are several aspects re- 
lated to the STM images of graphite 
surfaces 
which remain controversial 
and are still not well 
understood. 
Several explanations have been pro- 
posed to account for the enhanced atomic resolu- 
tion [6-121, the unexpectedly 
large atomic corru- 
gations 16,101 and for the anomalously large su- 
perperiodicities 
1121 
observed on the surface of 
bulk graphite by STM. The enhanced resolution 
effect observed for graphite has resulted in its use 
as a standard 
for STM calibration, 
and many 
images of atomically resolved graphite have been 
obtained in air as well as in vacuum [ll-131. 
In 
most STM images of graphite one observes only 
three of the six carbon atoms in the graphite 
lattice 111-131. This has been explained in terms 
of interlayer interactions 
which break the sixfold 
symmetry 
resulting 
in an inequivalency 
of the 
carbon atoms in the graphite lattice [6-131. The 
two inequivalent top layer carbon sites are the A 
sites, which have a carbon atom directly in the 
layer below, and B sites which do not have a 
carbon atom directly in the layer below (see fig. 
1). Only one of these two sites is thought to be 
observed in typical STM images of bulk graphite. 
We have utilized the capabilities of STM to 
provide real space images of the formation 
of 
graphite on Pt(ll1) 
during hydrocarbon 
decom- 
position. From this investigation 
we have been 
able to gain insight into the the transition from 
carbidic to graphitic carbon and about the nucle- 
ation, growth and nature of the graphite layer 
formation on PtClll). Visual and quantitative re- 
sults include: nucleation via small islands which 
are initially uniformly distributed 
over the sur- 
face, accumulation 
of the graphite layer at the 
lower step edges with increased annealing tem- 
perature, 
formation 
of a superperiodicity 
in the 
STM image resulting from the higher order com- 
mensurability 
of the graphite and Pt lattices, de- 
termination 
that hydrocarbon 
decomposition 
on 
Pt results in formation of a single layer of graphite

atoms (solid circles) have a carbon atom in the layer directly 
below and the B-type carbon atoms (open circles) do not have 
another carbon in the layer below. The distance between

nearest neighbors is 2.46 A. 
on the Pt surface. It is also observed that even for 
this single layer of graphite, only three of the six 
carbon atoms in the graphite lattice are seen and 
this cannot be accounted for by the usual expla- 
nation given for bulk graphite [6-131. 
2. Experimental 
Experiments were performed at the IGV/KFA 
in Jiilich, Germany, 
with a specially designed 
microscope which is based on the Beetle-type 
STM [14-163. The microscope 
is incorporated 
into a UHV system with standard techniques for 
sample preparation 
and characterization 
such as 
LEED 
and Auger 
electron 
spectroscopy. 
The 
Pt(121) crystal is mounted 
in a fixed, ramped 
sample holder. The sample assembly is mounted 
on a thermally insulated copper block which is 
damped 
against vibrations 
and contained 
in a 
rigid manipulator 
tube with two degrees of free- 
dom, rotation 
and translation, 
for easy sample 
positioning. The sample can be heated by means 
T.A. Land et al. / STM of the graphite layer on Pt(ll1) produced by hydrocarbon decomposition 
263 
of a hot filament and the entire sample assembly 
is in contact with a liquid nitrogen reservoir which 
can be used to cool the sample to 1.50 
K. Sample 
temperature 
control is possible in all preparation 
and analysis steps. The capability to heat and 
cool the sample while tunneling allows us to carry 
out STM measurements 
over a wide, controlled 
temperature 
range from 150 to 450 K. Experi- 
ments which involve sample temperatures 
above 
450 K require that the STM be lifted from the 
sample. This is accomplished 
in a quite facile 
manner and images can be obtained 
within 10 
min of a flash anneal to as high as 1200 K. All 
images were obtained 
in the constant 
current 
mode with tunneling currents 
of 1.5 to 15 nA, 
and typical bias voltages of +30 to 200 mV 
applied to the tip. A scan frequency of 8 Hz was 
typically used to obtain topographs of 512 X 512 
lines. The Pt(lll> 
sample is of high qualip, ex- 
hibiting an average terrace width of 2000 A 1171. 
The orientation 
of the Pt crystal in our STM 
images has been inferred from X-ray diffraction 
measurements 
[161. Sample cleaning was accom- 
plished by standard procedures 
of oxygen treat- 
ment and argon ion bombardment, 
and checked 
with Auger electron spectroscopy. The clean sur- 
face was then exposed 
to varying amounts of 
ethylene by backfilling the chamber. Exposures of 
2.5 L (1 L = 1 X 10e6 Torr s) resulted in a satura- 
tion coverage of ethylene at 160 K. Room tem- 
perature 
exposures were typically over 5 L to 
ensure saturation. 
3. Results and discussion 
Following a saturation exposure of ethylene at 
300 K the sample was annealed in stages to 800 K 
resulting in the formation of graphite on the Pt 
surface 
which 
produced 
the 
characteristic 
graphite 
rings [3,4] observed 
with LEED. 
The 
details of the STM results obtained during the 
intermediate 
stages of decomposition 
of the hy- 
drocarbon 
will be presented 
elsewhere 
[18,19]. 
After annealing to about 800 K, the STM images 
show many small islands exhibiting the graphite 
lattice structure.

at 
room temperature 
after annealing to 900 K, shows

obtained at room temperature

this image one sees many small islands of 20-30 w evenly 
covering the surface. The dark depressions observed on some 
of the larger islands are the beginnings of the superstructure 
formation. 
the graphit: 
islands generated 
by annealing. In 
this 1000 A x 1000 A image one observes that 
most of the graphite islands produced 
have di- 
mensions between 20 and 30 A in diameter and 
are relatively evenly distri$ted 
over0 the surface. 
In this large-scale 
1000 A X 1000 A image the 
individual carbon atoms in the graphite lattice 
are not resolved. On some of the larger graphite 
islands one observes dark depressions which are 
the beginnings of the moire superstructure 
pat- 
tern which is readily seen in images which follow 
in this paper. 
With annealing to higher temperature 
we ob- 
serve the formation of larger structures with few 
of the smaller structures seen in the early stages 
of graphite growth remaining. This behavior is 
described by the process of Ostwald ripening [20] 
which is characterized 
by the growth of larger 
structures at the expense of the disappearance 
of 
the smaller ones. Upon annealing above 1000 K 
the graphite layer is observed to organize into a 
continuous 
band of domains at the lower step 
edges and, into larger islands on the terraces. In

T.A. Land ef al. / ST34 of the graphite layer on Pf il I1 i produced by hydrocarbon decopsfjon 
fig. 3, which was taken at room temperature 
after 
annealing to 1070 K, one still sets many of the 
smaller graphite 
islands (20-30 A> on the ter- 
races and also a substantial 
layer of graphite 
accumulating 
at the lower step edge. In fig. 4, 
obtained after annealing to 1230 K, one sees that 
most of the graphite is now at the lower step edge 
with a few large, regularly shaped islands remain- 
ing on the terraces. The influence of graphite on 
the Pt step edges is clearly observed in figs. 3 and 
4. Where carbon is attached, the step edge is very 
rough and irregular. This is very different 
than 
clean Pt where steps are very smooth and straight 
[61]. The carbon appears to inhibit the exchange 
of Pt atoms at the steps effectively pinning the Pt 
edges 1191. It should be noted that the honey- 
comb structures observed in these 1000 A X 1000 
_& 
images have lattice constants which vary up to 
22 A and thus it is not the actual graphite lattice 
but rather as we have determined 
a moir& super- 
structure 
pattern 
produced 
by a higher order 
commensurabili 
of the graphite and Pt lattices 
Fig. 3. This 1000 AX 1000 A image of graphite on Pt was 
obtained at room temperature 
after annealing to 1070 K. In 
this image one sees many small islands remaining on the 
terraces and also an accumulation of graphite at the lower 
step edges. The graphite 
areas are now large enough to 
exhibit substantial regions of the various periodic&y super- 
structures.

Higher resolution 
images, shown later in this paper, 
resolve the 
individual carbon atoms of the graphite 
lattice 
and reveal details relating to the nature of the 
observed superstructure. 
The superstructures 
seen in the images can be 
generated by placing a graphite l$tice on top of a 
Pt lattice. We can use the 22 A period super- 
structure 
seen in the small scan image of a 
graphiteoarea 
shpwn in fig. 5a as an example. In 
this 65 A x 6.5 A image one sees the individual 
carbon atoms (3 of the 6) in the graphite lattice 
are resolved, which appear as a hexagonal 
ar,- 
rangement 
of small dots, along with the 22 A 
period superstructure, 
which appears as a hexag- 
onat arrangement 
of maxima and minima. One 
can create 
the 22 A period superstructure 
by 
aligning the graphite 
[iOlOl with the Pt [liO] 
direction 
as shown in fig. 6. The Pt atoms are 
shown as circles and have a lattice constant of 
2.78 A and, the graphite 
lattice 
is shown as 
hexagons where carbon atoms are located at the 
vertices with a C-C distance of 1.42 w and a

Fig. 5. (a) This 65 AX65 A image is a close up of a graphite 
area on the Pt surface. The carbon atoms of the graphite 
lattice are resolved and ar? seen as the hexagonal arrange- 
ment of small dots. The 22 A period superstructure

the hexagonal arrangement of the larger maxima and minima.

lattice constant of 2.46 A. By placing the graphite 
lattice on top of the Pt lattice in this manner one 
finds that every nine graphite hexagons (along the 
(1010) 
directions) 
almost coincides with every 
eight Pt atoms (along the (110) directions). There 
is a very small lattice misfit of 0.45% associated 
with the coincidence 
of the Pt lattice at 22.24 A 
and the graphite lattice at 22.14 A. This minute 
misfit can obviously be accounted 
for, e.g., by a 
corresponding 
relaxation 
of the graphite layer. 
The spacings of the carbon atoms in the STM 
images, as seen in fig. 5a are consistent with the 
bulk graphite lattice spacing of 2.46 A indicating 
that the graphite lattice is not substantially dis- 
torted by the Pt substrate. Even if the graphite 
lattice expands to conform to the Pt lattice this 
would only result in an expansion 
of 0.10 A 
spread over nine graphite rings. This commensu- 
rability is evident in the image of graphite seen in 
fig. 5a. By counting the carbon atoms or looking 
at a line scan through the superstructure, 
shown 
in fig. 5b, one can see that there are nine graphite 
lattice spacings to the 22 A period superstructure. 
Fig. 7 alto shows the basic (8 x 8) repeat unit of 
the 22 A superstructure 
which follows the Pt 
(110) directions creating the hexagonal arrange- 
ment of the superstructure 
seen in the images. 
A possible explanation 
for the hexagonal ar- 
rangement 
of light and dark areas of the super- 
structure seen in the STM image shown in fig. 5a 
may be the coincidence 
formed in two types of 
carbon environments 
(see fig. 6). One environ- 
ment may be when the carbon 
atoms in the 
graphite lattice lie over hollow sites, another en- 
vironment may be when the carbon atoms lie over 
on top sites, these types of coincidence may give 
Fig. 6. A graphite lattice, shown as the hexagons, is placed on 
top of a Pt lattice, shown as the circles, to generate the 22 A 
period superstructure. 
When the graphite [iOlO] direction is 
aligned with the Pt [liO] direction one notes that evety eight 
Pt atoms and every nine graphite lattice spacings there is a 
coincidence between the two lattices. This coincidence forms 
a superstructure 
with an (8 8) unit cell along the (110) 
directions of the Pt substrate.

rise to the maxima and minima in the tunneling 
current leading to the superstructure 
observed in 
the images. Indeed the pattern produced in fig. 6 
is consistent with the STM images as seen in fig. 
5a. 
It is possible to generate the other superstruc- 
tures observed 
in the images by placing the 
graphite lattice on top of the Pt lattice at differ- 
ent relative rotations. In a close-up of a graphite 
area with a 20 A period superstructure, 
shown in 
fig. 7a, one sees that the graphite lattice is not 
aligned with the superstructure. 
The measure of 
the angle formed between the superstructure 
and 
the graphite lattice is lo. Rotating the graphite 
lattice by a very small amount with respect to the 
Pt lattice can result in much larger changes in the 
superstructure 
orientation. 
As shown in fig. 7b, 
by placing a graphite lattice on a Pt lattice with 
the [iOlO] direction rotated by 1.5 away from the 
Pt [liO] direction one can generate the structure 
seen in fig. 7a where 
the angle between 
the 
graphite 
lattice and the superstructure 
is lo. 
This is another detailed example indicating that 
the structures seen in the images are explainable 
by a moire pattern resulting from the coincidence 
of the two lattices. Examples of various periodic- 
ity superstructures 
can be seen in figs. 3, 4 and 8. 
For example, looking at the step edge area in fig. 
4, one sees patches where the close-packed direc- 
tion of the superstructure 
is slightly rotated from 
the (110) directions of the substrate. In the 200 
A x 200 A image of graphite shown in fig. 8 one 
sees the graphite lattice as the small dots, the 
near 20 A period 
superstructure 
as the large 
maxima and minima and a :maller 
5 A period 
superstructure. 
The small 5 A period superstruc- 
ture observed 
in fig. 8a, can be generated 
by 
rotating the graphite lattice 90 with respect to 
the Pt lattice (i.e., the graphite (1010) along the 
Pt (112)) as shown in fig. 8b. Fig. 3 exhibits 
several other medium size superstructures 
which 
can be obtained 
again by rotating the graphite 
lattice by varying amounts with respect to the Pt 
lattice. 
In general, one notices that there are a wide 
variety of superstructures 
present in the images 
obtained after annealing to 1070 K as seen in fig. 
3. After annealing to 1230 K there is a propensity 
in the 
superstructure

distribution 
where one observes predominantly 
the larger 20-

One notes that the graphite lattice, as, seen as 
the small dots, is at an angle of lo to the superstructure.

22 A period structures and small areas of the 5 A 
structure. 
The 
preferred 
orientations 
of the 
graphite lattice has also been observed by LEED 
[3,4] as confirmed 
by experiments 
in our lab. 
After annealing the ethylene covered surface to 
800 K the typical graphite rings are observed. 
With further 
annealing to 1230 K we find seg- 
mentation of the ring with dominant bright ring 
segments 
in line with the Pt spots indicating 
alignment 
of the graphite 
tnd Pt lattice, 
i.e., 
formation o,f the aligned 22 A period and nearly 
aligned 20 A period superstructures. 
One consequence 
the alignment 
of the two 
lattices may have is in deteining 
the shapes of 
the graphite islands. Looking at the graphite is- 
lands, seen in figs. 3, 4 and 9, one notes several 
interesting 
aspects about the shapes: (1) Some 
islands appear as regular hexagons (see fig. 4) 
with sixfold symmetry. (2) Others appear as dis- 
torted hexagons, i.e., long and short sides (see 
figs. 3, 9). The regular sixfold symmetric islands 
seen in fig. 4 are formed by orienting the graphite 
(1010) direction along the Pt (1 
too> 
directions as 
has been discussed for the 22 A period super- 
structure. 
In this special orientation, 
where the 
two lattices are aligned, one expects to see regu- 
lar hexagons as all sides are equivalent to each 
other. However, in the case where the edges of 
the islands have a different orientation 
with re- 
spect to the substrate other growth factors may 
be involved in the shape determination. 
As dis- 
cussed previously, islands with other superstruc- 
tures are formed by rotating the graphite lattice 
with respect to the Pt substrate. It may be that by 
rotating 
the graphite 
(1010) 
direction 
slightly 
from the Pt (110) direction that an environment 
is created where not all Gr/Pt 
edges are equiva- 
lent. For example, in fig. 9a one can see that the 
larger island in the center of the image with a 16 
A period superstcture 
(which can be formed by 
rotating the graphite 
[iOlO] direction 
approxi- 
mately 6 from the Pt(liO] direction) has unequal 
sides. In this type of environment one island edge 
may have a more or less preferential 
Gr/Pt 
inter- 
action resulting in different probabili 
for stick- 
ing of a carbon adatom at that edge. This in turn 
may lead to unequal growth resulting in differ- 
ently shaped islands as seen in fig. 9b where one 
can see examples of islands exhibiting distorted 
hexagonal and near triangular shapes. 
Before discussing further results it is important 
to answer the question, does graphite on the Pt

image. (b) A graphite lattice rotated 90 from the Pt lattice resulting in the formation of the 5 A period superstructure.

system [19,21] to obtain quantitative 
re- 
sults to clarify the nature of the graphite layer. 
The idea is to start with a known amount of 
carbon on the surface, anneal this carbon layer 
(without loss of material) to form graphite and 
then measure the amount of carbon in the result- 
ing graphite layer. This technique works well for 
the naphthalene/Pt 
system since molecularly re- 
solved images can be obtained 
allowing us to 
actually count molecules on these surfaces [21] 
and no carbon containing fragments are observed 
to desorb from the surface during decomposition 
and graphite formation [22,231. Also carbon disso- 
lution into the bulk is very low as Pt forms no 
interstitial 
carbides [24]. The ideal coverage of 
carbon in a close packed naphthalene 
overlayer 
on Pt(ll1) 
is predicted 
to be 1.1 C/Pt 
from 
LEED experiments [23]. By actually counting the 
naphthalene 
molecules in the STM images [21] 
we find the initial carbon coverage to be 0.94 + 
0.12 C/Pt. 
After 
annealing 
this naphthalene 
overlayer to form graphite we can easily measure 
the graphite area, in doing this we find the cover- 
age of carbon in the graphite layer to be 0.75 + 
0.13 C/Pt. These measurements 
show that, within 
the statistics of our measurements, 
the initial and 
final carbon coverages are the same, indicating 
formation of a single layer of graphite. 
Formation of a single layer of graphite is also 
supported by qualitative observations made from 
graphite formation by decomposition 
of ethylene. 
The fact that all of the graphite areas <se: figs. 2, 
3,, 4, 8, and 91 in an image (up to 4000 A x 4000 
A) appear to be theosame height relative to the Pt 
step height of 2.26 A supports the idea of a single 
layer of graphite. 
The observed 
height of the 
graphite also always appears to be less than the 
height of the Pt step. These observations are true 
even for various initial hydrocarbon 
coverages 
and, also for repeated 
hydrocarbon 
exposures at 
high temperatures. 
If multilayers or other config- 
urations of graphite which have been proposed 
[3,41 were formed, one would expect to see areas 
of different heights corresponding 
to formation of 
1, 2, 3, etc., graphite layers. The fact that all of 
Fig. 9. (a) In this 1000 w x 1000 A image one sees several islands exhibiting a distorted hexagonal shape with both long and short 
sides. The large island in the center 
of the image exhibits 
both long and short sides and has 16 A period 
superstructure.

1260 AX 1260 i image shows other examples

the graphite 
areas appear 
to be of the same 
height and appear without defects together with 
the quantitative results obtained from the naph- 
thalene experiments support our conclusions that 
we are forming a single layer rather than multi- 
layers or other configurations 
of graphite on the 
Pt surface. 
The fact that a single layer of graphite 
is 
formed on the Pt surface is very important 
in 
discussing the effects seen in the STM images. 
Returning to the high resolution image of graphite 
seen in fig. 5a; one sees the individual carbon 
atoms in the graphite lattice are resolved, which 
appear as a hexagoDnal 
arrangement of small dots, 
along with the 22 A period superstructure, 
which 
appears as a hexagonal arrangement 
of maxima 
and minima. An interesting 
point arises from 
these images, that is, even for our single layer of 
graphite, we observe only three of the six carbon 
atoms in the graphite lattice. This same result has 
been frequently 
observed for bulk graphite [ll- 
131 and has been attributed 
to the inequivalence 
of the A and B carbon atoms in the graphite 
lattice (see fig. 1). This inequivalence 
has been 
proposed to induce electronic effects which result 
in the STM imaging preferentially 
only the B 
atoms [6-lo]. For a single layer of graphite there 
is no longer a distinction between A and B atoms 
of the graphite 
monolayer 
lattice. While there 
appear 
to be strong electronic 
effects due to 
interaction 
with the Pt substrate, 
this does not 
occur in such a fashion that one can make a 
distinction between two unique types of carbon 
atoms in the graphite 
lattice. Looking 
at the 
model with the two lattices in fig. 6 one realizes 
that there are many types of carbon/Pt 
interac- 
tions. There are areas where all of the carbon 
atoms are over hollow sites, areas where all lie 
over Pt atoms and other arrangements 
exhibiting 
configurations 
in between these two, i.e., there is 
no simple way to distinguish a unique environ- 
ment which would lead to the preferential 
imag- 
ing of every other carbon atom. The fact that we 
see the same results for a single layer of graphite 
as are observed for bulk graphite may indicate 
that the usual explanation of inequivalent A and 
B carbon atoms may not provide the whole story 
as to why only three of the six carbon atoms in 
graphite are imaged and that other factors may 
be important. 
It is clear from the images that there is an 
electronic 
correlation 
between the graphite and 
Pt lattices. The fact that the superstructure 
re- 
flects the higher order commensurability 
between 
the two lattices indicates that there is something 
special about the lattice position. The lattice sites 
both in and out of registry, forming the coinci- 
dence with the substrate, produce electronic ef- 
fects resulting in the apparent maxima and min- 
ima seen in the STM images. Fig. 5b shows a line 
scan through two periods of the superstructure 
of 
fig. 5a. The superstructure0 appears as the greater 
modulation 
of about 0.8 A and the grfphite lat- 
tice appears as the smaller near 0.25 A modula- 
tion appearing on top of that of the superstruc- 
ture. Both, the corrugation 
observed for the su- 
perstructure 
and, the graphite lattice were ob- 
served with tunneling conditions in the range of 
Z, 
= 1.5 to 15 nA and V, = k 30 to 200 mV. Car- 
bon atoms sitting above different 
Pt environ- 
ments (see fig. 6) may be expected to have slightly 
different heights above the surface. However, it is 
unlikely that such a physical corrygation 
of the 
graphite could be as large as 0.8 A. Most of the 
0.8 A corrugation 
of the superstructure 
must be 
due to electronic effects on the tunneling current. 
The observed modulat@n of the graphite lattice 
in the range of 0.25 A is consistent 
with the 
corrugation predicted by theory [6-9,131 and, with 
the corrugation 
observed in measurements 
made 
by AFM [9,25,26] and by He scattering [27]. In 
these images of a single layer of graphite on Pf,, 
the giant anomalous corrugations 
of up to 8 A 
[6-131, sometimes seen in images of bulk graphite, 
were not observed. 
4. Summary 
STM provides real space images that help to 
clarify the nucleation, 
growth and the nature of 
the graphite layer formed on Pt(ll1) 
due to hy- 
drocarbon 
decomposition. 
STM images obtained 
after annealing to 800 K show that initial nucle- 
ation results in formation of graphite islands of 
about 20-30 A in diameter 
which are evenly

T.A. Land et al. / STM of the graphite layer on Pt(lI1) produced by hydrocarbon decomposition 
distributed 
over the Pt surface. With increased 
annealing, the graphite is observed to accumulate 
forming large regularly 
shaped 
islands on the 
terraces and a layer of graphite at the lower step 
edges. The layer of graphite formed at the step 
edges acts to inhibit exchange of Pt atoms be- 
tween the ledge and the terrace resulting in rough 
irregular 
step edges. The 
superstructures 
ob- 
served by STM in these graphite overlayers can 
be nicely explained in terms of a moire pattern 
resulting from the higher order commensurability 
of the two lattices at different relative rotations. 
Quantitative 
and qualitative arguments obtained 
by STM measurements 
have enabled us to deter- 
mine that hydrocarbon 
decomposition 
on Pt(ll1) 
results in formation of a single layer of graphite 
on the surface. In high resolution images of the 
graphite layer we observe only three of the six 
carbon atoms in the graphite lattice. This same 
result is standardly 
observed 
for bulk graphite. 
The explanation of inequivalent carbon atoms in 
the bulk graphite lattice cannot be used to de- 
scribe this phenomena 
observed in a single layer 
of graphite. This suggests that the simple expla- 
nation given in terms of A- and B-type carbon 
atoms may not provide a complete explanation of 
the tunneling probability and that there may be 
other interesting factors involved [28].
