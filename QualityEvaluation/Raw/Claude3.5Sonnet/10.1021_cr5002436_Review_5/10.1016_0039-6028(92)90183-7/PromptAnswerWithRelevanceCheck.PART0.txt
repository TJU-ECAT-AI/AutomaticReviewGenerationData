Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The text primarily discusses STM investigations of graphite formation on platinum surfaces through hydrocarbon decomposition. It does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps, rate-limiting debates, or ongoing scientific interest in this topic. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be explained based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about this mechanism, its steps, or debates regarding the rate-limiting step. The document focuses on STM studies of graphite formation on platinum surfaces through hydrocarbon decomposition, which is unrelated to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation or analysis of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism from the given information.
