The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the kinetic modeling of isobutane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps. The literature discusses various mechanisms and rate-determining steps for isobutane dehydrogenation, but these are specific to the chromia/alumina catalyst system studied and do not relate directly to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

The document does not provide information about the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, nor does it discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, I cannot answer the question about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its associated debates based on this document alone.

所给文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注铬/氧化铝催化剂上异丁烷脱氢的动力学建模,但没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其四个主要步骤。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢的各种机理和速率决定步骤,但这些都是针对所研究的铬/氧化铝催化剂系统,与Horiuti-Polanyi机理没有直接关系。

文档没有提供关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理中哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤的持续争论的信息,也没有讨论为什么这种机理尽管经过近一个世纪的研究仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息,我无法仅根据这份文档回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理及其相关争论的问题。
