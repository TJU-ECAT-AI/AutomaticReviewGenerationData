Abstract
The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation. The dehydrogenation activity measurements were carried out in a laboratory-scale plug-flow reactor at 520580 C under atmospheric pressure. Several kinetic models were derived from different mechanisms, and the suitability of the models in describing the rate of the dehydrogenation reaction was tested. The results of the kinetic modeling suggested that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly on a pair of chromium and oxygen ions. A satisfactory description of the reaction rate depended on inclusion of the isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters in the mathematical model. The activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was estimated to be 133142 kJ/mol.

Introduction
Light alkenes, such as propene and butenes, are important intermediates in the manufacture of polymers and chemicals. The most selective way to produce these short-chain alkenes is the direct catalytic dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. Industrial dehydrogenation processes use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts generally supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals. 1 The structure and activity of chromia catalysts have been studied extensively in an attempt to understand better how the properties of supported chromia influence the dehydrogenation activity. 2-10 However, an understanding of the system also requires information about the reaction mechanism.
The kinetics and mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina catalysts have been explored in various publications. 11-19 However, the findings of these studies have not always been in agreement. Not only different mechanisms but also different rate-determining steps and, thus, different kinetic models have been proposed. The rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation of isobutane has been suggested to involve alkane adsorption,15,16 whereas in the dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane, it has been proposed to involve the surface reaction of the adsorbed alkyl group.11,12,18,19 Furthermore, results of tracer studies with 13C-labeled isobutane and deuterium on chromia gel 20 and with deutero-propane on chromia/alumina17 suggest a mechanism with the surface reaction as the slow step.
The dehydrogenation activity of chromia catalysts is most often attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ ions.3-10 Varying with the sample properties and treatment conditions, three types of Cr3+ have been observed:2,3,5,6 (i) redox Cr3+ formed in the reduction of Cr5+ and Cr6+ present on oxidized samples, (ii) nonredox Cr3+ in an amorphous chromia phase that is present in both reduced and oxidized samples, and (iii) the Cr3+ present in crystalline chromia. On alumina-supported catalysts, redox Cr3+ is the most abundant species at low chromium contents, and its amount stabilizes to about 23 atoms of Cr/nm2 (23 wt % chromium, depending on the support surface area) for total chromium contents above 5 atoms of Cr/nm2 (48 wt %).5,6,8 The amount of amorphous chromia increases with the total chromium content, and crystalline chromia is mainly observed, by X-ray diffraction, above about 810 atoms of Cr/nm2 (616 wt %).5,6,8 It has been suggested that both redox and nonredox Cr3+ are active in dehydrogenation,5,6 whereas crystalline chromia is less active.6
In addition to the Cr3+ ions, surface oxygen ions might also participate in the reaction.3,9,10,21,22
Dehydrogenation might involve a stage where the alkane adsorbs and dissociates, in one or two steps, onto a pair of chromium and oxygen ions to give an alkyl group bonded to surface chromium and a hydrogen atom bonded to surface oxygen,3,21,22 as schematized in eq 1
In kinetic modeling studies, the active site of the catalyst has generally been described as a single ion. However, if both the chromium and oxygen ions take part in the reaction, as has been suggested, the active site should be described as a CrO pair.
In this work, the dehydrogenation of isobutane on a chromia/alumina catalyst was studied to clarify the reaction kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation. Kinetic models were derived on the basis of different mechanisms and rate-determining steps, and the suitabilities of the models in describing the measured dehydrogenation activities were tested.
Experimental Section
Materials. The chromia/alumina catalyst used in the study was a sample developed for fluidized-bed operation. The chromium content of the catalyst was 12 wt %, and the average particle size was 96 μm. The gases were supplied by Aga, and their purities were N2, 99.999%; air, 99.5%; H2, 99.999%; i-C4H10, 99.95%; and Ar, 99.999%. Nitrogen and argon were purified with Oxisorb (Messer-Griesheim).
Dehydrogenation Equipment and Analytical Methods. The dehydrogenation activities were measured in a continuous-flow fixed-bed microreactor. The catalyst sample (0.1 or 0.2 g) was loaded between two layers of silicon carbide into a quartz-glass reactor with a 7-mm inside diameter. The catalyst bed length was 3 or 6 mm for 0.1- or 0.2-g loading, respectively. The reaction temperature was monitored with a thermocouple in the catalyst bed, and the flow rates of gases were regulated with mass flow controllers.
The reaction products were analyzed on-line with a Gasmet Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Temet Instruments Ltd.) equipped with a Peltier-cooled mercurycadmium telluride detector and with an HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an HP PLOT/Al2O3 M column and a flame ionization detector. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range 4000850 cm-1 with a resolution of 8 cm-1 and a scanning rate of 10 scans/s. The analysis cuvette (9 cm3) was maintained at constant temperature (175 C) and pressure (1.03 bar). The spectra were measured every 3 s during the first 2 min on stream, every 5 s during the next 2 min, and every 30 or 60 s thereafter. The compounds analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy were methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, n-butane, isobutane, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, 1,3-butadiene, isobutene, benzene, toluene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The composition of the product stream was calculated by the classical least-squares multicomponent analysis method using an analysis program (Calcmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.) with calibration spectra for the measured compounds. The method for analyzing light hydrocarbons by FTIR spectroscopy has been described in detail elsewhere. 23
Activity Measurements. Three series of activity measurements were carried out at atmospheric pressure (1.03 bar) under different reaction conditions. As described in Table 1, the catalyst loading, reaction temperature, isobutane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and molar ratios of isobutane to hydrogen and to nitrogen in the feed were varied in the experiments. Each series consisted of about 50 (pre)reductiondehydrogenationregeneration cycles with the same catalyst load. During the first 1520 cycles, the catalyst activity stabilized to a constant level. Then, the kinetic measurements were started. The stability of the catalyst activity was verified regularly with standard experiments. The stabilization and standard dehydrogenation stages were carried out at 580 C and a WHSV value of 15 h-1. The isobutane feed was diluted with nitrogen, the molar ratio of isobutane to nitrogen being 1:1. No hydrogen was added to the feed. Some experiments were performed with argon instead of nitrogen as the inert gas.

The catalyst was reduced either (i) with hydrogen before the dehydrogenation stage or (ii) with isobutane during the first few minutes on the isobutane stream. The hydrogen prereduction was done at 590 C with 10% H2/N2 and a reduction time of 15 min. The reduction products were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The influence of hydrogen prereduction on the catalyst activity and product distribution was studied in cycles 112: cycles 16 and 12 did not include a prereduction stage, whereas cycles 711 did. The kinetic measurements were done with the prereduced catalyst commencing at about cycle 16. During the dehydrogenation stage, the isobutane feed was continued for 11 or 15 min. The reaction products were monitored by FTIR spectroscopy for the first 6 min on stream, a GC sample was taken after 8 or 10 min, and the FTIR analysis was then continued. The catalyst was regenerated after the dehydrogenation stage with 2% O2/N2 for 2 min, with 5% O2/N2 for 2 min, and with 10% O2/N2 for 30 min. The amounts of the regeneration products, carbon oxides and water, were determined by FTIR spectroscopy. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst during dehydrogenation was calculated from the measured amounts of carbon oxides.
Thermal reactions in the system were investigated by replacing the catalyst with silicon carbide but otherwise implementing the dehydrogenation procedure as usual. Internal mass transfer was considered with the Weisz-Prater criterion, and external mass transfer by conducting dehydrogenation experiments with two catalyst loadings at the same reaction temperature and WHSV value.
Calculation of Conversions and Selectivities. The conversions of isobutane and the product selectivities determined from the FTIR results were calculated on the basis of the measured amounts of carbon-containing compounds. The molar amount of carbon in the feed was assumed to be equal to the molar amount of carbon in the product; the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst during dehydrogenation was ignored. The amount of isobutane fed CA,in was thus
The accuracy of this calculation was verified by calculating the mass balance of carbon in the reactor system: the calculated inlet isobutane concentration CA,in was compared with the measured inlet concentration. The conversion of isobutane X was calculated as
The selectivity Si to product i was calculated as
The yield of product i was calculated by multiplying the conversion of isobutane X by the selectivity Si to product i. The conversions and selectivities determined from the GC results were calculated on a molar basis.
Kinetic Models. Several kinetic models were tested to describe the rate of dehydrogenation; the equations are presented in Table 2. Model 1 is a power-law model that includes both the forward and the reverse reaction rates. Models 28 were derived from possible dehydrogenation mechanisms with use of the general principles of the LangmuirHinshelwood approach.27 These models will be referred to in the form model I-a, where the Roman numeral indicates the mechanism and the letter (a or b) the reaction rate-determining step (RDS), with the letter a referring to the adsorption of isobutane and b to the surface reaction. Models with isobutene or hydrogen desorption as the slow step were tested in some calculations, but these models described the activity results poorly. Moreover, it has been concluded from tracer experiments that the desorptions of isobutene and hydrogen are in equilibrium.20 Desorption models were, therefore, not considered more closely. Mechanisms I and II are presented in eqs 5ad and 6ae, respectively.

Kao et al.20 used mechanism II with a surface reaction (step 6b) as the rate-determining step to describe the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation on unsupported chromia gel.
Mechanisms I and II imply that the hydrocarbon and hydrogen species occupy the same type of active surface site S, for example, chromium. Mechanisms III and IV, however, assume that (i) the active site requires both a chromium and an oxygen ion, as has been suggested;3,21,22 (ii) some steps occur on the same CrO pair, with the use of both the chromium and the oxygen ion; and (iii) it is not necessary in the model derivation to write separate site balances for the chromium and oxygen ions. In mechanism III, proposed by Carr et al.12 for n-butane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina, the alkane adsorbs dissociatively on a CrO pair (step 7a). In the surface reaction, the adsorbed alkyl group reacts with a neighboring CrO pair (step 7b), and finally, the alkene and the hydrogen desorb from the surface (steps 7c and d).
In the reaction equations, the notation i-C4H9···CrO···H, for example, means that the alkyl group and the hydrogen atom are adsorbed on the CrO pair. Mechanism III can be simplified to mechanism IV, suggested by Burwell et al.,22 by assuming that the dehydrogenation reaction takes place on a single CrO pair. Recently, Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt3 proposed a similar mechanism for dehydrogenation. Although they described the adsorption of the alkane and the dissociation to an alkyl group and a hydrogen atom as two separate steps, their mechanism leads to a mathematical expression similar to that obtained with mechanism IV.
In mechanism IV, step 8a is the adsorption of isobutane, and step 8b the surface reaction. Mechanisms III and IV both include the formation of CrH and OH bonds, in agreement with the results of FTIR studies by Busca, 24 who detected CrH and OH species on unsupported chromia during hydrogen adsorption at room temperature. The main difference between the two mechanisms is the surface reaction: mechanism III requires two chromium ions and mechanism IV only one ion. De Rossi and co-workers8-10 suggested the active site to consist of one Cr3+ ion, with neighboring oxygen ion(s) involved in the reaction. This might support a mechanism with one chromium ion. However, Cavani et al.6 proposed amorphous chromia to be the most active species, which might support a mechanism involving multiple chromium ions or else a mechanism involving one chromium ion but with the activity of the single ion higher in an environment with several chromium ions nearby.
In addition, three other models presented in earlier studies were tested: models 10 and 11 (Table 2), with adsorption as the RDS, proposed by Zwahlen and Agnew15 and Happel et al.,16 respectively, for the dehydrogenation of isobutane on chromia/alumina, and model 12, with surface reaction on two different types of sites as the RDS, proposed by Suzuki and Kaneko19 for the dehydrogenation of propane on a potassium-modified chromia/alumina catalyst.
Parameter Estimation. The parameters of the kinetic equations were estimated from the results of 59 dehydrogenation stages carried out with a hydrogen-prereduced catalyst. The amounts of isobutane, isobutene, hydrogen, and nitrogen were used in the estimation. The molar amounts of isobutane and isobutene were determined from the results of FTIR analyses after 5 min on the isobutane stream, and the amount of hydrogen was assumed to equal that of isobutene. The data set did not include the results of the stabilization or the standard dehydrogenation stages so that the effects of deactivation and the overemphasis of certain reaction conditions could be ruled out. The parameters were estimated with the Kinfit program 25 by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals (SSR) between the measured and calculated compositions of the product stream. The kinetic model was combined with an integral plug-flow reactor model, and the minimization was performed by the LevenbergMarquardt method.
The temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant was described with an Arrhenius equation that was rewritten as
where Amean is A0e-E/RTmean and z is 1/R(1/T  1/Tmean). The temperature 550 C was used as Tmean. The reparametrization was done to reduce the correlation between the parameters. During preliminary modeling, the adsorption/desorption equilibrium constants were described with an equation similar to eq 9. However, this resulted in poor identifiability of the models. Therefore, the adsorption equilibrium constants were assumed to be temperature-independent. Consequently, the parameters are not real adsorption equilibrium constants but represent mean values in the temperature range studied (520580 C). The equilibrium constant of the dehydrogenation reaction was calculated from the thermodynamic data in the Flowbat program 26
Results and Discussion
General Remarks.Mass Balance of Carbon. The mass balance of carbon in the reactor system was calculated from the molar amounts of hydrocarbons measured by FTIR spectroscopy during dehydrogenation. The mass balance was generally 9799%. Coke deposition on the catalyst during dehydrogenation was low, and the effect of coke on the total mass balance was less than 1%.
Thermal Reactions. The thermal reactions were studied by replacing the catalyst with an equal amount of silicon carbide. Without the catalyst, the yield of isobutene was 03.7% in the studied temperature range of 520580 C, with the highest yields being obtained at high temperatures and low feed rates.
Mass Transfer. The effect of external mass transfer was studied in dehydrogenation experiments done at 580 C with a WHSV value of 15 h-1 with use of two different catalyst loadings (0.1 and 0.2 g). The isobutane conversion was 31% with both loadings, and the selectivities to isobutene were 93 and 96% with 0.1 and 0.2 g, respectively. The similar results indicated that external mass-transfer limitations were negligible. 27 Internal mass transfer was considered with the WeiszPrater criterion. The calculated value was about 10-7 in magnitude (1), which implied that internal mass-transfer effects were not significant.
Effect of Nitrogen Dilution. Noda et al.18 accounted for nitrogen adsorption onto the catalyst surface in their kinetic investigation of n-butane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina. Even though nitrogen was not expected to interact with the oxide catalyst, 28 the adsorption effect of nitrogen was investigated in the present study by doing some experiments with argon instead of nitrogen dilution. The experiments were carried out with a 0.2-g catalyst loading at 580 C and a WHSV value of 15 h-1. The conversion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene were 30 and 95%, respectively, for both nitrogen and argon dilution. Thus, the nitrogen adsorption parameter was not included in the kinetic equations.
Activity in the Dehydrogenation of Isobutane. To determine whether to perform the kinetic measurements with a hydrogen-prereduced or a nonprereduced catalyst, the effect of the reducing medium on the product distribution was studied in the first 12 cycles of the series. A typical product distribution for the nonprereduced catalyst is shown in Figure 1. During the first few minutes on stream, carbon oxides and water were formed in the reduction of Cr6+ and Cr5+ to Cr3+ with isobutane, and water was formed in the prereduction with hydrogen. With the isobutane reduction, the amount of dehydrogenation products stabilized only after the formation of carbon oxides terminated, whereas with hydrogen prereduction, no carbon oxides or water were formed during the dehydrogenation stage. The kinetic experiments were, therefore, carried out with a prereduced catalyst. The most significant side reaction in all dehydrogenations was the cracking of C4 hydrocarbons to C1C3 hydrocarbons, mostly methane and propene. In addition, a low concentration (<1%) of C4 hydrocarbons other than isobutane and isobutene was detected.
Figure 1 Product distribution with a nonprereduced catalyst.
The experimental data consisted of dehydrogenation activities measured in three series. Figure 2 shows, as an example for the first series, the yield of isobutene at 10 min on the isobutane stream for the first 16 dehydrogenation stages and for the standard stages. Figure 3 presents a typical example of the catalyst activity with time on the isobutane stream after hydrogen prereduction. During the initial 16 cycles, the catalyst activity decreased, most likely as a result of structural changes on the catalyst5 and possibly also accumulation of unburned coke on the surface. After the deactivation period, the catalyst activity stabilized as a function both of the number of cycles and of the time on the isobutane stream. With the stabilized catalyst, the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene were 31  1 and 93  1%, respectively, in the standard dehydrogenation stages of the first series. The results were similar for the second and third series. In the kinetic activity measurements, the conversion was 3.634%, and the selectivity to isobutene was 9099%, depending on the reaction conditions. Figure 4 shows the conversion of isobutane at different temperatures with a catalyst loading of 0.1 g and WHSV values of 15 and 30 h-1 without hydrogen in the feed. At 550 C, the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion is about 61% with the isobutane feed diluted with nitrogen at a molar ratio of 1:1. 29

Addition of hydrogen to the isobutane feed decreased the conversion and the selectivity. The main reason for the lower selectivity was that the cracking reaction of C4 hydrocarbons was mainly a thermal reaction. Thus, hydrogen affected only the yield of isobutene and not the yield of cracking products. The additional hydrogen in the gas phase might have decreased the conversion by slowing the desorption of hydrogen from the surface, thereby decreasing the number of vacant surface sites. The effect might also have been purely kinetic: the reaction rate decreased because of the increased hydrogen partial pressure. In any case, the results suggest that the hydrogen partial pressure is required in the kinetic model.
The effect of the reducing medium on the yield of isobutene can be seen from Figure 2 (cycles 112). The conversion of isobutane was lower after prereduction of the catalyst with hydrogen than after its reduction with the isobutane feed; the selectivity to isobutene was the same. The observation that hydrogen prereduction lowers the alkane conversion on chromia/alumina is in accordance with the results of Hakuli 30 and Gorriz et al. 31 but contrary to those of De Rossi et al.9 In general, the reduction of the chromia phase liberates water in hydrogen prereduction and carbon oxides and water in isobutane reduction according to eqs 11 and 12, respectively
In the present study, the amount of water detected by FTIR spectroscopy during hydrogen prereduction and isobutane reduction was lower than anticipated from the amount of carbon oxides released in the hydrocarbon reduction. Some water must have remained on the catalyst, as proposed by Hakuli et al.4 and De Rossi et al.9,10 The water remaining on the catalyst, in the form of OH/H groups for example, has been suggested to modify the active sites,30 possibly by influencing their coordinative unsaturation. Moreover, De Rossi et al.10 observed that addition of water to the alkane feed decreased the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/zirconia catalysts. They suggested that the water adsorbed on the surface and saturated a fraction of the active sites. Here, saturation of some of the active sites might explain the lower activity measured after hydrogen prereduction compared to that measured after hydrocarbon reduction. It is questionable, however, whether the lower activity observed after hydrogen prereduction and the lower activity we observed upon hydrogen addition to the feed were due to the same cause, for example, the decrease in the number of vacant surface sites. The oxygen-containing species formed in the prereduction might have had an additional effect: in addition to influencing the coordinative unsaturation, they might have lowered the activity by changing the dispersion of the chromia phase. 32 Hydrogen addition to the feed, in turn, might have decreased the reaction rate purely through the influence of the increased partial pressure on the catalyst surface.
Kinetic Modeling.Comparison of the Models. The 12 models presented in Table 2 were tested for the measured dehydrogenation data, and the results of the parameter estimation are presented at Table 3. The sum of squares of the residuals (SSR) was significantly higher with the power-law model (SSR 218) than with the models assuming some adsorption effect (SSR 2489). Thus, the least accurate model was the power-law equation. Models II-b, IV-b, and 10 were also rejected, as their SSRs were in the range 6689.

The lowest SSR value of 24 was obtained with models II-a, III-a, and III-b. For model III-a, which assumed adsorption as the RDS, the value of the isobutane adsorption term KEH2pEpH2 was near 0. Thus, the model could be simplified to eq 13 by omitting this term from the model. The parameter values were not significantly changed from those presented in Table 3.
The additional parameters and the squared denominators in models II-a and III-b compared to eq 13 did not decrease the SSR. The similar descriptions of the three models can be explained by the estimation results, as the values for the reaction rate constant factors Amean and E are similar for the three models (Table 3). Therefore, the values of the denominators should also be similar, indicating that the parameter values were determined so that they compensated for the modifications in the form of the equation. Thus, the three models can be expressed with the simplest of them, eq 13.
Although the best modeling results were obtained with eq 13, models I-a, I-b, IV-a, 11, and 12 (Table 2) were also satisfactory (SSR 2733). These five models derive from quite similar mechanisms with adsorption on one site, S or CrO, and desorption of alkene and hydrogen also from single sites. When comparing the form and the parameter estimation results of the equations that adequately described the reaction, certain generalizations can be made. First, the adsorption term of isobutane was either poorly determined, or its value was near zero. Thus, it could be omitted from the equations without increasing the SSR or changing the values of the other parameters significantly. Second, both the isobutene and hydrogen adsorption terms were required in the equations for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate. The effect of hydrogen was also clear from the activity results: addition of hydrogen to the feed lowered the conversion. In addition, the results of model II-a (Table 3) indicated that the hydrogen atom combination and desorption could be treated as a single step. Third, squaring the denominator, corresponding to an RDS with two similar active sites, only adjusted the parameter values but did not decrease the SSR. The simplest model studied to incorporate only the isobutene and hydrogen adsorption terms was model 11, with adsorption as the RDS, suggested earlier by Happel et al.16 Figure 5 shows the weight fractions of isobutane, isobutene, and hydrogen in the outlet stream as estimated with eq 13 and model 11 versus the measured weight fractions. Both equations can be used to describe the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction with good accuracy.

The finding that the isobutane adsorption term was not required in the equations for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate supports a model with adsorption of isobutane as the slow step; the two proposed models, eq 13 and model 11, both assume this RDS. In addition, the results suggest that the adsorption requires only one site because squaring the denominator did not improve the description. This agrees with the idea that the adsorption can occur dissociatively on the suggested3,21,22 active site, a CrO pair. If the surface reaction of the adsorbed species to the adsorbed alkene were the slow step, the amount of adsorbed isobutane or adsorbed i-C4H9- would be significant and, thus, necessary in the equation. Our speculation for the rate-determining step is in accordance with models suggested by Zwahlen and Agnew15 and Happel et al.16 for isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina but contrary to the proposal of Kao et al.20 that the surface reaction of the adsorbed alkyl group is the RDS in isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia gel. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane has been suggested to determine the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation on supported Pt/Sn catalysts 33 and the molecular adsorption of the alkane the rate of propane dehydrogenation on silicalite-supported zinc oxide. 34
The activation energy of the reaction rate-determining step was estimated to be 133142 and 115147 kJ/mol with models assuming, respectively, adsorption and surface reaction as the RDS. Lower values than these have been estimated before for isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/alumina with models assuming alkane adsorption as the RDS: Zwahlen and Agnew15 estimated a value of 112 kJ/mol with model 10 and Happel et al.16 a value of 73 kJ/mol with model 11. Both models 10 and 11 are simplified forms of model I-a (Table 2), with model 10 leaving out the KH2pH2 term of model I-a and model 11 the KEH2pEpH2 term. Zwahlen and Agnew modeled dehydrogenation and deactivation of the catalyst simultaneously, which increased the number of parameters to be fitted and might have reduced the accuracy of the estimates. In addition, the values for the reaction equilibrium constants were different in the earlier studies from the values used in our study. These differences might explain the higher values obtained here for the activation energy.
Comparison of the Mechanisms. The modeling results support mechanisms I and IIIboth assuming adsorption on single site and surface reaction on dual sitesapproximately equally. Mechanism II, with adsorption on dual sites, seems less probable as the results suggest that the adsorption might require only one site. The weakness of mechanism I, however, is the unlikely abstraction of the hydrogen molecule from the alkane in a single step; the weakness of mechanisms II and III is that they require three and two similar active sites. Mechanism IV, suggested by Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt3 and by Burwell et al.,22 would seem to be the most realistic on the basis of the conclusions of De Rossi et al.8-10 that the reaction requires only one chromium ion. However, our modeling results do not support mechanism IV as strongly as the other mechanisms. It might be beneficial to treat the chromium and oxygen ions as separate SCr and SO sites in the model derivation rather than as a CrO pair. However, if the adsorption/dissociation of alkane is the slow step in the reaction, the other steps are more difficult to elucidate with kinetic modeling of reaction rate data. Isotopic tracer studies might also prove helpful in deciding among the different mechanisms, and such an approach is under study.
Conclusions
The kinetics of isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on a chromia/alumina catalyst developed for fluidized-bed operation. The catalyst used was active and selective in isobutane dehydrogenation. The activity was lower after prereduction of the catalyst with hydrogen than after reduction with the isobutane feed. The lower activity might have been caused by the modification of the active sitespresumably coordinatively unsaturated CrO pairsby the water formed during prereduction and subsequently retained on the catalyst. The results of the kinetic modeling suggest that the rate-determining step is isobutane adsorption, possibly with dissociation on a CrO pair. The isobutene and hydrogen adsorption parameters were required in the kinetic equation for a satisfactory description of the reaction rate by the model. A value of 133142 kJ/mol was calculated for the reaction activation energy.
