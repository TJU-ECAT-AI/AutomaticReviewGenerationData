The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, rather than the specific mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step based on the information in this document.

该文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文档主要关注在Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成,而不是脱氢反应本身的具体机理。因此,我无法根据这份文档中的信息来详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理或讨论有关其速率限制步骤的持续争论。
