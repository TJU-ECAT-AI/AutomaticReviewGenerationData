The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation on Pt and PtSn catalysts, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step based on the information in this document.

本文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文档主要关注Pt和PtSn催化剂上丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成，但没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。因此，我无法根据这篇文档中的信息详细解释这一机理或讨论关于其限速步骤的持续争论。
