[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Stepwise dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane species
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) has often been observed to be the rate-determining step, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. However, this can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual surface processes can be more complex than the simplified four-step model.

2. Difficulty in direct observation: Many surface intermediates are short-lived and challenging to detect experimentally.

3. Dependence on conditions: The rate-limiting step can change based on temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface processes.

5. Relevance to industrial catalysis: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for catalyst design and process optimization.

6. Connection to other fields: The mechanism has implications for surface science, computational chemistry, and materials engineering.

The ongoing research on this mechanism reflects the broader challenges in understanding heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level. As new experimental and theoretical tools emerge, scientists continue to refine and sometimes challenge longstanding models of surface reactions.

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Stepwise dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. At elevated temperatures, the dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) is often considered to be the rate-determining step, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. This is supported by isotopic labeling experiments showing no H-D exchange in the alkane reactant, indicating that adsorption is irreversible under reaction conditions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding heterogeneous catalysis of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The rate-limiting step can change depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties, making it challenging to develop a universal model.

3. Advanced spectroscopic and computational techniques continue to reveal new insights into surface species and elementary steps.

4. Understanding the mechanism at a molecular level is crucial for rational catalyst design and process optimization.

5. The mechanism has implications beyond simple alkane dehydrogenation, extending to more complex reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization.

6. Debate continues over the nature and role of various adsorbed intermediates.

Overall, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism provides a useful framework, but ongoing research aims to refine our understanding of the elementary steps and develop more precise mechanistic models for specific catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它为理解氢化/脱氢反应的多相催化提供了基本框架。

2. 速率限制步骤可能随反应条件和催化剂性质而变化，使得建立通用模型具有挑战性。

3. 先进的光谱和计算技术不断揭示表面物种和基元步骤的新见解。

4. 在分子水平上理解机理对于理性催化剂设计和过程优化至关重要。

5. 该机理的应用不仅限于简单的烷烃脱氢，还延伸到更复杂的反应，如氢解和异构化。

6. 关于各种吸附中间体的性质和作用仍存在争议。

总的来说，Horiuti-Polanyi机理提供了一个有用的框架，但正在进行的研究旨在完善我们对基元步骤的理解，并为特定催化剂系统和反应条件开发更精确的机理模型。
