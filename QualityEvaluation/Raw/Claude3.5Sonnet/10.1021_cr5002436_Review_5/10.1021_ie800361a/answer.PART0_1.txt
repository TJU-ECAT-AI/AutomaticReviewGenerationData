[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Stepwise dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane
3. Formation of the alkene on the surface
4. Desorption of the alkene product

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) is often considered the rate-determining step, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. However, this can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The detailed surface chemistry is complex and can vary with different catalysts and reaction conditions.

2. Difficulty in direct observation: Many of the surface intermediates are short-lived and challenging to observe directly.

3. Competing mechanisms: Alternative mechanisms have been proposed that may be relevant in certain cases.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for catalyst design and process optimization in important industrial processes.

5. Advances in characterization techniques: New analytical methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface chemistry.

6. Theoretical modeling: Improvements in computational chemistry allow for more detailed theoretical studies of reaction mechanisms.

The ongoing research and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its fundamental importance in heterogeneous catalysis and the continuous advancement of our understanding of surface chemistry.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理描述了催化脱氢反应的四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附烷烃的逐步脱氢
3. 烯烃在表面的形成
4. 烯烃产物的脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。在高温下，烷烃的解离吸附（第1步）通常被认为是速率决定步骤，特别是对于Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂。然而，这可能因反应条件和催化剂特性而异。

尽管研究近一个世纪，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：详细的表面化学反应复杂，可能因不同的催化剂和反应条件而变化。

2. 直接观察的困难：许多表面中间体寿命短暂，难以直接观察。

3. 竞争机理：在某些情况下，可能存在其他相关的替代机理。

4. 工业应用的重要性：理解该机理对于催化剂设计和重要工业过程的优化至关重要。

5. 表征技术的进步：新的分析方法不断为表面化学提供新的见解。

6. 理论模拟：计算化学的进步使得对反应机理进行更详细的理论研究成为可能。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了它在多相催化中的基础重要性，以及我们对表面化学理解的不断进步。
