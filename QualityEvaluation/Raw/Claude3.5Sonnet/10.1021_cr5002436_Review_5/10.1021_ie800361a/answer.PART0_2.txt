[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species to form an adsorbed alkene
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) has often been observed to be rate-determining, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. However, this can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual processes occurring on catalyst surfaces are often more complex than this simplified mechanism suggests.

2. Diversity of catalysts and conditions: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-determining steps or additional reaction pathways.

3. Difficulty of direct observation: Many of the proposed intermediates are short-lived and challenging to observe directly, leading to ongoing debates about their exact nature and role.

4. Importance in industrial processes: As this mechanism underlies many important industrial catalytic processes, refining our understanding can lead to significant practical improvements.

5. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface reactions, sometimes challenging previous assumptions.

The ongoing research and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its fundamental importance in catalysis and the complexity of heterogeneous catalytic processes. As our understanding evolves, it helps drive improvements in catalyst design and process optimization for a wide range of industrial applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理用于描述催化脱氢反应，包含四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种脱氢形成吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。在高温下，烷烃的解离吸附（步骤1）通常被观察为速率决定步骤，特别是对于Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂。然而，这可能因反应条件和催化剂特性而异。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：催化剂表面实际发生的过程通常比这种简化机理更复杂。

2. 催化剂和条件的多样性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率决定步骤或额外的反应途径。

3. 直接观察的困难：许多假设的中间体寿命短暂，难以直接观察，导致对它们的确切性质和作用存在持续争议。

4. 在工业过程中的重要性：由于这一机理是许多重要工业催化过程的基础，完善我们的理解可以带来显著的实际改进。

5. 分析技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法不断为表面反应提供新的见解，有时会挑战以前的假设。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了它在催化领域的基础重要性以及多相催化过程的复杂性。随着我们理解的深入，它有助于推动催化剂设计和过程优化的改进，适用于广泛的工业应用。
