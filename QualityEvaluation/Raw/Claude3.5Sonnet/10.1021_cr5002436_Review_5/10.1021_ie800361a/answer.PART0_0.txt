[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Stepwise dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane species
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) has often been observed to be the rate-determining step, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. However, this can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual surface processes can be more complex than the simplified four-step model.

2. Difficulty in direct observation: Many surface intermediates are short-lived and challenging to detect experimentally.

3. Dependence on conditions: The rate-limiting step can change based on temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods continue to provide fresh insights into surface processes.

5. Relevance to industrial catalysis: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for catalyst design and process optimization.

6. Connection to other fields: The mechanism has implications for surface science, computational chemistry, and materials engineering.

The ongoing research on this mechanism reflects the broader challenges in understanding heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level. As new experimental and theoretical tools emerge, scientists continue to refine and sometimes challenge longstanding models of surface reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理用于描述催化脱氢反应，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷烃物种逐步脱氢
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。在高温下，烷烃的解离吸附（步骤1）通常被观察为速率决定步骤，特别是对于Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂。但是，这可能会因反应条件和催化剂性质而异。

尽管Horiuti-Polanyi机理已经研究了近一个世纪，但它仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：实际的表面过程可能比简化的四步模型更为复杂。

2. 直接观察的困难：许多表面中间体寿命短暂，难以通过实验检测。

3. 对条件的依赖性：速率限制步骤可能会随温度、压力和催化剂组成而改变。

4. 分析技术的进步：新方法不断为表面过程提供新的见解。

5. 与工业催化的相关性：理解该机理对催化剂设计和过程优化至关重要。

6. 与其他领域的联系：该机理对表面科学、计算化学和材料工程都有影响。

对这一机理的持续研究反映了在分子水平上理解多相催化的更广泛挑战。随着新的实验和理论工具的出现，科学家们继续完善，有时甚至挑战长期存在的表面反应模型。
