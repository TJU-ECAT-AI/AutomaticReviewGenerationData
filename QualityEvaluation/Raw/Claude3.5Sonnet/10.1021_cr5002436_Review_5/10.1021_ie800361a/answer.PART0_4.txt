[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is usually used to describe dehydrogenation of alkanes and hydrogenation of alkenes over metal catalysts."

[2] "For ethane dehydrogenation, the elementary reaction steps of this mechanism are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)"

[3] "At elevated temperatures, dissociative adsorption of ethane has been observed to be the rate determining step (rds) over a range of metal catalysts, and in particular over Pt and Pt,Sn catalysts."

[4] "From the D2 isotopic labeling experiments, no HD exchange in ethane was observed under all conditions. This indicates that no significant reverse reaction takes place, even under the highest hydrogen and ethene partial pressures, and that the negative dependence of the reaction rate on ethene and hydrogen partial pressures can be attributed to an increased occupation of active surface sites by species of ethene and hydrogen adsorption."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkyl species
3. Desorption of the alkene product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

There has been ongoing debate about which step is rate-limiting. Traditionally, at elevated temperatures, the dissociative adsorption of the alkane (step 1) has been considered the rate-determining step for many metal catalysts, particularly for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. However, this view has been challenged by some researchers.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The actual processes occurring on catalyst surfaces are complex and difficult to observe directly.

2. Variety of catalysts and conditions: Different catalysts and reaction conditions can lead to different rate-limiting steps.

3. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods for studying surface reactions continue to provide fresh insights and sometimes challenge existing models.

4. Importance for industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing better catalysts and optimizing industrial processes.

5. Interplay with side reactions: The mechanism interacts with various side reactions and byproduct formations, complicating the overall picture.

6. Isotope effects: Studies using isotopically labeled reactants can provide conflicting or complex results.

The ongoing research and debate around the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect the broader challenges in understanding heterogeneous catalysis at a fundamental level. As new experimental and theoretical tools become available, our understanding of this important mechanism continues to evolve, making it a persistent topic of scientific interest.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理用于描述金属催化剂上烷烃脱氢和烯烃加氢反应，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种的脱氢
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，一直存在争议。传统上，在高温下，烷烃的解离吸附（步骤1）被认为是许多金属催化剂，特别是Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂的速率决定步骤。然而，这一观点已经受到一些研究人员的质疑。

尽管研究了近一个世纪，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：催化剂表面上实际发生的过程复杂，难以直接观察。

2. 催化剂和条件的多样性：不同的催化剂和反应条件可能导致不同的速率限制步骤。

3. 分析技术的进步：研究表面反应的新方法不断提供新的见解，有时会挑战现有模型。

4. 工业应用的重要性：理解该机理对设计更好的催化剂和优化工业过程至关重要。

5. 与副反应的相互作用：该机理与各种副反应和副产物形成相互作用，使整体情况更加复杂。

6. 同位素效应：使用同位素标记反应物的研究可能提供相互矛盾或复杂的结果。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论反映了在基础层面理解多相催化的更广泛挑战。随着新的实验和理论工具的出现，我们对这一重要机理的理解不断发展，使其成为持续的科学兴趣话题。
