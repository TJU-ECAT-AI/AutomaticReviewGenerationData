[1] "We are led to conclude that the atomic inter- change between benzene and hydrogen and between ethylene and hydro- gen takes place according to mechanism II."

[2] "We can apply the arguments of paragraph II to this reaction and to the comparison of this reaction with those between the separate hydrocarbons and water."

[3] "From a review of the literature we have found that nascent hydro- gen, although a powerful reducing agent, does not hydrogenate double bonds. This is understandable from our previous discussions of mech- anism II(b), if we assume that the metals involved in the production of nascent hydrogen are unable to chemisorb the double bonded com- pounds."

[4] "To review our discussion-the essential processes which we have postulated are :
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen pro- ducing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.
2. The chernisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond com- pound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, while not explicitly described in full in this document, can be inferred from the discussions on hydrogen exchange and hydrogenation mechanisms. Based on the information provided, we can outline the basic steps and discuss its relevance:

1. Chemisorption of hydrogen: The hydrogen molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and dissociates into hydrogen atoms.

2. Chemisorption of the alkene: The unsaturated compound (e.g., ethylene) is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, with the double bond opening and forming new links with the catalyst.

3. Addition of hydrogen: A hydrogen atom is transferred to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming a half-hydrogenated state.

4. Desorption: The final step involves either the removal of a hydrogen atom from another carbon (leading to exchange) or the addition of another hydrogen atom (leading to hydrogenation).

The document does not explicitly state which step is rate-limiting, but it suggests that the chemisorption steps (1 and 2) are faster than the subsequent reactions.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The mechanism involves multiple steps and can lead to different outcomes (exchange or hydrogenation), making it challenging to study and fully understand.

2. Applicability: The mechanism appears to explain various phenomena, including hydrogen exchange, hydrogenation, and even cis-trans isomerization, making it broadly relevant in catalysis.

3. Experimental challenges: The document highlights the difficulties in isolating and studying individual steps of the mechanism, as evidenced by the complex experimental setups described.

4. Theoretical implications: The mechanism touches on fundamental concepts in surface chemistry and catalysis, making it a rich area for theoretical studies and debates.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding this mechanism is crucial for optimizing industrial processes involving hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

While the document doesn't provide a complete picture of the ongoing debates, it demonstrates that even in the early stages of its development, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism was subject to careful experimental scrutiny and theoretical analysis, setting the stage for continued interest and controversy in the field of catalysis.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理虽然在本文档中没有被完整明确地描述，但可以从氢交换和氢化机理的讨论中推断出来。根据所提供的信息，我们可以概述其基本步骤并讨论其相关性：

1. 氢的化学吸附：氢分子被吸附在催化剂表面并解离成氢原子。

2. 烯烃的化学吸附：不饱和化合物（如乙烯）被吸附在催化剂表面，双键打开并与催化剂形成新的连接。

3. 氢的添加：一个氢原子转移到吸附的碳氢化合物的一个碳原子上，形成半氢化状态。

4. 脱附：最后一步涉及从另一个碳原子上移除一个氢原子（导致交换）或添加另一个氢原子（导致氢化）。

文档没有明确指出哪一步是速率限制步骤，但它暗示化学吸附步骤（1和2）比随后的反应更快。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：该机理涉及多个步骤，可能导致不同的结果（交换或氢化），使其难以研究和完全理解。

2. 适用性：该机理似乎可以解释各种现象，包括氢交换、氢化，甚至顺反异构化，使其在催化领域具有广泛相关性。

3. 实验挑战：文档强调了分离和研究机理个别步骤的困难，这从所描述的复杂实验设置中可以看出。

4. 理论意义：该机理涉及表面化学和催化作用的基本概念，使其成为理论研究和辩论的丰富领域。

5. 工业相关性：理解这一机理对于优化涉及氢化和脱氢反应的工业过程至关重要。

虽然文档没有提供关于持续辩论的完整图景，但它表明即使在其发展的早期阶段，Horiuti-Polanyi机理就已经受到仔细的实验scrutiny和理论分析，为催化领域的持续兴趣和争议奠定了基础。
