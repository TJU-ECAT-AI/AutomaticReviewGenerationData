The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Chemisorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface to produce adsorbed hydrogen atoms (not directly quoted but implied from context)

2. Chemisorption of the unsaturated compound on the catalyst surface, involving opening of the double bond and formation of new links with the catalyst

3. Transfer of a hydrogen atom to one carbon atom of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming a half-hydrogenated state

4. Either:
   a) Removal of a hydrogen atom from the half-hydrogenated state, leading to replacement (dehydrogenation)
   b) Addition of another hydrogen atom, resulting in hydrogenation

The document does not explicitly discuss which step is considered rate-limiting or why this mechanism remains controversial. However, we can infer that the mechanism's complexity and the multiple possible pathways (replacement vs. hydrogenation) likely contribute to ongoing scientific interest and debate.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains relevant nearly a century after its proposal due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic processes involving hydrocarbons. The mechanism provides a framework for explaining various phenomena such as hydrogen exchange, cis-trans isomerization, and the competition between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Its ability to account for these diverse processes while also connecting to quantum mechanical principles likely contributes to its enduring scientific interest.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢在催化剂表面的化学吸附，产生吸附氢原子（未直接引用但从上下文推断）

2. 不饱和化合物在催化剂表面的化学吸附，涉及双键的打开和与催化剂形成新的连接

3. 将一个氢原子转移到吸附烃的一个碳原子上，形成半氢化状态

4. 然后发生以下两种情况之一：
   a) 从半氢化状态中移除一个氢原子，导致置换（脱氢）
   b) 添加另一个氢原子，导致氢化

文献并未明确讨论哪一步被认为是速率限制步骤，也没有解释为什么这种机理仍然存在争议。但我们可以推断，该机理的复杂性和多种可能的反应途径（置换vs氢化）可能是持续引起科学兴趣和争论的原因。

尽管提出已近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然具有相关性，这是因为它在理解涉及碳氢化合物的催化过程中具有基础性重要性。该机理为解释各种现象提供了框架，如氢交换、顺反异构化以及氢化和脱氢反应之间的竞争。它能够解释这些多样的过程，同时还与量子力学原理相连接，这可能是它持续引起科学兴趣的原因。
