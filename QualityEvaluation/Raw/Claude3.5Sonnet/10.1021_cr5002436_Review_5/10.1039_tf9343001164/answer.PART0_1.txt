[1] "We are led to conclude that the atomic inter- change between benzene and hydrogen and between ethylene and hydro- gen takes place according to mechanism II."

[2] "We emphasise again that this conclusion is subject to the conditions that (I) the adsorbed water molecules are able to produce more atomic hydrogen than can be taken up by the benzene or the ethylene and (2) that the effect is not due to a shift in the adsorption equilibrium or to a change in the dissociation rate of the adsorbed hydrocarbon mole- cules."

[3] "Since the water-benzene and the water-ethylene ex- change both proceed much more rapidly than the observed interchange between ethylene and benzene, we may further conclude that at least one of these two reactions (water-benzene or water-ethylene) follows mechanism (II)."

[4] "To review our discussion-the essential processes which we have postulated are :
1. The chemisorption (activated adsorption) of the hydrogen pro- ducing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.
2. The chernisorption (activated adsorption) of the double bond com- pound on the surface accompanied by an opening of the double bond and the formation of two new links with the catalyst.
3. The transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon thus forming the half hydrogenated state ; a process which may be followed by
4(a) the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom in the half hydrogenated state leading to replacement, or
4(b) the subsequent attachment of a hydrogen atom to another carbon atom, giving rise to hydrogenation."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Chemisorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface, producing adsorbed hydrogen atoms.

2. Chemisorption of the unsaturated compound (with a double bond) on the catalyst surface. This involves opening the double bond and forming new links with the catalyst.

3. Transfer of a hydrogen atom to one of the carbon atoms of the adsorbed hydrocarbon, forming a half-hydrogenated state.

4. Either:
   a) Removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon in the half-hydrogenated state, leading to replacement (dehydrogenation), or
   b) Attachment of another hydrogen atom to a different carbon atom, resulting in hydrogenation.

The ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is not explicitly addressed in this text. However, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The mechanism involves multiple steps and possible pathways, making it challenging to definitively determine the rate-limiting step.

2. Experimental challenges: The authors emphasize that their conclusions are subject to specific conditions, suggesting that experimental verification can be difficult and results may vary under different conditions.

3. Competing mechanisms: The paper discusses alternative mechanisms (I and II) and subtypes (IIa and IIb), indicating that there may still be debate about the exact process.

4. Broad applicability: The mechanism applies to various reactions (e.g., benzene-hydrogen, ethylene-hydrogen), which may have different rate-limiting steps or behave differently under various conditions.

5. Theoretical and practical importance: Understanding this mechanism is crucial for improving catalytic processes in industrial applications and advancing our knowledge of surface chemistry.

The continued interest in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism likely stems from its fundamental importance in catalysis and the ongoing efforts to refine our understanding of these complex surface reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 氢在催化剂表面的化学吸附，产生吸附的氢原子。

2. 不饱和化合物（具有双键）在催化剂表面的化学吸附。这涉及打开双键并与催化剂形成新的联系。

3. 将氢原子转移到吸附的碳氢化合物的一个碳原子上，形成半氢化状态。

4. 要么：
   a) 从半氢化状态的碳原子上移除一个氢原子，导致替换（脱氢），或
   b) 将另一个氢原子附着到不同的碳原子上，导致氢化。

关于哪一步是限速步骤的持续争论在本文中并未明确讨论。然而，尽管经过近一个世纪的研究，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：该机理涉及多个步骤和可能的途径，使得确定限速步骤变得具有挑战性。

2. 实验挑战：作者强调他们的结论受特定条件限制，表明实验验证可能很困难，结果可能在不同条件下有所不同。

3. 竞争机理：论文讨论了替代机理（I和II）和亚型（IIa和IIb），表明对确切过程可能仍存在争议。

4. 广泛适用性：该机理适用于各种反应（如苯-氢、乙烯-氢），这些反应可能有不同的限速步骤或在不同条件下表现不同。

5. 理论和实际重要性：理解这一机理对改进工业应用中的催化过程和推进我们对表面化学的认识至关重要。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续兴趣可能源于其在催化中的基本重要性，以及持续努力完善我们对这些复杂表面反应的理解。
