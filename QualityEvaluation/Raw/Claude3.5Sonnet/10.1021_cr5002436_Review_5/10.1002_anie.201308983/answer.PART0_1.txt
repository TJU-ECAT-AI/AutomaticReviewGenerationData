The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on chromium-based catalysts for ethylene polymerization and does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism, its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-limiting step based on the given text. The literature does not address why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

给定的文献中没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理。该文档主要关注铬基催化剂用于乙烯聚合，不包含有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理或催化脱氢反应的信息。因此，我无法根据给定的文本提供该机理的详细解释、其步骤或关于速率限制步骤的争论。文献也没有说明为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题。
