The Houdry-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document does not provide information about the four main steps of this mechanism or discuss which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, there is no mention of any ongoing debate or scientific interest regarding this mechanism. The literature focuses on chromia and vanadia catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation but does not specifically address the Houdry-Polanyi mechanism.
