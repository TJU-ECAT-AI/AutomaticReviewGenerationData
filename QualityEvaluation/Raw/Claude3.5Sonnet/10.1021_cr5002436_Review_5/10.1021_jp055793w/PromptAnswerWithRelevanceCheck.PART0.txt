The given scientific literature does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the infrared spectroscopy of ethane adsorbed on gallium oxide and the subsequent dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation processes. It does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its four main steps, nor does it address the debate about the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be directly answered based on the given scientific literature. The document does not contain specific information about this mechanism, its steps, or the debate regarding the rate-limiting step. The text primarily focuses on the infrared spectroscopy of ethane adsorbed on gallium oxide and does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

However, based on general knowledge of catalytic reactions, I can provide some information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism:

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, describes the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. It consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption of the reactant molecule on the catalyst surface
2. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst
3. Addition of a hydrogen atom to the adsorbed molecule (for hydrogenation) or removal of a hydrogen atom (for dehydrogenation)
4. Desorption of the product from the catalyst surface

The debate about which step is rate-limiting continues because it can vary depending on the specific reaction conditions, catalyst, and reactants involved. Some studies suggest the surface reaction step (step 3) is rate-limiting, while others argue for the adsorption or desorption steps.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy because:

1. It applies to many important industrial processes, such as hydrogenation of oils and production of margarine.
2. Understanding the rate-limiting step is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design.
3. Advanced spectroscopic and computational techniques allow for more detailed investigations of each step.
4. The mechanism's applicability to complex systems and its limitations are still being explored.

While the given document doesn't directly address the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, it does discuss related concepts such as adsorption, dissociation, and dehydrogenation of ethane on a catalyst surface, which are relevant to understanding catalytic processes in general.

基于给定的科学文献，无法直接回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理的问题。该文档不包含有关此机理、其步骤或关于速率限制步骤争论的具体信息。该文本主要关注乙烷在氧化镓上吸附的红外光谱，并未讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理。

然而，基于对催化反应的一般认知，我可以提供一些关于Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息：

Horiuti-Polanyi机理由1934年提出，描述了不饱和烃类的催化加氢和脱氢过程。它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 反应物分子在催化剂表面的吸附
2. 氢在催化剂上的解离吸附
3. 向吸附分子添加氢原子（对于加氢反应）或移除氢原子（对于脱氢反应）
4. 产物从催化剂表面脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，因为它可能因特定的反应条件、催化剂和反应物而异。一些研究表明表面反应步骤（第3步）是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为是吸附或脱附步骤。

这个机理之所以仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 它适用于许多重要的工业过程，如油脂加氢和人造黄油生产。
2. 理解速率限制步骤对于优化反应条件和催化剂设计至关重要。
3. 先进的光谱和计算技术允许对每个步骤进行更详细的研究。
4. 该机理在复杂系统中的适用性及其局限性仍在被探索。

虽然给定的文档没有直接讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理，但它确实讨论了相关概念，如乙烷在催化剂表面的吸附、解离和脱氢，这些对于理解催化过程in总体上是相关的。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions cannot be directly answered based on the given scientific literature. The document focuses on the infrared spectroscopy of ethane adsorbed on gallium oxide and does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps in detail. The text does mention dehydrogenation of ethane on gallium oxide at elevated temperatures, but it does not provide information about the specific mechanism or its rate-limiting step. 

To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically discussing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism would be required. The given text does not contain sufficient information to explain the four main steps of the mechanism, analyze the debate about the rate-limiting step, or discuss why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.
