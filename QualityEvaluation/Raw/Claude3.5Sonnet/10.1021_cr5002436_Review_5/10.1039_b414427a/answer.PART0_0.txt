The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not described in the given literature. The document focuses on a different aspect of propane dehydrogenation, specifically the quantitative analysis of coke formation using Raman spectroscopy. It does not contain information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its steps, or debates regarding the rate-limiting step.

The question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this document. To properly address this question, additional sources specifically discussing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism and its current scientific status would be needed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

这篇文献中没有描述催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注丙烷脱氢的另一个方面，即使用拉曼光谱对积炭形成进行定量分析。它不包含有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其步骤或关于速率限制步骤的争论的信息。

基于本文档提供的信息无法直接回答这个问题。要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的专门讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理及其当前科学地位的资料。
