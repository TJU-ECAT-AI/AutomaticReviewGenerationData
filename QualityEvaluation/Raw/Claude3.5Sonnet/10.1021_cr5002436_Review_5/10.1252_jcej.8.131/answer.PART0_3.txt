The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on catalyst fouling in the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature does not provide information on the ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step or why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. As such, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

所给文献中并未讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。该文档主要关注正丁烷在铬-氧化铝催化剂上脱氢时的催化剂失活问题，但并未提及Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献中没有提供关于速率限制步骤的持续争论或为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议话题的信息。因此，无法根据本文档中提供的信息回答该问题。
