The fouling
mechanism of the dehydrogenation
of //-butane
over chromia-alumina catalysts
was studied
both theoretically
and experimentally.
The reaction
experiments
were carried
out using
three
kinds
of chromia-alumina
catalysts
of
different
compositions
and it was clarified
that
dehydrogenation
of //-butane
was effective only
on chromia, whereas coke formation
occurred on alumina as well as on chromia.
The experimental
results
could be well explained
by the
dual active
site
model in which two
kinds
of active
sites
on the
catalytic
surface
and a one-to-one correspondence between the
numberof "molecules of coke" and the number of active
sites
were assumed.
Intro duction
Many heterogeneous
reactions
of
industrial
im-
portance such as cracking,
isomerization
and dehydro-
genation
of
hydrocarbons
are
accompanied
by
a
gradual
decrease
of catalyst
activity
as the
reaction
proceeds.
This
deactivation
of
the
catalyst
is
in
many cases caused
by the deposition
of carbonaceous
substances,
so-called
"coke"
which
is
formed
by
side
r
eaction.
This
phenomenon
is called
catalyst
fouling.
Especially
from the engineering
point
of view it is
a
quite
important
problem1>2)
to
express
the
degree
of
fouling
quantitatively,
and attempts
have been made
to relate
the
activity
factor,
which
is
defined
as the
ratio
of the reaction
rate
at any time after
the start
of
the reaction
to that
at the
initial
reaction
time, with the
process
time8)
or the
coke content
on the catalyst4
7'
9 10).
Several
kinds
of expressions
for
the
activity
factor
such as a linear4},
an exponential7)
or a hyper-
bolic10>
dependency
on coke content
have been pro-
p
osed
by many investigators
but
they
seem to have
little
theoretical
background
or physical
meaning.
The object
of the
present
study
is to
examine
the
physical
meaning of the activity
factor,
and the rate
of
dehydrogenation
of -butane
over chromia-alumina
catalysts
was studied.
The experimental
results
were
well
explained
by the
dual
active
site
model with the
assumptions
that
one-to-one correspondence
exists
between the number of "molecules
of coke" deposited
on a catalyst and the number of active sites and that
the effect of intraparticle diffusion within micropores
can
 be ignored.
1. Experiments and Results
1. 1 Experimental apparatus and procedure
 In Fig. 1, a flow sheet of the experimental apparatus
is shown. rc-Butane (99.6%) or w-butene gas (99.5%)
and nitrogen gas were fed from commercial cylinders
into the reactor at constant flow rates. The reactor
was made of quartz glass (inner diameter 20mm,
length 620 mm), and was heated by an electric heater.
The temperature of the catalyst bed was controlled
within
 0.5C.
 For each experiment, about 2.6 g of the catalyst
was set in the reactor, and was diluted with crushed
ceramics to reduce temperature variation through the
bed. Before the reaction, dehydration of the catalyst
was performed under a nitrogen stream at 580C for
two hours. Thereafter, the catalyst bed was cooled
to the reaction temperature and then w-butane or 1-
butene
 gas was fed.

Coke content
vs. process
time
A
fter
25 minutes from the start
of the
reaction,
the bed condition
reached
steady
state
and the product
gas (w-butene,
i.e.,
the
sum of 1-butene,
trans-2-butene
and cis-2-butene,
and also
light
hydrocarbons
such as
m
ethane,
propane,
ethylene
and propylene)
was ana-
lyzed
by gas chromatography
every
10 to
30 minutes.
Measurement of the
coke content
on the
catalyst
was made for the
different
runs
in which
the
same
reacting
condition
as in the
case of the
rate
measure-
ment was confirmed.
Small
quantities
of the catalyst
particles
were sampled
(about
15 mg) from the center
of the bed
by a water suction
pump with a glass
tube.
The coke content
was measured by a thermal
balance.
1. 2 Catalysts
Three
kinds
of chromia-alumina
catalysts,
made by
Nikki
Chemicals
Co., were used for
the
experiments.
One
of
them, which was used in most cases, was com-
posed
of
20wt%
Cr2O3
and
80wt%?--Al2O3
(here-
after
described
as the
Cr-20/-Al-80
catalyst).
The
second
catalyst
was of
l wt%
Cr2O3 and
99wt%
A12O3
(the
Cr-l/f-Al-99
catalyst).
The
last
one
was
prepared
by
dipping
20wt%
Cr2O3
in
an
alumina
support
annealed
at
1300C
(a-Al2O3)
(the
Cr-20/a-
A
l-80
catalyst).
The pore
distribution
curves
obtained
by the
mer-
cury
penetration
method
are
shown
in
Fig. 2,
in
which the
physical
properties
of the catalysts
are also
illustrated.

.
3 Reacting
conditions
The reaction
was carried
out
at 550C
and
1 atm
through
the
experiments.
The
partial
pressure
of
w-butane was varied
from 0.ll
to
0.56 atm and that
of 1-butene
from 0.045
to 0.275
atm in order
to ana-
l
yze
the mechanism of coke formation.
Most runs were carried
out
under
the
conditions
of low conversion
(max.
12%)
in
order
to
reduce
temperature
and concentration
distribution
through
a
catalyst
bed.
Total
flow rate was mostly
32 //hr
(20C,
1 atm)
and
the
diffusional
resistance
through
the
gas
film
was
estimated
to
be
negligibly
small.
The
size
of
catalyst
used
for
the
reaction
experiments
was
0.21 mm in
average
diameter,
for
which
the
apparent
intraparticle
diffusional
resistance
was confirmed
to be negligible.
Preliminary
experiments
with
crushed
ceramics
in
place of the
catalyst
clarified
that
most of the
light
hydrocarbons
were produced
by a thermal
cracking
reaction and little
from a catalytic
reaction.

These
two
experimental
results
imply
that
coke
formation
occurs
consecutively
to
dehydrogenation
of?z-butane
as w-butanew-butene->coke.
The same
reaction mechanism was reported
by Otake
et al.4).
1. 5 The kinetics
of /i-butane

The
rate
of -butane

at
the
initial
time
(at
zero
coke

is
plotted
against
the
partial
pressure
of
n-butane
in
Fig.
5.
The
depend-
ency on w-butane partial
pressure
was well expressed
by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
equation
with
a single
adsorptive
species
:
rA=k<>pAl(l
+KAPA)
(1)
where KAis
the
adsorption
equilibrium
constant
of
/-butane.
The
values
of
k\
and
KA were
determined
as
0.45x
104
mol/g-cat-sec-atm
and
3.33

6 The kinetics
of coke formation
In Fig.
6, the
initial
rate
of coke formation
is plotted
against the
partial
pressure
of w-butene and it is found
that
the
coke formation
rate
is
of
first
order
with
respect to pB and
that
the
effect
of the
adsorption
of
-butene
can
be
ignored.
Fig.
7 shows
the
effect
of -butane
partial
pressure
on rg,
in which
the
rate
of coke formation
is appreci-
ably affected
bypA.
The dependency
of r onpA can
be well
explained
by the
following
equation
with
the
same value
of KA as in
Eq.
(1)*,
and
this
amy imply
that coke
formation
may not occur on the
catalytic
site
which
is
occupied
by
the
adsorbed
-butane.

7 The effect
of catalyst
composition
To
examine the
reaction
mechanism
in
detail,
two
other
kinds
of chromia-alumina
catalysts
of different
composition
were
used,
namely
the
Cr-l/-Al-99
and
Cr-20/a-Al-80
catalysts.
In
Fig.
3, the
rates
of rc-butene production
in the
case
of
n-butane
feed
(pA=0A2atm)
are plotted
against
process
time
in
which
the
results
obtained
with
the
Cr-20/-Al-80
catalyst
are also
shown.
As
seen from the
figure,
the
catalytic
activity
for
the
dehydrogenation
reaction
of
w-butane
of
both
the
Cr-20/a-Al-80
and
Cr-l/f-Al-99
catalysts
is
much
lower
than
that
of
the
Cr-20/f-Al-80
catalyst.
The
difference of activity
among them
is probably
due
to a
large difference
in the
amount
of chromia
as seen from
the
physical
properties
shown
in
Fig.
2,
and
it
may
reaction,
one-to-one
correspondence
is
assumed
be-
be suggested
that
dehydrogenation
of /z-butane
occurs
o
nly
on
chromia.
In
the
case
of -butene
feed
(pB=0-
275atm),
the
results
exhibit
a different
tendency
from
that
of
the
former
case,
as
seen
from
Fig.
8.
The
coke
content
of the
Cr-20/a-Al-80
catalyst
is very
small
and reaches
the
maximum
value
soon
after
the
start
of the
reaction.
On the
other
hand,
the
coke
content
of the
Cr-1/
f-Al-99
catalyst
continues
to
increase
and tends
to-
ward that
of the
Cr-20/-Al-80
catalyst
in
spite
of a
low concentration
of chromia.
This
implies
that
coke
formation occurs on alumina
as well
as on chromia.
2. Analysis
and Discussion

1 Catalyst
fouling
equations
In the
preceeding
section,
it was suggested
that
the
chromia-alumina
catalyst
has
two
kinds
of
active
sites,
that
is,
chromia
and
alumina.
On chromia,
both dehydrogenation
of /z-butane
and coke formation
occur:
(-butane)-->5(-butene)i>C(coke)
(3)
and
the rate
equations
for rA1 and rcl
at the
initial
time are expressed
as
rlx =rl =klPJ(l

In

the
rate
of catalyst

is
ana-
lyzed with
the
following
assumptions.

For

reaction
and
coke

Though
the
rate
of coke
formation
should
be
expressed
as
a sum of ra and
r<?2, rCi
is much smaller
than
rG\ at
the
beginning
of the
reaction,
as is shown later.
Thus,

be expressed
by Eq. (2)
with
accuracy.

easily
integrated

(13)
And nc is obtained
using
Eqs.
(ll)(13)
as follows:
-H'->(-k))}
+n;,{1
_exp(-i)}
(M)
 The four unknown parameters included in Eq. (14),
i.e. kCi, kC2, ri$i and n"2, were determined using the
experimental data (Fig. 4) for the case ofpA=0. Fig.
8 shows fairly good agreement between the calculated
results obtained with Eq. (14) and the experimental
ones, in which the estimated values of the parameters
are also illustrated. The values ofkC2 and rQ2 for the
Cr-20/a-Al-80 catalyst are negligibly small and this is
probably due to the fact that a:-alumina is inactive for
coke formation as well as for dehydrogenation.
 In the case of the Cr-l/-Al-99 catalyst, n"2 takes so
large a value owing to the large surface area and pore
volume
 occupied by /-alumina.
 The dependency of the rate of coke formation on
w-butane partial pressure can be also well explained
by Eq. (14) using the same values of the parameters.
In the figure, the calculated result in the case where a
single active site is assumed for the Cr-20//-Al-80
catalyst is also shown in dotted lines. It shows a
large deviation from the experiments.
2. 3 The rate of catalyst fouling
 When contact time in a reactor is very small and
the thickness of a reactor is very thin, as is the case in
this experiment, the partial pressure of a reactant
gas may be uniform throughout the reactor. Thus
the mass balance equations for n-butane, w-butene
and coke may be written as follows, taking into
consideration that pseudo-steady-state treatment may
be valid and that the partial pressure of rc-butene is
negligible
 at the inlet of a reactor.

for
the
main
reaction,
<f>m,is
de-
fined as
 n=rA/r
A
             (25)
Accordingly,
the
relation
between
the
activity
factor
and coke content
is obtained
using
Eqs.
(23)(25)
as
<7 =?i(i
-?y+(i
-)
(26)
In
the
case where
only
the
active
site
1 is
effective,
Eq.
(26)
becomes
0m=l
-(Cl/Cl)
In Fig.
9, the
calculated
results
of <fimfor
the
Cr-20/
7--A1-8O
and
Cr-20/a-Al-80
catalysts
are
shown in
solidlines,
which
seem to be in good
agreement
with
the
experimental
data.
In
the
figure,
the
theoretical
result
assuming
the
single
active
site
for
the
Cr-20/
f-Al-80
catalyst
is
also
shown.
It
shows
quite
a large
deviation
from
the
experiments.
For
the
case
of
the
Cr-20/a-Al-80
catalyst
in
which
only
chromia
is
ef-
fective
for
the
coke
formation,
Eq.
(27)
seems
to
be
valid.

4 Comparison with other treatments
Only a few studies
have been reported
on the pro-
blem
of the
expression
of catalyst
fouling
or coke
formation rate
both
experimentally
and theoretically.
Pozzi
et
al.e)
studied
the
rate
of hydrogenation
of
isobutene
over a nickel
catalyst
and
explained
the
results
with
a theoretical
expression
based
on the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood
mechanism,
but
they
did
not
refer
to
the
relation
with
coke
content.
Otake
et
al.4t9)
studied
the
rate
of
dehydrogenation
of
n-
butane over a chromia-alumina
catalyst
and obtained
a
linear
dependency
of <f>m
on coke content,
while
the
rate
of
coke
formation
was not
affected
by
coke.
The experimental
results
were well
explained
by these
relations but the physical
meaning
seems to be lacking.
Takeuchi
et
al.10)
observed
a hyperbolic
dependency
of
<fim on coke content
for
hydrogenation
of
iso-
butylene
over a nickel-on-silica
catalyst
but
they
did
not
correlate
the
coke
formation
rate.
Recently,
Levinter et al.3)
studied
the
kinetics
of coke formation
both
theoretically
and
experimentally,
but
the
effect
of coke content
on catalyst
fouling
was not consid-
ered.
In this
paper,
the behavior
of catalyst
fouling
was
analyzed
both
experimentally
and theoretically.
First,
the
coke
formation
rate
was simulated
based
on the
assumptions
that
the
catalytic
surface
is
composed
of
dual
active
sites
and that
one-to-one correspondence
exists
between
the
number of "molecules
of coke"
deposited
on a catalyst
and the number of catalytic
sites.
The rate
of fouling
was calculated
using
the
estimated
values
of the
parameters.
The agreement
between the
calculated
and experimental
results
was
considered
to be
good
within
a permitted
limit
of
experimental
error.
In
a
subsequent
paper,
the
analysis
will
be
made
for
the
case
where
the
intra-
particle
diffusion
cannot
be
ignored,
using
the
kinetic
equations
obtained
in
this
paper.

3. Conclusions
(1)
It
was
observed
in
the
dehydrogenation
of
w-butane over chromia-alumina
catalysts
that
de-
hydrogenation
occurred
on chromia,
whereas
coke
could
be formed on -alumina
as well
as on chromia.
(2)
The
experimental
results
could
be
well
ex-
plained
by the dual active
site
model under the as-
sumptions
that
one-to-one correspondence
exists
between the number of "molecules
of coke" deposited
on a catalyst
and the numberof catalytic
sites,
and
that the effect
of intraparticle
diffusion
within micro-
pores can be ignored.
