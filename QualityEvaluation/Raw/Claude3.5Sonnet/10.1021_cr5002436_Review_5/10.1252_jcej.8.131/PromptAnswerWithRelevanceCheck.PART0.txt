Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, describing its four main steps and analyzing the ongoing debate regarding which step is considered rate-limiting. Additionally, discuss why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on catalyst fouling in the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not discuss the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or analyze the debate regarding its rate-limiting step based on the given text. The question cannot be answered using the information provided in this document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的信息。该文档主要关注正丁烷在氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂上脱氢过程中的催化剂失活问题，但没有讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。因此，我无法基于给定的文本提供该机理的详细解释或分析有关其速率限制步骤的争论。无法使用本文档中提供的信息来回答这个问题。
