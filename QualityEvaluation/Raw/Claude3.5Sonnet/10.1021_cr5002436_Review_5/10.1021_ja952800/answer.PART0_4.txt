[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon–carbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogen addition: The adsorbed ethylene is hydrogenated to form an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen addition: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated product (ethane) desorbs from the surface.

The debate regarding which step is rate-limiting is ongoing and depends on various factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst type, and substrate. Some researchers argue that the first hydrogen addition is rate-limiting, while others propose that the second addition or desorption step could be rate-determining under certain conditions.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The actual reaction pathway can be more complex than the simplified model, involving multiple intermediates and parallel reaction routes.

2. Surface science advancements: New techniques allow for more detailed investigations of surface species and reaction intermediates, leading to refinements of the original mechanism.

3. Catalyst diversity: Different catalysts and support materials can alter the reaction pathway and rate-limiting step.

4. Pressure gap: Discrepancies between ultra-high vacuum studies and high-pressure industrial conditions continue to challenge researchers.

5. Structure sensitivity: The mechanism may vary depending on the catalyst's surface structure and defects.

6. Environmental and economic importance: Hydrogenation reactions are crucial in many industrial processes, driving continued research to improve efficiency and selectivity.

The ongoing study of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism contributes to our fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and helps in the rational design of more effective catalysts for various applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理于20世纪30年代提出，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烯在清洁金属表面上化学吸附，打破其碳-碳双键之一。

2. 第一个氢原子加成：吸附的乙烯被氢化形成乙基中间体。

3. 第二个氢原子加成：乙基中间体进一步氢化。

4. 脱附：完全氢化的产物（乙烷）从表面脱附。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论仍在继续，这取决于反应条件、催化剂类型和底物等多种因素。一些研究人员认为第一个氢原子的加成是速率限制步骤，而其他人则提出在某些条件下，第二个氢原子加成或脱附步骤可能是决定速率的步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：实际反应途径可能比简化模型更复杂，涉及多种中间体和平行反应路径。

2. 表面科学进展：新技术允许对表面物种和反应中间体进行更详细的研究，导致对原始机理的改进。

3. 催化剂多样性：不同的催化剂和载体材料可以改变反应途径和速率限制步骤。

4. 压力差异：超高真空研究和高压工业条件之间的差异继续挑战研究人员。

5. 结构敏感性：机理可能因催化剂的表面结构和缺陷而异。

6. 环境和经济重要性：氢化反应在许多工业过程中至关重要，推动了持续研究以提高效率和选择性。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究有助于我们对多相催化的基本理解，并有助于为各种应用理性设计更有效的催化剂。
