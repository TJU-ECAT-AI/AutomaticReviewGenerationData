[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogenation: The adsorbed ethylene is hydrogenated to form an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogenation: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated product (ethane) desorbs from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step is not explicitly addressed in the given text. However, this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic processes and the complexity of surface reactions. The mechanism provides a conceptual framework for understanding hydrogenation reactions, but the details of each step and their relative importance can vary depending on specific reaction conditions and catalysts used.

The continued interest in this mechanism likely stems from its applicability to a wide range of catalytic reactions beyond ethylene hydrogenation, as well as the ongoing development of new experimental and theoretical techniques that allow for more detailed investigations of surface processes at the molecular level.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理于20世纪30年代提出，包含四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烯在清洁金属表面上化学吸附，打破其碳-碳双键之一。

2. 第一次氢化：吸附的乙烯被氢化形成乙基中间体。

3. 第二次氢化：乙基中间体进一步氢化。

4. 脱附：完全氢化的产物（乙烷）从表面脱附。

给定的文本中没有明确讨论关于哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论。然而，尽管研究近一个世纪，这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，这是由于它在理解催化过程和表面反应复杂性方面的基础重要性。该机理为理解氢化反应提供了概念框架，但每个步骤的细节及其相对重要性可能因具体反应条件和使用的催化剂而异。

这种机理持续受到关注可能源于其适用于广泛的催化反应，不仅限于乙烯氢化，以及新的实验和理论技术的持续发展，这些技术允许在分子水平上对表面过程进行更详细的研究。
