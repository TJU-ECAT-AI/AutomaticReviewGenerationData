[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogenation: The adsorbed ethylene is hydrogenated to form an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogenation: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated to form ethane.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated ethane molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism stems from the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing intermediates under reaction conditions. Different experimental conditions and catalyst systems can lead to varying conclusions about which step is rate-determining.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Fundamental importance: It serves as a foundational model for understanding heterogeneous catalysis in hydrogenation reactions.

2. Technological relevance: Hydrogenation reactions are crucial in many industrial processes, making a deeper understanding of the mechanism valuable for process optimization.

3. Advances in surface science: New analytical techniques continue to provide fresh insights into surface species and reaction intermediates.

4. Complexity of real catalysts: The mechanism may vary depending on catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions, leading to ongoing discussions about its universality.

5. Connection to other fields: The mechanism has implications for related areas such as electrocatalysis and computational chemistry, maintaining its relevance in broader scientific contexts.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理于20世纪30年代提出，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烯通过断裂一个碳-碳双键在干净的金属表面上化学吸附。

2. 第一次氢化：吸附的乙烯被氢化形成乙基中间体。

3. 第二次氢化：乙基中间体进一步氢化形成乙烷。

4. 脱附：完全氢化的乙烷分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于该机理中哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论源于反应的复杂性和在反应条件下直接观察中间体的困难。不同的实验条件和催化剂系统可能导致对速率决定步骤的不同结论。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 基础重要性：它作为理解氢化反应中多相催化的基础模型。

2. 技术相关性：氢化反应在许多工业过程中至关重要，深入理解该机理对优化过程很有价值。

3. 表面科学的进展：新的分析技术不断为表面物种和反应中间体提供新的见解。

4. 实际催化剂的复杂性：机理可能因催化剂成分、结构和反应条件而变化，导致对其普遍性的持续讨论。

5. 与其他领域的联系：该机理对电催化和计算化学等相关领域有影响，在更广泛的科学背景中保持其相关性。
