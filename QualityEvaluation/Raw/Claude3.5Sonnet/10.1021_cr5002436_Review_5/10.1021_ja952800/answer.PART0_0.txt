[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogen addition: The adsorbed ethylene is partially hydrogenated, forming an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen addition: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated to form ethane.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated ethane molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism stems from the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing intermediate species under reaction conditions. Different studies have proposed various steps as rate-limiting, including the initial adsorption, the first hydrogen addition, or the second hydrogen addition.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Fundamental importance: It serves as a model for understanding more complex hydrogenation reactions.

2. Industrial relevance: Hydrogenation reactions are crucial in many industrial processes, making a thorough understanding of the mechanism vital for process optimization.

3. Advances in analytical techniques: New surface science and spectroscopic methods continue to provide fresh insights into the reaction mechanism.

4. Complexity of real catalysts: The mechanism may vary depending on the specific catalyst, support, and reaction conditions used.

5. Connection to other fields: Understanding this mechanism has implications for related areas such as electrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis in general.

The ongoing research and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism highlight the challenges in fully understanding heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level and the importance of continued investigation in this field.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化加氢反应机理于20世纪30年代提出，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烯在清洁金属表面上化学吸附，打破其碳-碳双键之一。

2. 第一次氢气加成：吸附的乙烯部分加氢，形成乙基中间体。

3. 第二次氢气加成：乙基中间体进一步加氢形成乙烷。

4. 脱附：完全加氢的乙烷分子从催化剂表面脱附。

关于该机理中哪一步是速率限制步骤的争论持续存在，这源于反应的复杂性以及在反应条件下直接观察中间物种的困难。不同的研究提出了各种步骤作为速率限制步骤，包括初始吸附、第一次氢气加成或第二次氢气加成。

尽管已经研究了将近一个世纪，这一机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 基础重要性：它作为理解更复杂加氢反应的模型。

2. 工业相关性：加氢反应在许多工业过程中至关重要，因此深入了解该机理对于过程优化至关重要。

3. 分析技术的进步：新的表面科学和光谱方法不断为反应机理提供新的见解。

4. 实际催化剂的复杂性：机理可能因所使用的特定催化剂、载体和反应条件而异。

5. 与其他领域的联系：理解这一机理对电催化和一般的多相催化等相关领域有影响。

围绕Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和争论突显了在分子水平上完全理解多相催化的挑战，以及在这一领域继续调查的重要性。
