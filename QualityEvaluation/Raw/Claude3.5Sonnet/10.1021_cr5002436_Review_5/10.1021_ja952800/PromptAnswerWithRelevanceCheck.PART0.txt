[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogen addition: The adsorbed ethylene is partially hydrogenated, forming an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogen addition: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated to form ethane.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated ethane molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism stems from the complexity of the reaction and the difficulty in directly observing intermediate species under reaction conditions. Different studies have proposed various steps as rate-limiting, including the initial adsorption, the first hydrogen addition, or the second hydrogen addition.

This mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Fundamental importance: It serves as a model for understanding more complex hydrogenation reactions.

2. Industrial relevance: Hydrogenation reactions are crucial in many industrial processes, making a thorough understanding of the mechanism vital for process optimization.

3. Advances in analytical techniques: New surface science and spectroscopic methods continue to provide fresh insights into the reaction mechanism.

4. Complexity of real catalysts: The mechanism may vary depending on the specific catalyst, support, and reaction conditions used.

5. Connection to other fields: Understanding this mechanism has implications for related areas such as electrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis in general.

The ongoing research and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism highlight the challenges in fully understanding heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level and the importance of continued investigation in this field.
