[1] "A mechanism for the hydrogenation of the simplest olefin, ethylene, over a platinum surface was first proposed in the 1930's by Horiuti and Polanyi (Figure 1)."

[2] "According to their model, ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of the carboncarbon double bonds. This species, which forms two σ bonds with the underlying metal substrate, is then stepwise hydrogenated through an ethyl intermediate to ethane."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, proposed in the 1930s, consists of four main steps:

1. Adsorption: Ethylene chemisorbs on the clean metal surface by breaking one of its carbon-carbon double bonds.

2. First hydrogenation: The adsorbed ethylene is hydrogenated to form an ethyl intermediate.

3. Second hydrogenation: The ethyl intermediate is further hydrogenated.

4. Desorption: The fully hydrogenated product (ethane) desorbs from the surface.

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step in this mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study due to its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic processes and the complexity of surface reactions. The continued research efforts to elucidate the details of this mechanism, as evidenced by the studies described in the literature, suggest that there are still unresolved questions and nuances to be explored in the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化氢化反应机理于20世纪30年代提出，包括四个主要步骤：

1. 吸附：乙烯通过断裂其碳-碳双键之一在清洁金属表面上化学吸附。

2. 第一次氢化：吸附的乙烯被氢化形成乙基中间体。

3. 第二次氢化：乙基中间体进一步氢化。

4. 脱附：完全氢化的产物（乙烷）从表面脱附。

关于该机理中哪一步是速率限制步骤的持续争论在给定的文献中并未明确讨论。然而，尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，这个机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的主题，这是因为它对理解催化过程和表面反应的复杂性具有根本重要性。文献中描述的持续研究努力表明，Horiuti-Polanyi机理中仍有未解决的问题和需要探索的细微差别。
