[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag. (286)"

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)"

[3] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the paraffin
2. C-H cleavage of a second hydrogen atom
3. Formation of a hydrogen molecule
4. Desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin

This mechanism follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all catalyst surface sites are identical.

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. Some studies suggest that the C-H cleavage steps are rate-limiting, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-determining step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The dehydrogenation reaction is catalyzed by a wide range of materials, from noble metals to transition metal oxides, making it challenging to develop a unified mechanism.

2. Experimental limitations: The reaction conditions and the nature of intermediates make it difficult to study the mechanism directly.

3. Ongoing developments: New analytical techniques and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into the reaction mechanism.

4. Industrial importance: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for improving catalyst design and optimizing industrial processes.

5. Interdisciplinary nature: The study of this mechanism involves various fields such as surface chemistry, catalysis, and materials science, leading to diverse perspectives and interpretations.

The continued debate and research on the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism reflect its fundamental importance in understanding catalytic dehydrogenation reactions and the challenges in elucidating complex heterogeneous catalytic processes.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理解释催化脱氢反应包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃的解离吸附
2. 第二个氢原子的C-H键断裂
3. 氢分子的形成
4. 氢气和烯烃的脱附

这种机理遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学，假设所有催化剂表面位点都是相同的。

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，仍存在争议。一些研究表明C-H键断裂步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为烷烃的解离吸附是速率决定步骤。

尽管已经研究了将近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：脱氢反应可以由从贵金属到过渡金属氧化物等多种材料催化，这使得建立统一的机理变得困难。

2. 实验限制：反应条件和中间体的性质使直接研究机理变得困难。

3. 持续发展：新的分析技术和计算方法不断为反应机理提供新的见解。

4. 工业重要性：理解机理对改进催化剂设计和优化工业过程至关重要。

5. 跨学科性质：这种机理的研究涉及表面化学、催化和材料科学等多个领域，导致了多样的观点和解释。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续争论和研究反映了它在理解催化脱氢反应中的基础重要性，以及阐明复杂的多相催化过程所面临的挑战。
