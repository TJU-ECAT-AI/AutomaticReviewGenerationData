[1] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical."

[2] "The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag. (286)"

[3] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)"

[4] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, proposed in 1934, is based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics and assumes all catalyst surface sites are identical. It consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the paraffin
2. C-H cleavage of a second hydrogen atom
3. Formation of a hydrogen molecule
4. Desorption of both hydrogen and olefin

There is ongoing debate regarding which step is rate-limiting. Some studies suggest the C-H cleavage steps are rate-limiting, while others propose the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin as the rate-determining step.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity: The dehydrogenation reaction is catalyzed by a wide range of materials, from noble metals to transition metal oxides, making it challenging to develop a unified mechanism.

2. Experimental limitations: The high temperatures and pressures involved in dehydrogenation reactions make it difficult to directly observe reaction intermediates and determine the exact sequence of steps.

3. Competing mechanisms: Different catalysts may follow slightly different pathways, leading to conflicting experimental results and interpretations.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New spectroscopic and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into the reaction mechanism, sometimes challenging established views.

5. Industrial relevance: The importance of dehydrogenation reactions in industrial processes drives ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and selectivity.

These factors contribute to the continued scientific interest and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, as researchers strive to develop a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions across various catalytic systems.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理是描述催化脱氢反应的最常用机理，由1934年提出，基于Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学，并假设所有催化剂表面位点都是相同的。它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃的解离吸附
2. 第二个氢原子的C-H键断裂
3. 氢分子的形成
4. 氢和烯烃的脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤，目前仍存在争议。一些研究表明C-H键断裂步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则认为烷烃的解离吸附是决定速率的步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 复杂性：脱氢反应可以被多种材料催化，从贵金属到过渡金属氧化物，这使得发展统一的机理变得具有挑战性。

2. 实验限制：脱氢反应涉及的高温高压条件使得直接观察反应中间体和确定准确的步骤顺序变得困难。

3. 竞争机理：不同的催化剂可能遵循略有不同的反应路径，导致实验结果和解释存在矛盾。

4. 分析技术的进步：新的光谱和计算方法不断为反应机理提供新的见解，有时会挑战已建立的观点。

5. 工业相关性：脱氢反应在工业过程中的重要性推动了持续的研究，以改善催化剂性能和选择性。

这些因素共同促使科学家们继续对Horiuti-Polanyi机理保持兴趣并展开讨论，以努力在各种催化系统中发展出更全面的催化脱氢反应理解。
