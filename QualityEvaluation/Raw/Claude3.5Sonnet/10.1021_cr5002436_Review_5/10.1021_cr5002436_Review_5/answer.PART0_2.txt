The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag."

[2] "Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)"

[3] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, proposed in 1934, is the most widely accepted model for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. This mechanism follows Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming all catalyst surface sites are identical. It consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the paraffin
2. C-H cleavage of a second hydrogen atom
3. Formation of a hydrogen molecule
4. Desorption of both hydrogen and olefin

Despite nearly a century of study, the exact mechanism remains a topic of debate. This ongoing controversy stems from two main factors:

1. Rate-limiting step: There is disagreement about which step is rate-limiting. Some studies suggest that the C-H cleavage steps are rate-limiting, while others propose that the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin is the rate-determining step.

2. Diverse catalytic materials: The dehydrogenation reaction is catalyzed by a wide range of materials, from noble metals to transition metal oxides. This diversity complicates the development of a universal mechanistic understanding.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest because:

1. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding catalytic dehydrogenation.
2. Refining the mechanism could lead to improved catalyst design and process optimization.
3. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the need for advanced characterization techniques.
4. Understanding the mechanism is crucial for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

In conclusion, while the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism offers a valuable foundation for understanding catalytic dehydrogenation, the specifics of the mechanism, particularly the rate-limiting step, continue to be subjects of scientific inquiry and debate.

Horiuti-Polanyi机理于1934年提出，是描述催化脱氢反应最广泛接受的模型。该机理遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood动力学，假设所有催化剂表面位点都是相同的。它包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃的解离吸附
2. 第二个氢原子的C-H键断裂
3. 氢分子的形成
4. 氢和烯烃的脱附

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，但确切的机理仍然是一个争论的话题。这种持续的争议主要源于两个因素：

1. 速率限制步骤：关于哪一步是速率限制步骤存在分歧。一些研究表明C-H键断裂步骤是速率限制步骤，而其他研究则提出烷烃的解离吸附是决定速率的步骤。

2. 多样的催化材料：脱氢反应可以被从贵金属到过渡金属氧化物的广泛材料催化。这种多样性使得发展普遍适用的机理理解变得复杂。

Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣的话题，因为：

1. 它为理解催化脱氢提供了基本框架。
2. 完善该机理可能导致改进的催化剂设计和过程优化。
3. 持续的争论突出了多相催化的复杂性和对先进表征技术的需求。
4. 理解该机理对于开发更高效和选择性的工业应用催化剂至关重要。

总之，虽然Horiuti-Polanyi机理为理解催化脱氢提供了有价值的基础，但机理的具体细节，特别是速率限制步骤，仍然是科学研究和争论的主题。
