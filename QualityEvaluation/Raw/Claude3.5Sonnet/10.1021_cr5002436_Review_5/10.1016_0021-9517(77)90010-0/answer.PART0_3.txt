[1] "According to the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are required for the conversion of adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at least two of these sites are associated with a pair of adjacent metal atoms."

[2] "From our results E and B, we then conclude that for the alloys mechanism Bl is to be preferred to the two other mechanisms discussed."

[3] "This mechanism has as the rate-determining step the conversion of propyl radicals to π-bonded propene, using two adsorption sites located on one platinum atom."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Formation of an adsorbed alkyl species
3. Conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species to an adsorbed olefin
4. Desorption of the olefin product

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step has centered around steps 2 and 3. Traditionally, the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism proposed that step 3 required multiple adjacent metal atoms. However, this study suggests that for platinum and platinum-gold alloy catalysts, the rate-determining step involves only a single platinum atom with two adsorption sites.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The exact nature of surface intermediates and transition states is difficult to observe directly.

2. Catalyst diversity: Different catalysts may exhibit variations in the rate-limiting step or overall mechanism.

3. Reaction conditions: The mechanism may change depending on temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods for studying surface reactions continue to provide fresh insights into the mechanism.

5. Importance in industry: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.

6. Theoretical modeling: Improvements in computational chemistry allow for more accurate modeling of reaction pathways, sometimes challenging established views.

The ongoing research in this area aims to reconcile experimental observations with theoretical predictions and to develop a unified understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation across different systems.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 形成吸附的烷基物种
3. 将吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃
4. 烯烃产物的脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论主要集中在步骤2和3。传统上，Horiuti-Polanyi机理认为步骤3需要多个相邻的金属原子。然而，这项研究表明，对于铂和铂-金合金催化剂，速率决定步骤仅涉及单个铂原子上的两个吸附位点。

尽管研究近一个世纪，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：很难直接观察表面中间体和过渡态的确切性质。

2. 催化剂多样性：不同的催化剂可能在速率限制步骤或整体机理上存在差异。

3. 反应条件：机理可能会随温度、压力和反应物浓度的变化而改变。

4. 分析技术的进步：研究表面反应的新方法不断为机理提供新的见解。

5. 工业重要性：理解机理对设计更高效的工业过程催化剂至关重要。

6. 理论建模：计算化学的改进允许对反应途径进行更准确的建模，有时会挑战既定观点。

这一领域的持续研究旨在调和实验观察与理论预测，并在不同系统中发展对催化脱氢的统一理解。
