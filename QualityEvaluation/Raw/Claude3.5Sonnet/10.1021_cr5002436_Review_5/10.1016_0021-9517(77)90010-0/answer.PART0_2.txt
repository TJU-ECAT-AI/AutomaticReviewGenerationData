[1] "According to the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are required for the conversion of adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at least two of these sites are associated with a pair of adjacent metal atoms."

[2] "For the further discussion we thus assume that step ii is the rate-determining step, namely, conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin."

[3] "From our results E and B, we then conclude that for the alloys mechanism Bl is to be preferred to the two other mechanisms discussed."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Formation of an adsorbed alkyl species
3. Conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into an adsorbed olefin
4. Desorption of the olefin product

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step has focused primarily on step 3, the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species to the adsorbed olefin. This step is considered rate-determining in many studies, including the one discussed in this paper.

The mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The exact nature of surface intermediates and transition states is difficult to observe directly.

2. Variation among catalysts: Different catalysts may exhibit different rate-limiting steps or reaction pathways.

3. Influence of reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations can affect the rate-determining step.

4. Advances in analytical techniques: New methods for studying surface reactions continue to provide fresh insights and challenge existing models.

5. Importance for industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions.

6. Debate over the number of active sites involved: As seen in this study, there is ongoing discussion about whether the reaction requires multiple adjacent metal atoms or can occur on a single atom.

The continued study and refinement of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism contribute to our fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and help bridge the gap between surface science and practical catalytic applications.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 形成吸附的烷基物种
3. 将吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃
4. 烯烃产物的脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论主要集中在第3步，即将吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃。在许多研究中，包括本文讨论的研究，这一步被认为是速率决定步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，该机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：很难直接观察表面中间体和过渡态的确切性质。

2. 催化剂之间的差异：不同的催化剂可能表现出不同的速率限制步骤或反应途径。

3. 反应条件的影响：温度、压力和反应物浓度可能影响速率决定步骤。

4. 分析技术的进步：研究表面反应的新方法不断提供新的见解，并对现有模型提出挑战。

5. 对工业应用的重要性：理解机理对设计更高效的催化剂和优化反应条件至关重要。

6. 关于所涉及活性位点数量的争论：如本研究所示，关于反应是否需要多个相邻金属原子或可以在单个原子上进行，仍在进行讨论。

对Horiuti-Polanyi机理的持续研究和完善有助于我们对多相催化的基本理解，并有助于弥合表面科学和实际催化应用之间的差距。
