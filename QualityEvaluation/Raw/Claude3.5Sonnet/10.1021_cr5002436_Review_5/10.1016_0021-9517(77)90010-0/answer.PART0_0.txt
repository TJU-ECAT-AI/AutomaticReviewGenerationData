[1] "According to the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are required for the conversion of adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at least two of these sites are associated with a pair of adjacent metal atoms."

[2] "For the further discussion we thus assume that step ii is the rate-determining step, namely, conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin."

[3] "From our results E and B, we then conclude that for the alloys mechanism Bl is to be preferred to the two other mechanisms discussed."

[4] "Apart from result E, which is the outcome of chemisorption measurements, there is also evidence from alkane-deuterium exchange (9) and from calculations (24) suggesting that alloy surfaces might well be comparatively deficient in hydrogen."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into an adsorbed olefin
3. Desorption of the olefin product
4. Recombination and desorption of hydrogen

The rate-limiting step has been a subject of debate. Traditionally, it was thought that step 2 (conversion of alkyl to olefin) was rate-limiting, requiring multiple adjacent metal sites. However, this study challenges that view.

The authors propose a modified mechanism where only one platinum atom is involved in the rate-determining step, using two adsorption sites on the same atom. This conclusion is based on their experiments with platinum-gold alloys, where the activity per platinum atom remained constant despite dilution.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains controversial because:

1. It's fundamental to understanding heterogeneous catalysis
2. Experimental evidence is often indirect and open to interpretation
3. The mechanism may vary depending on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions
4. Advanced surface science techniques continue to provide new insights
5. It has implications for catalyst design and optimization

The ongoing interest and controversy stem from the mechanism's importance in various industrial processes and the continuous development of new experimental and theoretical tools to study surface reactions at the atomic level.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃
3. 烯烃产物的脱附
4. 氢的重组和脱附

关于哪一步是速率限制步骤一直存在争议。传统上认为步骤2（烷基转化为烯烃）是速率限制步骤，需要多个相邻的金属位点。然而，这项研究对这一观点提出了挑战。

作者提出了一种修正机制，其中只有一个铂原子参与速率决定步骤，使用同一原子上的两个吸附位点。这一结论基于他们对铂-金合金的实验，其中每个铂原子的活性在稀释过程中保持不变。

Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然存在争议，原因如下：

1. 它是理解多相催化的基础
2. 实验证据往往是间接的，可以有不同的解释
3. 机理可能因具体的催化剂和反应条件而异
4. 先进的表面科学技术不断提供新的见解
5. 它对催化剂设计和优化有重要影响

持续的兴趣和争议源于该机理在各种工业过程中的重要性，以及用于研究原子级表面反应的新实验和理论工具的不断发展。
