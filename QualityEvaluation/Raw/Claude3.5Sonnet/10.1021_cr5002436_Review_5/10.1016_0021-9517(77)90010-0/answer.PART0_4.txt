[1] "According to the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism (I), several sites are required for the conversion of adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin, and at least two of these sites are associated with a pair of adjacent metal atoms."

[2] "For the further discussion we thus assume that step ii is the rate-determining step, namely, conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin."

[3] "Therefore, we propose that the two sites required for the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into adsorbed olefin are located on one and the same Pt atom."

[4] "Apart from result E, which is the outcome of chemisorption measurements, there is also evidence from alkane-deuterium exchange (9) and from calculations (24) suggesting that alloy surfaces might well be comparatively deficient in hydrogen."

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions consists of four main steps:

1. Dissociative adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. Formation of an adsorbed alkyl species
3. Conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into an adsorbed olefin
4. Desorption of the olefin product

The ongoing debate regarding the rate-limiting step has focused primarily on step 3, the conversion of the adsorbed alkyl species into an adsorbed olefin. This step is considered rate-limiting by many researchers, including the authors of this study.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy despite nearly a century of study for several reasons:

1. Complexity of surface reactions: The mechanism involves multiple steps and intermediates, making it challenging to definitively identify the rate-limiting step.

2. Variations in catalyst materials: Different catalysts may exhibit different rate-limiting steps or variations in the mechanism.

3. Advances in analytical techniques: New experimental and computational methods continue to provide fresh insights into the details of the mechanism.

4. Importance in industrial applications: Understanding the mechanism is crucial for improving catalyst design and optimizing industrial processes.

5. Debate over active sites: There is ongoing discussion about the nature of the active sites involved in the reaction, as evidenced by the authors' proposal that two sites on a single platinum atom may be involved, rather than sites on adjacent atoms as originally proposed.

6. Role of hydrogen: The mechanism's dependence on hydrogen coverage and its impact on reaction rates continues to be a subject of investigation, as shown by the authors' findings on hydrogen deficiency in alloy surfaces.

These factors contribute to the ongoing scientific interest and debate surrounding the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, driving continued research and refinement of our understanding of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.

Horiuti-Polanyi催化脱氢反应机理包括四个主要步骤：

1. 烷烃在催化剂表面的解离吸附
2. 形成吸附的烷基物种
3. 将吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃
4. 烯烃产物的脱附

关于速率限制步骤的持续争论主要集中在第3步，即将吸附的烷基物种转化为吸附的烯烃。包括本研究作者在内的许多研究人员认为这一步是速率限制步骤。

尽管已经研究了近一个世纪，Horiuti-Polanyi机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议的话题，原因如下：

1. 表面反应的复杂性：该机理涉及多个步骤和中间体，使得明确识别速率限制步骤具有挑战性。

2. 催化剂材料的变化：不同的催化剂可能表现出不同的速率限制步骤或机理变化。

3. 分析技术的进步：新的实验和计算方法不断为机理细节提供新的见解。

4. 在工业应用中的重要性：理解该机理对改进催化剂设计和优化工业过程至关重要。

5. 活性位点的争论：关于反应中涉及的活性位点的性质仍在讨论中，正如作者提出的可能涉及单个铂原子上的两个位点，而不是最初提出的相邻原子上的位点。

6. 氢的作用：机理对氢覆盖度的依赖性及其对反应速率的影响继续是研究的主题，正如作者关于合金表面氢缺乏的发现所示。

这些因素促使Horiuti-Polanyi机理持续受到科学兴趣和争议，推动了对催化脱氢反应理解的持续研究和完善。
