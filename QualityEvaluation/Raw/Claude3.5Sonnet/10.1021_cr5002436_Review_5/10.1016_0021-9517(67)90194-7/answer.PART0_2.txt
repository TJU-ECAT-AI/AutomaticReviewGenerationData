The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not specifically mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature presents a different reaction mechanism involving chromium ions on the catalyst surface, but does not provide information to answer the question about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its rate-limiting step debate, or why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism would be required.

本文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文献重点关注了在铬-氧化铝催化剂上正丁烷的脱氢反应,但并未特别提及Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献提出了一种涉及催化剂表面铬离子的不同反应机理,但没有提供回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其速率限制步骤争议或为何它仍然是科学兴趣和争议话题的信息。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理的资料。
