<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the kinetics and mechanism of n-butane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. As such, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this mechanism or discuss the ongoing debate about its rate-limiting step based on the given text. The literature does not contain the necessary information to answer this question.

给定的科学文献中没有包含关于催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理的任何信息。该文档主要关注在氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂上正丁烷脱氢的动力学和机理,但没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。因此,我无法根据给定的文本对这个机理进行详细解释,也无法讨论关于其速率限制步骤的持续争论。这篇文献不包含回答这个问题所需的必要信息。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts and does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature presents a different reaction mechanism involving chemisorption on Cr2+ ions and a dual-site surface reaction, but does not provide information about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or the ongoing debate regarding its rate-limiting step. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or discuss the scientific interest and controversy surrounding it based on the information given in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文献中并未讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文档主要关注在氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂上正丁烷的脱氢,没有提到Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献提出了一种不同的反应机理,涉及在Cr2+离子上的化学吸附和双位点表面反应,但没有提供有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其速率限制步骤的持续争论的信息。因此,基于本文档给出的信息,我无法详细解释Horiuti-Polanyi机理,也无法讨论围绕它的科学兴趣和争议。

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of n-butane over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not specifically mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism or its steps. The literature presents a different reaction mechanism involving chromium ions on the catalyst surface, but does not provide information to answer the question about the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, its rate-limiting step debate, or why it remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy. To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism would be required.

本文献中没有讨论催化脱氢反应的Horiuti-Polanyi机理。文献重点关注了在铬-氧化铝催化剂上正丁烷的脱氢反应,但并未特别提及Horiuti-Polanyi机理或其步骤。文献提出了一种涉及催化剂表面铬离子的不同反应机理,但没有提供回答有关Horiuti-Polanyi机理、其速率限制步骤争议或为何它仍然是科学兴趣和争议话题的信息。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门讨论Horiuti-Polanyi机理的资料。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions is not discussed in the given scientific literature. The document focuses on the kinetics and mechanism of n-butane dehydrogenation over chromia-alumina catalysts, but does not mention the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism specifically. The literature describes a dual-site mechanism for n-butane dehydrogenation, but this is different from the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

The Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, while an important concept in catalytic dehydrogenation, is not covered in this particular document. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of its four main steps or discuss the debate about its rate-limiting step based on the given information. The document does not contain any information about why this mechanism remains a topic of scientific interest and controversy.

To accurately answer this question would require information from other sources beyond what is provided in the given scientific literature.

虽然Horiuti-Polanyi机理是催化脱氢反应中的一个重要概念，但在这份特定文档中并未涉及。因此，我无法根据给定的信息详细解释其四个主要步骤或讨论关于其速率限制步骤的争论。该文档也不包含任何关于为什么这种机理仍然是科学兴趣和争议话题的信息。

要准确回答这个问题需要超出给定科学文献范围的其他信息来源。
