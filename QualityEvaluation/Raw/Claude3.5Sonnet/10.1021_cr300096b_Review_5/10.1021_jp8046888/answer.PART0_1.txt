[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[3] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the oxygen adsorption strength and stability of the catalyst surfaces.

In Pt-segregated systems, the order of oxygen adsorption strength is Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111), which is the reverse of the order found for nonsegregated Pt3M alloys. This indicates that surface segregation alters the catalytic properties of these alloys.

The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean conditions and under oxygen adsorption. Interestingly, the degree of stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strengths of the alloys. This suggests that weaker oxygen binding correlates with stronger Pt surface layer adhesion to the subsurface, thus improving the stability of Pt atoms against dissolution.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance. The enhanced stability of Pt-skin surfaces could lead to improved durability of catalysts in various applications, particularly in fuel cells where catalyst degradation is a significant concern. Additionally, the ability to tune oxygen adsorption strength through alloying and surface segregation provides a means to optimize catalytic activity for specific reactions.

The protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer, highlights the importance of subsurface composition in designing stable and effective catalysts. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了Pt基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素影响了氧气吸附强度和催化剂表面的稳定性。

在Pt偏析系统中，氧气吸附强度的顺序为Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111)，这与非偏析Pt3M合金的顺序相反。这表明表面偏析改变了这些合金的催化性能。

与纯Pt表面相比，三种合金的Pt-皮层表面的Pt原子稳定性得到了提高，这种现象在清洁条件下和氧气吸附条件下都观察到。有趣的是，稳定性提高的程度与合金的氧气吸附强度呈反比。这表明较弱的氧气结合与Pt表面层对亚表面的较强粘附相关，从而提高了Pt原子抗溶解的稳定性。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响。Pt-皮层表面的增强稳定性可能导致各种应用中催化剂耐久性的提高，特别是在催化剂降解是一个重大问题的燃料电池中。此外，通过合金化和表面偏析来调节氧气吸附强度的能力为优化特定反应的催化活性提供了方法。

3d亚表面原子的保护作用，由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定，突显了亚表面组成在设计稳定和有效催化剂中的重要性。这种理解可以指导开发更高效和耐用的Pt基催化剂，用于各种应用，包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程。
