[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species."

[3] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[4] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the surface composition and adsorption properties, which in turn affect catalytic performance.

For Pt-based systems, surface segregation of Pt occurs, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation alters the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys. In Pt-segregated systems, the order becomes Pt3Ni > Pt3Co > Pt3Fe, which is the reverse of nonsegregated alloys.

The adsorption properties are primarily determined by surface geometry (strain effects) and electronic structure (effects due to change in metal species). These factors contribute to the differences in catalytic properties between pure Pt and Pt-alloy surfaces.

In terms of stability, the presence of adsorbed oxygen generally decreases the stability of both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces compared to clean Pt surfaces. However, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under oxygen adsorption conditions. The potential shifts for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni are higher than those of pure Pt, indicating better stability against dissolution.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance. The enhanced stability of Pt-skin surfaces under reaction conditions (with adsorbed oxygen) suggests improved durability of these catalysts. The different adsorption strengths and surface compositions resulting from segregation can lead to varied catalytic activities for different reactions, allowing for the design of tailored catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素决定了表面组成和吸附性质，从而影响催化性能。

对于基于Pt的系统，Pt会发生表面偏析，形成Pt表皮层。这种偏析改变了不同合金间氧气吸附强度的顺序。在Pt偏析系统中，顺序变为Pt3Ni > Pt3Co > Pt3Fe，这与非偏析合金的顺序相反。

吸附性质主要由表面几何结构（应变效应）和电子结构（金属种类变化引起的效应）决定。这些因素导致纯Pt表面和Pt合金表面之间的催化性质差异。

在稳定性方面，吸附氧气的存在通常会降低纯Pt和Pt表皮表面相对于洁净Pt表面的稳定性。然而，在氧气吸附条件下，合金的Pt表皮表面仍然比纯Pt表面表现出更高的稳定性。Pt3Fe、Pt3Co和Pt3Ni的电位偏移比纯Pt高，表明它们对溶解的稳定性更好。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响。Pt表皮表面在反应条件下（有吸附氧气）的增强稳定性表明这些催化剂具有更好的耐久性。由偏析引起的不同吸附强度和表面组成可能导致不同反应的催化活性各异，这允许为特定应用设计定制催化剂。
