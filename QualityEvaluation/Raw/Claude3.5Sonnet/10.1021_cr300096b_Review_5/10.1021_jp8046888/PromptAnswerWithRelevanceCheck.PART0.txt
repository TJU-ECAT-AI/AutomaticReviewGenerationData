[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species."

[3] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[4] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the surface composition and adsorption properties, which in turn affect catalytic performance.

For Pt-based systems, surface segregation of Pt occurs, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation alters the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys. In Pt-segregated systems, the order becomes Pt3Ni > Pt3Co > Pt3Fe, which is the reverse of nonsegregated alloys.

The adsorption properties are primarily determined by surface geometry (strain effects) and electronic structure (effects due to change in metal species). These factors contribute to the differences in catalytic properties between pure Pt and Pt-alloy surfaces.

In terms of stability, the presence of adsorbed oxygen generally decreases the stability of both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces compared to clean Pt surfaces. However, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under oxygen adsorption conditions. The potential shifts for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni are higher than those of pure Pt, indicating better stability against dissolution.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance. The enhanced stability of Pt-skin surfaces under reaction conditions (with adsorbed oxygen) suggests improved durability of these catalysts. The different adsorption strengths and surface compositions resulting from segregation can lead to varied catalytic activities for different reactions, allowing for the design of tailored catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素决定了表面组成和吸附性质，从而影响催化性能。

对于基于Pt的系统，Pt会发生表面偏析，形成Pt表皮层。这种偏析改变了不同合金间氧气吸附强度的顺序。在Pt偏析系统中，顺序变为Pt3Ni > Pt3Co > Pt3Fe，这与非偏析合金的顺序相反。

吸附性质主要由表面几何结构（应变效应）和电子结构（金属种类变化引起的效应）决定。这些因素导致纯Pt表面和Pt合金表面之间的催化性质差异。

在稳定性方面，吸附氧气的存在通常会降低纯Pt和Pt表皮表面相对于洁净Pt表面的稳定性。然而，在氧气吸附条件下，合金的Pt表皮表面仍然比纯Pt表面表现出更高的稳定性。Pt3Fe、Pt3Co和Pt3Ni的电位偏移比纯Pt高，表明它们对溶解的稳定性更好。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响。Pt表皮表面在反应条件下（有吸附氧气）的增强稳定性表明这些催化剂具有更好的耐久性。由偏析引起的不同吸附强度和表面组成可能导致不同反应的催化活性各异，这允许为特定应用设计定制催化剂。

Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the oxygen adsorption strength and stability of the catalyst surfaces.

In Pt-segregated systems, the order of oxygen adsorption strength is Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111), which is the reverse of the order found for nonsegregated Pt3M alloys. This indicates that surface segregation alters the catalytic properties of these alloys.

The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean conditions and under oxygen adsorption. Interestingly, the degree of stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strengths of the alloys. This suggests that weaker oxygen binding correlates with stronger Pt surface layer adhesion to the subsurface, thus improving the stability of Pt atoms against dissolution.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance. The enhanced stability of Pt-skin surfaces could lead to improved durability of catalysts in various applications, particularly in fuel cells where catalyst degradation is a significant concern. Additionally, the ability to tune oxygen adsorption strength through alloying and surface segregation provides a means to optimize catalytic activity for specific reactions.

The protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer, highlights the importance of subsurface composition in designing stable and effective catalysts. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了Pt基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素影响了氧气吸附强度和催化剂表面的稳定性。

在Pt偏析系统中，氧气吸附强度的顺序为Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111)，这与非偏析Pt3M合金的顺序相反。这表明表面偏析改变了这些合金的催化性能。

与纯Pt表面相比，三种合金的Pt-皮层表面的Pt原子稳定性得到了提高，这种现象在清洁条件下和氧气吸附条件下都观察到。有趣的是，稳定性提高的程度与合金的氧气吸附强度呈反比。这表明较弱的氧气结合与Pt表面层对亚表面的较强粘附相关，从而提高了Pt原子抗溶解的稳定性。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响。Pt-皮层表面的增强稳定性可能导致各种应用中催化剂耐久性的提高，特别是在催化剂降解是一个重大问题的燃料电池中。此外，通过合金化和表面偏析来调节氧气吸附强度的能力为优化特定反应的催化活性提供了方法。

3d亚表面原子的保护作用，由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定，突显了亚表面组成在设计稳定和有效催化剂中的重要性。这种理解可以指导开发更高效和耐用的Pt基催化剂，用于各种应用，包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程。

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition: Introducing 3d metals into Pt systems alters surface adsorption properties. This changes the catalytic behavior compared to pure Pt surfaces.

2. Binding site preferences: The fcc sites remain most favorable for oxygen adsorption in alloy systems, with binding strength following the order fcc > hcp > bridge > top. This is similar to both Pt(111) and non-segregated Pt3M surfaces.

3. Oxygen binding strength: The general trend for oxygen binding strength is Pt-skin of Pt3M < Pt(111) < Pt3M(111). This indicates that alloying and surface segregation can tune the reactivity.

4. Determining factors: Adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by surface geometry and electronic structure. These factors are influenced by the alloying and reaction conditions.

5. Stability under reaction conditions: In the presence of adsorbed oxygen (0.25 ML), both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces show decreased stability compared to clean Pt surfaces. This suggests that reaction conditions can affect catalyst stability.

6. Enhanced stability of Pt-skin alloys: Despite the destabilizing effect of oxygen adsorption, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under oxygen adsorption. This indicates that alloying can improve catalyst durability under reaction conditions.

These findings demonstrate that the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impacts the structure and properties of bimetallic catalysts. By carefully tuning alloy composition and surface structure, it is possible to optimize catalytic performance and stability for various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the oxygen adsorption strength and surface stability in different ways:

1. Surface segregation: Pt tends to segregate to the surface in Pt-3d alloys, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation changes the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys compared to their non-segregated counterparts.

2. Structural configuration: The interlayer distance between the top two layers remains relatively constant during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can be used as an indicator of binding strength.

3. Stability: Pt-skin surfaces of the studied alloys show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean conditions and with adsorbed oxygen. This stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strength.

4. Subsurface effects: The 3d subsurface atoms play a protective role by strongly binding to the Pt surface layer, contributing to the overall stability of the catalyst.

These findings have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts:

1. Tunable activity: By altering the composition and structure of the alloy, the oxygen adsorption strength can be fine-tuned, potentially optimizing catalytic activity for specific reactions.

2. Enhanced durability: The increased stability of Pt-skin surfaces suggests improved durability of these catalysts under reaction conditions, which is crucial for long-term performance in applications such as fuel cells.

3. Balancing activity and stability: The inverse relationship between stability enhancement and oxygen adsorption strength highlights the need to balance these properties when designing catalysts for specific applications.

4. Rational catalyst design: Understanding the role of subsurface 3d metals in stabilizing the Pt surface layer can guide the development of more efficient and durable catalysts by strategically selecting alloying elements and controlling surface segregation.
