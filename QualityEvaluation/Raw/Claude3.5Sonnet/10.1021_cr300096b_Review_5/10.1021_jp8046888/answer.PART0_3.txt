[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[3] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the oxygen adsorption strength and surface stability in different ways:

1. Surface segregation: Pt tends to segregate to the surface in Pt-3d alloys, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation changes the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys compared to their non-segregated counterparts.

2. Structural configuration: The interlayer distance between the top two layers remains relatively constant during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can be used as an indicator of binding strength.

3. Stability: Pt-skin surfaces of the studied alloys show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean conditions and with adsorbed oxygen. This stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strength.

4. Subsurface effects: The 3d subsurface atoms play a protective role by strongly binding to the Pt surface layer, contributing to the overall stability of the catalyst.

These findings have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts:

1. Tunable activity: By altering the composition and structure of the alloy, the oxygen adsorption strength can be fine-tuned, potentially optimizing catalytic activity for specific reactions.

2. Enhanced durability: The increased stability of Pt-skin surfaces suggests improved durability of these catalysts under reaction conditions, which is crucial for long-term performance in applications such as fuel cells.

3. Balancing activity and stability: The inverse relationship between stability enhancement and oxygen adsorption strength highlights the need to balance these properties when designing catalysts for specific applications.

4. Rational catalyst design: Understanding the role of subsurface 3d metals in stabilizing the Pt surface layer can guide the development of more efficient and durable catalysts by strategically selecting alloying elements and controlling surface segregation.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了Pt基双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素以不同方式影响氧气吸附强度和表面稳定性：

1. 表面偏析：Pt倾向于在Pt-3d合金中偏析到表面，形成Pt-皮层。这种偏析改变了不同合金之间氧气吸附强度的顺序，与非偏析合金相比有所不同。

2. 结构构型：在氧气吸附过程中，顶部两层之间的层间距保持相对恒定，而Pt/M-O键长可用作结合强度的指标。

3. 稳定性：研究的合金的Pt-皮层表面相比纯Pt表面显示出增强的稳定性，无论是在清洁条件下还是有吸附氧气的情况下。这种稳定性增强与氧气吸附强度呈反比。

4. 亚表面效应：3d亚表面原子通过与Pt表面层的强结合起到保护作用，有助于催化剂的整体稳定性。

这些发现对Pt基双金属催化剂的催化性能和应用有重要影响：

1. 可调活性：通过改变合金的成分和结构，可以精细调节氧气吸附强度，潜在地优化特定反应的催化活性。

2. 提高耐久性：Pt-皮层表面稳定性的增加表明这些催化剂在反应条件下的耐久性得到改善，这对燃料电池等应用的长期性能至关重要。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：稳定性增强与氧气吸附强度之间的反比关系突出了在设计特定应用的催化剂时需要平衡这些性质。

4. 理性催化剂设计：理解亚表面3d金属在稳定Pt表面层中的作用可以指导开发更高效和耐用的催化剂，通过战略性地选择合金元素和控制表面偏析。
