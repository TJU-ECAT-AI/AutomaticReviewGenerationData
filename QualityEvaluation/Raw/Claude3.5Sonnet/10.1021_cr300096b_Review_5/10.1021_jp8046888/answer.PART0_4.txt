[1] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[2] "Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties."

[3] "The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect."

[4] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Introduction of 3d metals into Pt systems considerably alters surface adsorption properties. This affects catalyst stability and reactivity.

2. On non-segregated surfaces, 3d metal atoms directly participate in oxygen adsorption, enhancing adsorption strength. However, on Pt-segregated surfaces, they weaken oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and electronic effects.

3. The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both on clean surfaces and with adsorbed oxygen. This stability enhancement is inversely related to oxygen adsorption strength.

4. The protective role of subsurface 3d atoms is determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. This influences the overall stability and catalytic performance of the alloy.

5. The interlayer distance of the top two layers changes little during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can generally indicate binding strength. This structural behavior impacts catalyst stability and reactivity.

These thermodynamic and structural factors significantly affect the catalytic properties of Pt-3d alloys, influencing their performance in applications such as fuel cells and other catalytic processes.

Pt基双金属催化剂（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的显著影响。这些因素对其催化性能和应用表现有重要影响：

1. 将3d金属引入Pt系统会显著改变表面吸附性质。这影响了催化剂的稳定性和反应活性。

2. 在非偏析表面上，3d金属原子直接参与氧气吸附，增强吸附强度。然而，在Pt偏析表面上，由于表面应变和电子效应，它们削弱了氧气吸附。

3. 与纯Pt表面相比，Pt皮层表面的Pt原子稳定性得到增强，无论是在清洁表面还是有吸附氧的情况下。这种稳定性增强与氧气吸附强度呈反比。

4. 亚表面3d原子的保护作用由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定。这影响了合金的整体稳定性和催化性能。

5. 在氧气吸附过程中，顶部两层的层间距变化很小，而Pt/M-O键长通常可以指示结合强度。这种结构行为影响催化剂的稳定性和反应活性。

这些热力学和结构因素显著影响Pt-3d合金的催化性能，进而影响它们在燃料电池和其他催化过程中的应用表现。
