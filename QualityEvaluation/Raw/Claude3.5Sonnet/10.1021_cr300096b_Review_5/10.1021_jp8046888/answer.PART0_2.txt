[1] "Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties."

[2] "Our calculations indicate that fcc sites are still the most favorable for all the alloy systems and the O binding strength still follows the order of fcc > hcp > bridge > top, analogous to Pt(111) and nonsegregated Pt3M surfaces."

[3] "Therefore, the general trend of O binding strength is determined as Pt-skin of Pt3M < Pt(111) < Pt3M(111)."

[4] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure."

[5] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[6] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition: Introducing 3d metals into Pt systems alters surface adsorption properties. This changes the catalytic behavior compared to pure Pt surfaces.

2. Binding site preferences: The fcc sites remain most favorable for oxygen adsorption in alloy systems, with binding strength following the order fcc > hcp > bridge > top. This is similar to both Pt(111) and non-segregated Pt3M surfaces.

3. Oxygen binding strength: The general trend for oxygen binding strength is Pt-skin of Pt3M < Pt(111) < Pt3M(111). This indicates that alloying and surface segregation can tune the reactivity.

4. Determining factors: Adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by surface geometry and electronic structure. These factors are influenced by the alloying and reaction conditions.

5. Stability under reaction conditions: In the presence of adsorbed oxygen (0.25 ML), both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces show decreased stability compared to clean Pt surfaces. This suggests that reaction conditions can affect catalyst stability.

6. Enhanced stability of Pt-skin alloys: Despite the destabilizing effect of oxygen adsorption, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under oxygen adsorption. This indicates that alloying can improve catalyst durability under reaction conditions.

These findings demonstrate that the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impacts the structure and properties of bimetallic catalysts. By carefully tuning alloy composition and surface structure, it is possible to optimize catalytic performance and stability for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂（特别是基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面组成：将3d金属引入Pt系统会改变表面吸附性质。这使得催化行为与纯Pt表面相比发生变化。

2. 结合位点偏好：在合金系统中，fcc位点仍然是氧吸附最有利的位点，结合强度遵循fcc > hcp > bridge > top的顺序。这与Pt(111)和非偏析Pt3M表面相似。

3. 氧结合强度：氧结合强度的一般趋势是Pt3M的Pt皮层 < Pt(111) < Pt3M(111)。这表明合金化和表面偏析可以调节反应活性。

4. 决定因素：金属表面的吸附性质主要由表面几何结构和电子结构决定。这些因素受合金化和反应条件的影响。

5. 反应条件下的稳定性：在有吸附氧（0.25 ML）存在的情况下，纯Pt和Pt皮层表面与清洁Pt表面相比都显示出稳定性降低。这表明反应条件可以影响催化剂的稳定性。

6. Pt皮层合金的增强稳定性：尽管氧吸附有降低稳定性的效果，但在氧吸附下，合金的Pt皮层表面仍然比纯Pt表面显示出更高的稳定性。这表明合金化可以提高催化剂在反应条件下的耐久性。

这些发现表明，热力学偏好与反应条件之间的相互作用显著影响双金属催化剂的结构和性质。通过仔细调整合金成分和表面结构，可以优化各种应用中的催化性能和稳定性。
