[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[2] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[3] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

[4] "The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and this is also approximately where both the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of CuPt alloys, the presence of adsorbates like CO can dramatically alter the surface composition and structure.

Under clean conditions, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, as Cu diffusion to the surface is endothermic. However, when exposed to CO at elevated pressures and temperatures, the less reactive Cu is pulled to the surface, contrary to typical expectations of adsorbate-induced segregation.

This CO-induced Cu surface segregation is driven by a significant increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer. The formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure overcomes the endothermic nature of Cu surface migration.

Temperature plays a crucial role in this process. The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant around 460 K, which coincides with the formation and breakup of the CO-induced surface alloy. This temperature dependence highlights the importance of kinetic factors in determining the final surface structure.

The structural reconfiguration of the CuPt alloy in response to CO adsorption has important implications for its catalytic properties. The formation of well-defined, isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu atoms in the surface layer can lead to altered reactivity and selectivity compared to pure Pt or the initial near-surface alloy structure.

These findings demonstrate the complex interplay between thermodynamics, kinetics, and adsorbate-surface interactions in determining the surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts. They also highlight the potential for using adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for various catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。以CuPt合金为例，CO等吸附物的存在可以显著改变表面组成和结构。

在清洁条件下，Cu倾向于停留在CuPt近表面合金的亚表面层，因为Cu向表面扩散是吸热的。然而，当在高压和高温下暴露于CO时，反应性较低的Cu被拉到表面，这与典型的吸附诱导偏析预期相反。

这种CO诱导的Cu表面偏析是由Cu存在于第一表面层时CO结合能显著增加所驱动的。稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构的形成克服了Cu表面迁移的吸热性质。

温度在这个过程中起着至关重要的作用。Cu和Pt的相互扩散在460 K左右变得显著，这与CO诱导的表面合金的形成和分解相吻合。这种温度依赖性突出了动力学因素在决定最终表面结构中的重要性。

CuPt合金对CO吸附的结构重构对其催化性能有重要影响。表面层中由Cu原子包围的孤立Pt位点的形成可能导致与纯Pt或初始近表面合金结构相比反应性和选择性的改变。

这些发现表明，热力学、动力学和吸附物-表面相互作用在决定双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构方面存在复杂的相互作用。它们也强调了利用吸附物诱导的表面变化作为选择性和动态工程合金表面的工具的潜力，以用于各种催化应用。
