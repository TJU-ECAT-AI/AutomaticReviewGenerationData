[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[2] "The earlier density functional theory (DFT) study (15) indicated increased PtCO bonding when Cu is present in the first layer, similar to what is observed for other coinage/Pt-group metal systems."

[3] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

[4] "Clearly, there is a driving force toward having 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer when CO is adsorbed atop the remaining surface Pt sites. As Table 1 shows, the origin of the exothermicity is the vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of CuPt alloys, the presence of CO adsorbates at elevated pressures and temperatures causes a dramatic change in the surface structure.

Without CO, the thermodynamically preferred configuration is a near-surface alloy with Cu in the second layer. However, when CO is introduced at high pressures and temperatures, it induces surface segregation of Cu, pulling it to the top layer. This is contrary to typical observations where the more reactive component (usually Pt in this case) tends to segregate to the surface.

The driving force for this unusual segregation is the significantly increased PtCO bond strength when Cu is present in the first layer. DFT calculations show that having 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer becomes energetically favorable when CO is adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites.

This CO-induced surface restructuring has important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The formation of a stable, well-ordered surface alloy with isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu can dramatically alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity. It provides a way to tune the electronic structure of the surface and potentially enhance catalytic performance for specific reactions.

These findings suggest that reaction conditions can be used as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications, particularly those involving CO or similar adsorbates.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中。以CuPt合金为例，在高压和高温条件下CO吸附物的存在会导致表面结构发生显著变化。

在没有CO的情况下，热力学上更倾向于Cu在第二层的近表面合金构型。然而，当在高压和高温下引入CO时，它会诱导Cu的表面偏析，将其拉到顶层。这与通常观察到的更活泼的组分（在这种情况下通常是Pt）倾向于偏析到表面的情况相反。

这种不寻常偏析的驱动力是Cu存在于第一层时PtCO键强度的显著增加。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，当CO吸附在剩余的Pt位点上时，第一层有2/3单层的Cu在能量上变得更有利。

这种CO诱导的表面重构对催化性能有重要影响。形成稳定的、有序的表面合金，其中Pt位点被Cu孤立包围，可以显著改变催化剂的反应性和选择性。这提供了一种调节表面电子结构的方法，potentially增强特定反应的催化性能。

这些发现表明，反应条件可以用作选择性和动态工程合金表面的工具，为催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性，尤其是在涉及CO或类似吸附物的各种应用中。
