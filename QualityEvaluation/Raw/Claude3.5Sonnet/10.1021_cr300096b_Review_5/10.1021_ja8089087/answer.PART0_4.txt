[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[2] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of CuPt alloys, the presence of CO adsorbates at elevated pressures and temperatures can dramatically alter the surface composition and structure.

Under clean conditions, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, as Cu diffusion to the surface is endothermic. However, when CO is introduced at high pressures and temperatures, it induces Cu segregation to the surface, contrary to typical expectations of adsorbate-induced segregation.

This unexpected behavior is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. The presence of Cu in the first surface layer of Pt significantly strengthens the PtCO bond, which more than compensates for the endothermic nature of Cu surface segregation.

The most stable configuration under CO adsorption is found to be 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop the remaining Pt sites. This structural change has important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The stronger PtCO binding and the formation of well-defined, isolated Pt sites can significantly alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions and demonstrate how adsorbates can be used as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces. This understanding can be applied to optimize catalyst performance in various applications, potentially extending to other coinage metal/Pt-group bimetallic systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。以CuPt合金为例，在高压和高温条件下CO吸附剂的存在可以显著改变表面组成和结构。

在清洁条件下，Cu倾向于保持在CuPt近表面合金的亚表面层中，因为Cu向表面扩散是吸热的。然而，当在高压和高温下引入CO时，它会诱导Cu向表面偏析，这与典型的吸附剂诱导偏析预期相反。

这种意外行为是由于形成了稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构。Cu在Pt的第一表面层中的存在显著增强了PtCO键，这种增强足以抵消Cu表面偏析的吸热性质。

在CO吸附条件下，最稳定的构型是第一层中有2/3 ML的Cu，剩余的Pt位点上吸附1/3 ML的CO。这种结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。更强的PtCO结合和形成良好定义的孤立Pt位点可以显著改变催化剂的反应活性和选择性。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂表面在反应条件下的动态性质，并展示了如何利用吸附剂作为选择性和动态工程合金表面的工具。这种理解可以应用于优化各种应用中的催化剂性能，潜在地扩展到其他贵金属/铂族双金属系统。
