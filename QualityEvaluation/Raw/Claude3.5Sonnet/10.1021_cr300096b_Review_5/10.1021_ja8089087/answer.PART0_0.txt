[1] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure. The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[2] "Counterintuitive to this picture, we show that CO adsorption induces surface segregation of the less reactive alloy component, Cu, switching a CuPt near-surface alloy (15) to a novel well-ordered CuPt surface alloy."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-Cu alloys. The study shows that:

1. In the absence of adsorbates, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a Pt-Cu alloy, forming a near-surface alloy (NSA) structure.

2. However, under CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures, Cu unexpectedly segregates to the surface, forming a novel surface alloy (SA) structure.

3. This surface segregation is driven by the drastically increased CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt, which overcomes the endothermic nature of Cu diffusion to the surface.

4. The most stable configuration under CO adsorption is 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically under reaction conditions, affecting activity and selectivity.

2. The presence of adsorbates can induce unexpected surface segregation effects, leading to novel surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. The strong CO binding in the CuPt surface alloy suggests improved CO tolerance, which could be beneficial for reactions where CO poisoning is a concern.

4. The well-ordered nature of the CuPt surface alloy, with isolated Pt sites, may offer unique catalytic properties compared to pure Pt or the near-surface alloy.

These results demonstrate the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing and studying bimetallic catalysts, as the actual active surface structure may differ significantly from the initial or expected configuration.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Cu合金）中。该研究表明：

1. 在没有吸附物的情况下，Cu倾向于留在Pt-Cu合金的亚表面层，形成近表面合金（NSA）结构。

2. 然而，在高压和高温下CO吸附时，Cu意外地偏析到表面，形成一种新型的表面合金（SA）结构。

3. 这种表面偏析是由Cu存在于Pt第一表面层时CO结合能大幅增加驱动的，这种增加克服了Cu向表面扩散的吸热本质。

4. 在CO吸附下，最稳定的构型是第一层有2/3 ML的Cu，剩余的Pt位点上吸附1/3 ML的CO。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 催化剂表面的组成和结构可以在反应条件下动态变化，影响活性和选择性。

2. 吸附物的存在可以诱导意想不到的表面偏析效应，导致具有潜在增强催化性能的新型表面结构。

3. CuPt表面合金中CO的强结合表明其对CO的耐受性提高，这对于CO中毒是一个问题的反应可能有益。

4. CuPt表面合金的有序性质，具有孤立的Pt位点，可能与纯Pt或近表面合金相比提供独特的催化性能。

这些结果表明，在设计和研究双金属催化剂时考虑反应条件的重要性，因为实际的活性表面结构可能与初始或预期的构型有显著差异。
