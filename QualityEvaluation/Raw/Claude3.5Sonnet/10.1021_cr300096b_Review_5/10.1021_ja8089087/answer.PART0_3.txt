[1] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure. The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[2] "Counterintuitive to this picture, we show that CO adsorption induces surface segregation of the less reactive alloy component, Cu, switching a CuPt near-surface alloy (15) to a novel well-ordered CuPt surface alloy."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-Cu alloys, are strongly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. 

In the case of Pt-Cu alloys, the clean surface thermodynamically prefers Cu in the second layer, with Cu diffusion to the first layer being endothermic. However, the presence of adsorbates like CO can dramatically alter this preference. CO adsorption induces surface segregation of Cu, the less reactive component, contrary to typical expectations. This is due to the drastic increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first layer, which more than compensates for the endothermicity of Cu surface migration.

Specifically, with CO adsorption, the most stable configuration becomes one with 2/3 monolayer (ML) of Cu in the first layer and 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop the remaining Pt sites. This forms a novel, well-ordered CuPt surface alloy structure.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. They can alter the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The formation of isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu in the surface layer can lead to unique catalytic properties, potentially beneficial for certain reactions. 

Moreover, this phenomenon opens up possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis. By controlling the reaction environment (e.g., CO pressure and temperature), it may be possible to reversibly switch between different surface configurations, each with its own catalytic properties.

These findings are likely applicable to a range of coinage metal (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, suggesting broad implications for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如铂-铜合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的强烈影响。

对于铂-铜合金，清洁表面在热力学上倾向于将铜置于第二层，铜向第一层扩散是吸热的。然而，像CO这样的吸附物的存在可以显著改变这种偏好。CO吸附诱导铜（较不活跃的组分）的表面偏析，这与典型预期相反。这是因为当铜存在于第一层时，CO结合能大幅增加，这补偿了铜表面迁移的吸热性。

具体而言，在CO吸附的情况下，最稳定的构型变成第一层有2/3单层(ML)的铜，剩余的铂位上吸附1/3 ML的CO。这形成了一种新颖的、有序的铂铜表面合金结构。

这些由吸附物引起的表面组成和结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。它们可以改变催化剂的活性和选择性。表面层中被铜包围的孤立铂位的形成可能导致独特的催化性质，这对某些反应可能有益。

此外，这种现象为催化领域的选择性和动态合金表面工程开辟了可能性。通过控制反应环境（例如CO压力和温度），可能可以在不同的表面构型之间可逆地切换，每种构型都有其特定的催化性质。

这些发现可能适用于一系列贵金属（铜、银）/铂族双金属表面合金，这表明它们对各种应用中的催化剂设计和优化具有广泛的影响。
