[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-Cu alloys. The study shows that:

1. In the absence of adsorbates, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a Pt-Cu alloy, forming a near-surface alloy (NSA) structure.

2. However, under CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures, Cu unexpectedly segregates to the surface, forming a novel surface alloy (SA) structure.

3. This surface segregation is driven by the drastically increased CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt, which overcomes the endothermic nature of Cu diffusion to the surface.

4. The most stable configuration under CO adsorption is 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically under reaction conditions, affecting activity and selectivity.

2. The presence of adsorbates can induce unexpected surface segregation effects, leading to novel surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. The strong CO binding in the CuPt surface alloy suggests improved CO tolerance, which could be beneficial for reactions where CO poisoning is a concern.

4. The well-ordered nature of the CuPt surface alloy, with isolated Pt sites, may offer unique catalytic properties compared to pure Pt or the near-surface alloy.

These results demonstrate the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing and studying bimetallic catalysts, as the actual active surface structure may differ significantly from the initial or expected configuration.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Cu合金）中。该研究表明：

1. 在没有吸附物的情况下，Cu倾向于留在Pt-Cu合金的亚表面层，形成近表面合金（NSA）结构。

2. 然而，在高压和高温下CO吸附时，Cu意外地偏析到表面，形成一种新型的表面合金（SA）结构。

3. 这种表面偏析是由Cu存在于Pt第一表面层时CO结合能大幅增加驱动的，这种增加克服了Cu向表面扩散的吸热本质。

4. 在CO吸附下，最稳定的构型是第一层有2/3 ML的Cu，剩余的Pt位点上吸附1/3 ML的CO。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 催化剂表面的组成和结构可以在反应条件下动态变化，影响活性和选择性。

2. 吸附物的存在可以诱导意想不到的表面偏析效应，导致具有潜在增强催化性能的新型表面结构。

3. CuPt表面合金中CO的强结合表明其对CO的耐受性提高，这对于CO中毒是一个问题的反应可能有益。

4. CuPt表面合金的有序性质，具有孤立的Pt位点，可能与纯Pt或近表面合金相比提供独特的催化性能。

这些结果表明，在设计和研究双金属催化剂时考虑反应条件的重要性，因为实际的活性表面结构可能与初始或预期的构型有显著差异。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of CuPt alloys, the presence of adsorbates like CO can dramatically alter the surface composition and structure.

Under clean conditions, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, as Cu diffusion to the surface is endothermic. However, when exposed to CO at elevated pressures and temperatures, the less reactive Cu is pulled to the surface, contrary to typical expectations of adsorbate-induced segregation.

This CO-induced Cu surface segregation is driven by a significant increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer. The formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure overcomes the endothermic nature of Cu surface migration.

Temperature plays a crucial role in this process. The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant around 460 K, which coincides with the formation and breakup of the CO-induced surface alloy. This temperature dependence highlights the importance of kinetic factors in determining the final surface structure.

The structural reconfiguration of the CuPt alloy in response to CO adsorption has important implications for its catalytic properties. The formation of well-defined, isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu atoms in the surface layer can lead to altered reactivity and selectivity compared to pure Pt or the initial near-surface alloy structure.

These findings demonstrate the complex interplay between thermodynamics, kinetics, and adsorbate-surface interactions in determining the surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts. They also highlight the potential for using adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for various catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。以CuPt合金为例，CO等吸附物的存在可以显著改变表面组成和结构。

在清洁条件下，Cu倾向于停留在CuPt近表面合金的亚表面层，因为Cu向表面扩散是吸热的。然而，当在高压和高温下暴露于CO时，反应性较低的Cu被拉到表面，这与典型的吸附诱导偏析预期相反。

这种CO诱导的Cu表面偏析是由Cu存在于第一表面层时CO结合能显著增加所驱动的。稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构的形成克服了Cu表面迁移的吸热性质。

温度在这个过程中起着至关重要的作用。Cu和Pt的相互扩散在460 K左右变得显著，这与CO诱导的表面合金的形成和分解相吻合。这种温度依赖性突出了动力学因素在决定最终表面结构中的重要性。

CuPt合金对CO吸附的结构重构对其催化性能有重要影响。表面层中由Cu原子包围的孤立Pt位点的形成可能导致与纯Pt或初始近表面合金结构相比反应性和选择性的改变。

这些发现表明，热力学、动力学和吸附物-表面相互作用在决定双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构方面存在复杂的相互作用。它们也强调了利用吸附物诱导的表面变化作为选择性和动态工程合金表面的工具的潜力，以用于各种催化应用。

[2] "The earlier density functional theory (DFT) study (15) indicated increased PtCO bonding when Cu is present in the first layer, similar to what is observed for other coinage/Pt-group metal systems."

[4] "Clearly, there is a driving force toward having 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer when CO is adsorbed atop the remaining surface Pt sites. As Table 1 shows, the origin of the exothermicity is the vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of CuPt alloys, the presence of CO adsorbates at elevated pressures and temperatures causes a dramatic change in the surface structure.

Without CO, the thermodynamically preferred configuration is a near-surface alloy with Cu in the second layer. However, when CO is introduced at high pressures and temperatures, it induces surface segregation of Cu, pulling it to the top layer. This is contrary to typical observations where the more reactive component (usually Pt in this case) tends to segregate to the surface.

The driving force for this unusual segregation is the significantly increased PtCO bond strength when Cu is present in the first layer. DFT calculations show that having 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer becomes energetically favorable when CO is adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites.

This CO-induced surface restructuring has important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The formation of a stable, well-ordered surface alloy with isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu can dramatically alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity. It provides a way to tune the electronic structure of the surface and potentially enhance catalytic performance for specific reactions.

These findings suggest that reaction conditions can be used as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications, particularly those involving CO or similar adsorbates.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中。以CuPt合金为例，在高压和高温条件下CO吸附物的存在会导致表面结构发生显著变化。

在没有CO的情况下，热力学上更倾向于Cu在第二层的近表面合金构型。然而，当在高压和高温下引入CO时，它会诱导Cu的表面偏析，将其拉到顶层。这与通常观察到的更活泼的组分（在这种情况下通常是Pt）倾向于偏析到表面的情况相反。

这种不寻常偏析的驱动力是Cu存在于第一层时PtCO键强度的显著增加。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，当CO吸附在剩余的Pt位点上时，第一层有2/3单层的Cu在能量上变得更有利。

这种CO诱导的表面重构对催化性能有重要影响。形成稳定的、有序的表面合金，其中Pt位点被Cu孤立包围，可以显著改变催化剂的反应性和选择性。这提供了一种调节表面电子结构的方法，potentially增强特定反应的催化性能。

这些发现表明，反应条件可以用作选择性和动态工程合金表面的工具，为催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性，尤其是在涉及CO或类似吸附物的各种应用中。

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-Cu alloys, are strongly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. 

In the case of Pt-Cu alloys, the clean surface thermodynamically prefers Cu in the second layer, with Cu diffusion to the first layer being endothermic. However, the presence of adsorbates like CO can dramatically alter this preference. CO adsorption induces surface segregation of Cu, the less reactive component, contrary to typical expectations. This is due to the drastic increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first layer, which more than compensates for the endothermicity of Cu surface migration.

Specifically, with CO adsorption, the most stable configuration becomes one with 2/3 monolayer (ML) of Cu in the first layer and 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop the remaining Pt sites. This forms a novel, well-ordered CuPt surface alloy structure.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. They can alter the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The formation of isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu in the surface layer can lead to unique catalytic properties, potentially beneficial for certain reactions. 

Moreover, this phenomenon opens up possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis. By controlling the reaction environment (e.g., CO pressure and temperature), it may be possible to reversibly switch between different surface configurations, each with its own catalytic properties.

These findings are likely applicable to a range of coinage metal (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, suggesting broad implications for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如铂-铜合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的强烈影响。

对于铂-铜合金，清洁表面在热力学上倾向于将铜置于第二层，铜向第一层扩散是吸热的。然而，像CO这样的吸附物的存在可以显著改变这种偏好。CO吸附诱导铜（较不活跃的组分）的表面偏析，这与典型预期相反。这是因为当铜存在于第一层时，CO结合能大幅增加，这补偿了铜表面迁移的吸热性。

具体而言，在CO吸附的情况下，最稳定的构型变成第一层有2/3单层(ML)的铜，剩余的铂位上吸附1/3 ML的CO。这形成了一种新颖的、有序的铂铜表面合金结构。

这些由吸附物引起的表面组成和结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。它们可以改变催化剂的活性和选择性。表面层中被铜包围的孤立铂位的形成可能导致独特的催化性质，这对某些反应可能有益。

此外，这种现象为催化领域的选择性和动态合金表面工程开辟了可能性。通过控制反应环境（例如CO压力和温度），可能可以在不同的表面构型之间可逆地切换，每种构型都有其特定的催化性质。

这些发现可能适用于一系列贵金属（铜、银）/铂族双金属表面合金，这表明它们对各种应用中的催化剂设计和优化具有广泛的影响。
