[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys"

[2] "Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[3] "It has been widely reported that surface segregation is primarily determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[4] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

[5] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The main factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface.

2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote segregation.

4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter the segregation behavior.

5. Subsurface atomic arrangement: The structure beneath the surface layer can influence segregation.

These factors combine to determine the final surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based alloys, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its larger atomic size compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation has important implications for catalytic properties and performance. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin surfaces formed by segregation on Pt3M alloys (where M is Ni or Co) show enhanced catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt. This improved performance is attributed to modifications in the electronic structure of the surface rather than geometric effects.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, electrocatalysis, and other heterogeneous catalytic processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。影响表面偏析的主要因素包括：

1. 表面能：表面能较低的元素倾向于偏析到表面。

2. 原子尺寸：较大的原子更可能偏析到表面以缓解应力。

3. 温度：较高的温度可以促进偏析。

4. 吸附物的存在：某些吸附物可以改变偏析行为。

5. 亚表面原子排列：表面层下方的结构可以影响偏析。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂的最终表面组成和结构。在基于Pt的合金中，由于Pt相比许多3d过渡金属具有较大的原子尺寸，Pt常常偏析到表面。

由此产生的表面偏析对催化性能和性能有重要影响。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，由Pt3M合金（其中M为Ni或Co）偏析形成的Pt-皮层表面显示出比体相合金和纯Pt更高的催化活性。这种性能的提高归因于表面电子结构的修改，而非几何效应。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于优化它们在各种应用中的性能至关重要，如燃料电池、电催化和其他多相催化过程。
