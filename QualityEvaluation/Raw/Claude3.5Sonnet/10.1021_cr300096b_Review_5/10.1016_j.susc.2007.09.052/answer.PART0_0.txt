[1] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."

[2] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals"

[3] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR"

[4] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[5] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[6] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation is a key phenomenon in bimetallic catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is governed by several factors including temperature, presence of adsorbates, atomic size mismatch, surface energy differences, and subsurface atomic arrangement.

2. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. This can lead to the formation of "skin" structures where one metal preferentially occupies the surface layer.

3. The presence of adsorbates and reaction conditions can alter the surface composition and structure of the catalyst. This dynamic restructuring can significantly affect catalytic performance.

4. For Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, surface segregation can enhance catalytic activity for reactions like ORR. This is attributed to modifications in the electronic structure of the surface.

5. The stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining performance. Surface segregation and structural changes can affect long-term stability and activity.

6. By controlling the composition and preparation conditions of bimetallic catalysts, it is possible to tune their surface properties and catalytic performance. This approach has been used to develop more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to pure Pt catalysts.

These factors collectively determine the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions, which in turn governs their catalytic properties and performance in various applications such as fuel cells and chemical transformations.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的体系（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析是双金属催化剂中的一个关键现象，尤其对氧还原反应（ORR）很重要。它受到多个因素的影响，包括温度、吸附物的存在、原子尺寸不匹配、表面能差异以及亚表面原子排列。

2. 具有较大半径和较低表面能的金属原子倾向于偏析到表面。这可能导致形成"皮层"结构，其中一种金属优先占据表面层。

3. 吸附物的存在和反应条件可以改变催化剂的表面组成和结构。这种动态重构可以显著影响催化性能。

4. 对于基于Pt的双金属催化剂，表面偏析可以增强ORR等反应的催化活性。这归因于表面电子结构的修饰。

5. 催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性对于维持性能至关重要。表面偏析和结构变化可能影响长期稳定性和活性。

6. 通过控制双金属催化剂的组成和制备条件，可以调节其表面性质和催化性能。这种方法已被用于开发比纯Pt催化剂更高效和更具成本效益的替代品。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的表面结构和组成，进而决定了它们在燃料电池和化学转化等各种应用中的催化性能和表现。
