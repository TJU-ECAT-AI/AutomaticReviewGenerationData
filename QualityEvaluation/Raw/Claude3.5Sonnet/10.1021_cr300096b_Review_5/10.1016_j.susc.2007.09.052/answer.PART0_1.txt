[1] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry"

[2] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst"

[3] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[4] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[5] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement. In addition, surface segregation energies may be influenced by the heats of dissolution of the segregating component in the host matrix, which in turn have a strong structural contribution"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface segregation: In many alloys, the surface composition differs from the bulk, with one metal species enriching the surface or subsurface layers. This phenomenon is crucial for materials science and surface chemistry.

2. Catalytic activity: Surface segregation can dramatically affect catalytic performance. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures formed by Pt segregation on Pt3Co alloys show significantly higher activity than bulk alloys or pure Pt catalysts.

3. Influencing factors: Temperature and the presence of adsorbates can govern surface segregation. These factors can be important in determining the final surface structure and composition.

4. Atomic properties: Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. This relationship between atomic properties and segregation behavior influences the resulting catalyst structure.

5. Multiple determinants: Surface segregation is governed by a combination of factors, including atomic size mismatch, surface energy differences, subsurface atomic arrangement, and heats of dissolution of the segregating component in the host matrix.

These thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions ultimately determine the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties. By understanding and controlling these factors, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells or chemical synthesis processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析：在许多合金中，表面成分与体相不同，一种金属物种会富集在表面或亚表面层。这种现象对材料科学和表面化学至关重要。

2. 催化活性：表面偏析可以显著影响催化性能。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，由Pt在Pt3Co合金表面偏析形成的Pt-皮层结构显示出比体相合金或纯Pt催化剂更高的活性。

3. 影响因素：温度和吸附物的存在可以控制表面偏析。这些因素在决定最终表面结构和成分方面可能很重要。

4. 原子性质：半径较大和表面能较低的金属原子倾向于偏析到表面。这种原子性质与偏析行为之间的关系影响了最终的催化剂结构。

5. 多重决定因素：表面偏析受多种因素的共同影响，包括原子尺寸不匹配、表面能差异、亚表面原子排列以及偏析组分在主体基质中的溶解热。

这些热力学偏好和反应条件最终决定了双金属催化剂的表面结构和成分，进而影响其催化性能。通过理解和控制这些因素，研究人员可以为特定应用（如燃料电池或化学合成过程）设计更高效的催化剂。
