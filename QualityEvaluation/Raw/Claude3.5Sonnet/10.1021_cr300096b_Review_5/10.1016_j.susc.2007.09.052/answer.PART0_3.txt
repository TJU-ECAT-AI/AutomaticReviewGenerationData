[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys"

[2] "Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[3] "It has been widely reported that surface segregation is primarily determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[4] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

[5] "The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The key factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface.

2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote surface segregation.

4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter surface segregation behavior.

These factors collectively determine the surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties. For Pt-based alloys, surface segregation often leads to the formation of Pt-skin structures, which have shown enhanced catalytic performance, particularly for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The improved catalytic activity is primarily attributed to changes in the surface electronic structure rather than geometric effects.

The implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Enhanced ORR activity: Pt-skin surfaces often show higher activity than pure Pt or bulk alloy surfaces.

2. Modified electronic structure: Surface segregation alters the d-band structure of the catalyst, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.

3. Tailored catalytic properties: By controlling surface segregation, it's possible to optimize catalyst performance for specific reactions.

4. Improved stability: In some cases, surface segregation can lead to more stable catalyst structures under reaction conditions.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other energy conversion devices.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是基于铂的系统，如Pt-3d合金。影响表面偏析的关键因素包括：

1. 表面能：具有较低表面能的元素倾向于偏析到表面。

2. 原子尺寸：较大的原子更可能偏析到表面。

3. 温度：较高的温度可以促进表面偏析。

4. 吸附物的存在：某些吸附物可以改变表面偏析行为。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构，进而影响其催化性能。对于基于铂的合金，表面偏析常常导致铂皮层结构的形成，这种结构显示出增强的催化性能，特别是对氧还原反应（ORR）。改善的催化活性主要归因于表面电子结构的变化，而非几何效应。

对催化性能和表现的影响包括：

1. 增强的ORR活性：铂皮层表面通常比纯铂或体相合金表面表现出更高的活性。

2. 改变的电子结构：表面偏析改变了催化剂的d带结构，影响其与反应物和中间体的相互作用。

3. 定制的催化性能：通过控制表面偏析，可以优化催化剂性能以适应特定反应。

4. 改善的稳定性：在某些情况下，表面偏析可以在反应条件下形成更稳定的催化剂结构。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于设计更高效、更稳定的催化剂至关重要，这些催化剂可应用于燃料电池、电解槽和其他能量转换装置等多种场合。
