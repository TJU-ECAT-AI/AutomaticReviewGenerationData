[1] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."

[2] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals"

[3] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR"

[4] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[5] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[6] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation is a key phenomenon in bimetallic catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is governed by several factors including temperature, presence of adsorbates, atomic size mismatch, surface energy differences, and subsurface atomic arrangement.

2. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. This can lead to the formation of "skin" structures where one metal preferentially occupies the surface layer.

3. The presence of adsorbates and reaction conditions can alter the surface composition and structure of the catalyst. This dynamic restructuring can significantly affect catalytic performance.

4. For Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, surface segregation can enhance catalytic activity for reactions like ORR. This is attributed to modifications in the electronic structure of the surface.

5. The stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining performance. Surface segregation and structural changes can affect long-term stability and activity.

6. By controlling the composition and preparation conditions of bimetallic catalysts, it is possible to tune their surface properties and catalytic performance. This approach has been used to develop more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to pure Pt catalysts.

These factors collectively determine the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions, which in turn governs their catalytic properties and performance in various applications such as fuel cells and chemical transformations.

[1] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry"

[2] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst"

[3] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[4] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[5] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement. In addition, surface segregation energies may be influenced by the heats of dissolution of the segregating component in the host matrix, which in turn have a strong structural contribution"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface segregation: In many alloys, the surface composition differs from the bulk, with one metal species enriching the surface or subsurface layers. This phenomenon is crucial for materials science and surface chemistry.

2. Catalytic activity: Surface segregation can dramatically affect catalytic performance. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures formed by Pt segregation on Pt3Co alloys show significantly higher activity than bulk alloys or pure Pt catalysts.

3. Influencing factors: Temperature and the presence of adsorbates can govern surface segregation. These factors can be important in determining the final surface structure and composition.

4. Atomic properties: Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. This relationship between atomic properties and segregation behavior influences the resulting catalyst structure.

5. Multiple determinants: Surface segregation is governed by a combination of factors, including atomic size mismatch, surface energy differences, subsurface atomic arrangement, and heats of dissolution of the segregating component in the host matrix.

These thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions ultimately determine the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties. By understanding and controlling these factors, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells or chemical synthesis processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The main factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface.

2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote segregation.

4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter the segregation behavior.

5. Subsurface atomic arrangement: The structure beneath the surface layer can influence segregation.

These factors combine to determine the final surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based alloys, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its larger atomic size compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation has important implications for catalytic properties and performance. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin surfaces formed by segregation on Pt3M alloys (where M is Ni or Co) show enhanced catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt. This improved performance is attributed to modifications in the electronic structure of the surface rather than geometric effects.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, electrocatalysis, and other heterogeneous catalytic processes.

由此产生的表面偏析对催化性能和性能有重要影响。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，由Pt3M合金（其中M为Ni或Co）偏析形成的Pt-皮层表面显示出比体相合金和纯Pt更高的催化活性。这种性能的提高归因于表面电子结构的修改，而非几何效应。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于优化它们在各种应用中的性能至关重要，如燃料电池、电催化和其他多相催化过程。
