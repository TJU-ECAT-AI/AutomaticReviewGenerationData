Pt surface segregation in bimetallic Pt3M alloys: A density functional theory study
Abstract
A simplified 5-layer slab model is used to study Pt segregation at Pt3M(1 1 1) surfaces (M = Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Ti, V). The calculated segregation energies are generally in good agreement with the experimental results. However, for Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1), the model is unable to give the correct prediction because the experimental subsurface compositions are very different from those of the model. Pt segregation is found to be correlated with the subsurface atomic structure, the size of metal atoms and the surface energy. Interestingly, the calculations show that the displacement of M atoms at the topmost Pt3M layer can be used to predict the surface segregation trend. The local geometries for the segregation and non-segregation structures are carefully compared and the surface geometric effect on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is discussed. In particular, it is determined that the enhanced ORR activity for the Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1) alloys are not caused by geometric effects.
1. Introduction
For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry
[1]
,
[2]
. It influences many important physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, metal corrosion, etc. Particularly, it has been found that the catalytic activities of alloys can be altered dramatically through surface segregation.
As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, as a noble metal, Pt is extremely expensive. Moreover, the relatively sluggish ORR kinetics on Pt surface considerably limits its catalytic efficiency. Therefore, it is indispensable to develop new catalysts with lower cost and higher activities. For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals

. Since the catalytic properties are chiefly determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the chemical composition of the bimetallic alloys, the catalytic effect can be considerably improved when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been reported in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals

[12]

[13]

[14]
. Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR
[10]
,
[14]
. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst
[14]
.
Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys

. For some of them, the surface and subsurface structures have been unambiguously identified. However, the details of segregation are not completely understood. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. So far, surface segregation has been investigated by various theories such as thermodynamic
[32]
, tight-binding
[33]
,
[34]
, embedding atom (EAM)
[35]
,
[36]
and first-principles methods
[37]
,
[38]
. The thermodynamic method estimates the surface segregation energy by phenomenological factors such as the mixing heat of alloys and the metal surface energy. In the tight-binding method, pairwise energies are introduced to evaluate the segregation behavior. In the EAM and its modified version (MEAM), the total energy is computed based on the local electron density. The first-principles approaches are usually performed within the frame of density functional theory (DFT), using various approximations. Quantummechanical surface segregation studies of an impurity in a matrix of a host metal have been reported
[37]
. However, for Pt-based alloys where the second element is present in larger proportions, surface segregation has only been studied by MEAM
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
, by atomistic modeling
[43]
, and by linear-muffin-tin-orbitals calculations with the coherent potential approximation (CPA)
[37]
,
[44]
.
In this paper, we chose the well-investigated Pt3M(1 1 1) (M = Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Ti, V) alloy systems
[5]
,
[7]
,
[9]

[10]

[14]

[45]
. It has been reported that Pt segregates to the surface and the metal M enriches the second layer in many Pt-based bimetallic alloys. For example, a recent study with crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis showed that a highly structured compositional oscillation takes place at the first top layers for the Pt3Ni(1 1 1) structure: The first layer is composed entirely of Pt, whereas the second layer only contains 48% of Pt, the third layer is again Pt-enriched (87%)
[7]
. Our segregation model was thus built by exchanging the positions of the topmost layer M atoms and the second layer Pt atoms. Surface structures and segregation energies on the (1 1 1) surface were calculated for 15 different transition metals. It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important
[46]
and they will be discussed in a future report.
2. Computational details
The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[47]
,
[48]
,
[49]
,
[50]
,
[51]
, in which the KohnSham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms. For improving the calculation efficiency, core electrons were replaced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials
[52]
,
[53]
and the valence electrons were described by plane wave basis set. In this work, the plane wave was expanded up to a cutoff energy of 340 eV. Brillouin zone integration was made on a 11 × 11 × 11 MonkhorstPack k-point mesh for the bulk calculations and a 11 × 11 × 1 mesh for the slab calculations. The choice of the grid was based on calculations done with various grids, from 4 × 4 × 1 to 15 × 15 × 1; energy fluctuations were found when the grid is small than 10 × 10 × 1. The exchange-correlation functional was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)
[54]
. Spin polarization was taken into account in the calculations and the MethfesselPaxon method was employed to determine electron occupancies with a smearing parameter σ of 0.2 eV. The convergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent iteration and the ionic relaxation loop were set to 105 eV and 104 eV, respectively.
Ordered fcc-like structures have been widely used to model various Pt3M crystalline alloys
[55]
,
[56]
,
[57]
,
[58]
,
[59]
. Therefore, we assumed that the Pt3M alloys possess close-packed fcc structures, in which the Pt atoms occupy the face-centered positions and the M atoms are located at the corners in the unit cell, as shown in
Fig. 1
. For each Pt3M structure, the lattice constant was obtained after a bulk optimization. In this work, a 2 × 2 (1 1 1) unit cell was used for all the slab models. The supercell consists of a 5-layer slab and a 5-layer vacuum (>10 Å). In the super cell, each slab layer contains 3 Pt atoms and 1 M atom. As illustrated in
Fig. 2
, the segregation structures were reached by exchanging M atoms at the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer. Thus the topmost layer is fully covered by Pt atoms and the second layer contains 50% Pt atoms for each Pt segregation structure. The atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration, while the atoms of the bottom two layers were fixed to their bulk positions in keeping with the optimized lattice constants. In general, the surface segregation energy, Esegr, is the energy of moving an atom from the interior to the surface of a crystal. In this work, it is defined as the difference of total free energies of the slab with the Pt segregated structure and that with the bulk structure. A negative segregation energy indicates that the Pt atoms are able to segregate to the surface, while a positive segregation energy suggests no Pt segregation on the surface.

3. Results and discussion
The calculated surface segregation energies for 16 metals are listed in
Table 1
. Most Pt3M alloys are found to have negative segregation energy, indicating Pt segregation on the surface. Only five alloys, Pt3Ag, Pt3Au, Pt3Cr, Pt3Mn and Pt3Ti have positive segregation energy. The most negative Esegr is 2.08 eV for Pt3Re, while the most positive Esegr is 0.68 eV for Pt3Ti. The calculated segregation energies are generally in good agreement with experimental results. Pt segregation has been observed on the surface of PtFe
[23]
,
[60]
, PtCo
[20]
,
[21]
and PtNi
[16]
,
[17]
. Furthermore, it has been reported that the topmost layer is composed of pure Pt while the second layer is enriched in the transition metal M for Pt-rich Fe, Co and Ni alloys
[5]
. This indicates that our simplified model is a good approximation for studying the surface properties of these Pt3M systems. Pt surface segregation was also found in PtIr
[24]
, PtRh
[28]
,
[29]
,
[61]
and PtRu
[30]
,
[31]
. In particular, for PtRh, the segregation pattern has been identified as Pt enrichment at the top layer and Pt depletion at the second layer
[29]
. Our calculations fit those experimental results and further show that the segregation tendency is Esegr(Pt3Ru) > Esegr(Pt3Ir) > Esegr(Pt3Rh). For Pt3Mo, the calculated Esegr predicts a strong surface segregation of Pt. However, only slight enrichment of Pt was observed in experiments. For instance, a well-characterized Pt70Mo30 alloy gives a surface component of Pt77Mo23 after annealing
[26]
. The discrepancy can be interpreted by the formation of intermediate phases, resulting in the enrichment of Mo on the alloy surface
[62]
. For PtCu alloys, two experimental studies of a Cu3Pt (1 1 1) surface led to opposite results: Shen et al. analyzed the surface by low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and found a surface component of 20% Pt at the first layer
[63]
. Gauthier et al. examined a disordered Cu3Pt (1 1 1) sample by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and found a slight Pt segregation at the topmost layer
[19]
. Both experiments suggested that the segregation trend may not be obvious for either metal and can be reversed by other factors. Our calculation (on a different overall composition, Pt3Cu) predicts a weak Pt surface segregation (Esegr = 0.17 eV), in no contradiction with the experimental results. Furthermore, the tendency of surface segregation can vary substantially with alloy composition. In particular, the variation for the PtCu system was already shown in previous studies
[19]
. Therefore, the possible discrepancy between our calculations and the results by Shen et al. may arise from the different alloy compositions. Moreover, our calculations give very small absolute values of Esegr for Pt3Cr and Pt3Pd alloys, indicating no Pt segregation on the surfaces. These values also agree very well with experiments: the surface analyses for various PtCr alloys by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) revealed no preferred surface segregation of Pt in the alloys
[18]
,
[22]
. Several experimental studies unanimously showed that the PtPd surface is Pd enriched
[15]
,
[25]
,
[45]
. It was reported that Pt3Ti(1 1 1) surface has a pure Pt topmost layer
[5]
,
[27]
, whereas our calculation generates a big positive value (0.67 eV). The discrepancy may originate from the subsurface compositions of Pt3Ti(1 1 1): a recent experimental study showed that the subsurface layers all have bulk composition although the topmost layer is pure Pt
[5]
. Thus, the structure cannot be achieved simply an interchange of atoms between the first two layers, as done in our model. This simplification may give rise to a significant deviation from the experimental results. Even a larger model, using the measured thermodynamic bond energies and next nearest neighbor interactions
[64]
, did not predict the experimental result possibly due to a slight non-stoichiometry in the bulk. Our model is also not suitable to Pt3Mn(1 1 1), in which the Pt components for 4 four topmost layers are 100%, 75%, 100%, 75%

Our DFT calculations predict that Pt does not segregate to the PtAu surface. This is in accordance with experimental results, which show strong surface segregation of Au in various PtAu alloys
[66]
,
[67]
. We did not find any experimental studies for PtAg and PtRe segregation, however, our results are consistent with other theoretical calculations: Ag segregates to the PtAg surface according to tight-binding theory
[68]
and Monte Carlo simulation
[69]
and Pt segregates to the PtRe surface by the MEAM method
[40]
,
[42]
. We point out that Ruban et al. calculated surface segregation energies of single Pt impurities in transition-metal hosts by the linear-muffin-tin-orbitals (LMTO) method with atomic sphere approximations (ASO) and discussed the general trends of surface segregation for the impurity-host bimetallic model
[37]
. Although the model they used is very different, their data are approximately in accord with our results.
It has been widely reported that surface segregation is primarily determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface. The correlation between Esegr and both the M metallic radius
[70]
and the experimental surface energy Esurf
[71]
can be found in
Table 2
. For those metals with Esurf higher than Pt, Pt is always predicted to segregate to the surface. This demonstrates that Pt surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy. Pt surface segregation is also found for the alloys with M having comparable or lower Esurf if their covalent radii are small enough. A typical example is Ni, which has a little lower surface energy than Pt but a much smaller atomic size. Segregating Pt atom to the surface alleviates the large strain in the alloy and thus decreases the total energy. This leads to the conclusion that the atomic size is an important factor for surface segregation. In some cases, it can even determine the direction of surface segregation. For instance, Cu, which possesses a much smaller metallic radius than Pt, is still predicted to have a slight trend of Pt surface segregation, in spite of its low Esurf relative to that of Pt. Furthermore, in terms of the atomic size, Esurf and the calculated Esegr, Pt should not segregate to the Pt3Mn(1 1 1) and Pt3Ti(1 1 1) surfaces, However, experimental analyses gave opposite results
[27]
,
[65]
. As discussed above, the disagreement with our results in these cases may be ascribed to their distinct subsurface structures. We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement. In addition, surface segregation energies may be influenced by the heats of dissolution of the segregating component in the host matrix, which in turn have a strong structural contribution

In our model, the top three layers of the slabs were fully optimized. We find some correlations between the local geometries of Pt3M alloys and Pt surface segregation. At the non-segregated Pt3M surfaces, the M atoms are located either above or below the plane comprising the first layer Pt atoms. Interestingly, the displacements out of the plane can be used as a parameter to predict the surface segregation tendency. We define a positive displacement when the M atoms are above the plane and a negative displacement when the M atoms are below the plane. As shown in
Table 3
, Pt segregates to the surface for the ones with a big negative displacement (<0.01 Å), whereas no Pt segregation is found for those with a big positive displacement (>0.01 Å). Some metals, such as Cr, Cu, and Mn, have a small displacement, and thus the segregation/antisegregation tendency is not obvious. This observation generally fits the experiments very well; the agreement is even better than that of our segregation model. More importantly, the prediction does not rely on any assumed subsurface segregation structures. Considering the advantages, the surface displacement can be used to predict surface segregation. We also find that the interlayer distances are changed after surface segregation. As the same layer atoms do not exactly lie in a plane, thus we take their average position to express the interlayer distance.
Table 3
gives the corresponding distances for the top two interlayers. For the alloys with negative Esegr, the distance between the first and the second layers (d12) increases except for Cu. Moreover, it can be found that the alloy with larger segregation energy approximately corresponds to a larger displacement. This suggests that surface segregation may weaken the interaction between the two layers. In addition, the distance between the second and the third layers decreases except for Ag and Au. The shortened interlayer distance indicates that surface segregation diminishes the internal strain.

For the ORR, enhanced electrocatalytic activities of Pt-based alloys have been extensively reported
[4]

,
[10]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[72]
,
[73]
,
[74]
. Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt
[10]
,
[14]
. The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry has been argued to be able to considerably alter the catalytic efficiency. Jalan et al. and Min et al. suggested that the reduced PtPt distance leads to the enhanced ORR activities
[73]
,
[75]
. For each non-segregated alloy, the surface metal bond length varies narrowly (up to 0.12 Å).
Table 4
lists the maximum and minimum bond lengths at the topmost layer of Pt3M alloys. Our calculations show that the distance is correlated with the lattice constant. For alloys with small transition metal atoms, such as Pt3Co and Pt3Ni, the maximum bond length is even shorter than that of pure Pt. The bond contraction may influence the dissociation energy of dioxygen
[76]
. In addition, the effect may increase the d-orbital overlaps and change d-band structures as well. As shown in
Table 4
, the surface geometry for the Pt-segregated structures is found to be close to the non-segregated geometry, although the M atoms are all replaced by Pt atoms. For the well-studied Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length is only 0.002 Å after Pt segregation. Therefore, the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces; instead the electronic structures modified through surface segregation should be the main factor for such enhancement.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, Pt segregation in Pt3M(1 1 1) surfaces (M = Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Ti, V) has been carefully investigated according to a proposed slab model. The segregation energies have been calculated using DFT with plane wave basis set at the GGA level. Comparison to experimental results indicates that our segregation model is a good approximation for most alloy systems. However, for Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1), the model cannot give the correct prediction due to the discrepancy between model and experimental subsurface compositions. Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure. Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface. Such displacement can effectively predict surface segregation regardless of the subsurface segregation structures. The interlayer distance is also found to be correlated with the segregation energy. Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions. In our future work, Pt surface segregation in the presence of adsorbates such as OH and atomic oxygen will be investigated and the detailed electronic structures of Pt-skin surfaces will be analyzed.
