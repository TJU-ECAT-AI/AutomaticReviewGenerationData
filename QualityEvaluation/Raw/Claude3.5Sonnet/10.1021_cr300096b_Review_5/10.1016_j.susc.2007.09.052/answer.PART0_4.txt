[1] "Pt segregation is found to be correlated with the subsurface atomic structure, the size of metal atoms and the surface energy."

[2] "It has been widely reported that surface segregation is primarily determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[3] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

[4] "For the ORR, enhanced electrocatalytic activities of Pt-based alloys have been extensively reported"

[5] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface.

2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.

3. Subsurface atomic structure: The arrangement of atoms below the surface also plays a role in determining segregation behavior.

These factors combine to determine the overall surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based systems, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its relatively large atomic size and lower surface energy compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation and structural configuration have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Surface segregation can lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).

2. Formation of "Pt-skin" structures: In some Pt-3d alloys, a Pt-rich surface layer forms, which can exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.

3. Tunable electronic properties: The subsurface composition and structure can modify the electronic properties of the surface Pt atoms, affecting their catalytic behavior.

4. Stability under reaction conditions: The thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation can influence the long-term stability and performance of the catalyst under operating conditions.

Understanding and controlling these factors allows for the design of more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素包括：

1. 表面能：表面能较低的元素倾向于偏析到表面。

2. 原子尺寸：较大的原子更可能偏析到表面以缓解应力。

3. 亚表面原子结构：表面下方的原子排列也在决定偏析行为中起作用。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂的整体表面组成和结构。在基于Pt的系统中，由于Pt相对于许多3d过渡金属具有较大的原子尺寸和较低的表面能，因此Pt常常偏析到表面。

由此产生的表面偏析和结构构型对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 增强的催化活性：表面偏析可以导致催化性能的提高，特别是对于氧还原反应（ORR）。

2. 形成"Pt皮层"结构：在某些Pt-3d合金中，会形成富Pt的表面层，其催化活性可能优于块体合金和纯Pt。

3. 可调的电子性质：亚表面组成和结构可以改变表面Pt原子的电子性质，从而影响其催化行为。

4. 反应条件下的稳定性：表面偏析的热力学偏好可以影响催化剂在工作条件下的长期稳定性和性能。

理解和控制这些因素可以设计出更高效、更稳定的双金属催化剂，用于各种应用，包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程。
