[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "To illustrate this, we calculate the difference of the overall energetics ΔE between the surface and subsurface alloys in the presence of oxygen (0.25 ML), and the result is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen clearly that calculated ΔE becomes negative or neutral for the 3d TMs considered except Cu."

[3] "The strong interaction between O and 3d TMs not only induces the segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface, but also may result in the clustering and/or agglomeration of segregated 3d TMs atoms further in surface layer to maximize O3d TMs coordination."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[5] "For CO oxidation, we find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism. For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reductive conditions, 3d transition metals (TMs) prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt(111), as this configuration is energetically more favorable. However, in oxidizing environments, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d TMs induces segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface.

The presence of oxygen can even cause further clustering and agglomeration of segregated 3d TM atoms in the surface layer to maximize O-3d TM coordination. This structural evolution has profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. For instance, in CO oxidation, catalysts with atomically dispersed 3d TMs in the Pt surface layer show high activity through a bi-functional mechanism. However, when oxidized 3d TM islands form on the Pt surface, the activity becomes limited by oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or edges of oxidized 3d TM islands becomes crucial for catalytic performance.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under different reaction conditions and underscore the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure and composition for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications. The ability of these catalysts to adapt their structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for designing smart catalysts with tunable properties, but also presents challenges in maintaining desired configurations under operating conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对Pt基双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在真空或还原条件下，3d过渡金属（TMs）倾向于停留在Pt(111)的亚表面，因为这种构型在能量上更有利。然而，在氧化环境中，氧气与3d TMs之间的强相互作用会诱导3d TMs从亚表面偏析到表面。

氧气的存在甚至可能导致偏析的3d TM原子在表面层进一步聚集和团聚，以最大化O-3d TM配位。这种结构演变对催化性能和性能有深远的影响。例如，在CO氧化反应中，具有原子分散3d TMs的Pt表面层催化剂通过双功能机制表现出高活性。然而，当氧化的3d TM岛在Pt表面形成时，活性受到氧气去除的限制，缺陷位点或氧化3d TM岛的边缘的存在对催化性能变得至关重要。

这些发现凸显了双金属催化剂在不同反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了理解和控制表面结构和成分对优化各种应用中的催化性能的重要性。这些催化剂能够根据反应环境调整其结构，为设计具有可调性能的智能催化剂提供了机会，但同时也在操作条件下保持所需构型方面带来了挑战。
