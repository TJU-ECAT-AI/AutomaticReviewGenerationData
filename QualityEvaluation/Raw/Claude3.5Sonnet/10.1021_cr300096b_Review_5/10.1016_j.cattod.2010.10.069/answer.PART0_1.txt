[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "Despite the enhanced CO binding with Pt3d TM surface alloys, the energy gain from CO adsorption on the surface alloys over the subsurface alloys (0.20 eV) remains modest, and is not able to compensate the energy cost of 3d TMs segregation from the subsurface to the surface falling typically in the range of 0.470.75 eV."

[3] "We find that under the reductive conditions (vacuum and CO), 3d TM prefers to occupy in the subsurface layer due to its higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. While under the oxidizing conditions, the strong O3d TMs interaction would induce 3d TM segregation to the surface, migrating further in the surface layer to form oxidized 3d TM islands."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen. Kinetically, Menning and Chen reported a small activation barrier of 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of PtNi and PtCo subsurface alloys in the presence of adsorbed oxygen under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[5] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions (like CO atmosphere), 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. This configuration is energetically favorable and stable.

However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces surface segregation. The 3d metals migrate to the surface and can form oxidized islands. This process has a relatively low kinetic barrier, making it both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. In reducing environments, the subsurface configuration can help relieve CO poisoning and improve activity for certain reactions. Under oxidizing conditions, the surface segregation and potential oxidation of 3d metals can create new active sites, potentially enhancing oxygen activation but also risking deactivation if oxidation is too extensive.

The ability of these bimetallic catalysts to respond to different reaction environments offers opportunities for tuning catalytic performance. However, it also presents challenges in maintaining desired structures and activities under varying conditions. Understanding and controlling these structural evolutions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, from fuel cells to chemical synthesis.

热力学偏好和反应条件对Pt基双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在真空或还原条件下（如CO氛围），3d过渡金属由于其较高的表面能和较小的原子尺寸，倾向于留在Pt的亚表面。这种构型在能量上是有利的，且稳定。

然而，在氧化条件下，氧气与3d过渡金属之间的强相互作用会诱导表面偏析。3d金属迁移到表面，并可能形成氧化物岛。这个过程具有相对较低的动力学障碍，使其在热力学上有利且动力学上可行。

这些结构变化对催化性能有深远的影响。在还原环境中，亚表面构型可以帮助缓解CO中毒，并提高某些反应的活性。在氧化条件下，3d金属的表面偏析和潜在的氧化可以创造新的活性位点，potentially增强氧气活化，但如果氧化程度过高，也可能导致失活。

这些双金属催化剂对不同反应环境的响应能力为调节催化性能提供了机会。然而，它也在不同条件下维持所需结构和活性方面带来了挑战。理解和控制这些结构演变对于优化各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要，从燃料电池到化学合成都是如此。
