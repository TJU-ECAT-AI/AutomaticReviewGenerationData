[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "Under oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[3] "The strong interaction between O and 3d TMs not only induces the segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface, but also may result in the clustering and/or agglomeration of segregated 3d TMs atoms further in surface layer to maximize O3d TMs coordination."

[4] "At elevated temperature and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin film or three-dimensional oxide island on Pt surfaces"

[5] "We find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism. For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions, 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt, forming a Pt-skin structure. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals drives their segregation to the surface. 

As oxygen partial pressure and temperature increase, the segregated 3d transition metals may further cluster, agglomerate, or even oxidize, forming complex oxide structures on the Pt surface. These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance.

For CO oxidation, catalysts with atomically dispersed 3d transition metals in the Pt surface layer show high activity through a bi-functional mechanism. However, when 3d transition metals form oxidized islands on the Pt surface, CO oxidation activity becomes limited by oxygen removal. In this case, defect sites or the edges of oxidized 3d transition metal islands become crucial for catalytic activity.

These structural evolutions under different reaction conditions highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts and emphasize the importance of understanding and controlling catalyst structure for optimizing performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了以铂为基础的双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是铂-3d合金。在真空或还原条件下，3d过渡金属倾向于停留在铂的亚表面，形成铂皮层结构。然而，在氧化条件下，氧气和3d过渡金属之间的强相互作用驱使它们向表面偏析。

随着氧分压和温度的升高，偏析的3d过渡金属可能进一步聚集、团聚，甚至氧化，在铂表面形成复杂的氧化物结构。这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。

对于CO氧化反应，在铂表面层中原子分散的3d过渡金属催化剂通过双功能机制表现出高活性。然而，当3d过渡金属在铂表面形成氧化物岛时，CO氧化活性受到氧移除的限制。在这种情况下，缺陷位点或氧化3d过渡金属岛的边缘对催化活性变得至关重要。

这些在不同反应条件下的结构演变突出了双金属催化剂的动态特性，并强调了理解和控制催化剂结构对优化各种应用性能的重要性。
