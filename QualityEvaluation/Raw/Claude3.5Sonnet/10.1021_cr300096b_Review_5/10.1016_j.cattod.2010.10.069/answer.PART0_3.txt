[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "Despite the enhanced CO binding with Pt3d TM surface alloys, the energy gain from CO adsorption on the surface alloys over the subsurface alloys (0.20 eV) remains modest, and is not able to compensate the energy cost of 3d TMs segregation from the subsurface to the surface falling typically in the range of 0.470.75 eV."

[3] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[4] "At elevated temperature and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin film or three-dimensional oxide island on Pt surfaces"

[5] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (CO, H2), 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt, forming a Pt-skin surface structure. This is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower surface energy of Pt.

In oxidizing environments, 3d metals tend to segregate to the surface because of their strong interaction with oxygen. This segregation can overcome the energy cost of moving from subsurface to surface positions. At higher temperatures and oxygen pressures, the segregated 3d metals may further oxidize to form oxide films or islands on the Pt surface.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. The Pt-skin structure formed under reducing conditions can improve activity for certain reactions by modifying adsorbate binding strengths.

2. Under oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals creates new active sites at the surface, enabling bi-functional catalysis.

3. Formation of oxide structures at higher oxygen pressures can affect activity, selectivity and stability, sometimes leading to deactivation if oxygen binding becomes too strong.

4. The dynamic nature of these catalysts allows their structure to respond to the reaction environment, potentially enabling "smart" catalysts that adapt for optimal performance.

5. Careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst preparation methods is crucial to maintain the desired active structure and avoid deactivation.

Overall, understanding and controlling these structural evolution processes is key to designing effective Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了以铂为基础的双金属催化剂（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空或还原条件下（CO、H2），3d过渡金属倾向于停留在Pt的亚表面，形成Pt-皮层表面结构。由于Pt的表面能较低，这在热力学上是有利的。

在氧化环境中，3d金属由于与氧的强相互作用而倾向于偏析到表面。这种偏析可以克服从亚表面向表面位置移动的能量成本。在更高的温度和氧分压下，偏析的3d金属可能进一步氧化，在Pt表面形成氧化物薄膜或岛屿。

这些结构变化对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 在还原条件下形成的Pt-皮层结构可以通过改变吸附物结合强度来提高某些反应的活性。

2. 在氧化条件下，3d金属的偏析在表面创造了新的活性位点，实现了双功能催化。

3. 在较高氧分压下形成的氧化物结构可以影响活性、选择性和稳定性，如果氧结合变得过强，有时会导致失活。

4. 这些催化剂的动态性质使其结构能够响应反应环境，潜在地实现能够适应最佳性能的"智能"催化剂。

5. 仔细控制反应条件和催化剂制备方法对于维持所需的活性结构和避免失活至关重要。

总的来说，理解和控制这些结构演变过程是设计各种应用的有效Pt基双金属催化剂的关键。
