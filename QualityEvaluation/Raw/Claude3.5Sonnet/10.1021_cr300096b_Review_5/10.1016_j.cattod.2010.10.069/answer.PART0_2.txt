[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "Despite the enhanced CO binding with Pt3d TM surface alloys, the energy gain from CO adsorption on the surface alloys over the subsurface alloys (0.20 eV) remains modest, and is not able to compensate the energy cost of 3d TMs segregation from the subsurface to the surface falling typically in the range of 0.470.75 eV."

[3] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[4] "At elevated temperature and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin film or three-dimensional oxide island on Pt surfaces"

[5] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions, 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is energetically favorable due to the lower surface energy of Pt and larger atomic size compared to 3d metals.

However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d metals induces surface segregation of the 3d elements. This segregation can lead to the formation of complex oxide thin films or three-dimensional oxide islands on Pt surfaces at elevated temperatures and oxygen partial pressures.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-skin structure formed under reducing conditions can improve activity for certain reactions by modifying adsorbate binding strengths. In contrast, the oxidized structures formed under oxidizing conditions can create new active sites but may also lead to deactivation in some cases.

The ability of these bimetallic catalysts to reversibly change their surface composition and structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for tuning catalytic performance. However, it also presents challenges in maintaining long-term stability and activity under varying reaction conditions. Understanding and controlling these structural evolutions is crucial for optimizing the catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic systems for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。在真空或还原条件下，3d过渡金属倾向于停留在Pt的亚表面，形成Pt皮层结构。由于Pt的表面能较低且原子尺寸较大，这种结构在能量上更有利。

然而，在氧化条件下，氧气与3d金属之间的强相互作用会诱导3d元素的表面偏析。在高温和高氧分压下，这种偏析可能导致在Pt表面形成复杂的氧化物薄膜或三维氧化物岛。

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有深远的影响。在还原条件下形成的Pt皮层结构可以通过修改吸附物结合强度来提高某些反应的活性。相比之下，在氧化条件下形成的氧化结构可以创造新的活性位点，但在某些情况下也可能导致失活。

这些双金属催化剂能够根据反应环境可逆地改变其表面组成和结构，为调节催化性能提供了机会。然而，这也给在不同反应条件下保持长期稳定性和活性带来了挑战。理解和控制这些结构演变对于优化基于Pt的双金属系统在各种应用中的催化性能至关重要。
