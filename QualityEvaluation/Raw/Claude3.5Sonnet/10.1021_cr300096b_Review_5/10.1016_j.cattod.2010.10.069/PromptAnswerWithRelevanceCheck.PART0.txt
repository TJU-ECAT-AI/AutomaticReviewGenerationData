[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "To illustrate this, we calculate the difference of the overall energetics ΔE between the surface and subsurface alloys in the presence of oxygen (0.25 ML), and the result is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen clearly that calculated ΔE becomes negative or neutral for the 3d TMs considered except Cu."

[3] "The strong interaction between O and 3d TMs not only induces the segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface, but also may result in the clustering and/or agglomeration of segregated 3d TMs atoms further in surface layer to maximize O3d TMs coordination."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[5] "For CO oxidation, we find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism. For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reductive conditions, 3d transition metals (TMs) prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt(111), as this configuration is energetically more favorable. However, in oxidizing environments, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d TMs induces segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface.

The presence of oxygen can even cause further clustering and agglomeration of segregated 3d TM atoms in the surface layer to maximize O-3d TM coordination. This structural evolution has profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. For instance, in CO oxidation, catalysts with atomically dispersed 3d TMs in the Pt surface layer show high activity through a bi-functional mechanism. However, when oxidized 3d TM islands form on the Pt surface, the activity becomes limited by oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or edges of oxidized 3d TM islands becomes crucial for catalytic performance.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under different reaction conditions and underscore the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure and composition for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications. The ability of these catalysts to adapt their structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for designing smart catalysts with tunable properties, but also presents challenges in maintaining desired configurations under operating conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对Pt基双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在真空或还原条件下，3d过渡金属（TMs）倾向于停留在Pt(111)的亚表面，因为这种构型在能量上更有利。然而，在氧化环境中，氧气与3d TMs之间的强相互作用会诱导3d TMs从亚表面偏析到表面。

氧气的存在甚至可能导致偏析的3d TM原子在表面层进一步聚集和团聚，以最大化O-3d TM配位。这种结构演变对催化性能和性能有深远的影响。例如，在CO氧化反应中，具有原子分散3d TMs的Pt表面层催化剂通过双功能机制表现出高活性。然而，当氧化的3d TM岛在Pt表面形成时，活性受到氧气去除的限制，缺陷位点或氧化3d TM岛的边缘的存在对催化性能变得至关重要。

这些发现凸显了双金属催化剂在不同反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了理解和控制表面结构和成分对优化各种应用中的催化性能的重要性。这些催化剂能够根据反应环境调整其结构，为设计具有可调性能的智能催化剂提供了机会，但同时也在操作条件下保持所需构型方面带来了挑战。

[2] "Despite the enhanced CO binding with Pt3d TM surface alloys, the energy gain from CO adsorption on the surface alloys over the subsurface alloys (0.20 eV) remains modest, and is not able to compensate the energy cost of 3d TMs segregation from the subsurface to the surface falling typically in the range of 0.470.75 eV."

[3] "We find that under the reductive conditions (vacuum and CO), 3d TM prefers to occupy in the subsurface layer due to its higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. While under the oxidizing conditions, the strong O3d TMs interaction would induce 3d TM segregation to the surface, migrating further in the surface layer to form oxidized 3d TM islands."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen. Kinetically, Menning and Chen reported a small activation barrier of 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of PtNi and PtCo subsurface alloys in the presence of adsorbed oxygen under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions"

[5] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions (like CO atmosphere), 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. This configuration is energetically favorable and stable.

However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces surface segregation. The 3d metals migrate to the surface and can form oxidized islands. This process has a relatively low kinetic barrier, making it both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. In reducing environments, the subsurface configuration can help relieve CO poisoning and improve activity for certain reactions. Under oxidizing conditions, the surface segregation and potential oxidation of 3d metals can create new active sites, potentially enhancing oxygen activation but also risking deactivation if oxidation is too extensive.

The ability of these bimetallic catalysts to respond to different reaction environments offers opportunities for tuning catalytic performance. However, it also presents challenges in maintaining desired structures and activities under varying conditions. Understanding and controlling these structural evolutions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, from fuel cells to chemical synthesis.

热力学偏好和反应条件对Pt基双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在真空或还原条件下（如CO氛围），3d过渡金属由于其较高的表面能和较小的原子尺寸，倾向于留在Pt的亚表面。这种构型在能量上是有利的，且稳定。

然而，在氧化条件下，氧气与3d过渡金属之间的强相互作用会诱导表面偏析。3d金属迁移到表面，并可能形成氧化物岛。这个过程具有相对较低的动力学障碍，使其在热力学上有利且动力学上可行。

这些结构变化对催化性能有深远的影响。在还原环境中，亚表面构型可以帮助缓解CO中毒，并提高某些反应的活性。在氧化条件下，3d金属的表面偏析和潜在的氧化可以创造新的活性位点，potentially增强氧气活化，但如果氧化程度过高，也可能导致失活。

这些双金属催化剂对不同反应环境的响应能力为调节催化性能提供了机会。然而，它也在不同条件下维持所需结构和活性方面带来了挑战。理解和控制这些结构演变对于优化各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要，从燃料电池到化学合成都是如此。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions, 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is energetically favorable due to the lower surface energy of Pt and larger atomic size compared to 3d metals.

However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d metals induces surface segregation of the 3d elements. This segregation can lead to the formation of complex oxide thin films or three-dimensional oxide islands on Pt surfaces at elevated temperatures and oxygen partial pressures.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-skin structure formed under reducing conditions can improve activity for certain reactions by modifying adsorbate binding strengths. In contrast, the oxidized structures formed under oxidizing conditions can create new active sites but may also lead to deactivation in some cases.

The ability of these bimetallic catalysts to reversibly change their surface composition and structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for tuning catalytic performance. However, it also presents challenges in maintaining long-term stability and activity under varying reaction conditions. Understanding and controlling these structural evolutions is crucial for optimizing the catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic systems for various applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (CO, H2), 3d transition metals prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt, forming a Pt-skin surface structure. This is thermodynamically favorable due to the lower surface energy of Pt.

In oxidizing environments, 3d metals tend to segregate to the surface because of their strong interaction with oxygen. This segregation can overcome the energy cost of moving from subsurface to surface positions. At higher temperatures and oxygen pressures, the segregated 3d metals may further oxidize to form oxide films or islands on the Pt surface.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. The Pt-skin structure formed under reducing conditions can improve activity for certain reactions by modifying adsorbate binding strengths.

2. Under oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals creates new active sites at the surface, enabling bi-functional catalysis.

3. Formation of oxide structures at higher oxygen pressures can affect activity, selectivity and stability, sometimes leading to deactivation if oxygen binding becomes too strong.

4. The dynamic nature of these catalysts allows their structure to respond to the reaction environment, potentially enabling "smart" catalysts that adapt for optimal performance.

5. Careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst preparation methods is crucial to maintain the desired active structure and avoid deactivation.

Overall, understanding and controlling these structural evolution processes is key to designing effective Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

这些结构变化对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 在还原条件下形成的Pt-皮层结构可以通过改变吸附物结合强度来提高某些反应的活性。

2. 在氧化条件下，3d金属的偏析在表面创造了新的活性位点，实现了双功能催化。

3. 在较高氧分压下形成的氧化物结构可以影响活性、选择性和稳定性，如果氧结合变得过强，有时会导致失活。

4. 这些催化剂的动态性质使其结构能够响应反应环境，潜在地实现能够适应最佳性能的"智能"催化剂。

5. 仔细控制反应条件和催化剂制备方法对于维持所需的活性结构和避免失活至关重要。

总的来说，理解和控制这些结构演变过程是设计各种应用的有效Pt基双金属催化剂的关键。
