The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The document appears to be a table of contents or outline for a scientific paper on modeling surface segregation in Pt3Ti crystal, but it does not provide specific details or findings that address the question asked. Without access to the full text of the paper, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer based solely on the information given.

所给的文献并不包含直接相关的信息来回答关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金的热力学偏好、反应条件、稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的问题。这份文件似乎是一篇关于模拟Pt3Ti晶体表面偏析的科学论文的目录或大纲，但它没有提供能回答所问问题的具体细节或发现。没有访问论文全文的情况下，仅凭所给信息无法提供准确的回答。
