The provided literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The document appears to be focused on modeling surface segregation phenomena in the (111) surface of ordered Pt3Ti crystal, but does not provide specific details that address the broader question about various Pt-based systems and their catalytic properties in different applications.

所提供的文献中没有直接相关的信息来回答关于双金属催化剂的热力学偏好、反应条件、稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的问题,特别是在基于Pt的系统(如Pt-3d合金)中。该文档似乎主要关注有序Pt3Ti晶体(111)表面的表面偏析现象建模,但没有提供具体细节来解答有关各种基于Pt系统及其在不同应用中的催化性能的更广泛问题。
