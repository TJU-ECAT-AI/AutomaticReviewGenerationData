[1] "Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen."

[2] "Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one."

[3] "The segregation energy under adsorbate environment, E^ads_segr, can be expressed as E^ads_segr = E^vac_segr + (E^ads_segr - E^ads_nonsegr)"

[4] "For the Pt-segregated structures, the vacuum segregation energy is unable to compensate the loss of the surface adsorption energy due to Pt-segregation; whereas for the M-segregated structures, the extra adsorption energy gained from M-segregation cannot counterbalance the strong anti-segregation energy."

[5] "The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of adsorbates, like oxygen, can substantially modify segregation trends on the surface. 

In the case of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys, under 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface. This is contrary to the vacuum condition where Pt tends to segregate to the surface.

The segregation energy under adsorbate environment can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. For Pt-segregated structures, the vacuum segregation energy cannot offset the loss in surface adsorption energy. For M-segregated structures, the additional adsorption energy gained cannot overcome the strong anti-segregation energy.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of the catalyst can change under reaction conditions, potentially altering its catalytic activity. However, the influence on catalytic activity, particularly for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), is complex due to various factors including adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, as the actual working state of the catalyst may differ significantly from its as-prepared state. This knowledge can guide the development of catalysts with optimized surface compositions for specific reaction environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。吸附质（如氧气）的存在可以实质性地改变表面的偏析趋势。

对于Pt3M（M = Fe, Co, Ni）合金，在1/4单层氧覆盖度下，Pt偏析和M偏析表面都变得不如非偏析表面稳定。这与真空条件下Pt倾向于偏析到表面的情况相反。

吸附质环境下的偏析能可以表示为真空条件下的偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构之间吸附能差的总和。对于Pt偏析结构，真空偏析能无法抵消表面吸附能的损失。对于M偏析结构，获得的额外吸附能无法克服强烈的反偏析能。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响。催化剂的表面组成和结构可能在反应条件下发生变化，从而可能改变其催化活性。然而，对催化活性的影响，特别是对氧还原反应（ORR）的影响，由于吸附质浓度、偏析动力学、金属原子溶解和反应机理等多种因素而变得复杂。

理解这些动态对设计更高效和稳定的催化剂至关重要，因为催化剂的实际工作状态可能与其制备状态有显著差异。这些知识可以指导开发针对特定反应环境优化表面组成的催化剂。
