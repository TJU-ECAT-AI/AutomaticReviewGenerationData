Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface of Pt3M alloys due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals. However, the presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can dramatically alter this segregation trend.

Under oxygen adsorption conditions, the stability of different surface configurations changes. At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface for Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys. This is because the adsorption energy difference between segregated and non-segregated structures often outweighs the vacuum segregation energy.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the vacuum segregation energy and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why certain surface compositions become more or less favorable under different environmental conditions.

These changes in surface composition and structure directly affect the catalytic properties of the alloys. The catalytic activity is primarily determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which are modified by the surface composition. Therefore, understanding how reaction conditions influence surface segregation is crucial for optimizing the performance of these bimetallic catalysts in applications such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.

The influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms. By manipulating reaction conditions, it may be possible to control surface composition and thus tailor the catalytic properties of Pt-based alloys for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这对它们在各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。

在真空条件下，由于Pt比3d金属具有更大的原子半径和更低的表面能，Pt倾向于在Pt3M合金表面发生偏析。然而，吸附质（如氧气）的存在可以显著改变这种偏析趋势。

在氧气吸附条件下，不同表面构型的稳定性发生变化。在1/4单层氧覆盖度下，对于Pt3M（M = Fe, Co, Ni）合金，Pt偏析和M偏析表面都变得不如非偏析表面稳定。这是因为偏析和非偏析结构之间的吸附能差异通常超过了真空偏析能。

吸附条件下的偏析能可以表示为真空偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构吸附能差之和。这种关系有助于解释为什么某些表面组成在不同环境条件下变得更有利或不利。

这些表面组成和结构的变化直接影响合金的催化性能。催化活性主要由表面几何和电子结构决定，而这些又受表面组成的影响。因此，理解反应条件如何影响表面偏析对于优化这些双金属催化剂在燃料电池氧还原反应（ORR）等应用中的性能至关重要。

表面偏析对催化活性的影响是复杂的，涉及吸附质浓度、偏析动力学、金属原子溶解和反应机理等因素。通过操控反应条件，可能可以控制表面组成，从而为特定应用定制基于Pt的合金的催化性能。
