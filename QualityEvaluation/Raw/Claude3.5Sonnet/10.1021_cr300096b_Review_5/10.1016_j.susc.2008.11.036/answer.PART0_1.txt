Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface of Pt3M alloys due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals. However, the presence of adsorbates like oxygen can dramatically alter this segregation trend. 

At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, neither Pt-segregation nor M-segregation is thermodynamically favored on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt3M alloys. This is because the oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces, while the strong anti-segregation energy of Pt counteracts the enhanced adsorption energy gained from M-segregation.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why non-segregated structures remain the most thermodynamically stable under certain adsorption conditions.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts can change depending on the reaction environment, affecting their catalytic activity. For instance, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), the presence of oxygen can modify the surface structure of Pt-based catalysts, potentially altering their effectiveness. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the catalyst's performance under operating conditions may differ significantly from its behavior in vacuum or inert environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。

在真空条件下，由于Pt相比3d金属具有更大的原子半径和更低的表面能，Pt倾向于在Pt3M合金的表面偏析。然而，吸附物（如氧）的存在可以显著改变这种偏析趋势。

在1/4单层氧覆盖率下，Pt3M合金的(1 1 1)表面既不倾向于Pt偏析，也不倾向于M偏析。这是因为氧吸附降低了Pt偏析表面的稳定性，而Pt强烈的反偏析能又抵消了M偏析带来的增强吸附能。

吸附条件下的偏析能可以表示为真空条件下的偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构之间吸附能差的总和。这种关系有助于解释为什么在某些吸附条件下，非偏析结构仍然是热力学上最稳定的。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响。双金属催化剂的表面成分和结构可能会根据反应环境而改变，从而影响其催化活性。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，氧的存在可以改变基于Pt的催化剂的表面结构，潜在地改变其有效性。理解这些动态对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要，因为催化剂在操作条件下的性能可能与其在真空或惰性环境中的行为有显著不同。
