          [1] "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry"

[2] "Pt-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals"

[3] "As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance."

[4] "Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface."

[5] "However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures."

[6] "Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys."

[7] "The segregation trend is consequently reversed, leading to an M-segregated surface."

[8] "Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one."

[9] "The segregation energy under adsorbate environment, E^ads_segr, can be expressed as E^ads_segr = E^vac_segr + (E^ads_segr - E^ads_nonsegr)"

[10] "The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is primarily determined by surface energy and atomic size. Atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. In Pt-3d alloys, this typically results in Pt segregation to the surface due to its larger atomic radius compared to 3d metals.

However, the presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can dramatically alter the surface composition and segregation trends. Oxygen adsorption can decrease the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces and even reverse the segregation trend in Pt3M alloys. At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface for Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the vacuum segregation energy and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why certain surface compositions become more or less favorable under different environmental conditions.

These changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are critical for catalytic activity, are directly influenced by the surface composition. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-based alloys with 3d metals have shown enhanced catalytic activities compared to pure Pt, with surface segregation playing a crucial role in this improvement.

The influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms. Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena under different reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where Pt-based alloys are widely used as cathode catalysts for ORR.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对它们在各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。

在真空条件下，表面偏析主要由表面能和原子尺寸决定。半径较大和表面能较低的原子倾向于偏析到表面。在Pt-3d合金中，由于Pt的原子半径较大，通常会导致Pt偏析到表面。

然而，吸附质（如氧气）的存在可以显著改变表面组成和偏析趋势。氧气吸附可以降低Pt偏析表面的稳定性，甚至在Pt3M合金中逆转偏析趋势。在1/4单层氧覆盖度下，对于Pt3M（M = Fe, Co, Ni）合金，Pt偏析和M偏析表面都变得不如非偏析表面稳定。

吸附条件下的偏析能可以表示为真空偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构之间吸附能差的总和。这种关系有助于解释为什么某些表面组成在不同环境条件下变得更有利或不利。

这些表面组成和结构的变化对催化性能有重要影响。表面几何和电子结构，这对催化活性至关重要，直接受到表面组成的影响。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，与纯Pt相比，含3d金属的Pt基合金表现出增强的催化活性，表面偏析在这种性能提升中起着关键作用。

表面偏析对催化活性的影响是复杂的，涉及吸附质浓度、偏析动力学、金属原子溶解和反应机理等因素。理解和控制这些在不同反应条件下的偏析现象对于优化双金属系统在各种应用中的催化性能至关重要，特别是在燃料电池技术中，Pt基合金被广泛用作ORR的阴极催化剂。
