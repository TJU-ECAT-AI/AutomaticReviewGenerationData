Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals. However, the presence of adsorbates like oxygen can dramatically alter this segregation trend.

The stability of different surface configurations (non-segregated, Pt-segregated, or M-segregated) depends on the interplay between segregation energy under vacuum and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. For Pt3M alloys (M = Fe, Co, Ni) under 1/4 ML oxygen coverage, the non-segregated structure is generally found to be the most stable, as neither Pt nor M segregation is thermodynamically favored.

These changes in surface structure and composition have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are primarily determined by the surface composition, directly affect the catalyst's activity. For instance, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), the formation of a Pt-skin layer can significantly enhance catalytic activity. However, the presence of adsorbates during real operating conditions can modify this ideal structure.

Understanding these complex interactions between surface segregation, adsorbate effects, and catalytic performance is crucial for designing more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。在真空条件下，由于Pt相比3d金属具有更大的原子半径和更低的表面能，Pt倾向于偏析到表面。然而，像氧这样的吸附物的存在可以显著改变这种偏析趋势。

不同表面构型（非偏析、Pt偏析或M偏析）的稳定性取决于真空条件下的偏析能和偏析与非偏析结构之间吸附能差的相互作用。对于Pt3M合金（M = Fe、Co、Ni），在1/4单层氧覆盖下，非偏析结构通常被发现是最稳定的，因为Pt和M的偏析都不是热力学上有利的。

这些表面结构和成分的变化对催化性能有重要影响。表面几何和电子结构主要由表面成分决定，直接影响催化剂的活性。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，Pt皮层的形成可以显著提高催化活性。然而，在实际操作条件下吸附物的存在可能会修改这种理想结构。

理解表面偏析、吸附物效应和催化性能之间的复杂相互作用对于设计更高效、更稳定的双金属催化剂至关重要，这些催化剂可应用于燃料电池和其他电化学系统等多个领域。
