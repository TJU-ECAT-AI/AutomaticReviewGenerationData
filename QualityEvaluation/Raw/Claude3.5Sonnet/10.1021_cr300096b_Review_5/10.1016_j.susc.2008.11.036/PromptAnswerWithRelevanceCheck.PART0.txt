[1] "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry"

[2] "Pt-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals"

[3] "As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance."

[4] "Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface."

[5] "However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures."

[6] "Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys."

[7] "The segregation trend is consequently reversed, leading to an M-segregated surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is primarily determined by surface energy and atomic size. Atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. In Pt-3d alloys, this typically results in Pt segregation to the surface due to its larger atomic radius compared to 3d metals.

However, the presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can dramatically alter the surface composition and segregation trends. Oxygen adsorption can decrease the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces and even reverse the segregation trend in Pt3M alloys. This is because 3d metals generally have a higher affinity for oxygen than Pt, leading to stronger adsorption on 3d-metal-enriched surfaces.

The interplay between vacuum segregation tendencies and adsorbate-induced effects determines the final surface configuration. At lower adsorbate coverages, the vacuum segregation tendency may still dominate, while at higher coverages, the adsorbate-induced effects can become more prominent, potentially leading to M-segregated surfaces.

These changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are critical for catalytic activity, are directly influenced by the surface composition. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-based alloys with 3d metals have shown enhanced catalytic activities compared to pure Pt, with surface segregation playing a crucial role in this improvement.

Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena under different reaction conditions is therefore crucial for optimizing the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where Pt-based alloys are widely used as cathode catalysts for ORR.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对它们在各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。

在真空条件下，表面偏析主要由表面能和原子尺寸决定。半径较大和表面能较低的原子倾向于偏析到表面。在Pt-3d合金中，由于Pt的原子半径较大，通常会导致Pt偏析到表面。

然而，吸附质（如氧气）的存在可以显著改变表面组成和偏析趋势。氧气吸附可以降低Pt偏析表面的稳定性，甚至在Pt3M合金中逆转偏析趋势。这是因为3d金属通常比Pt对氧气有更高的亲和力，导致在3d金属富集的表面上有更强的吸附。

真空偏析趋势和吸附质诱导效应之间的相互作用决定了最终的表面构型。在较低的吸附质覆盖度下，真空偏析趋势可能仍然占主导地位，而在较高的覆盖度下，吸附质诱导效应可能变得更加显著，可能导致M偏析表面。

这些表面组成和结构的变化对催化性能有重要影响。表面几何和电子结构，这对催化活性至关重要，直接受到表面组成的影响。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，与纯Pt相比，含3d金属的Pt基合金表现出增强的催化活性，表面偏析在这种性能提升中起着关键作用。

因此，理解和控制这些在不同反应条件下的偏析现象对于优化双金属系统在各种应用中的催化性能至关重要，特别是在燃料电池技术中，Pt基合金被广泛用作ORR的阴极催化剂。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface of Pt3M alloys due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals. However, the presence of adsorbates like oxygen can dramatically alter this segregation trend. 

At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, neither Pt-segregation nor M-segregation is thermodynamically favored on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt3M alloys. This is because the oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces, while the strong anti-segregation energy of Pt counteracts the enhanced adsorption energy gained from M-segregation.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why non-segregated structures remain the most thermodynamically stable under certain adsorption conditions.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts can change depending on the reaction environment, affecting their catalytic activity. For instance, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), the presence of oxygen can modify the surface structure of Pt-based catalysts, potentially altering their effectiveness. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the catalyst's performance under operating conditions may differ significantly from its behavior in vacuum or inert environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。

在真空条件下，由于Pt相比3d金属具有更大的原子半径和更低的表面能，Pt倾向于在Pt3M合金的表面偏析。然而，吸附物（如氧）的存在可以显著改变这种偏析趋势。

在1/4单层氧覆盖率下，Pt3M合金的(1 1 1)表面既不倾向于Pt偏析，也不倾向于M偏析。这是因为氧吸附降低了Pt偏析表面的稳定性，而Pt强烈的反偏析能又抵消了M偏析带来的增强吸附能。

吸附条件下的偏析能可以表示为真空条件下的偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构之间吸附能差的总和。这种关系有助于解释为什么在某些吸附条件下，非偏析结构仍然是热力学上最稳定的。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响。双金属催化剂的表面成分和结构可能会根据反应环境而改变，从而影响其催化活性。例如，在氧还原反应（ORR）中，氧的存在可以改变基于Pt的催化剂的表面结构，潜在地改变其有效性。理解这些动态对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要，因为催化剂在操作条件下的性能可能与其在真空或惰性环境中的行为有显著不同。

[1] "Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen."

[2] "Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one."

[3] "The segregation energy under adsorbate environment, E^ads_segr, can be expressed as E^ads_segr = E^vac_segr + (E^ads_segr - E^ads_nonsegr)"

[4] "For the Pt-segregated structures, the vacuum segregation energy is unable to compensate the loss of the surface adsorption energy due to Pt-segregation; whereas for the M-segregated structures, the extra adsorption energy gained from M-segregation cannot counterbalance the strong anti-segregation energy."

[5] "The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of adsorbates, like oxygen, can substantially modify segregation trends on the surface. 

In the case of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys, under 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface. This is contrary to the vacuum condition where Pt tends to segregate to the surface.

The segregation energy under adsorbate environment can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. For Pt-segregated structures, the vacuum segregation energy cannot offset the loss in surface adsorption energy. For M-segregated structures, the additional adsorption energy gained cannot overcome the strong anti-segregation energy.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of the catalyst can change under reaction conditions, potentially altering its catalytic activity. However, the influence on catalytic activity, particularly for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), is complex due to various factors including adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, as the actual working state of the catalyst may differ significantly from its as-prepared state. This knowledge can guide the development of catalysts with optimized surface compositions for specific reaction environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。吸附质（如氧气）的存在可以实质性地改变表面的偏析趋势。

对于Pt3M（M = Fe, Co, Ni）合金，在1/4单层氧覆盖度下，Pt偏析和M偏析表面都变得不如非偏析表面稳定。这与真空条件下Pt倾向于偏析到表面的情况相反。

吸附质环境下的偏析能可以表示为真空条件下的偏析能与偏析和非偏析结构之间吸附能差的总和。对于Pt偏析结构，真空偏析能无法抵消表面吸附能的损失。对于M偏析结构，获得的额外吸附能无法克服强烈的反偏析能。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响。催化剂的表面组成和结构可能在反应条件下发生变化，从而可能改变其催化活性。然而，对催化活性的影响，特别是对氧还原反应（ORR）的影响，由于吸附质浓度、偏析动力学、金属原子溶解和反应机理等多种因素而变得复杂。

理解这些动态对设计更高效和稳定的催化剂至关重要，因为催化剂的实际工作状态可能与其制备状态有显著差异。这些知识可以指导开发针对特定反应环境优化表面组成的催化剂。

Under vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals. However, the presence of adsorbates like oxygen can dramatically alter this segregation trend.

The stability of different surface configurations (non-segregated, Pt-segregated, or M-segregated) depends on the interplay between segregation energy under vacuum and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. For Pt3M alloys (M = Fe, Co, Ni) under 1/4 ML oxygen coverage, the non-segregated structure is generally found to be the most stable, as neither Pt nor M segregation is thermodynamically favored.

These changes in surface structure and composition have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are primarily determined by the surface composition, directly affect the catalyst's activity. For instance, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), the formation of a Pt-skin layer can significantly enhance catalytic activity. However, the presence of adsorbates during real operating conditions can modify this ideal structure.

Understanding these complex interactions between surface segregation, adsorbate effects, and catalytic performance is crucial for designing more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

Therefore, understanding how reaction conditions influence surface segregation is crucial for optimizing the performance of these bimetallic catalysts in applications such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.

The influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms. By manipulating reaction conditions, it may be possible to control surface composition and thus tailor the catalytic properties of Pt-based alloys for specific applications.
