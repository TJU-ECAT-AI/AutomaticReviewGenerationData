Unfortunately, this document does not contain information specifically addressing the stability, surface segregation, structural configuration, or catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-3d alloys. The literature appears to be focused on other topics related to catalysis and does not provide details relevant to answering this particular question about Pt-based systems and their thermodynamic preferences under different reaction conditions.

很遗憾,这篇文献并未包含专门讨论铂基双金属催化剂(如Pt-3d合金)的稳定性、表面偏析、结构构型或催化性能的信息。这篇文献似乎侧重于与催化相关的其他主题,并未提供回答这个关于铂基系统及其在不同反应条件下的热力学偏好的具体问题所需的详细信息。
