[1] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."

[2] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."

[3] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

The study provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences influence surface segregation and structural configuration in PtPd bimetallic catalysts:

1. In extended surfaces, Pd atoms tend to segregate to the outermost layers, while Pt concentration increases from the surface into the bulk.

2. For nanoparticles, the equilibrium structure shows Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores.

3. Within the nanoparticle shell, Pd atoms preferentially segregate to (100) facets over (111) facets.

These findings have implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The Pd-rich surface could alter the catalytic behavior compared to pure Pt surfaces.

2. The core-shell structure with a Pd-rich exterior may influence reactivity and selectivity.

3. Preferential segregation to specific facets could affect shape-dependent catalytic properties.

However, the study does not directly address catalytic performance or applications. More research would be needed to fully understand how these structural characteristics impact specific catalytic reactions and applications.

该研究提供了热力学偏好如何影响PtPd双金属催化剂的表面偏析和结构配置的见解：

1. 在扩展表面上，Pd原子倾向于偏析到最外层，而Pt浓度从表面向体相增加。

2. 对于纳米颗粒，平衡结构显示Pd富集的外壳和Pt富集的核心。

3. 在纳米颗粒外壳内，Pd原子优先偏析到(100)面而不是(111)面。

这些发现对催化性能和性能有影响：

1. Pd富集的表面可能会改变催化行为，与纯Pt表面相比。

2. 具有Pd富集外部的核-壳结构可能影响反应性和选择性。

3. 对特定晶面的优先偏析可能影响形状依赖的催化性能。

然而，该研究并未直接讨论催化性能或应用。需要进行更多研究以充分了解这些结构特征如何影响特定的催化反应和应用。
