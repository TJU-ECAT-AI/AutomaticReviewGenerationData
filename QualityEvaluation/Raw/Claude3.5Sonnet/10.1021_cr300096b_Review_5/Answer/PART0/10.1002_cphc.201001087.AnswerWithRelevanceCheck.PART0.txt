          [1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[4] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

[5] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

[6] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Surface energy differences: Metals with lower surface energies (like Pt and Pd) tend to segregate to the surface when alloyed with higher surface energy metals (like Ru).

2. Atomic size mismatch: Larger guest atoms (Pt, Pd) in a host lattice of smaller atoms (Ru) experience tensile stress, favoring their segregation to the surface.

3. Segregation energies: DFT calculations show significant segregation energies for Pt (0.8 eV) and Pd (1.0 eV) in Ru(0001), providing a strong driving force for surface segregation.

4. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote surface segregation but may also lead to bulk dissolution due to entropic effects.

These factors result in the formation of stable surface alloy configurations that are metastable only towards bulk dissolution. The implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Enhanced stability: The thermodynamic preference for surface segregation helps maintain the desired surface composition during catalytic reactions.

2. Tunable surface properties: By controlling composition and preparation conditions, the surface structure and composition can be tailored for specific catalytic applications.

3. Synergistic effects: The combination of different metals in the surface layer can lead to unique electronic and geometric properties, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Long-term performance: Understanding and controlling segregation behavior can help design catalysts with improved long-term stability and activity.

These insights provide a foundation for rational catalyst design and optimization for various applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical reactions, and heterogeneous catalysis.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。关键因素包括：

1. 表面能差异：表面能较低的金属（如Pt和Pd）倾向于在与表面能较高的金属（如Ru）合金时偏析到表面。

2. 原子尺寸不匹配：在较小原子（Ru）的主体晶格中，较大的客体原子（Pt、Pd）会经历拉伸应力，有利于它们偏析到表面。

3. 偏析能：DFT计算显示Pt（0.8 eV）和Pd（1.0 eV）在Ru(0001)中具有显著的偏析能，为表面偏析提供了强大的驱动力。

4. 温度：较高的温度可以促进表面偏析，但也可能由于熵效应导致体相溶解。

这些因素导致形成稳定的表面合金构型，仅对体相溶解呈亚稳态。对催化性能和性能的影响包括：

1. 增强稳定性：表面偏析的热力学偏好有助于在催化反应过程中维持所需的表面组成。

2. 可调表面性能：通过控制组成和制备条件，可以针对特定催化应用调整表面结构和组成。

3. 协同效应：表面层中不同金属的组合可能导致独特的电子和几何性质，潜在地增强催化性能。

4. 长期性能：理解和控制偏析行为可以帮助设计具有改进的长期稳定性和活性的催化剂。

这些见解为各种应用（如燃料电池、电化学反应和多相催化）的理性催化剂设计和优化提供了基础。
