          [1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

[5] "Annealing to higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K) allows for diffusion deeper into the bulk or accelerates it to a measurable value. This is a slower process with a higher activation barrier."

[6] "Deposition of submonolayer amounts of silver and subsequent annealing to above 620 K forms an intermixed AgPt surface with nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix, or vice versa, depending on the Ag coverage"

[7] "It was proposed that alloying of Ag with Pt reduces stress in pseudomorphic Ag layers and thus alloy formation is a means for reducing the free energy of the system."

[8] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."

[9] "Intermixing of Ag and Pt appears to be unfavorable because it was previously claimed that Ag and Pt possesses a positive exchange energy and Ag has a lower surface energy. However, the entropic contribution to the free energy may drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface."

[10] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Ag alloys. Key factors include:

1. Stress in adlayers: Promotes surface alloying even for bulk-immiscible elements.
2. Positive exchange energy: Favors clustering of like atoms (e.g., Ag-Ag bonds) in the surface layer.
3. Strain minimization: Promotes Ag dissolution in the Pt surface layer.
4. Surface energy differences: Ag's lower surface energy favors its surface segregation.
5. Temperature effects:
   - At lower temperatures: Fast place exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers.
   - Above 600-620 K: Formation of nanophasic AgPt alloy, starting at adisland perimeters.
   - At higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K): Slower bulk diffusion occurs.
6. Entropic contributions: At higher temperatures, drive limited mixing and surface disordering.

These factors result in:
- Surface-confined alloy with Ag clustering in the topmost layer.
- Nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix or vice versa.
- Dynamic equilibrium allowing quick surface composition adjustments with temperature changes.
- Limited Ag dissolution into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures.

Implications for catalytic properties and performance:
1. Unique active sites at Ag-Pt interfaces enhance catalytic activity or selectivity.
2. Temperature-dependent surface composition allows tunable catalytic properties.
3. Surface-confined alloy maintains high active metal concentration at the surface.
4. Dynamic nature of the surface at elevated temperatures may increase catalyst stability.
5. Potential for creating highly active and selective catalytic sites through controlled alloying and segregation.
6. Possibility of dynamic catalytic behavior responsive to reaction conditions.

Understanding these thermodynamic and kinetic factors enables the design of more efficient and stable Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications by carefully controlling composition, temperature, and reaction conditions.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Ag合金）中。主要因素包括：

1. 吸附层应力：促进表面合金化，即使是体相不互溶的元素。
2. 正交换能：有利于表面层中同类原子（如Ag-Ag键）的聚集。
3. 应变最小化：促进Ag在Pt表面层的溶解。
4. 表面能差异：Ag较低的表面能有利于其表面偏析。
5. 温度效应：
   - 较低温度：Ag和Pt在第一层和第二层之间快速位置交换。
   - 600-620 K以上：形成纳米相AgPt合金，从岛状结构边缘开始。
   - 较高温度（如800 K）：发生较慢的体扩散。
6. 熵贡献：在较高温度下，驱动有限的混合和表面无序化。

这些因素导致：
- 局限于表面的合金，Ag在最表层聚集。
- 纳米级银聚集体嵌入Pt基体中，或反之。
- 动态平衡允许表面组成随温度变化快速调整。
- 在高温长时间加热后，Ag有限地溶解到Pt体相中。

对催化性能和表现的影响：
1. Ag-Pt界面处的独特活性位点增强催化活性或选择性。
2. 温度依赖的表面组成允许可调的催化性能。
3. 表面局限的合金保持表面高活性金属浓度。
4. 高温下表面的动态性质可能增加催化剂稳定性。
5. 通过控制合金化和偏析创造高活性和高选择性催化位点的潜力。
6. 对反应条件响应的动态催化行为的可能性。

理解这些热力学和动力学因素，通过仔细控制组成、温度和反应条件，可以设计更高效和稳定的基于Pt的双金属催化剂，用于各种应用。
