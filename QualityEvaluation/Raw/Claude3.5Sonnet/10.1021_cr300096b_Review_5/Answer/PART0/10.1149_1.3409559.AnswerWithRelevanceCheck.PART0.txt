          [1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."

          [2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."

          [3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key findings are:

          1. Surface segregation: Ternary alloys demonstrate a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This segregation behavior affects the structural configuration of the catalyst.

          2. Binding strengths: The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species in ternary alloys compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This change in binding strength suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

          3. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time.

          These effects have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

          1. The surface segregation of Pt in ternary alloys can be exploited to create more active and stable catalysts.

          2. The weaker binding of reaction intermediates (O and OH) on the Pt monolayer surface may lead to improved ORR kinetics.

          3. The enhanced stability of Pt atoms on the surface of certain ternary alloys could result in longer-lasting catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

          4. The interplay between surface composition, binding strengths, and stability highlights the importance of carefully tuning alloy composition and structure to optimize catalytic performance.

          These findings indicate that the thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation and the resulting structural configuration of Pt-based ternary alloys can lead to improved catalytic properties, including enhanced ORR activity and increased electrochemical stability. These characteristics make such alloys promising candidates for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where ORR catalysts play a critical role.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。主要发现如下：

          1. 表面偏析：三元合金表现出强烈的Pt表面偏析趋势，导致在其表面形成Pt单层。这种偏析行为影响了催化剂的结构配置。

          2. 结合强度：表面Pt单层的存在导致三元合金中O和OH物种的结合强度较双金属合金表面更弱。这种结合强度的变化表明氧还原反应（ORR）的催化活性得到了提高。

          3. 稳定性：某些三元合金的Pt皮层表面表现出对合金表面Pt原子溶解的改善的电化学稳定性。这种增强的稳定性对于长期维持催化性能至关重要。

          这些效应对催化性能和应用表现有重要影响：

          1. 可以利用三元合金中铂的表面偏析来创造更活跃和稳定的催化剂。

          2. 铂单层表面上反应中间体（O和OH）的较弱结合可能会导致ORR动力学的改善。

          3. 某些三元合金表面铂原子的增强稳定性可能会产生更持久的催化剂，特别是在燃料电池和其他电化学系统中。

          4. 表面成分、结合强度和稳定性之间的相互作用突显了仔细调整合金成分和结构以优化催化性能的重要性。

          这些发现表明，三元Pt基合金的表面偏析热力学偏好及由此产生的结构配置可以带来改善的催化性能，包括增强的ORR活性和提高的电化学稳定性。这些特性使得这类合金成为各种应用的有前景的候选者，特别是在ORR催化剂发挥关键作用的燃料电池技术中。
