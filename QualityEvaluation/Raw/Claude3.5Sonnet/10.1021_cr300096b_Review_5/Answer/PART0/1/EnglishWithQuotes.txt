The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are critical for catalytic activity, are directly influenced by the surface composition. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-based alloys with 3d metals have shown enhanced catalytic activities compared to pure Pt, with surface segregation playing a crucial role in this improvement.\n\nThe influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms.
