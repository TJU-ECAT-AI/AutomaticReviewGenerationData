[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]."

[4] "This follows the same trend predicted by DFT that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet, as shown earlier in Fig. 2."

[5] "This highlights one of the added degradation mechanisms for bimetallic alloys, the adsorbate-induced restructuring of the alloy metals near the surface, which has been predicted and demonstrated to occur for a number of bimetallic systems [720]."

[1] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."

[2] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."

[3] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

[6] "After a further 8 min, Fig. 2D, an expanded image shown in Fig. 2E was acquired in which well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structure are observed."

[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures"

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

[4] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[5] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces."

[4] "The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system. This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."

[5] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species."

[3] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[4] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

[5] "Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties."

[6] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[7] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

[8] "The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect."

[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "For T850 K, these morphological changes are accompanied by exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms, that is, the onset of surface alloy formation."

[4] "The onset of surface alloy formation at the descending edges of vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films was observed after annealing to 850 K, while surface alloy formation is completed after annealing to 1300 K."

[5] "The surface confinement of the alloy layer is largely due to a higher energy barrier for diffusion of Pt into the bulk than for intermixing in the outermost layer."

[6] "On the atomic scale, this means that Pt and Ru atoms in the outermost layer prefer to be supported on Ru3 sites rather than on Ru2Pt, RuPt2, or Pt3 sites. This can be rationalized by the stronger binding to Ru compared to Pt, which in a simplified picture means an increase of the pairwise bond strength in the order PtPt, PtRu, RuRu."

[7] "The modified chemical and catalytic properties of bimetallic (catalyst) surfaces are mostly discussed in terms of a few fundamental concepts, namely the geometric ensemble effect, the electronic ligand effect and the electronic strain effect."

[1] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."

[2] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals"

[3] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR"

[4] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[5] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[6] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

[7] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry"

[8] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst"

[9] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

[10] "The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems."

[11] "Pt segregation is found to be correlated with the subsurface atomic structure, the size of metal atoms and the surface energy."

[1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

[5] "Annealing to higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K) allows for diffusion deeper into the bulk or accelerates it to a measurable value. This is a slower process with a higher activation barrier."

[6] "Deposition of submonolayer amounts of silver and subsequent annealing to above 620 K forms an intermixed AgPt surface with nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix, or vice versa, depending on the Ag coverage"

[7] "It was proposed that alloying of Ag with Pt reduces stress in pseudomorphic Ag layers and thus alloy formation is a means for reducing the free energy of the system."

[8] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."

[9] "Intermixing of Ag and Pt appears to be unfavorable because it was previously claimed that Ag and Pt possesses a positive exchange energy and Ag has a lower surface energy. However, the entropic contribution to the free energy may drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface."

[10] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."

[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."

          [2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."

          [3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

          [2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."

          [3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

          [4] "Migration of solute atoms deeper into these subsurface alloys does reduce the calculated decrease in BEH compared with the pure host, but the decrease is still significant"

          [5] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11). However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."

[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

[5] "Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

[6] "Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[5] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."

[6] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

[7] "To understand why Pt2Mo has a lower barrier, we first examined the optimized structure for O2adsorption, and the OOH dissociation TS on Pt2Mo and on Pt, as shown in Fig. 4. The key structural parameters are labelled. These identified structures are similar except that there are precovered O atoms near to the adsorbed O2 and OOH TS on Pt."

[8] "We show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."

[1] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure. The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[2] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

[5] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."

[6] "The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and this is also approximately where both the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur."

          [3] "Stability Of PtNiPt And PtCoPt Exposed To Oxygen"
          [4] "Effect Of Crystal Plane On Subsurface Stability"

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

[7] "An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations."

[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "To illustrate this, we calculate the difference of the overall energetics ΔE between the surface and subsurface alloys in the presence of oxygen (0.25 ML), and the result is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen clearly that calculated ΔE becomes negative or neutral for the 3d TMs considered except Cu."

[3] "The strong interaction between O and 3d TMs not only induces the segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface, but also may result in the clustering and/or agglomeration of segregated 3d TMs atoms further in surface layer to maximize O3d TMs coordination."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[5] "At elevated temperature and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin film or three-dimensional oxide island on Pt surfaces"

[6] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

[7] "For CO oxidation, we find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism. For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."

[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

[6] "Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal–oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

[7] "The mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases."

[1] "The surface composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their properties and performance."

[2] "Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations."

[3] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt."

[4] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[5] "Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a detailed description of the preparation and transition of various Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the temperature and gaseous environment."

[6] "The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts."

[7] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[8] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[9] "The surface stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. an oxidative environment [35,36]."

[10] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

[11] "The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K [2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K)."

[12] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[13] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[14] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]."

[15] "The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[16] "The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."

[17] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

[18] "The Fe 2p signal was almost unchanged until 700 K, and then it decreased rapidly with annealing temperature. The Fe 2p signal decreased to 39% on annealing the surface at 850 K for 6 min. The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[1] "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry"

[2] "Pt-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals"

[3] "As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance."

[4] "Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface."

[5] "However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures."

[6] "Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys."

[7] "The segregation trend is consequently reversed, leading to an M-segregated surface."

[8] "Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one."

[9] "The segregation energy under adsorbate environment, E^ads_segr, can be expressed as E^ads_segr = E^vac_segr + (E^ads_segr - E^ads_nonsegr)"

[10] "The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism."

[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[4] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

[5] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

[6] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."

[1] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming"
          
          [2] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."
          
          [3] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."
          
          [4] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3, where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size"
          
          [5] "Alloying Sn into the Pt(1 1 1) surface reduces the surface reactivity such that the strongly chemisorbed μ-N,O-bonded-nitrito species of NO2 on Pt(1 1 1) is not formed on the alloy."
          
          [6] "Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures."
          
          [7] "We find that after desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, θO=0.2 ML remains at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species. With ΘSn=0.33 ML, this gives an O:Sn ratio of 2:3 corresponding to surface film of Sn1.5O species."
          
          [8] "Our results following NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K is also consistent with previous structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys. In our work, oxygen associated with Sn sites after more extensive oxidation reactions corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species."

[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level, and change in d-band occupancy and electronegativity"

[5] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."

[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]."

[4] "This follows the same trend predicted by DFT that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet, as shown earlier in Fig. 2."

[5] "This highlights one of the added degradation mechanisms for bimetallic alloys, the adsorbate-induced restructuring of the alloy metals near the surface, which has been predicted and demonstrated to occur for a number of bimetallic systems [720]."

[1] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."

[2] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."

[3] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

[6] "After a further 8 min, Fig. 2D, an expanded image shown in Fig. 2E was acquired in which well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structure are observed."

[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures"

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

[4] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[5] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces."

[4] "The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system. This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."

[5] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

[1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species."

[3] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[4] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

[5] "Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties."

[6] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[7] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

[8] "The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect."

[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "For T850 K, these morphological changes are accompanied by exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms, that is, the onset of surface alloy formation."

[4] "The onset of surface alloy formation at the descending edges of vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films was observed after annealing to 850 K, while surface alloy formation is completed after annealing to 1300 K."

[5] "The surface confinement of the alloy layer is largely due to a higher energy barrier for diffusion of Pt into the bulk than for intermixing in the outermost layer."

[6] "On the atomic scale, this means that Pt and Ru atoms in the outermost layer prefer to be supported on Ru3 sites rather than on Ru2Pt, RuPt2, or Pt3 sites. This can be rationalized by the stronger binding to Ru compared to Pt, which in a simplified picture means an increase of the pairwise bond strength in the order PtPt, PtRu, RuRu."

[7] "The modified chemical and catalytic properties of bimetallic (catalyst) surfaces are mostly discussed in terms of a few fundamental concepts, namely the geometric ensemble effect, the electronic ligand effect and the electronic strain effect."

[1] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."

[2] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals"

[3] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR"

[4] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[5] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[6] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

[7] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry"

[8] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst"

[9] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

[10] "The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems."

[11] "Pt segregation is found to be correlated with the subsurface atomic structure, the size of metal atoms and the surface energy."

[1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

[5] "Annealing to higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K) allows for diffusion deeper into the bulk or accelerates it to a measurable value. This is a slower process with a higher activation barrier."

[6] "Deposition of submonolayer amounts of silver and subsequent annealing to above 620 K forms an intermixed AgPt surface with nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix, or vice versa, depending on the Ag coverage"

[7] "It was proposed that alloying of Ag with Pt reduces stress in pseudomorphic Ag layers and thus alloy formation is a means for reducing the free energy of the system."

[8] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."

[9] "Intermixing of Ag and Pt appears to be unfavorable because it was previously claimed that Ag and Pt possesses a positive exchange energy and Ag has a lower surface energy. However, the entropic contribution to the free energy may drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface."

[10] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."

[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."

          [2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."

          [3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

          [2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."

          [3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

          [4] "Migration of solute atoms deeper into these subsurface alloys does reduce the calculated decrease in BEH compared with the pure host, but the decrease is still significant"

          [5] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11). However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."

[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

[5] "Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

[6] "Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[5] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."

[6] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

[7] "To understand why Pt2Mo has a lower barrier, we first examined the optimized structure for O2adsorption, and the OOH dissociation TS on Pt2Mo and on Pt, as shown in Fig. 4. The key structural parameters are labelled. These identified structures are similar except that there are precovered O atoms near to the adsorbed O2 and OOH TS on Pt."

[8] "We show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."

[1] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure. The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[2] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

[5] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."

[6] "The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and this is also approximately where both the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur."

          [4] "Effect Of Crystal Plane On Subsurface Stability"

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

[7] "An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations."

[1] "Under vacuum condition, all calculated ΔE are positive, suggesting that the 3d TMs in the subsurface of Pt (1 1 1) are energetically more favorable."

[2] "To illustrate this, we calculate the difference of the overall energetics ΔE between the surface and subsurface alloys in the presence of oxygen (0.25 ML), and the result is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen clearly that calculated ΔE becomes negative or neutral for the 3d TMs considered except Cu."

[3] "The strong interaction between O and 3d TMs not only induces the segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface, but also may result in the clustering and/or agglomeration of segregated 3d TMs atoms further in surface layer to maximize O3d TMs coordination."

[4] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."

[5] "At elevated temperature and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin film or three-dimensional oxide island on Pt surfaces"

[6] "The structural response and evolutions of alloy catalysts under the oxidizing conditions have profound effect on the catalytic reaction in terms of activity, selectivity and stability."

[7] "For CO oxidation, we find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism. For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."

[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

[6] "Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal–oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

[7] "The mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases."

[1] "The surface composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their properties and performance."

[2] "Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations."

[3] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt."

[4] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[5] "Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a detailed description of the preparation and transition of various Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the temperature and gaseous environment."

[6] "The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts."

[7] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[8] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[9] "The surface stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. an oxidative environment [35,36]."

[10] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

[11] "The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K [2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K)."

[12] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[13] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[14] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]."

[15] "The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[16] "The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."

[17] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

[18] "The Fe 2p signal was almost unchanged until 700 K, and then it decreased rapidly with annealing temperature. The Fe 2p signal decreased to 39% on annealing the surface at 850 K for 6 min. The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[1] "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry"

[2] "Pt-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals"

[3] "As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance."

[4] "Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface."

[5] "However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures."

[6] "Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys."

[7] "The segregation trend is consequently reversed, leading to an M-segregated surface."

[8] "Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one."

[9] "The segregation energy under adsorbate environment, E^ads_segr, can be expressed as E^ads_segr = E^vac_segr + (E^ads_segr - E^ads_nonsegr)"

[10] "The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism."

[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[4] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

[5] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

[6] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."

[1] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming"
          
          [2] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."
          
          [3] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."
          
          [4] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3, where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size"
          
          [5] "Alloying Sn into the Pt(1 1 1) surface reduces the surface reactivity such that the strongly chemisorbed μ-N,O-bonded-nitrito species of NO2 on Pt(1 1 1) is not formed on the alloy."
          
          [6] "Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures."
          
          [7] "We find that after desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, θO=0.2 ML remains at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species. With ΘSn=0.33 ML, this gives an O:Sn ratio of 2:3 corresponding to surface film of Sn1.5O species."
          
          [8] "Our results following NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K is also consistent with previous structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys. In our work, oxygen associated with Sn sites after more extensive oxidation reactions corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species."

[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level, and change in d-band occupancy and electronegativity"

[5] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."
