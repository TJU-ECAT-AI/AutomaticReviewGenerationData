Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Environmental effects: In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred. However, with adsorbed oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes more stable.

2. Crystal facet effects: The stability of configurations varies with crystal facets. For example, the subsurface PtNiPt configuration is more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

3. Catalytic performance: The subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems shows increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding of oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

4. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: This phenomenon represents a significant degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys, affecting their long-term stability and performance.

5. Verification: DFT predictions have been experimentally verified, confirming the segregation behavior and allowing quantification of activation barriers for adsorbate-induced segregation.

These factors have important implications for catalyst design, performance, and longevity in various applications, emphasizing the need to consider the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions.

The study provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as PtPd alloys:

1. Surface segregation: In PtPd alloys, Pd atoms tend to segregate to the outermost layers of extended surfaces, while Pt concentration increases from the surface into the bulk. This segregation behavior affects the surface composition and thus the catalytic properties.

2. Nanoparticle structure: PtPd nanoparticles exhibit a core-shell structure with Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. This configuration can influence catalytic activity by exposing more Pd atoms at the surface.

3. Facet-dependent segregation: In nanoparticles, Pd atoms preferentially segregate to (100) facets over (111) facets. This facet-specific segregation can lead to anisotropic catalytic properties.

These findings have implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The Pd-rich surface in Pt-Pd alloys may alter catalytic activity compared to pure Pt surfaces, potentially enhancing or inhibiting certain reactions.

2. The core-shell structure with a Pd-rich exterior may influence reactivity and selectivity.

3. The observed segregation patterns may affect the long-term stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

4. Understanding these segregation phenomena can guide the design of more effective Pt-based bimetallic catalysts by controlling composition, particle size, and shape to optimize surface properties for specific applications.

While the study focuses on PtPd alloys, similar principles may apply to other Pt-3d alloys, though specific behaviors would depend on the particular elements involved and their interactions. These thermodynamic preferences and resulting structural configurations significantly impact the stability, activity, and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys like PtFe, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by electrochemical potential cycling, which promotes Fe dissolution and Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through this selective dissolution process has important implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits improved CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, the Pt skin layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. Over time, the surface morphology evolves from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures. This reorganization process involves the formation of oriented crystalline steps and the appearance of terraces, which can significantly affect the catalytic properties of the surface.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface segregation and restructuring processes for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells. The resulting Pt-rich surface with specific crystallographic orientations has direct consequences for the catalyst's performance in electrochemical applications, where CO tolerance and stability are critical factors.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-3d alloys such as Pt-Fe systems:

1. Thermodynamic stability: While the thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, preparation methods like sputtering at room temperature can produce metastable structures with face-centered cubic arrangements across various compositions.

2. Surface segregation: Under electrochemical conditions, even mild ones, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a pure Pt skin layer. This surface segregation occurs despite the bulk composition remaining unchanged, as evidenced by EDX measurements.

3. Structural configuration: The Pt skin layer formed on the alloy surface is very thin, approximately 1 nm thick. This thin nature is crucial for maintaining the enhanced catalytic properties of the alloy.

4. Electronic effects: The thin Pt skin allows the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms to be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, leading to significant enhancement of catalytic activity. As the skin layer thickens, this modification diminishes, potentially explaining controversial enhancement effects reported in various studies.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Despite the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer, Pt-Fe alloys exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction compared to pure Pt.

2. Thickness-dependent performance: The catalytic enhancement is highly dependent on the thickness of the Pt skin layer. Optimal performance is achieved when the layer is thin enough to allow electronic modification by the underlying alloy.

3. Stability considerations: While surface segregation occurs, the stability of the bulk composition suggests these catalysts may maintain their performance over time. However, long-term stability studies would be needed to confirm this.

4. Preparation method importance: The method of catalyst preparation can override thermodynamic preferences, allowing for the creation of metastable structures with potentially unique catalytic properties.

Overall, the interplay between surface and bulk properties in these bimetallic systems creates a complex relationship between structure and catalytic performance, offering opportunities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1. Surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition of Pt-based alloys, which directly affects catalytic activity. For example, in Pt3Co alloys, annealing can lead to the formation of a Pt-skin structure on the surface due to Pt segregation, resulting in significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.

2. The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements:
   - Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, which is thermodynamically favorable (exothermic process, 0.57 eV) and kinetically feasible.
   - Co does not tend to segregate to the surface in PtCo alloys, as the process is thermodynamically unfavorable (endothermic, 0.45 eV) and kinetically prohibitive.

3. These segregation behaviors have significant implications for catalyst design and performance:
   - Formation of Pt-skin structures in Pt-3d alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and stability.
   - Surface composition and structure resulting from segregation can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.

4. Understanding and controlling surface segregation is crucial for optimizing bimetallic catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. By carefully selecting alloying elements and controlling reaction conditions, it is possible to tailor the surface composition and structure of Pt-based catalysts to achieve desired catalytic properties and enhanced performance.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation: Pt tends to segregate to the surface in Pt-3d alloys, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation alters the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys, with Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for Pt-segregated systems, which is the reverse of nonsegregated Pt3M alloys.

2. Adsorption properties: The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters surface adsorption properties. These properties are primarily determined by two factors: surface geometry (strain effects) and electronic structure (effects due to the change of metal species).

3. Stability: While both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces show decreased stability with oxygen adsorption compared to clean Pt surfaces, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys demonstrate enhanced stability under oxygen adsorption conditions. The potential shifts are higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni compared to pure Pt, indicating better stability against dissolution.

4. Structural effects: The interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can be used to measure binding strength in most cases.

5. Role of 3d metals: In nonsegregated surfaces, 3d metal atoms directly participate in oxygen adsorption, enhancing adsorption strength. However, on Pt-segregated surfaces, they weaken oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and electronic effects.

6. Subsurface effects: The 3d subsurface atoms play a protective role by strongly binding to the Pt surface layer, contributing to the overall stability of the catalyst. The degree of stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance, allowing for the design of tailored catalysts with optimized stability, reactivity, and durability for specific applications such as fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key factors and their implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Temperature: It plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and distribution of components. For Pt-Ru systems, increasing temperature leads to various structural configurations, from Pt islands at room temperature to surface alloy formation at higher temperatures (850 K - 1300 K).

2. Energy barriers for diffusion: A higher energy barrier for Pt diffusion into the bulk compared to surface intermixing promotes surface alloy formation and confinement.

3. Binding strength preferences: Atoms tend to be supported on sites that offer stronger binding. In Pt-Ru systems, the preference follows the order Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3.

4. Pairwise bond strengths: These affect stability, with RuRu > PtRu > PtPt in Pt-Ru systems.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. They affect the availability and nature of active sites on the catalyst surface.
2. Surface confinement of the alloy layer can maintain a high concentration of active components.
3. Preferential binding arrangements can create specific ensemble effects influencing catalytic activity and selectivity.
4. The variation in bond strengths affects catalyst stability under reaction conditions.

The catalytic properties are further influenced by geometric ensemble effects, electronic ligand effects, and electronic strain effects. Understanding and controlling these factors allows for tuning bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, optimizing their catalytic performance and stability.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The main factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface.
2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.
3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote segregation.
4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter the segregation behavior.
5. Subsurface atomic arrangement: The structure beneath the surface layer can influence segregation.

These factors combine to determine the final surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based alloys, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its larger atomic size compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation has important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Surface segregation can lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). For example, Pt-skin structures formed by segregation on Pt3M alloys (where M is Ni or Co) show enhanced catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
2. Formation of "Pt-skin" structures: In some Pt-3d alloys, a Pt-rich surface layer forms, which can exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
3. Modified electronic structure: Surface segregation alters the d-band structure of the catalyst, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.
4. Tailored catalytic properties: By controlling surface segregation, it's possible to optimize catalyst performance for specific reactions.
5. Improved stability: In some cases, surface segregation can lead to more stable catalyst structures under reaction conditions.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells, electrocatalysis, and other heterogeneous catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Ag alloys. Key factors include:

1. Stress in adlayers: Promotes surface alloying even for bulk-immiscible elements.
2. Positive exchange energy: Favors clustering of like atoms (e.g., Ag-Ag bonds) in the surface layer.
3. Strain minimization: Promotes Ag dissolution in the Pt surface layer.
4. Surface energy differences: Ag's lower surface energy favors its surface segregation.
5. Temperature effects:
   - At lower temperatures: Fast place exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers.
   - Above 600-620 K: Formation of nanophasic AgPt alloy, starting at adisland perimeters.
   - At higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K): Slower bulk diffusion occurs.
6. Entropic contributions: At higher temperatures, drive limited mixing and surface disordering.

These factors result in:
- Surface-confined alloy with Ag clustering in the topmost layer.
- Nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix or vice versa.
- Dynamic equilibrium allowing quick surface composition adjustments with temperature changes.
- Limited Ag dissolution into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures.

Implications for catalytic properties and performance:
1. Unique active sites at Ag-Pt interfaces enhance catalytic activity or selectivity.
2. Temperature-dependent surface composition allows tunable catalytic properties.
3. Surface-confined alloy maintains high active metal concentration at the surface.
4. Dynamic nature of the surface at elevated temperatures may increase catalyst stability.
5. Potential for creating highly active and selective catalytic sites through controlled alloying and segregation.
6. Possibility of dynamic catalytic behavior responsive to reaction conditions.

Understanding these thermodynamic and kinetic factors enables the design of more efficient and stable Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications by carefully controlling composition, temperature, and reaction conditions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key findings are:

          1. Surface segregation: Ternary alloys demonstrate a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This segregation behavior affects the structural configuration of the catalyst.

          2. Binding strengths: The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species in ternary alloys compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This change in binding strength suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

          3. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time.

          These effects have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

          1. The surface segregation of Pt in ternary alloys can be exploited to create more active and stable catalysts.

          2. The weaker binding of reaction intermediates (O and OH) on the Pt monolayer surface may lead to improved ORR kinetics.

          3. The enhanced stability of Pt atoms on the surface of certain ternary alloys could result in longer-lasting catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

          4. The interplay between surface composition, binding strengths, and stability highlights the importance of carefully tuning alloy composition and structure to optimize catalytic performance.

          These findings indicate that the thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation and the resulting structural configuration of Pt-based ternary alloys can lead to improved catalytic properties, including enhanced ORR activity and increased electrochemical stability. These characteristics make such alloys promising candidates for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where ORR catalysts play a critical role.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects.

          Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This approach helps predict whether hydrogen-induced segregation will occur under specific conditions.

          In real NSAs, deviations from idealized models may occur. For example, some solute atoms in subsurface alloys might segregate deeper into the host metal. While these deviations don't substantially alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior, they can have quantitative effects on adsorbate properties and reduce the calculated decrease in hydrogen binding energy (BEH) compared to the pure host metal.

          These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Even non-ideal NSAs have shown significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions. The ability to control and manipulate these properties through careful design of NSA composition and structure offers potential for tailoring catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells, hydrogenation reactions, or hydrogen storage and separation.

          Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural effects is essential for rational catalyst design, as it allows researchers to predict and control the surface composition and properties of bimetallic catalysts under relevant reaction conditions, potentially leading to improved performance in various catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This influence has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electrocatalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing efficient and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.
2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.
3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the extent of surface segregation in Pt-based alloys. The addition of a third component can significantly alter surface segregation behavior. For instance, in Pt3Ni alloys, replacing Ni with certain transition metals (V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, Ir) enhances Pt surface segregation, while others (Ag, Au, Pd) can completely suppress it. The atomic size of the third component relative to Pt also plays a role, with smaller atoms better maintaining Pt surface segregation.

The resulting surface structures, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in specific layers, can significantly affect the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the catalyst. This allows for fine-tuning of catalyst properties through careful selection of alloying elements and synthesis conditions.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on surface segregation enables the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By optimizing surface composition and structure, it's possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Surface Stability:
   - Oxygen coverage plays a crucial role in catalyst stability.
   - Clean alloy surfaces are generally more stable than pure Pt due to d-band stabilization.
   - High oxygen coverage reverses this trend, making alloys less stable than Pt.
   - Maintaining low or zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (e.g., 0.9 V) is crucial for both high activity and stability.

2. Surface Segregation:
   - Alloying stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution on clean surfaces.
   - Oxygen presence facilitates Pt removal by stabilizing surface vacancies.

3. Structural Configuration:
   - The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and oxygen coverage.
   - Precovered oxygen atoms near adsorbed O2 and OOH transition states affect catalyst performance.

4. Catalytic Properties and Performance:
   - Lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) is necessary for stable ORR catalysts.
   - The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change under reaction conditions.
   - Optimizing the ratio of Pt to alloying elements is crucial for balancing stability and activity.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, surface structure, and reaction environment in determining bimetallic catalyst performance. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for designing improved catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Cu alloys. The key findings and implications are:

1. Clean surface preference: Without adsorbates, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, with Cu diffusion to the surface being endothermic.

2. CO-induced surface restructuring: Contrary to typical expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induces surface segregation of the less reactive Cu, pulling it to the surface of the CuPt near-surface alloy.

3. Driving force for restructuring: The Cu surface segregation is driven by a drastic increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. This increase more than compensates for the endothermic nature of Cu diffusion to the surface.

4. Stable configuration: Under CO adsorption, the most stable configuration becomes 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites, forming a novel, well-ordered CuPt surface alloy.

5. Temperature dependence: The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant around 460 K, coinciding with the formation and breakup of the CO-induced surface alloy.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Dynamic surface changes: The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically under reaction conditions, affecting activity and selectivity.

2. Novel surface structures: Adsorbate-induced surface segregation can lead to unexpected surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. Tunable electronic structure: The formation of isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu in the surface layer can alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity.

4. Design implications: These results demonstrate the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing and studying bimetallic catalysts, as the actual active surface structure may differ significantly from the initial or expected configuration.

5. Broader applicability: The findings suggest potential applications in other coinage metal/Pt-group bimetallic systems, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

The literature suggests that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The study focuses on the oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt3dPt(111) and Pt3dPt(100) bimetallic structures, indicating that the crystal plane orientation plays a crucial role in determining the stability of subsurface 3d metals in the presence of oxygen.

          The research investigates the stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures when exposed to oxygen, which implies that reaction conditions involving oxygen can affect the structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, the study examines the effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability, suggesting that the specific arrangement of atoms at the surface influences the overall stability and potential for surface segregation in these Pt-based systems.

          These factors have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys in various applications. The stability and surface composition of bimetallic catalysts directly affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. By understanding how thermodynamics and reaction conditions influence the structural configuration of these materials, researchers can better predict and optimize their performance in specific applications, such as fuel cells or other catalytic processes involving oxygen.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play a crucial role in determining their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Bimetallic catalysts exhibit more complex surface structures compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in different states (metallic or oxidized) and locations (surface, near-surface, or bulk). This structural complexity contributes to their superior catalytic performance.

In Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region leads to enhanced catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This demonstrates the critical role of surface structure in determining catalytic properties.

The structure of bimetallic catalysts is not static but can change dynamically during reactions. Environmental conditions, such as changes between reductive and oxidative atmospheres, can induce reversible surface processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion.

Using FePt(111) systems as an example, it has been shown that the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

The ability to control and manipulate the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts through thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions has significant implications for optimizing their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. This tunability offers opportunities for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for specific reactions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. This preference is often observed in fuel cell applications where Pt3d alloys are covered by a Pt skin.

The stability and surface segregation of these bimetallic catalysts are highly dependent on the presence and nature of adsorbates. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen, sulfur, selenium, or carbon have minimal impact on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. However, strongly binding adsorbates such as nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the stability of surface structures.

The segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the final structure. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to admetal segregation to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

The presence of atomic oxygen can reverse the thermodynamic stability, making the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more stable than the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structure. This oxygen-induced surface segregation demonstrates how reaction conditions can dramatically influence the structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure can profoundly affect the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems. The dynamic nature of these surfaces under reaction conditions highlights the importance of considering the specific reaction environment when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the effects of reaction conditions is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of catalyst behavior under various reaction environments, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance and efficiency in applications such as fuel cells and other catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions, 3d transition metals (TMs) prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt(111), as this configuration is energetically more favorable. However, in oxidizing environments, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d TMs induces segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface.

The presence of oxygen can cause further clustering and agglomeration of segregated 3d TM atoms in the surface layer to maximize O-3d TM coordination. At elevated temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin films or three-dimensional oxide islands on Pt surfaces.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. In CO oxidation, catalysts with atomically dispersed 3d TMs in the Pt surface layer show high activity through a bi-functional mechanism.
2. When oxidized 3d TM islands form on the Pt surface, the activity becomes limited by oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or edges of oxidized 3d TM islands becomes crucial for catalytic performance.
3. The structural response and evolution of alloy catalysts under oxidizing conditions significantly affect catalytic reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under different reaction conditions and underscore the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure and composition for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications. The ability of these catalysts to adapt their structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for designing smart catalysts with tunable properties, but also presents challenges in maintaining desired configurations under operating conditions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition, affecting their catalytic properties and performance.

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (e.g., H2 atmosphere), there is a thermodynamic preference for Pt to segregate to the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles. This is primarily driven by Pt's larger atomic radius compared to 3d transition metals, which helps minimize strain energy at the surface. This results in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer or "Pt-skin" structure.

In oxidizing conditions (e.g., O2 atmosphere), the situation reverses. The 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong affinity for oxygen. These metals then become oxidized, forming a layer of metal oxide (e.g., NiO) that encapsulates the Pt-rich core. This encapsulation is driven by the lower surface energy of the metal oxides compared to Pt and strong metal-oxide interactions.

These structural changes are reversible and can occur cyclically as the reaction environment alternates between reducing and oxidizing conditions. The mass transport processes active in oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases.

This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition and active sites can change during reactions, potentially altering catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. The formation of Pt-skin structures in reducing environments can enhance certain catalytic reactions that prefer Pt-rich surfaces.
3. In oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals and oxide formation can create unique catalytic environments, potentially enhancing activity or selectivity for certain reactions.
4. The reversible nature of these changes allows for potential in-situ tuning of catalyst properties by manipulating reaction conditions.
5. Long-term catalyst stability and performance may be affected by repeated structural changes in cyclic oxidation-reduction processes.

Understanding and controlling these dynamic processes is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, catalytic reforming, and emission control systems. It also highlights the importance of evaluating catalyst performance under realistic operating conditions, as the structure observed ex-situ may not reflect the active state of the catalyst.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures promote stronger Fe-Pt interactions, favoring layer growth and alloying. For example, Fe forms layer-like structures on Pt(111) at 487 K.

2. Annealing conditions: Vacuum annealing at high temperatures induces inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt subsurface, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)).

3. Oxidative environments: High-temperature annealing in oxygen causes outward diffusion of Fe, forming FeO surface structures on Pt(111).

4. Reductive environments: Strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures can produce Pt-skin structures from Fe/Pt(111) surfaces.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition control: The ability to manipulate surface composition through temperature and gas environment allows for tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Electronic effects: Subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

3. Reversible modulation: The ability to switch between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) structures allows for fine-tuning of catalyst surface properties for specific applications.

4. Enhanced activity: Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt surface showed 25 times the ORR activity of pure Pt catalysts.

5. Stability considerations: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions highlights the importance of considering catalyst stability under reaction environments.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural transformations is crucial for rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance and stability for various catalytic applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is primarily determined by surface energy and atomic size. Atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. In Pt-3d alloys, this typically results in Pt segregation to the surface due to its larger atomic radius compared to 3d metals.

However, the presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can dramatically alter the surface composition and segregation trends. Oxygen adsorption can decrease the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces and even reverse the segregation trend in Pt3M alloys. At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface for Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the vacuum segregation energy and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why certain surface compositions become more or less favorable under different environmental conditions.

These changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are critical for catalytic activity, are directly influenced by the surface composition. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-based alloys with 3d metals have shown enhanced catalytic activities compared to pure Pt, with surface segregation playing a crucial role in this improvement.

The influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms. Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena under different reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where Pt-based alloys are widely used as cathode catalysts for ORR.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Surface energy differences: Metals with lower surface energies (like Pt and Pd) tend to segregate to the surface when alloyed with higher surface energy metals (like Ru).

2. Atomic size mismatch: Larger guest atoms (Pt, Pd) in a host lattice of smaller atoms (Ru) experience tensile stress, favoring their segregation to the surface.

3. Segregation energies: DFT calculations show significant segregation energies for Pt (0.8 eV) and Pd (1.0 eV) in Ru(0001), providing a strong driving force for surface segregation.

4. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote surface segregation but may also lead to bulk dissolution due to entropic effects.

These factors result in the formation of stable surface alloy configurations that are metastable only towards bulk dissolution. The implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Enhanced stability: The thermodynamic preference for surface segregation helps maintain the desired surface composition during catalytic reactions.

2. Tunable surface properties: By controlling composition and preparation conditions, the surface structure and composition can be tailored for specific catalytic applications.

3. Synergistic effects: The combination of different metals in the surface layer can lead to unique electronic and geometric properties, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Long-term performance: Understanding and controlling segregation behavior can help design catalysts with improved long-term stability and activity.

These insights provide a foundation for rational catalyst design and optimization for various applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical reactions, and heterogeneous catalysis.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

          1. Oxidation state and surface composition: Sn in Pt-Sn alloys can partially oxidize under certain conditions, creating a mixed catalyst system with both alloy and oxide phases. This affects surface composition and reactivity.
          
          2. Structural configuration: The structure changes with oxidation, forming reduced tin oxide layers (SnOx) at the interface with Pt. The degree of oxidation depends on reaction conditions, with different tin oxide species (e.g., Sn1.5O, SnO1.5) forming at different temperatures and exposures.
          
          3. Support effects: In supported catalysts, the oxide support material (e.g., alumina) influences the phases present and their relative concentrations, which are also affected by particle size.
          
          4. Surface reactivity: Alloying Sn with Pt reduces surface reactivity, changing adsorption behavior of molecules like NO2 and influencing decomposition pathways.
          
          5. Catalytic properties: These structural and compositional changes significantly affect catalytic performance. Pt-Sn catalysts show improved resistance to coking and increased selectivity towards aromatics in reforming reactions compared to pure Pt catalysts.
          
          6. Temperature dependence: Reaction temperature influences the oxidation state of Sn and the resulting surface structure, affecting catalyst behavior.
          
          7. Stability and regeneration: The tendency of Sn to oxidize and potentially segregate to the surface under certain conditions may affect long-term catalyst stability and necessitate specific regeneration procedures.

          Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and designing catalysts for specific applications such as petroleum reforming or selective oxidation and reduction reactions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The catalytic activity of these alloys depends dramatically on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation phenomena.

In Pt-based systems like Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation is commonly observed. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This variation in segregation behavior can significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these materials.

The study investigates surface segregation on stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by oxygen adsorption. In core-shell structures, segregation involves exchanges between Pt atoms in the first layer and core atoms in the second layer. For Pt3M alloys, segregation occurs through exchanges between M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer.

These factors collectively influence the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to control and predict surface segregation and structural changes under reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in fuel cells and other catalytic applications. Understanding and controlling these phenomena are essential for designing more efficient and stable catalysts, as they affect the availability of active sites, electronic structure, and overall reactivity of the catalyst surface.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Au alloys. Key findings include:

1. Thermodynamic preference: In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: Reaction conditions, particularly CO adsorption, can alter the thermodynamically preferred configuration. CO promotes Pt diffusion to the cluster surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for clusters with initially pure Au surfaces.

3. Structural impact on catalytic properties: The surface composition directly affects catalytic performance. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. Clusters with 100% Au surfaces cannot catalyze this reaction due to the lack of Pt ensembles at the surface.

4. Implications for catalyst design: The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions means their active surface composition may differ significantly from the as-prepared state. This can lead to unexpected catalytic behaviors and highlights the need to consider in-situ restructuring when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts.

5. Balance between stability and activity: While a Pt core-Au shell structure may be thermodynamically favored, it may not provide the optimal surface for certain reactions. The balance between thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity needs careful management.

6. Reaction-specific design considerations: The structural requirements for specific reactions (e.g., need for contiguous Pt sites for O2 dissociation) should guide the design of bimetallic catalysts to ensure the presence of necessary active site ensembles.

Understanding these factors is crucial for designing efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the surface composition and structure directly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Electronic structure modification: The formation of Pt-alloy systems alters the surface electronic properties of Pt, which in turn changes its reactivity. This is due to the formation of surface metal-metal bonds, shifts in core energy levels, and charge transfer between the Pt monolayer and the substrate.

2. Catalytic activity enhancement: Pt-alloy systems, such as Pt3M (where M is a 3d transition metal), have shown improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of Pt surface electronic and chemical properties.

3. Activity-structure correlation: The specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals (e.g., Ni to Ti) shows a volcano-shaped dependence. This relationship is explained by variations in oxygen chemisorption energy, which correlates with changes in surface electronic structure.

4. Density of states and d-band properties: The catalytic properties of bimetallic systems are influenced by changes in the density of states near the Fermi level, as well as alterations in d-band occupancy and electronegativity.

5. Strain and interfacial effects: Both lattice strain and interfacial interactions play crucial roles in determining the properties of bimetallic systems. Systems with small lattice mismatches between components are particularly interesting for studying these effects.

These factors collectively determine the stability, surface composition, and structural arrangement of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Understanding and controlling these aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in applications such as fuel cells, where enhanced ORR activity and reduced Pt content are desirable outcomes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Environmental effects: In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred. However, with adsorbed oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes more stable.

2. Crystal facet effects: The stability of configurations varies with crystal facets. For example, the subsurface PtNiPt configuration is more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

3. Catalytic performance: The subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems shows increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding of oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

4. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: This phenomenon represents a significant degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys, affecting their long-term stability and performance.

5. Verification: DFT predictions have been experimentally verified, confirming the segregation behavior and allowing quantification of activation barriers for adsorbate-induced segregation.

These factors have important implications for catalyst design, performance, and longevity in various applications, emphasizing the need to consider the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions.

The study provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as PtPd alloys:

1. Surface segregation: In PtPd alloys, Pd atoms tend to segregate to the outermost layers of extended surfaces, while Pt concentration increases from the surface into the bulk. This segregation behavior affects the surface composition and thus the catalytic properties.

2. Nanoparticle structure: PtPd nanoparticles exhibit a core-shell structure with Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. This configuration can influence catalytic activity by exposing more Pd atoms at the surface.

3. Facet-dependent segregation: In nanoparticles, Pd atoms preferentially segregate to (100) facets over (111) facets. This facet-specific segregation can lead to anisotropic catalytic properties.

These findings have implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The Pd-rich surface in Pt-Pd alloys may alter catalytic activity compared to pure Pt surfaces, potentially enhancing or inhibiting certain reactions.

2. The core-shell structure with a Pd-rich exterior may influence reactivity and selectivity.

3. The observed segregation patterns may affect the long-term stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

4. Understanding these segregation phenomena can guide the design of more effective Pt-based bimetallic catalysts by controlling composition, particle size, and shape to optimize surface properties for specific applications.

While the study focuses on PtPd alloys, similar principles may apply to other Pt-3d alloys, though specific behaviors would depend on the particular elements involved and their interactions. These thermodynamic preferences and resulting structural configurations significantly impact the stability, activity, and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys like PtFe, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by electrochemical potential cycling, which promotes Fe dissolution and Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through this selective dissolution process has important implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits improved CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, the Pt skin layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. Over time, the surface morphology evolves from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures. This reorganization process involves the formation of oriented crystalline steps and the appearance of terraces, which can significantly affect the catalytic properties of the surface.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface segregation and restructuring processes for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells. The resulting Pt-rich surface with specific crystallographic orientations has direct consequences for the catalyst's performance in electrochemical applications, where CO tolerance and stability are critical factors.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-3d alloys such as Pt-Fe systems:

1. Thermodynamic stability: While the thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, preparation methods like sputtering at room temperature can produce metastable structures with face-centered cubic arrangements across various compositions.

2. Surface segregation: Under electrochemical conditions, even mild ones, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a pure Pt skin layer. This surface segregation occurs despite the bulk composition remaining unchanged, as evidenced by EDX measurements.

3. Structural configuration: The Pt skin layer formed on the alloy surface is very thin, approximately 1 nm thick. This thin nature is crucial for maintaining the enhanced catalytic properties of the alloy.

4. Electronic effects: The thin Pt skin allows the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms to be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, leading to significant enhancement of catalytic activity. As the skin layer thickens, this modification diminishes, potentially explaining controversial enhancement effects reported in various studies.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Despite the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer, Pt-Fe alloys exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction compared to pure Pt.

2. Thickness-dependent performance: The catalytic enhancement is highly dependent on the thickness of the Pt skin layer. Optimal performance is achieved when the layer is thin enough to allow electronic modification by the underlying alloy.

3. Stability considerations: While surface segregation occurs, the stability of the bulk composition suggests these catalysts may maintain their performance over time. However, long-term stability studies would be needed to confirm this.

4. Preparation method importance: The method of catalyst preparation can override thermodynamic preferences, allowing for the creation of metastable structures with potentially unique catalytic properties.

Overall, the interplay between surface and bulk properties in these bimetallic systems creates a complex relationship between structure and catalytic performance, offering opportunities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1. Surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition of Pt-based alloys, which directly affects catalytic activity. For example, in Pt3Co alloys, annealing can lead to the formation of a Pt-skin structure on the surface due to Pt segregation, resulting in significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.

2. The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements:
   - Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, which is thermodynamically favorable (exothermic process, 0.57 eV) and kinetically feasible.
   - Co does not tend to segregate to the surface in PtCo alloys, as the process is thermodynamically unfavorable (endothermic, 0.45 eV) and kinetically prohibitive.

3. These segregation behaviors have significant implications for catalyst design and performance:
   - Formation of Pt-skin structures in Pt-3d alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and stability.
   - Surface composition and structure resulting from segregation can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.

4. Understanding and controlling surface segregation is crucial for optimizing bimetallic catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. By carefully selecting alloying elements and controlling reaction conditions, it is possible to tailor the surface composition and structure of Pt-based catalysts to achieve desired catalytic properties and enhanced performance.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation: Pt tends to segregate to the surface in Pt-3d alloys, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation alters the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys, with Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for Pt-segregated systems, which is the reverse of nonsegregated Pt3M alloys.

2. Adsorption properties: The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters surface adsorption properties. These properties are primarily determined by two factors: surface geometry (strain effects) and electronic structure (effects due to the change of metal species).

3. Stability: While both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces show decreased stability with oxygen adsorption compared to clean Pt surfaces, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys demonstrate enhanced stability under oxygen adsorption conditions. The potential shifts are higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni compared to pure Pt, indicating better stability against dissolution.

4. Structural effects: The interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can be used to measure binding strength in most cases.

5. Role of 3d metals: In nonsegregated surfaces, 3d metal atoms directly participate in oxygen adsorption, enhancing adsorption strength. However, on Pt-segregated surfaces, they weaken oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and electronic effects.

6. Subsurface effects: The 3d subsurface atoms play a protective role by strongly binding to the Pt surface layer, contributing to the overall stability of the catalyst. The degree of stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance, allowing for the design of tailored catalysts with optimized stability, reactivity, and durability for specific applications such as fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key factors and their implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Temperature: It plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and distribution of components. For Pt-Ru systems, increasing temperature leads to various structural configurations, from Pt islands at room temperature to surface alloy formation at higher temperatures (850 K - 1300 K).

2. Energy barriers for diffusion: A higher energy barrier for Pt diffusion into the bulk compared to surface intermixing promotes surface alloy formation and confinement.

3. Binding strength preferences: Atoms tend to be supported on sites that offer stronger binding. In Pt-Ru systems, the preference follows the order Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3.

4. Pairwise bond strengths: These affect stability, with RuRu > PtRu > PtPt in Pt-Ru systems.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. They affect the availability and nature of active sites on the catalyst surface.
2. Surface confinement of the alloy layer can maintain a high concentration of active components.
3. Preferential binding arrangements can create specific ensemble effects influencing catalytic activity and selectivity.
4. The variation in bond strengths affects catalyst stability under reaction conditions.

The catalytic properties are further influenced by geometric ensemble effects, electronic ligand effects, and electronic strain effects. Understanding and controlling these factors allows for tuning bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, optimizing their catalytic performance and stability.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The main factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface.
2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.
3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote segregation.
4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter the segregation behavior.
5. Subsurface atomic arrangement: The structure beneath the surface layer can influence segregation.

These factors combine to determine the final surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based alloys, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its larger atomic size compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation has important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Surface segregation can lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). For example, Pt-skin structures formed by segregation on Pt3M alloys (where M is Ni or Co) show enhanced catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
2. Formation of "Pt-skin" structures: In some Pt-3d alloys, a Pt-rich surface layer forms, which can exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
3. Modified electronic structure: Surface segregation alters the d-band structure of the catalyst, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.
4. Tailored catalytic properties: By controlling surface segregation, it's possible to optimize catalyst performance for specific reactions.
5. Improved stability: In some cases, surface segregation can lead to more stable catalyst structures under reaction conditions.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells, electrocatalysis, and other heterogeneous catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Ag alloys. Key factors include:

1. Stress in adlayers: Promotes surface alloying even for bulk-immiscible elements.
2. Positive exchange energy: Favors clustering of like atoms (e.g., Ag-Ag bonds) in the surface layer.
3. Strain minimization: Promotes Ag dissolution in the Pt surface layer.
4. Surface energy differences: Ag's lower surface energy favors its surface segregation.
5. Temperature effects:
   - At lower temperatures: Fast place exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layers.
   - Above 600-620 K: Formation of nanophasic AgPt alloy, starting at adisland perimeters.
   - At higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K): Slower bulk diffusion occurs.
6. Entropic contributions: At higher temperatures, drive limited mixing and surface disordering.

These factors result in:
- Surface-confined alloy with Ag clustering in the topmost layer.
- Nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix or vice versa.
- Dynamic equilibrium allowing quick surface composition adjustments with temperature changes.
- Limited Ag dissolution into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures.

Implications for catalytic properties and performance:
1. Unique active sites at Ag-Pt interfaces enhance catalytic activity or selectivity.
2. Temperature-dependent surface composition allows tunable catalytic properties.
3. Surface-confined alloy maintains high active metal concentration at the surface.
4. Dynamic nature of the surface at elevated temperatures may increase catalyst stability.
5. Potential for creating highly active and selective catalytic sites through controlled alloying and segregation.
6. Possibility of dynamic catalytic behavior responsive to reaction conditions.

Understanding these thermodynamic and kinetic factors enables the design of more efficient and stable Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications by carefully controlling composition, temperature, and reaction conditions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key findings are:

          1. Surface segregation: Ternary alloys demonstrate a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This segregation behavior affects the structural configuration of the catalyst.

          2. Binding strengths: The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species in ternary alloys compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This change in binding strength suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

          3. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time.

          These effects have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

          1. The surface segregation of Pt in ternary alloys can be exploited to create more active and stable catalysts.

          2. The weaker binding of reaction intermediates (O and OH) on the Pt monolayer surface may lead to improved ORR kinetics.

          3. The enhanced stability of Pt atoms on the surface of certain ternary alloys could result in longer-lasting catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

          4. The interplay between surface composition, binding strengths, and stability highlights the importance of carefully tuning alloy composition and structure to optimize catalytic performance.

          These findings indicate that the thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation and the resulting structural configuration of Pt-based ternary alloys can lead to improved catalytic properties, including enhanced ORR activity and increased electrochemical stability. These characteristics make such alloys promising candidates for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where ORR catalysts play a critical role.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects.

          Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This approach helps predict whether hydrogen-induced segregation will occur under specific conditions.

          In real NSAs, deviations from idealized models may occur. For example, some solute atoms in subsurface alloys might segregate deeper into the host metal. While these deviations don't substantially alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior, they can have quantitative effects on adsorbate properties and reduce the calculated decrease in hydrogen binding energy (BEH) compared to the pure host metal.

          These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Even non-ideal NSAs have shown significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions. The ability to control and manipulate these properties through careful design of NSA composition and structure offers potential for tailoring catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells, hydrogenation reactions, or hydrogen storage and separation.

          Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural effects is essential for rational catalyst design, as it allows researchers to predict and control the surface composition and properties of bimetallic catalysts under relevant reaction conditions, potentially leading to improved performance in various catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This influence has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electrocatalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing efficient and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.
2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.
3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the extent of surface segregation in Pt-based alloys. The addition of a third component can significantly alter surface segregation behavior. For instance, in Pt3Ni alloys, replacing Ni with certain transition metals (V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, Ir) enhances Pt surface segregation, while others (Ag, Au, Pd) can completely suppress it. The atomic size of the third component relative to Pt also plays a role, with smaller atoms better maintaining Pt surface segregation.

The resulting surface structures, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in specific layers, can significantly affect the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the catalyst. This allows for fine-tuning of catalyst properties through careful selection of alloying elements and synthesis conditions.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on surface segregation enables the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By optimizing surface composition and structure, it's possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Surface Stability:
   - Oxygen coverage plays a crucial role in catalyst stability.
   - Clean alloy surfaces are generally more stable than pure Pt due to d-band stabilization.
   - High oxygen coverage reverses this trend, making alloys less stable than Pt.
   - Maintaining low or zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (e.g., 0.9 V) is crucial for both high activity and stability.

2. Surface Segregation:
   - Alloying stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution on clean surfaces.
   - Oxygen presence facilitates Pt removal by stabilizing surface vacancies.

3. Structural Configuration:
   - The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and oxygen coverage.
   - Precovered oxygen atoms near adsorbed O2 and OOH transition states affect catalyst performance.

4. Catalytic Properties and Performance:
   - Lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) is necessary for stable ORR catalysts.
   - The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change under reaction conditions.
   - Optimizing the ratio of Pt to alloying elements is crucial for balancing stability and activity.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, surface structure, and reaction environment in determining bimetallic catalyst performance. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for designing improved catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Cu alloys. The key findings and implications are:

1. Clean surface preference: Without adsorbates, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, with Cu diffusion to the surface being endothermic.

2. CO-induced surface restructuring: Contrary to typical expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induces surface segregation of the less reactive Cu, pulling it to the surface of the CuPt near-surface alloy.

3. Driving force for restructuring: The Cu surface segregation is driven by a drastic increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. This increase more than compensates for the endothermic nature of Cu diffusion to the surface.

4. Stable configuration: Under CO adsorption, the most stable configuration becomes 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites, forming a novel, well-ordered CuPt surface alloy.

5. Temperature dependence: The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant around 460 K, coinciding with the formation and breakup of the CO-induced surface alloy.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Dynamic surface changes: The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically under reaction conditions, affecting activity and selectivity.

2. Novel surface structures: Adsorbate-induced surface segregation can lead to unexpected surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. Tunable electronic structure: The formation of isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu in the surface layer can alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity.

4. Design implications: These results demonstrate the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing and studying bimetallic catalysts, as the actual active surface structure may differ significantly from the initial or expected configuration.

5. Broader applicability: The findings suggest potential applications in other coinage metal/Pt-group bimetallic systems, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

The literature suggests that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The study focuses on the oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt3dPt(111) and Pt3dPt(100) bimetallic structures, indicating that the crystal plane orientation plays a crucial role in determining the stability of subsurface 3d metals in the presence of oxygen.

          The research investigates the stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures when exposed to oxygen, which implies that reaction conditions involving oxygen can affect the structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, the study examines the effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability, suggesting that the specific arrangement of atoms at the surface influences the overall stability and potential for surface segregation in these Pt-based systems.

          These factors have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys in various applications. The stability and surface composition of bimetallic catalysts directly affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. By understanding how thermodynamics and reaction conditions influence the structural configuration of these materials, researchers can better predict and optimize their performance in specific applications, such as fuel cells or other catalytic processes involving oxygen.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play a crucial role in determining their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Bimetallic catalysts exhibit more complex surface structures compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in different states (metallic or oxidized) and locations (surface, near-surface, or bulk). This structural complexity contributes to their superior catalytic performance.

In Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region leads to enhanced catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This demonstrates the critical role of surface structure in determining catalytic properties.

The structure of bimetallic catalysts is not static but can change dynamically during reactions. Environmental conditions, such as changes between reductive and oxidative atmospheres, can induce reversible surface processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion.

Using FePt(111) systems as an example, it has been shown that the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

The ability to control and manipulate the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts through thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions has significant implications for optimizing their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. This tunability offers opportunities for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for specific reactions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. This preference is often observed in fuel cell applications where Pt3d alloys are covered by a Pt skin.

The stability and surface segregation of these bimetallic catalysts are highly dependent on the presence and nature of adsorbates. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen, sulfur, selenium, or carbon have minimal impact on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. However, strongly binding adsorbates such as nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the stability of surface structures.

The segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the final structure. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to admetal segregation to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

The presence of atomic oxygen can reverse the thermodynamic stability, making the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more stable than the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structure. This oxygen-induced surface segregation demonstrates how reaction conditions can dramatically influence the structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure can profoundly affect the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems. The dynamic nature of these surfaces under reaction conditions highlights the importance of considering the specific reaction environment when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the effects of reaction conditions is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of catalyst behavior under various reaction environments, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance and efficiency in applications such as fuel cells and other catalytic processes.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. Under vacuum or reducing conditions, 3d transition metals (TMs) prefer to stay in the subsurface of Pt(111), as this configuration is energetically more favorable. However, in oxidizing environments, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d TMs induces segregation of 3d TMs from the subsurface to the surface.

The presence of oxygen can cause further clustering and agglomeration of segregated 3d TM atoms in the surface layer to maximize O-3d TM coordination. At elevated temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, segregated 3d TMs may be further oxidized into complex oxide thin films or three-dimensional oxide islands on Pt surfaces.

These structural changes have profound implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. In CO oxidation, catalysts with atomically dispersed 3d TMs in the Pt surface layer show high activity through a bi-functional mechanism.
2. When oxidized 3d TM islands form on the Pt surface, the activity becomes limited by oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or edges of oxidized 3d TM islands becomes crucial for catalytic performance.
3. The structural response and evolution of alloy catalysts under oxidizing conditions significantly affect catalytic reactions in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under different reaction conditions and underscore the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure and composition for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications. The ability of these catalysts to adapt their structure in response to the reaction environment offers opportunities for designing smart catalysts with tunable properties, but also presents challenges in maintaining desired configurations under operating conditions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition, affecting their catalytic properties and performance.

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (e.g., H2 atmosphere), there is a thermodynamic preference for Pt to segregate to the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles. This is primarily driven by Pt's larger atomic radius compared to 3d transition metals, which helps minimize strain energy at the surface. This results in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer or "Pt-skin" structure.

In oxidizing conditions (e.g., O2 atmosphere), the situation reverses. The 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong affinity for oxygen. These metals then become oxidized, forming a layer of metal oxide (e.g., NiO) that encapsulates the Pt-rich core. This encapsulation is driven by the lower surface energy of the metal oxides compared to Pt and strong metal-oxide interactions.

These structural changes are reversible and can occur cyclically as the reaction environment alternates between reducing and oxidizing conditions. The mass transport processes active in oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases.

This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition and active sites can change during reactions, potentially altering catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. The formation of Pt-skin structures in reducing environments can enhance certain catalytic reactions that prefer Pt-rich surfaces.
3. In oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals and oxide formation can create unique catalytic environments, potentially enhancing activity or selectivity for certain reactions.
4. The reversible nature of these changes allows for potential in-situ tuning of catalyst properties by manipulating reaction conditions.
5. Long-term catalyst stability and performance may be affected by repeated structural changes in cyclic oxidation-reduction processes.

Understanding and controlling these dynamic processes is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, catalytic reforming, and emission control systems. It also highlights the importance of evaluating catalyst performance under realistic operating conditions, as the structure observed ex-situ may not reflect the active state of the catalyst.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures promote stronger Fe-Pt interactions, favoring layer growth and alloying. For example, Fe forms layer-like structures on Pt(111) at 487 K.

2. Annealing conditions: Vacuum annealing at high temperatures induces inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt subsurface, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)).

3. Oxidative environments: High-temperature annealing in oxygen causes outward diffusion of Fe, forming FeO surface structures on Pt(111).

4. Reductive environments: Strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures can produce Pt-skin structures from Fe/Pt(111) surfaces.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition control: The ability to manipulate surface composition through temperature and gas environment allows for tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Electronic effects: Subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

3. Reversible modulation: The ability to switch between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) structures allows for fine-tuning of catalyst surface properties for specific applications.

4. Enhanced activity: Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt surface showed 25 times the ORR activity of pure Pt catalysts.

5. Stability considerations: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions highlights the importance of considering catalyst stability under reaction environments.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural transformations is crucial for rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance and stability for various catalytic applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is primarily determined by surface energy and atomic size. Atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies tend to segregate to the surface. In Pt-3d alloys, this typically results in Pt segregation to the surface due to its larger atomic radius compared to 3d metals.

However, the presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can dramatically alter the surface composition and segregation trends. Oxygen adsorption can decrease the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces and even reverse the segregation trend in Pt3M alloys. At 1/4 monolayer oxygen coverage, both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces become less stable than the non-segregated surface for Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys.

The segregation energy under adsorption conditions can be expressed as the sum of the vacuum segregation energy and the difference in adsorption energies between segregated and non-segregated structures. This relationship helps explain why certain surface compositions become more or less favorable under different environmental conditions.

These changes in surface composition and structure have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface geometry and electronic structure, which are critical for catalytic activity, are directly influenced by the surface composition. For example, in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-based alloys with 3d metals have shown enhanced catalytic activities compared to pure Pt, with surface segregation playing a crucial role in this improvement.

The influence of surface segregation on catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of metal atoms, and reaction mechanisms. Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena under different reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where Pt-based alloys are widely used as cathode catalysts for ORR.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Surface energy differences: Metals with lower surface energies (like Pt and Pd) tend to segregate to the surface when alloyed with higher surface energy metals (like Ru).

2. Atomic size mismatch: Larger guest atoms (Pt, Pd) in a host lattice of smaller atoms (Ru) experience tensile stress, favoring their segregation to the surface.

3. Segregation energies: DFT calculations show significant segregation energies for Pt (0.8 eV) and Pd (1.0 eV) in Ru(0001), providing a strong driving force for surface segregation.

4. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote surface segregation but may also lead to bulk dissolution due to entropic effects.

These factors result in the formation of stable surface alloy configurations that are metastable only towards bulk dissolution. The implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Enhanced stability: The thermodynamic preference for surface segregation helps maintain the desired surface composition during catalytic reactions.

2. Tunable surface properties: By controlling composition and preparation conditions, the surface structure and composition can be tailored for specific catalytic applications.

3. Synergistic effects: The combination of different metals in the surface layer can lead to unique electronic and geometric properties, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Long-term performance: Understanding and controlling segregation behavior can help design catalysts with improved long-term stability and activity.

These insights provide a foundation for rational catalyst design and optimization for various applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical reactions, and heterogeneous catalysis.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

          1. Oxidation state and surface composition: Sn in Pt-Sn alloys can partially oxidize under certain conditions, creating a mixed catalyst system with both alloy and oxide phases. This affects surface composition and reactivity.
          
          2. Structural configuration: The structure changes with oxidation, forming reduced tin oxide layers (SnOx) at the interface with Pt. The degree of oxidation depends on reaction conditions, with different tin oxide species (e.g., Sn1.5O, SnO1.5) forming at different temperatures and exposures.
          
          3. Support effects: In supported catalysts, the oxide support material (e.g., alumina) influences the phases present and their relative concentrations, which are also affected by particle size.
          
          4. Surface reactivity: Alloying Sn with Pt reduces surface reactivity, changing adsorption behavior of molecules like NO2 and influencing decomposition pathways.
          
          5. Catalytic properties: These structural and compositional changes significantly affect catalytic performance. Pt-Sn catalysts show improved resistance to coking and increased selectivity towards aromatics in reforming reactions compared to pure Pt catalysts.
          
          6. Temperature dependence: Reaction temperature influences the oxidation state of Sn and the resulting surface structure, affecting catalyst behavior.
          
          7. Stability and regeneration: The tendency of Sn to oxidize and potentially segregate to the surface under certain conditions may affect long-term catalyst stability and necessitate specific regeneration procedures.

          Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and designing catalysts for specific applications such as petroleum reforming or selective oxidation and reduction reactions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The catalytic activity of these alloys depends dramatically on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation phenomena.

In Pt-based systems like Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation is commonly observed. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This variation in segregation behavior can significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these materials.

The study investigates surface segregation on stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by oxygen adsorption. In core-shell structures, segregation involves exchanges between Pt atoms in the first layer and core atoms in the second layer. For Pt3M alloys, segregation occurs through exchanges between M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer.

These factors collectively influence the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to control and predict surface segregation and structural changes under reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in fuel cells and other catalytic applications. Understanding and controlling these phenomena are essential for designing more efficient and stable catalysts, as they affect the availability of active sites, electronic structure, and overall reactivity of the catalyst surface.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Au alloys. Key findings include:

1. Thermodynamic preference: In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: Reaction conditions, particularly CO adsorption, can alter the thermodynamically preferred configuration. CO promotes Pt diffusion to the cluster surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for clusters with initially pure Au surfaces.

3. Structural impact on catalytic properties: The surface composition directly affects catalytic performance. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. Clusters with 100% Au surfaces cannot catalyze this reaction due to the lack of Pt ensembles at the surface.

4. Implications for catalyst design: The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions means their active surface composition may differ significantly from the as-prepared state. This can lead to unexpected catalytic behaviors and highlights the need to consider in-situ restructuring when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts.

5. Balance between stability and activity: While a Pt core-Au shell structure may be thermodynamically favored, it may not provide the optimal surface for certain reactions. The balance between thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity needs careful management.

6. Reaction-specific design considerations: The structural requirements for specific reactions (e.g., need for contiguous Pt sites for O2 dissociation) should guide the design of bimetallic catalysts to ensure the presence of necessary active site ensembles.

Understanding these factors is crucial for designing efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the surface composition and structure directly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Electronic structure modification: The formation of Pt-alloy systems alters the surface electronic properties of Pt, which in turn changes its reactivity. This is due to the formation of surface metal-metal bonds, shifts in core energy levels, and charge transfer between the Pt monolayer and the substrate.

2. Catalytic activity enhancement: Pt-alloy systems, such as Pt3M (where M is a 3d transition metal), have shown improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of Pt surface electronic and chemical properties.

3. Activity-structure correlation: The specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals (e.g., Ni to Ti) shows a volcano-shaped dependence. This relationship is explained by variations in oxygen chemisorption energy, which correlates with changes in surface electronic structure.

4. Density of states and d-band properties: The catalytic properties of bimetallic systems are influenced by changes in the density of states near the Fermi level, as well as alterations in d-band occupancy and electronegativity.

5. Strain and interfacial effects: Both lattice strain and interfacial interactions play crucial roles in determining the properties of bimetallic systems. Systems with small lattice mismatches between components are particularly interesting for studying these effects.

These factors collectively determine the stability, surface composition, and structural arrangement of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Understanding and controlling these aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in applications such as fuel cells, where enhanced ORR activity and reduced Pt content are desirable outcomes.
