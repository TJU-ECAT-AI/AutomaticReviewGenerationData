          [1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures"

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

[4] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[5] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-3d alloys such as Pt-Fe systems:

1. Thermodynamic stability: While the thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, preparation methods like sputtering at room temperature can produce metastable structures with face-centered cubic arrangements across various compositions.

2. Surface segregation: Under electrochemical conditions, even mild ones, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a pure Pt skin layer. This surface segregation occurs despite the bulk composition remaining unchanged, as evidenced by EDX measurements.

3. Structural configuration: The Pt skin layer formed on the alloy surface is very thin, approximately 1 nm thick. This thin nature is crucial for maintaining the enhanced catalytic properties of the alloy.

4. Electronic effects: The thin Pt skin allows the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms to be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, leading to significant enhancement of catalytic activity. As the skin layer thickens, this modification diminishes, potentially explaining controversial enhancement effects reported in various studies.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Despite the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer, Pt-Fe alloys exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction compared to pure Pt.

2. Thickness-dependent performance: The catalytic enhancement is highly dependent on the thickness of the Pt skin layer. Optimal performance is achieved when the layer is thin enough to allow electronic modification by the underlying alloy.

3. Stability considerations: While surface segregation occurs, the stability of the bulk composition suggests these catalysts may maintain their performance over time. However, long-term stability studies would be needed to confirm this.

4. Preparation method importance: The method of catalyst preparation can override thermodynamic preferences, allowing for the creation of metastable structures with potentially unique catalytic properties.

Overall, the interplay between surface and bulk properties in these bimetallic systems creates a complex relationship between structure and catalytic performance, offering opportunities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金，如Pt-Fe系统）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型：

1. 热力学稳定性：虽然Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3，但室温下溅射等制备方法可以在各种成分中产生具有面心立方排列的亚稳定结构。

2. 表面偏析：在电化学条件下，即使是温和条件，Pt也倾向于偏析到表面，形成纯Pt皮层。尽管体相成分保持不变（通过EDX测量证实），这种表面偏析仍然发生。

3. 结构构型：在合金表面形成的Pt皮层非常薄，大约1纳米厚。这种薄性质对于维持合金的增强催化性能至关重要。

4. 电子效应：薄的Pt皮层允许表面Pt原子的电子结构被下层的体相合金修饰，导致催化活性显著增强。随着皮层变厚，这种修饰效应减弱，这可能解释了各种研究中报道的有争议的增强效应。

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 增强的催化活性：尽管形成了富Pt表面层，Pt-Fe合金相比纯Pt仍表现出显著提高的催化活性，如对氧还原反应。

2. 厚度依赖的性能：催化增强效果高度依赖于Pt皮层的厚度。当层足够薄以允许底层合金进行电子修饰时，可以达到最佳性能。

3. 稳定性考虑：虽然发生表面偏析，但体相成分的稳定性表明这些催化剂可能会随时间保持其性能。然而，需要进行长期稳定性研究来确认这一点。

4. 制备方法的重要性：催化剂制备方法可以超越热力学偏好，允许创造具有潜在独特催化性能的亚稳定结构。

总的来说，这些双金属系统中表面和体相性质之间的相互作用创造了结构和催化性能之间的复杂关系，为各种应用中的催化剂设计和优化提供了机会。
