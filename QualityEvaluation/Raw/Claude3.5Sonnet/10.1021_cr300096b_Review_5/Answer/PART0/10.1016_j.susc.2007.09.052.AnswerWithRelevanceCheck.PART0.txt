          [1] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."

[2] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals"

[3] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR"

[4] "It should be noted that surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates. In some cases, these factors could be important"

[5] "Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tends to segregate to the surface."

[6] "We infer that surface segregation is governed not only by the atomic size mismatch and the surface energy difference but also by the subsurface atomic arrangement."

[7] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry"

[8] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst"

[9] "Recent studies revealed that surface segregation can improve the catalytic performance of the alloys. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found the following order of ORR activities for the (1 1 1) surface: Pt-skin > Pt3M (M = Ni, Co) > Pt"

[10] "The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems."

[11] "Pt segregation is found to be correlated with the subsurface atomic structure, the size of metal atoms and the surface energy."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The main factors affecting surface segregation include:

1. Surface energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface.
2. Atomic size: Larger atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface to relieve strain.
3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote segregation.
4. Presence of adsorbates: Certain adsorbates can alter the segregation behavior.
5. Subsurface atomic arrangement: The structure beneath the surface layer can influence segregation.

These factors combine to determine the final surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst. In Pt-based alloys, Pt often segregates to the surface due to its larger atomic size compared to many 3d transition metals.

The resulting surface segregation has important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: Surface segregation can lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). For example, Pt-skin structures formed by segregation on Pt3M alloys (where M is Ni or Co) show enhanced catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
2. Formation of "Pt-skin" structures: In some Pt-3d alloys, a Pt-rich surface layer forms, which can exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
3. Modified electronic structure: Surface segregation alters the d-band structure of the catalyst, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.
4. Tailored catalytic properties: By controlling surface segregation, it's possible to optimize catalyst performance for specific reactions.
5. Improved stability: In some cases, surface segregation can lead to more stable catalyst structures under reaction conditions.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, including fuel cells, electrocatalysis, and other heterogeneous catalytic processes.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。影响表面偏析的主要因素包括：

1. 表面能：表面能较低的元素倾向于偏析到表面。
2. 原子尺寸：较大的原子更可能偏析到表面以缓解应力。
3. 温度：较高的温度可以促进偏析。
4. 吸附物的存在：某些吸附物可以改变偏析行为。
5. 亚表面原子排列：表面层下方的结构可以影响偏析。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂的最终表面组成和结构。在基于Pt的合金中，由于Pt相比许多3d过渡金属具有较大的原子尺寸，Pt常常偏析到表面。

由此产生的表面偏析对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 增强的催化活性：表面偏析可以导致催化性能的提高，特别是对于氧还原反应（ORR）。例如，由Pt3M合金（其中M为Ni或Co）偏析形成的Pt-皮层表面显示出比体相合金和纯Pt更高的催化活性。
2. 形成"Pt皮层"结构：在某些Pt-3d合金中，会形成富Pt的表面层，其催化活性可能优于块体合金和纯Pt。
3. 改变的电子结构：表面偏析改变了催化剂的d带结构，影响其与反应物和中间体的相互作用。
4. 定制的催化性能：通过控制表面偏析，可以优化催化剂性能以适应特定反应。
5. 改善的稳定性：在某些情况下，表面偏析可以在反应条件下形成更稳定的催化剂结构。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于设计更高效、更稳定的催化剂至关重要，这些催化剂可应用于燃料电池、电催化和其他多相催化过程等多种场合。
