          [1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[5] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."

[6] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

[7] "To understand why Pt2Mo has a lower barrier, we first examined the optimized structure for O2adsorption, and the OOH dissociation TS on Pt2Mo and on Pt, as shown in Fig. 4. The key structural parameters are labelled. These identified structures are similar except that there are precovered O atoms near to the adsorbed O2 and OOH TS on Pt."

[8] "We show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Surface Stability:
   - Oxygen coverage plays a crucial role in catalyst stability.
   - Clean alloy surfaces are generally more stable than pure Pt due to d-band stabilization.
   - High oxygen coverage reverses this trend, making alloys less stable than Pt.
   - Maintaining low or zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (e.g., 0.9 V) is crucial for both high activity and stability.

2. Surface Segregation:
   - Alloying stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution on clean surfaces.
   - Oxygen presence facilitates Pt removal by stabilizing surface vacancies.

3. Structural Configuration:
   - The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and oxygen coverage.
   - Precovered oxygen atoms near adsorbed O2 and OOH transition states affect catalyst performance.

4. Catalytic Properties and Performance:
   - Lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) is necessary for stable ORR catalysts.
   - The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change under reaction conditions.
   - Optimizing the ratio of Pt to alloying elements is crucial for balancing stability and activity.

These findings highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, surface structure, and reaction environment in determining bimetallic catalyst performance. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for designing improved catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。主要发现包括：

1. 表面稳定性：
   - 氧覆盖度在催化剂稳定性中起关键作用。
   - 由于d带稳定化，清洁合金表面通常比纯Pt更稳定。
   - 高氧覆盖度逆转了这一趋势，使合金比Pt更不稳定。
   - 在工作电位（如0.9 V）保持低或零氧覆盖度对于同时实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。

2. 表面偏析：
   - 合金化稳定了Pt的d带，使表面Pt原子在清洁表面上更能抵抗偏析或溶解。
   - 氧的存在通过稳定表面空位促进了Pt的移除。

3. 结构构型：
   - 合金的稳定性对合金元素和氧覆盖度都很敏感。
   - 吸附O2和OOH过渡态附近的预覆盖氧原子影响催化剂性能。

4. 催化性能：
   - 在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下保持较低的氧覆盖度对稳定的ORR催化剂至关重要。
   - 催化剂表面的组成和结构可能在反应条件下发生变化。
   - 优化Pt与合金元素的比例对平衡稳定性和活性至关重要。

这些发现强调了催化剂组成、表面结构和反应环境之间在决定双金属催化剂性能方面的复杂相互作用。理解和控制这些因素对于设计改进的催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池技术领域。
