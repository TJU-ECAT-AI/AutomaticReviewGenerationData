          [1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "For T850 K, these morphological changes are accompanied by exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms, that is, the onset of surface alloy formation."

[4] "The onset of surface alloy formation at the descending edges of vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films was observed after annealing to 850 K, while surface alloy formation is completed after annealing to 1300 K."

[5] "The surface confinement of the alloy layer is largely due to a higher energy barrier for diffusion of Pt into the bulk than for intermixing in the outermost layer."

[6] "On the atomic scale, this means that Pt and Ru atoms in the outermost layer prefer to be supported on Ru3 sites rather than on Ru2Pt, RuPt2, or Pt3 sites. This can be rationalized by the stronger binding to Ru compared to Pt, which in a simplified picture means an increase of the pairwise bond strength in the order PtPt, PtRu, RuRu."

[7] "The modified chemical and catalytic properties of bimetallic (catalyst) surfaces are mostly discussed in terms of a few fundamental concepts, namely the geometric ensemble effect, the electronic ligand effect and the electronic strain effect."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The key factors and their implications for catalytic properties and performance include:

1. Temperature: It plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and distribution of components. For Pt-Ru systems, increasing temperature leads to various structural configurations, from Pt islands at room temperature to surface alloy formation at higher temperatures (850 K - 1300 K).

2. Energy barriers for diffusion: A higher energy barrier for Pt diffusion into the bulk compared to surface intermixing promotes surface alloy formation and confinement.

3. Binding strength preferences: Atoms tend to be supported on sites that offer stronger binding. In Pt-Ru systems, the preference follows the order Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3.

4. Pairwise bond strengths: These affect stability, with RuRu > PtRu > PtPt in Pt-Ru systems.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. They affect the availability and nature of active sites on the catalyst surface.
2. Surface confinement of the alloy layer can maintain a high concentration of active components.
3. Preferential binding arrangements can create specific ensemble effects influencing catalytic activity and selectivity.
4. The variation in bond strengths affects catalyst stability under reaction conditions.

The catalytic properties are further influenced by geometric ensemble effects, electronic ligand effects, and electronic strain effects. Understanding and controlling these factors allows for tuning bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, optimizing their catalytic performance and stability.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。关键因素及其对催化性能的影响包括：

1. 温度：对表面结构和成分分布起着关键作用。对于Pt-Ru系统，温度升高导致从室温下的Pt岛状结构到高温（850 K - 1300 K）下的表面合金形成等各种结构构型。

2. 扩散能垒：与表面混合相比，Pt向体相扩散的能垒较高，这促进了表面合金的形成和局限性。

3. 结合强度偏好：原子倾向于支持在提供更强结合的位点上。在Pt-Ru系统中，偏好遵循Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3的顺序。

4. 成对键强度：这影响稳定性，在Pt-Ru系统中，RuRu > PtRu > PtPt。

这些因素对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 它们影响催化剂表面活性位点的可用性和性质。
2. 合金层的表面局限性可以维持高浓度的活性组分。
3. 优先结合排列可以创造影响催化活性和选择性的特定集合效应。
4. 键强度的变化影响催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。

催化性能进一步受到几何集合效应、电子配体效应和电子应变效应的影响。理解和控制这些因素允许针对特定应用调整双金属催化剂，优化其催化性能和稳定性。
