          [1] "Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys."

[2] "The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species."

[3] "Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption."

[4] "However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases."

[5] "Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties."

[6] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."

[7] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

[8] "The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation: Pt tends to segregate to the surface in Pt-3d alloys, forming a Pt-skin layer. This segregation alters the order of oxygen adsorption strength among different alloys, with Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for Pt-segregated systems, which is the reverse of nonsegregated Pt3M alloys.

2. Adsorption properties: The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters surface adsorption properties. These properties are primarily determined by two factors: surface geometry (strain effects) and electronic structure (effects due to the change of metal species).

3. Stability: While both pure Pt and Pt-skin surfaces show decreased stability with oxygen adsorption compared to clean Pt surfaces, Pt-skin surfaces from alloys demonstrate enhanced stability under oxygen adsorption conditions. The potential shifts are higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni compared to pure Pt, indicating better stability against dissolution.

4. Structural effects: The interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little during oxygen adsorption, while the Pt/M-O bond length can be used to measure binding strength in most cases.

5. Role of 3d metals: In nonsegregated surfaces, 3d metal atoms directly participate in oxygen adsorption, enhancing adsorption strength. However, on Pt-segregated surfaces, they weaken oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and electronic effects.

6. Subsurface effects: The 3d subsurface atoms play a protective role by strongly binding to the Pt surface layer, contributing to the overall stability of the catalyst. The degree of stability enhancement is inversely related to the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance, allowing for the design of tailored catalysts with optimized stability, reactivity, and durability for specific applications such as fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素对其催化性能和应用表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析：Pt倾向于在Pt-3d合金中偏析到表面，形成Pt-皮层。这种偏析改变了不同合金之间氧气吸附强度的顺序，对于Pt偏析系统，顺序为Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111)，这与非偏析Pt3M合金的顺序相反。

2. 吸附性质：将3d金属引入Pt(111)系统会显著改变表面吸附性质。这些性质主要由两个因素决定：表面几何结构（应变效应）和电子结构（金属种类变化引起的效应）。

3. 稳定性：虽然纯Pt和Pt-皮层表面在氧气吸附下与洁净Pt表面相比稳定性降低，但合金的Pt-皮层表面在氧气吸附条件下表现出增强的稳定性。Pt3Fe、Pt3Co和Pt3Ni的电位偏移比纯Pt高，表明它们对溶解的稳定性更好。

4. 结构效应：在氧气吸附过程中，顶部两层的层间距变化很小，而Pt/M-O键长通常可以用来衡量结合强度。

5. 3d金属的作用：在非偏析表面上，3d金属原子直接参与氧气吸附，增强吸附强度。然而，在Pt偏析表面上，由于表面应变和电子效应，它们削弱了氧气吸附。

6. 亚表面效应：3d亚表面原子通过与Pt表面层的强结合起到保护作用，有助于催化剂的整体稳定性。稳定性增强的程度与所研究合金的氧气吸附强度呈反比。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响，允许设计定制催化剂，为特定应用（如燃料电池和其他电化学过程）优化稳定性、反应活性和耐久性。
