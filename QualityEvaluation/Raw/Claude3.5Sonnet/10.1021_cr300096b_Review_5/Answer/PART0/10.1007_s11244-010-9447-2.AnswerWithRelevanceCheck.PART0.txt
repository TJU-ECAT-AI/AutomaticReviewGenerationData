          [1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]."

[4] "This follows the same trend predicted by DFT that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet, as shown earlier in Fig. 2."

[5] "This highlights one of the added degradation mechanisms for bimetallic alloys, the adsorbate-induced restructuring of the alloy metals near the surface, which has been predicted and demonstrated to occur for a number of bimetallic systems [720]."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key findings include:

1. Environmental effects: In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred. However, with adsorbed oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes more stable.

2. Crystal facet effects: The stability of configurations varies with crystal facets. For example, the subsurface PtNiPt configuration is more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

3. Catalytic performance: The subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems shows increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding of oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

4. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: This phenomenon represents a significant degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys, affecting their long-term stability and performance.

5. Verification: DFT predictions have been experimentally verified, confirming the segregation behavior and allowing quantification of activation barriers for adsorbate-induced segregation.

These factors have important implications for catalyst design, performance, and longevity in various applications, emphasizing the need to consider the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。主要发现包括：

1. 环境影响：在真空和吸附氢的条件下，亚表面PtMPt(111)构型在热力学上是优选的。然而，在吸附氧的情况下，表面MPtPt(111)构型变得更稳定。

2. 晶面效应：构型的稳定性随晶面而变。例如，亚表面PtNiPt构型在(100)晶面上比在(111)晶面上更稳定。

3. 催化性能：PtNi、PtCo和PtFe系统中的亚表面Pt3dPt(111)构型在燃料电池中表现出对氧还原反应(ORR)的活性增加，这是由于与纯Pt(111)相比，氧和羟基的结合更弱。

4. 吸附物诱导的重构：这种现象代表了双金属合金的一个重要降解机制，影响它们的长期稳定性和性能。

5. 验证：DFT预测已经通过实验得到验证，确认了偏析行为，并允许量化吸附物诱导偏析的活化能。

这些因素对催化剂设计、性能和在各种应用中的寿命有重要影响，强调了在反应条件下考虑双金属催化剂动态性质的必要性。
