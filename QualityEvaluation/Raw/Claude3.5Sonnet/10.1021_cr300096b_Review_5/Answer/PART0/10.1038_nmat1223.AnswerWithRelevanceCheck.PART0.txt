          [1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

          [2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."

          [3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

          [4] "Migration of solute atoms deeper into these subsurface alloys does reduce the calculated decrease in BEH compared with the pure host, but the decrease is still significant"

          [5] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11). However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects.

          Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This approach helps predict whether hydrogen-induced segregation will occur under specific conditions.

          In real NSAs, deviations from idealized models may occur. For example, some solute atoms in subsurface alloys might segregate deeper into the host metal. While these deviations don't substantially alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior, they can have quantitative effects on adsorbate properties and reduce the calculated decrease in hydrogen binding energy (BEH) compared to the pure host metal.

          These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Even non-ideal NSAs have shown significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions. The ability to control and manipulate these properties through careful design of NSA composition and structure offers potential for tailoring catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells, hydrogenation reactions, or hydrogen storage and separation.

          Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural effects is essential for rational catalyst design, as it allows researchers to predict and control the surface composition and properties of bimetallic catalysts under relevant reaction conditions, potentially leading to improved performance in various catalytic processes.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以铂为基础的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。近表面合金（NSAs）的稳定性可以通过一个考虑真空组成和氢吸附效应的两步过程来评估。

          表面偏析趋势可以通过比较溶质的偏析能与纯溶质和纯主体金属之间的氢结合能差来估计。这种方法有助于预测在特定条件下是否会发生氢诱导偏析。

          在实际的NSAs中，可能会出现与理想模型的偏差。例如，亚表面合金中的一些溶质原子可能会更深地偏析到主体金属中。虽然这些偏差通常不会显著改变吸附剂行为的主要趋势，但它们可能对吸附剂性质产生定量影响，并减少与纯主体金属相比计算得到的氢结合能（BEH）降低程度。

          这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响。即使是非理想的NSAs也已经显示出与理论预测一致的显著改变的催化活性。通过精心设计NSA的组成和结构来控制和操纵这些性质，为针对特定应用（如燃料电池、加氢反应或氢存储和分离）定制催化剂提供了潜力。

          理解这些热力学偏好和结构效应对于理性催化剂设计至关重要，因为它允许研究人员在相关反应条件下预测和控制双金属催化剂的表面组成和性质，潜在地可以在各种催化过程中提高性能。
