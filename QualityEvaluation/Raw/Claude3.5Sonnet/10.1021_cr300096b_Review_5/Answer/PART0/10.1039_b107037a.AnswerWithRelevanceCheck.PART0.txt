          [1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

[6] "After a further 8 min, Fig. 2D, an expanded image shown in Fig. 2E was acquired in which well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structure are observed."

          The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys like PtFe, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by electrochemical potential cycling, which promotes Fe dissolution and Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through this selective dissolution process has important implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits improved CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, the Pt skin layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. Over time, the surface morphology evolves from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures. This reorganization process involves the formation of oriented crystalline steps and the appearance of terraces, which can significantly affect the catalytic properties of the surface.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface segregation and restructuring processes for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells. The resulting Pt-rich surface with specific crystallographic orientations has direct consequences for the catalyst's performance in electrochemical applications, where CO tolerance and stability are critical factors.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-3d合金如PtFe）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成具有改变了的电子结构的富Pt表面层。这一过程是由电化学电位循环驱动的，促进了Fe的溶解和表面Pt原子的重排。

通过这种选择性溶解过程形成的Pt皮层对催化性能有重要影响。表面层的改变后的电子结构表现出对H2氧化和O2还原反应的改进的CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有益。此外，Pt皮层保护了下层的PtFe合金免受进一步腐蚀，提高了催化剂的整体稳定性。

表面的结构重构不仅限于成分变化。随着时间的推移，表面形态从粗糙的花菜状结构演变为具有台阶-平台结构的有序(111)取向晶面。这个重组过程涉及有序晶体台阶的形成和平台的出现，这可能会显著影响表面的催化性能。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了理解表面偏析和重构过程对于优化各种应用（特别是燃料电池）中的催化性能的重要性。由此产生的具有特定晶体学取向的富Pt表面对催化剂在电化学应用中的性能有直接影响，其中CO耐受性和稳定性是关键因素。
