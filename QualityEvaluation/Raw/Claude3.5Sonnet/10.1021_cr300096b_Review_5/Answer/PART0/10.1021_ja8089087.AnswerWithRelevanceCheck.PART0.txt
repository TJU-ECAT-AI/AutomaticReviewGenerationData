          [1] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure. The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[2] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbate), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."

[3] "Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, (15) the observed drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity."

[4] "For the clean surfaces (no CO adsorbed), 2/3 ML of Cu in the second layer is the most stable, and Cu diffusion from the second to the first layer is generally endothermic by 0.30.4 eV. With 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed atop surface Pt, the situation is very different: Cu surface migration to generate 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer is now most favorable."

[5] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."

[6] "The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and this is also approximately where both the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Cu alloys. The key findings and implications are:

1. Clean surface preference: Without adsorbates, Cu prefers to remain in the subsurface layers of a CuPt near-surface alloy, with Cu diffusion to the surface being endothermic.

2. CO-induced surface restructuring: Contrary to typical expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induces surface segregation of the less reactive Cu, pulling it to the surface of the CuPt near-surface alloy.

3. Driving force for restructuring: The Cu surface segregation is driven by a drastic increase in CO binding energy when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. This increase more than compensates for the endothermic nature of Cu diffusion to the surface.

4. Stable configuration: Under CO adsorption, the most stable configuration becomes 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer with 1/3 ML of CO adsorbed on the remaining Pt sites, forming a novel, well-ordered CuPt surface alloy.

5. Temperature dependence: The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant around 460 K, coinciding with the formation and breakup of the CO-induced surface alloy.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Dynamic surface changes: The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically under reaction conditions, affecting activity and selectivity.

2. Novel surface structures: Adsorbate-induced surface segregation can lead to unexpected surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. Tunable electronic structure: The formation of isolated Pt sites surrounded by Cu in the surface layer can alter the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity.

4. Design implications: These results demonstrate the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing and studying bimetallic catalysts, as the actual active surface structure may differ significantly from the initial or expected configuration.

5. Broader applicability: The findings suggest potential applications in other coinage metal/Pt-group bimetallic systems, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in various applications.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Cu合金）中。主要发现和影响包括：

1. 清洁表面偏好：在没有吸附物的情况下，Cu倾向于保持在CuPt近表面合金的亚表面层中，Cu向表面扩散是吸热的。

2. CO诱导的表面重构：与典型预期相反，在高压和高温下CO吸附会诱导反应性较低的Cu的表面偏析，将其拉到CuPt近表面合金的表面。

3. 重构的驱动力：Cu表面偏析是由Cu存在于Pt第一表面层时CO结合能的显著增加所驱动的。这种增加足以补偿Cu向表面扩散的吸热性质。

4. 稳定构型：在CO吸附条件下，最稳定的构型变为第一层有2/3 ML的Cu，剩余Pt位点上吸附1/3 ML的CO，形成一种新颖的、有序的CuPt表面合金。

5. 温度依赖性：Cu和Pt的相互扩散在460 K左右变得显著，这与CO诱导的表面合金的形成和分解相吻合。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 动态表面变化：催化剂表面的组成和结构可以在反应条件下动态变化，影响活性和选择性。

2. 新型表面结构：吸附物诱导的表面偏析可以导致意想不到的表面结构，可能具有增强的催化性能。

3. 可调电子结构：表面层中由Cu包围的孤立Pt位点的形成可以改变催化剂的反应活性和选择性。

4. 设计影响：这些结果表明，在设计和研究双金属催化剂时考虑反应条件的重要性，因为实际的活性表面结构可能与初始或预期的构型有显著差异。

5. 更广泛的适用性：这些发现暗示了在其他贵金属/铂族双金属系统中的潜在应用，为各种应用中的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。
