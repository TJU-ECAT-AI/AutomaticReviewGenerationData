          [1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Au alloys. Key findings include:

1. Thermodynamic preference: In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring: Reaction conditions, particularly CO adsorption, can alter the thermodynamically preferred configuration. CO promotes Pt diffusion to the cluster surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for clusters with initially pure Au surfaces.

3. Structural impact on catalytic properties: The surface composition directly affects catalytic performance. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. Clusters with 100% Au surfaces cannot catalyze this reaction due to the lack of Pt ensembles at the surface.

4. Implications for catalyst design: The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions means their active surface composition may differ significantly from the as-prepared state. This can lead to unexpected catalytic behaviors and highlights the need to consider in-situ restructuring when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts.

5. Balance between stability and activity: While a Pt core-Au shell structure may be thermodynamically favored, it may not provide the optimal surface for certain reactions. The balance between thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity needs careful management.

6. Reaction-specific design considerations: The structural requirements for specific reactions (e.g., need for contiguous Pt sites for O2 dissociation) should guide the design of bimetallic catalysts to ensure the presence of necessary active site ensembles.

Understanding these factors is crucial for designing efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the surface composition and structure directly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Au合金）中。主要发现包括：

1. 热力学偏好：在没有吸附质的情况下，热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构，这是由于Au的表面自由能较低。这导致在Pt组成为50%或更低时，簇的表面几乎是纯Au的。

2. 吸附质诱导的重构：反应条件，特别是CO吸附，可以改变热力学优选的构型。CO促进Pt向簇表面扩散，这是由形成强Pt-CO键驱动的。这种效应在初始表面为纯Au的簇上最为显著。

3. 结构对催化性能的影响：表面组成直接影响催化性能。对于CO氧化，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点。100%Au表面的簇无法催化这一反应，因为表面缺乏Pt集合。

4. 对催化剂设计的影响：双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性意味着它们的活性表面组成可能与制备状态有显著不同。这可能导致意外的催化行为，并突显了在设计和优化双金属催化剂时需要考虑原位重构的必要性。

5. 稳定性和活性之间的平衡：虽然Pt核-Au壳结构在热力学上可能是有利的，但它可能不会为某些反应提供最佳表面。需要仔细管理热力学稳定性和催化活性之间的平衡。

6. 特定反应的设计考虑：特定反应的结构要求（例如，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点）应该指导双金属催化剂的设计，以确保必要的活性位点集合的存在。

理解这些因素对设计各种应用的高效稳定的双金属催化剂至关重要，因为表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。
