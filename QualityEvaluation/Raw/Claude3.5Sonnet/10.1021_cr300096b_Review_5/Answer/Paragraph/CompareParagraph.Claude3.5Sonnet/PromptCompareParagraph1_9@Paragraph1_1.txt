3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt&ndash;3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffin&ndash;tin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the M&ndash;H&ndash;H surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the H&ndash;M&ndash;H subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200)
The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This review focuses on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, emphasizing the thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures under varying reaction conditions.

Key factors affecting bimetallic catalyst structure and performance include:

1. Surface Energy: Elements with lower surface energy tend to segregate to the surface. For instance, in Pt-Au alloys, Au tends to segregate to the surface due to its lower surface energy [10.1021/jp108939h].

2. Atomic Size: Larger atoms often segregate to the surface to relieve strain. Pt, with its larger atomic radius compared to many 3d transition metals, often segregates to the surface in Pt-3d alloys [10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086].

3. Adsorbate Effects: The presence of adsorbates can dramatically alter surface composition and segregation trends. For example, oxygen adsorption can decrease the stability of Pt-segregated surfaces and even reverse segregation trends in Pt3M alloys [10.1016/j.susc.2008.11.036].

4. Temperature: Higher temperatures generally promote surface segregation but can also lead to bulk dissolution due to entropic effects [10.1002/cphc.201001087].

5. Reaction Environment: Oxidizing and reducing conditions can significantly affect surface composition. In oxidizing environments, 3d transition metals often segregate to the surface and form oxides, while reducing conditions favor Pt surface segregation [10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086].

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Dynamic Surface Structure: The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically during reactions, affecting activity and selectivity [10.1002/cphc.200900053].

2. Electronic Effects: Subsurface atoms can modify the electronic structure of surface atoms, influencing adsorption and reaction characteristics. For instance, subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity [10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1].

3. Stability and Regeneration: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions affects long-term catalyst stability and may necessitate specific regeneration procedures [10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.030].

4. Tunable Properties: By controlling composition, preparation conditions, and reaction environment, it's possible to tailor surface structure and composition for specific catalytic applications [10.1002/cphc.201000391].

5. Enhanced Activity: Certain bimetallic configurations, such as Pt-skin structures with subsurface 3d metals, have shown significantly improved catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction compared to pure Pt [10.1016/s0022-0728(98)00361-1].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in bimetallic catalysts offers both challenges and opportunities for catalyst design and optimization. Future research directions may include:

1. In-situ characterization techniques: Developing advanced methods to study catalyst structure and composition under realistic reaction conditions could provide crucial insights into dynamic surface changes and their impact on catalytic performance.

2. Computational modeling: Enhancing predictive capabilities for surface segregation and restructuring phenomena could accelerate the design of more stable and efficient bimetallic catalysts.

3. Controlled synthesis strategies: Exploring novel preparation methods to create precisely tailored bimetallic structures with optimized surface compositions and configurations for specific reactions.

4. Smart catalysts: Designing catalysts that can adaptively restructure their surfaces in response to changing reaction conditions, potentially offering superior performance and longevity across a range of applications.

5. Multi-metallic systems: Expanding research into ternary or quaternary alloy systems might reveal synergistic effects that could further enhance catalytic properties beyond what is achievable with bimetallic catalysts.

By addressing these areas, researchers can work towards developing more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other important industrial processes, ultimately contributing to more sustainable chemical production methods.
