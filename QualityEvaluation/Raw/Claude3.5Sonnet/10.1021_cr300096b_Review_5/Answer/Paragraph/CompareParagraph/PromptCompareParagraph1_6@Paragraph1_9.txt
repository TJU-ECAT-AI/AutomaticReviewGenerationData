Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have crucial implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications, especially in propane dehydrogenation.

1. Surface Segregation and Structural Configuration:
In vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface of Pt-3d alloys due to its larger atomic radius and lower surface energy [10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052]. However, reaction conditions can dramatically alter this behavior. For instance, the presence of oxygen can induce segregation of 3d metals to the surface due to their strong interaction with oxygen [10.1016/j.cattod.2010.10.069]. This dynamic behavior leads to the formation of various structures such as Pt-skin surfaces, subsurface alloys, or oxide overlayers, depending on the specific conditions [10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1].

2. Adsorbate-Induced Restructuring:
The adsorption of reactants and intermediates can significantly influence surface composition and structure. For example, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can induce surface segregation of less reactive elements like Cu in CuPt alloys, contrary to typical expectations [10.1021/ja8089087]. This adsorbate-induced restructuring can lead to the formation of novel surface structures with potentially enhanced catalytic properties.

3. Electronic Effects and Catalytic Activity:
The surface segregation and structural changes in Pt-based alloys significantly affect their electronic properties, which in turn influence catalytic activity. For instance, Pt-skin structures with subsurface 3d metals have shown enhanced activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) due to modified d-band structure and weakened binding of oxygen intermediates [10.1021/jp8046888]. These electronic effects could also play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

4. Stability and Regeneration:
The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions poses challenges for long-term stability. Cyclic oxidation-reduction processes can lead to reversible structural changes, affecting catalyst performance over time [10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086]. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing effective regeneration strategies for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. Tailoring Catalyst Properties:
By carefully controlling alloy composition, preparation methods, and reaction conditions, it is possible to tailor the surface structure and composition of Pt-based catalysts for optimal performance in propane dehydrogenation. For example, the formation of specific surface ensembles or the tuning of electronic properties through alloying could enhance selectivity and activity for propane dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.susc.2008.09.019].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from studying the thermodynamic preferences and reaction-induced structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts offer significant opportunities for advancing propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Future research directions could focus on:

1. In-situ characterization techniques to study catalyst structure and composition under realistic propane dehydrogenation conditions.
2. Computational modeling to predict optimal alloy compositions and structures for enhanced activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.
3. Development of novel synthesis methods to create bimetallic catalysts with precise control over surface and near-surface composition.
4. Exploration of ternary or more complex alloy systems to further tune catalytic properties.
5. Investigation of support effects on the stability and activity of bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

By integrating these approaches, researchers can work towards designing more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, potentially leading to significant improvements in process economics and sustainability.

3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt&ndash;3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffin&ndash;tin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the M&ndash;H&ndash;H surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the H&ndash;M&ndash;H subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200)
The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.
