Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications, especially in propane dehydrogenation.

1. Surface Segregation:
In vacuum conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the surface due to its larger atomic size and lower surface energy compared to 3d metals [10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052]. However, the presence of adsorbates can dramatically alter this behavior. For instance, oxygen adsorption can induce segregation of 3d metals to the surface due to their strong interaction with oxygen [10.1016/j.cattod.2010.10.069]. This adsorbate-induced segregation is crucial for propane dehydrogenation catalysts, as it can expose more active sites or create unique surface structures.

2. Structural Configuration:
The structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is highly dynamic and responsive to reaction conditions. For example, in Pt-Fe systems, different surface structures (Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111)) can be formed by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature [10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1]. This structural flexibility allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning of catalyst properties during propane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Electronic Effects:
The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic structure of surface atoms, influencing their reactivity. In Pt-skin structures, subsurface 3d metals can modify the d-band center of surface Pt atoms, altering their binding strength with reactants and intermediates [10.1021/jp8046888]. This electronic modification is crucial for optimizing the activity and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

4. Stability and Deactivation:
The stability of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions is a critical factor for their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Adsorbate-induced restructuring can lead to catalyst deactivation over time [10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2]. Understanding and controlling these processes is essential for developing long-lasting catalysts.

5. Synergistic Effects:
The combination of Pt with 3d metals can create synergistic effects that enhance catalytic performance. For instance, Pt-Sn catalysts show improved resistance to coking and increased selectivity towards desired products in dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt catalysts [10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.030].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
The complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts offers both challenges and opportunities for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research could focus on:

1. In-situ characterization techniques to study surface restructuring under realistic reaction conditions, providing insights into the dynamic nature of these catalysts during propane dehydrogenation.

2. Developing "smart" catalysts that can adaptively restructure their surfaces to maintain optimal activity and selectivity throughout the reaction cycle.

3. Exploring novel ternary or quaternary alloy systems that can offer enhanced stability and performance by balancing surface segregation tendencies and electronic effects.

4. Utilizing advanced computational methods to predict and design bimetallic catalysts with optimal surface compositions and structures for propane dehydrogenation, considering both thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity.

5. Investigating the potential of controlled non-equilibrium states in bimetallic catalysts, where metastable surface structures might offer superior catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient, stable, and selective bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, contributing to the advancement of sustainable chemical production processes.

3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt&ndash;3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffin&ndash;tin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the M&ndash;H&ndash;H surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the H&ndash;M&ndash;H subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200)
The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.
