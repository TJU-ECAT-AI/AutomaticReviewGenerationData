Pt-based alloy systems have garnered significant attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique thermodynamic stability and structural dynamics under varying reaction conditions. These bimetallic surface structures offer enhanced catalytic performance compared to their monometallic counterparts, largely attributed to the synergistic effects between platinum and its alloying partners. The interplay between thermodynamic stability and structural dynamics plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic implications of these systems. Under different reaction environments, such as temperature fluctuations or gas-phase composition changes, the surface composition and morphology of Pt-based alloys can undergo significant transformations. These changes may involve phenomena like surface segregation, atom migration, or the formation of ordered structures, all of which directly impact the catalyst's active sites and, consequently, its overall catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the complex relationships between thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic performance is essential for designing more efficient and durable Pt-based alloy catalysts for various industrial applications, including fuel cells, emission control, and chemical synthesis.
