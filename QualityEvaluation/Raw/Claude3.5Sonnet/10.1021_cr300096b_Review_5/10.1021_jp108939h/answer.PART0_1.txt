[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu catalysts, bulk thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

However, reaction conditions can alter this configuration. CO adsorption promotes Pt diffusion to the surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for initially pure Au surfaces. DFT calculations confirm it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to migrate to the surface to bind CO.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties. For example, CO oxidation requires O2 dissociation at Pt sites, which needs multiple contiguous Pt atoms. On clusters with 100% Au surfaces, O2 dissociation cannot occur due to the low probability of Pt ensembles forming at the surface.

This demonstrates how the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can dramatically affect the surface composition and thus the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems. Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst design for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu催化剂,由于Au的表面自由能较低,整体热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构。这导致在Pt组成为50%或更低时,簇的表面几乎是纯Au的。

然而,反应条件可以改变这种构型。CO吸附促进Pt向表面扩散,这是由于形成了强Pt-CO键。这种效应在初始纯Au表面上最为明显。密度泛函理论计算证实,Pt迁移到表面与CO结合是热力学上有利的。

这些结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。例如,CO氧化需要在Pt位点上解离O2,这需要多个相邻的Pt原子。在100%Au表面的簇上,由于Pt原子集合在表面形成的概率很低,O2解离无法发生。

这表明热力学偏好和反应条件之间的相互作用可以显著影响双金属系统的表面组成,从而影响其催化性能。理解和控制这些因素对于优化特定应用的催化剂设计至关重要。
