[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt coreAu shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu catalysts, bulk thermodynamics predicts a Pt core-Au shell structure due to the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt. This leads to cluster surfaces consisting of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% or lower.

However, reaction conditions can alter this configuration. The adsorption of CO at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, especially for clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. This is because it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface to bind with CO.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. For example, in CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires multiple contiguous Pt sites. This reaction cannot occur on PtAu clusters with 100% Au surfaces before CO exposure, as there is a low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface.

Thus, the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can dramatically affect the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn determines their catalytic activity for specific reactions. This understanding is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu催化剂,由于Au的表面自由能低于Pt,体相热力学预测了Pt核-Au壳结构。这导致在Pt组成为50%或更低时,簇表面由几乎纯Au组成。

然而,反应条件可以改变这种构型。在室温下吸附CO会促进Pt向簇表面扩散,特别是对于最初表面为纯Au的簇。这是因为Pt扩散到簇表面与CO结合在热力学上是有利的。

这些结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。例如,在CO氧化中,O2解离需要多个相邻的Pt位点。在CO暴露之前,对于表面为100% Au的PtAu簇,由于表面形成Pt位点集合的概率较低,这种反应无法进行。

因此,热力学偏好和反应条件之间的相互作用可以显著影响双金属催化剂的表面组成,进而决定它们对特定反应的催化活性。这种理解对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。
