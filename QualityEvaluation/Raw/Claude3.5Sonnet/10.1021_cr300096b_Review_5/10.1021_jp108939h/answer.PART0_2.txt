[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt coreAu shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu catalysts:

1. In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy.

2. Reaction conditions involving CO adsorption can promote Pt diffusion to the surface, overcoming the thermodynamic preference for Au surface segregation.

3. The presence of CO makes it thermodynamically favorable for Pt to migrate to the surface to form strong Pt-CO bonds.

4. For CO oxidation, the need for contiguous Pt sites to dissociate O2 means that clusters with 100% Au surfaces are inactive, as isolated Pt sites are insufficient.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The initial surface composition affects the catalyst's activity for different reactions.
2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring can dynamically change the active sites available during reactions.
3. The balance between thermodynamic stability and adsorbate-induced changes determines the catalyst's long-term performance and stability.
4. Reaction conditions can be tailored to optimize surface composition for specific catalytic applications.

Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the surface composition and structure directly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂（如铂基系统）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu催化剂：

1. 在没有吸附物的情况下，热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构，这是由于Au的表面自由能较低。

2. 涉及CO吸附的反应条件可以促进Pt向表面扩散，克服Au表面偏析的热力学偏好。

3. CO的存在使得Pt迁移到表面形成强Pt-CO键在热力学上变得有利。

4. 对于CO氧化，需要连续的Pt位点来解离O2，这意味着100%Au表面的簇是无活性的，因为孤立的Pt位点是不够的。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 初始表面组成影响催化剂对不同反应的活性。
2. 吸附物诱导的重构可以动态改变反应过程中可用的活性位点。
3. 热力学稳定性和吸附物诱导变化之间的平衡决定了催化剂的长期性能和稳定性。
4. 可以调整反应条件以优化特定催化应用的表面组成。

理解这些现象对设计各种应用的高效稳定的双金属催化剂至关重要，因为表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。
