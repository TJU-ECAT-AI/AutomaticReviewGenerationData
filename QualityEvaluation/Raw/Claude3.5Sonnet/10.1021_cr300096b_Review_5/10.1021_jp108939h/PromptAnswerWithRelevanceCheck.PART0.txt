[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu clusters, bulk thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

However, reaction conditions can alter this thermodynamically preferred configuration. CO adsorption at room temperature promotes Pt diffusion to the cluster surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for clusters with initially pure Au surfaces.

The structural configuration impacts catalytic properties. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. Clusters with 100% Au surfaces cannot catalyze this reaction due to the lack of Pt ensembles at the surface. This demonstrates how surface composition directly affects catalytic performance.

These findings have important implications for catalytic applications. The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions means their active surface composition may differ significantly from the as-prepared state. This can lead to unexpected catalytic behaviors and highlights the need to consider in-situ restructuring when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu团簇，由于Au的表面自由能较低，体相热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构。这导致Pt组成为50%或更低的团簇表面几乎为纯Au。

然而，反应条件可以改变这种热力学优选的构型。室温下CO吸附促进Pt向团簇表面扩散，这是由形成强Pt-CO键驱动的。这种效应在初始表面为纯Au的团簇上最为显著。

结构构型影响催化性能。对于CO氧化，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点。100%Au表面的团簇无法催化这一反应，因为表面缺乏Pt集合。这说明表面组成直接影响催化性能。

这些发现对催化应用有重要意义。双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性意味着它们的活性表面组成可能与制备状态有显著不同。这可能导致意外的催化行为，并突显了在设计和优化特定应用的双金属催化剂时需要考虑原位重构的必要性。

For PtAu catalysts, bulk thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

However, reaction conditions can alter this configuration. CO adsorption promotes Pt diffusion to the surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for initially pure Au surfaces. DFT calculations confirm it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to migrate to the surface to bind CO.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties. For example, CO oxidation requires O2 dissociation at Pt sites, which needs multiple contiguous Pt atoms. On clusters with 100% Au surfaces, O2 dissociation cannot occur due to the low probability of Pt ensembles forming at the surface.

This demonstrates how the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can dramatically affect the surface composition and thus the catalytic performance of bimetallic systems. Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst design for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu催化剂,由于Au的表面自由能较低,整体热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构。这导致在Pt组成为50%或更低时,簇的表面几乎是纯Au的。

然而,反应条件可以改变这种构型。CO吸附促进Pt向表面扩散,这是由于形成了强Pt-CO键。这种效应在初始纯Au表面上最为明显。密度泛函理论计算证实,Pt迁移到表面与CO结合是热力学上有利的。

这些结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。例如,CO氧化需要在Pt位点上解离O2,这需要多个相邻的Pt原子。在100%Au表面的簇上,由于Pt原子集合在表面形成的概率很低,O2解离无法发生。

这表明热力学偏好和反应条件之间的相互作用可以显著影响双金属系统的表面组成,从而影响其催化性能。理解和控制这些因素对于优化特定应用的催化剂设计至关重要。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu catalysts:

1. In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy.

2. Reaction conditions involving CO adsorption can promote Pt diffusion to the surface, overcoming the thermodynamic preference for Au surface segregation.

3. The presence of CO makes it thermodynamically favorable for Pt to migrate to the surface to form strong Pt-CO bonds.

4. For CO oxidation, the need for contiguous Pt sites to dissociate O2 means that clusters with 100% Au surfaces are inactive, as isolated Pt sites are insufficient.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The initial surface composition affects the catalyst's activity for different reactions.
2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring can dynamically change the active sites available during reactions.
3. The balance between thermodynamic stability and adsorbate-induced changes determines the catalyst's long-term performance and stability.
4. Reaction conditions can be tailored to optimize surface composition for specific catalytic applications.

Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, as the surface composition and structure directly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

1. 在没有吸附物的情况下，热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构，这是由于Au的表面自由能较低。

2. 涉及CO吸附的反应条件可以促进Pt向表面扩散，克服Au表面偏析的热力学偏好。

3. CO的存在使得Pt迁移到表面形成强Pt-CO键在热力学上变得有利。

4. 对于CO氧化，需要连续的Pt位点来解离O2，这意味着100%Au表面的簇是无活性的，因为孤立的Pt位点是不够的。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 初始表面组成影响催化剂对不同反应的活性。
2. 吸附物诱导的重构可以动态改变反应过程中可用的活性位点。
3. 热力学稳定性和吸附物诱导变化之间的平衡决定了催化剂的长期性能和稳定性。
4. 可以调整反应条件以优化特定催化应用的表面组成。

理解这些现象对设计各种应用的高效稳定的双金属催化剂至关重要，因为表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。

This reaction cannot occur on PtAu clusters with 100% Au surfaces before CO exposure, as there is a low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface.

Thus, the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can dramatically affect the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn determines their catalytic activity for specific reactions.

2. Reaction conditions, particularly the presence of adsorbates like CO, can dramatically alter the surface composition. CO adsorption promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, especially for clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. This is thermodynamically favorable due to the strong Pt-CO binding.

3. The structural configuration affects catalytic properties. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. On PtAu clusters with 100% Au surface, O2 dissociation cannot occur due to the low probability of Pt ensembles forming at the surface.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance:

1. The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions must be considered when designing and optimizing catalysts.

2. Surface segregation induced by adsorbates can expose or hide active sites, significantly impacting catalytic activity.

3. The balance between thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity needs to be carefully managed. While a Pt core-Au shell structure may be thermodynamically favored, it may not provide the optimal surface for certain reactions.

4. The structural requirements for specific reactions (e.g., need for contiguous Pt sites for O2 dissociation) should guide the design of bimetallic catalysts to ensure the presence of necessary active site ensembles.

3. 需要仔细管理热力学稳定性和催化活性之间的平衡。虽然Pt核-Au壳结构在热力学上可能是有利的，但它可能不会为某些反应提供最佳表面。

4. 特定反应的结构要求（例如，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点）应该指导双金属催化剂的设计，以确保必要的活性位点集合的存在。
