[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt core–Au shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For PtAu clusters, bulk thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to Au's lower surface free energy. This results in nearly pure Au surfaces for clusters with 50% or less Pt composition.

However, reaction conditions can alter this thermodynamically preferred configuration. CO adsorption at room temperature promotes Pt diffusion to the cluster surface, driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds. This effect is most pronounced for clusters with initially pure Au surfaces.

The structural configuration impacts catalytic properties. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. Clusters with 100% Au surfaces cannot catalyze this reaction due to the lack of Pt ensembles at the surface. This demonstrates how surface composition directly affects catalytic performance.

These findings have important implications for catalytic applications. The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions means their active surface composition may differ significantly from the as-prepared state. This can lead to unexpected catalytic behaviors and highlights the need to consider in-situ restructuring when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于PtAu团簇，由于Au的表面自由能较低，体相热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构。这导致Pt组成为50%或更低的团簇表面几乎为纯Au。

然而，反应条件可以改变这种热力学优选的构型。室温下CO吸附促进Pt向团簇表面扩散，这是由形成强Pt-CO键驱动的。这种效应在初始表面为纯Au的团簇上最为显著。

结构构型影响催化性能。对于CO氧化，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点。100%Au表面的团簇无法催化这一反应，因为表面缺乏Pt集合。这说明表面组成直接影响催化性能。

这些发现对催化应用有重要意义。双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性意味着它们的活性表面组成可能与制备状态有显著不同。这可能导致意外的催化行为，并突显了在设计和优化特定应用的双金属催化剂时需要考虑原位重构的必要性。
