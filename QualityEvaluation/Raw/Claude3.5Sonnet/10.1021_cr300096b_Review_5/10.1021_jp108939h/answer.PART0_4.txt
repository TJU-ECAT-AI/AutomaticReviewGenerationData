[1] "For both coverages, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt. These results are consistent with bulk thermodynamics, which predicts a Pt coreAu shell structure based on the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap for the two metals."

[2] "The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomena is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."

[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. For PtAu catalysts:

1. In the absence of adsorbates, thermodynamics favors a Pt core-Au shell structure due to the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt. This results in cluster surfaces consisting of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% or lower.

2. Reaction conditions, particularly the presence of adsorbates like CO, can dramatically alter the surface composition. CO adsorption promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, especially for clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. This is thermodynamically favorable due to the strong Pt-CO binding.

3. The structural configuration affects catalytic properties. For CO oxidation, O2 dissociation requires contiguous Pt sites. On PtAu clusters with 100% Au surface, O2 dissociation cannot occur due to the low probability of Pt ensembles forming at the surface.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance:

1. The dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions must be considered when designing and optimizing catalysts.

2. Surface segregation induced by adsorbates can expose or hide active sites, significantly impacting catalytic activity.

3. The balance between thermodynamic stability and catalytic activity needs to be carefully managed. While a Pt core-Au shell structure may be thermodynamically favored, it may not provide the optimal surface for certain reactions.

4. The structural requirements for specific reactions (e.g., need for contiguous Pt sites for O2 dissociation) should guide the design of bimetallic catalysts to ensure the presence of necessary active site ensembles.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中。对于PtAu催化剂：

1. 在没有吸附质的情况下，热力学倾向于形成Pt核-Au壳结构，这是由于Au的表面自由能低于Pt。这导致在Pt组成为50%或更低时，簇表面几乎由纯Au组成。

2. 反应条件，特别是CO等吸附质的存在，可以显著改变表面组成。CO吸附促进Pt向簇表面扩散，尤其是对于初始表面为纯Au的簇。由于Pt-CO结合强烈，这在热力学上是有利的。

3. 结构构型影响催化性能。对于CO氧化，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点。在表面100%为Au的PtAu簇上，由于Pt集合体在表面形成的概率很低，O2解离无法发生。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 设计和优化催化剂时必须考虑双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性。

2. 吸附质诱导的表面偏析可以暴露或隐藏活性位点，显著影响催化活性。

3. 需要仔细管理热力学稳定性和催化活性之间的平衡。虽然Pt核-Au壳结构在热力学上可能是有利的，但它可能不会为某些反应提供最佳表面。

4. 特定反应的结构要求（例如，O2解离需要连续的Pt位点）应该指导双金属催化剂的设计，以确保必要的活性位点集合的存在。
