[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level, and change in d-band occupancy and electronegativity"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the electronic properties of the metal surface, which in turn impacts catalytic properties and performance.

For Pt-3d alloys, the formation of surface metal-metal bonds leads to shifts in core energy levels due to charge transfer between the monolayer and substrate. This alters the density of states near the Fermi level and changes d-band occupancy and electronegativity. These electronic modifications result in improved catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction compared to pure Pt.

The specific activity of Pt3M electrodes shows a volcano-shaped dependence across late transition metals, correlating with oxygen chemisorption energy and variations in surface electronic structure. This relationship between composition, electronic properties, and catalytic performance allows for tuning of Pt surface properties to achieve high activity and selectivity.

The stability and surface segregation in these bimetallic systems depend on factors like lattice mismatch, interfacial interactions, and strain effects. These influence the final structural configuration and exposed surface, which in turn determines catalytic behavior. Careful control of synthesis conditions and alloy composition is therefore crucial for optimizing catalyst performance for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型,尤其是在基于Pt的系统(如Pt-3d合金)中。这些因素影响金属表面的电子性质,进而影响催化性能。

对于Pt-3d合金,表面金属-金属键的形成导致由于单层与基底之间的电荷转移而引起核能级的移动。这改变了费米能级附近的态密度,并改变了d带占据和电负性。这些电子修饰导致氧还原等反应的催化活性比纯Pt有所提高。

Pt3M电极的比活性在晚过渡金属中呈火山形依赖关系,与氧化学吸附能和表面电子结构的变化相关。这种成分、电子性质和催化性能之间的关系允许调整Pt表面性质以实现高活性和选择性。

这些双金属系统中的稳定性和表面偏析取决于晶格失配、界面相互作用和应变效应等因素。这些因素影响最终的结构构型和暴露表面,从而决定催化行为。因此,仔细控制合成条件和合金成分对于优化特定应用的催化剂性能至关重要。
