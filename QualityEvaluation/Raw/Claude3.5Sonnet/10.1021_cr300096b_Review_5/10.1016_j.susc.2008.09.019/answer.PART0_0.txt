[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Stability: The formation of surface metal-metal bonds and charge transfer between the monolayer and substrate affects the stability of bimetallic catalysts. This can lead to shifts in core energy levels and changes in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer.

2. Surface segregation: The composition of the surface layer can be different from the bulk due to segregation effects, which are influenced by factors like surface energy, atomic size, and reaction conditions. This affects the exposed active sites and thus catalytic performance.

3. Structural configuration: Strain effects and interfacial interactions play crucial roles in determining the structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. Systems with small lattice mismatches between components are often used as starting points for studying these effects.

4. Catalytic properties: The electronic structure of the surface, particularly the d-band center position and width, is modified in bimetallic systems. This leads to changes in adsorption energies of reactants and intermediates, directly impacting catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. Performance in applications: Pt-alloy systems, such as Pt3M (where M is a 3d transition metal), have shown improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of Pt surface electronic and chemical properties.

6. Volcano-shaped activity trends: The specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals exhibits a volcano-shaped dependence. This trend is explained by variations in oxygen chemisorption energy, which correlates with changes in surface electronic structure.

These factors collectively determine the overall performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in fuel cells and other electrochemical systems. Understanding and controlling these aspects are crucial for designing more efficient and durable catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统(如Pt-3d合金)中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 稳定性：表面金属-金属键的形成和单层与基底之间的电荷转移影响双金属催化剂的稳定性。这可能导致核能级的移动和金属吸附层电子性质的变化。

2. 表面偏析：由于偏析效应，表面层的成分可能与体相不同，这受表面能、原子大小和反应条件等因素的影响。这影响了暴露的活性位点，从而影响催化性能。

3. 结构构型：应变效应和界面相互作用在决定双金属催化剂的结构构型中起着关键作用。组分之间晶格失配较小的系统通常被用作研究这些效应的起点。

4. 催化性能：双金属系统中表面的电子结构，特别是d带中心位置和宽度，被修改。这导致反应物和中间体的吸附能发生变化，直接影响催化活性和选择性。

5. 应用性能：Pt合金系统，如Pt3M（其中M是3d过渡金属），与纯Pt相比，显示出改进的氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性。这种增强归因于Pt表面电子和化学性质的调节。

6. 火山形活性趋势：Pt3M电极在晚期过渡金属中的特定活性呈火山形依赖关系。这一趋势可以通过氧化学吸附能的变化来解释，而氧化学吸附能与表面电子结构的变化相关。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂在各种应用中的整体性能，特别是在燃料电池和其他电化学系统中。理解和控制这些方面对设计更高效和耐久的催化剂至关重要。
