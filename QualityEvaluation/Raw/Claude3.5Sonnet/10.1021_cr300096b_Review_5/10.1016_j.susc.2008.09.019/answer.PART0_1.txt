[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level, and change in d-band occupancy and electronegativity"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the catalytic properties and performance in various applications in the following ways:

1. Electronic structure modification: The formation of Pt-alloy systems alters the surface electronic properties of Pt, which in turn changes its reactivity. This is due to the formation of surface metal-metal bonds, shifts in core energy levels, and charge transfer between the Pt monolayer and the substrate.

2. Catalytic activity enhancement: Pt-alloy systems, such as Pt3M (where M is a 3d transition metal), have shown improved catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of Pt surface electronic and chemical properties.

3. Activity-structure correlation: The specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals (e.g., Ni to Ti) shows a volcano-shaped dependence. This relationship is explained by variations in oxygen chemisorption energy, which correlates with changes in surface electronic structure.

4. Density of states and d-band properties: The catalytic properties of bimetallic systems are influenced by changes in the density of states near the Fermi level, as well as alterations in d-band occupancy and electronegativity.

These factors collectively determine the stability, surface composition, and structural arrangement of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Understanding and controlling these aspects are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in applications such as fuel cells, where enhanced ORR activity and reduced Pt content are desirable outcomes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素通过以下方式影响催化性能和各种应用中的表现：

1. 电子结构修饰：Pt合金系统的形成改变了Pt的表面电子性质，从而改变其反应活性。这是由于表面金属-金属键的形成、核能级的移动以及Pt单层与基底之间的电荷转移所致。

2. 催化活性增强：Pt合金系统，如Pt3M（其中M为3d过渡金属），相比纯Pt表现出更高的氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性。这种增强归因于Pt表面电子和化学性质的调节。

3. 活性-结构相关性：Pt3M电极在晚期过渡金属（如从Ni到Ti）中的特定活性呈现火山形依赖关系。这种关系可以通过氧化学吸附能的变化来解释，而氧化学吸附能与表面电子结构的变化相关。

4. 态密度和d带特性：双金属系统的催化性能受费米能级附近态密度变化的影响，以及d带占据率和电负性的改变。

这些因素共同决定了基于Pt的双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面组成和结构排列。理解和控制这些方面对于优化催化性能至关重要，特别是在燃料电池等应用中，其中增强的ORR活性和减少的Pt含量是理想的结果。
