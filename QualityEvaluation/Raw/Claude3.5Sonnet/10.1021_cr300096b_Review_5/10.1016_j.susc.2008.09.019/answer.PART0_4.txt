[1] "Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt"

[2] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure"

[3] "Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate"

[4] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Electronic structure tuning: The formation of Pt-alloy systems allows for tuning of the Pt surface electronic and chemical properties, leading to improved catalytic activity compared to pure Pt, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

2. Composition-dependent activity: There is a volcano-shaped dependence of catalytic activity on the composition of Pt3M alloys (where M is a 3d transition metal), related to oxygen chemisorption energy and variations in surface electronic structure.

3. Surface metal-metal bonding: The reactivity of the metal adlayer is influenced by the formation of surface metal-metal bonds, which can cause shifts in core energy levels due to charge transfer between the monolayer and substrate.

4. Strain and interfacial effects: Both lattice strain and interfacial interactions play crucial roles in determining the properties of bimetallic systems. Systems with small lattice mismatches between components are particularly interesting for studying these effects.

These factors collectively determine the stability and activity of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, affecting their performance in applications such as fuel cells. The ability to tune these properties through alloying and surface engineering offers opportunities for designing more efficient and durable catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 电子结构调节：Pt合金系统的形成允许调节Pt表面的电子和化学性质，从而提高催化活性，尤其是对氧还原反应（ORR）的催化活性，相比纯Pt有显著提升。

2. 成分依赖的活性：Pt3M合金（其中M为3d过渡金属）的催化活性与其成分呈火山形依赖关系，这与氧化学吸附能和表面电子结构的变化有关。

3. 表面金属-金属键合：金属吸附层的反应性受表面金属-金属键形成的影响，这可能导致由于单层与基底之间的电荷转移而引起核能级的移动。

4. 应变和界面效应：晶格应变和界面相互作用都在决定双金属系统性质中起着关键作用。组分之间晶格失配很小的系统对于研究这些效应特别有意思。

这些因素共同决定了基于Pt的双金属催化剂的稳定性和活性，影响其在燃料电池等应用中的性能。通过合金化和表面工程调节这些性质的能力为设计更高效和更耐用的催化剂提供了机会。
