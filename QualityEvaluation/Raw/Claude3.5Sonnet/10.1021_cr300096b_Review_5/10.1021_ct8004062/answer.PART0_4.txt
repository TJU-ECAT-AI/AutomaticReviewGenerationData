[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces."

[4] "The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system. This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."

[5] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In Pt-based alloys, surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition, which directly affects catalytic activity. For instance, in Pt3Co alloys, annealing can lead to the formation of a Pt-skin structure on the surface due to Pt segregation. This Pt-skin structure exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt catalysts.

The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements. Au shows a strong tendency for surface segregation in PtAu alloys, which is both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible. In contrast, Co does not tend to segregate to the surface in PtCo alloys. This difference is attributed to the thermodynamics of the segregation process: it is exothermic for Au (0.57 eV) but endothermic for Co (0.45 eV).

These segregation behaviors have significant implications for catalyst design and performance. The formation of Pt-skin structures in Pt-3d alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. The surface composition and structure resulting from segregation can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, influencing its interaction with reactants and intermediates.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other catalytic processes. By carefully selecting alloying elements and controlling reaction conditions, it is possible to tailor the surface composition and structure of Pt-based catalysts to achieve desired catalytic properties and enhanced performance.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在基于Pt的合金中，表面偏析在决定表面结构和成分方面起着关键作用，这直接影响催化活性。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，退火可以导致表面形成Pt皮层结构，这是由于Pt的偏析。这种Pt皮层结构展现出显著增强的氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的四倍。

不同合金元素的表面偏析趋势各不相同。Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析趋势，这在热力学上是有利的，动力学上也是可行的。相比之下，Co在PtCo合金中不倾向于偏析到表面。这种差异归因于偏析过程的热力学：对于Au来说是放热的（0.57 eV），而对于Co来说是吸热的（0.45 eV）。

这些偏析行为对催化剂设计和性能有重要影响。Pt-3d合金中Pt皮层结构的形成可以导致催化活性和稳定性的提高。由偏析引起的表面组成和结构可以改变催化剂表面的电子性质，影响其与反应物和中间体的相互作用。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于优化它们在各种应用中的性能至关重要，如燃料电池、电解槽和其他催化过程。通过仔细选择合金元素和控制反应条件，可以调整基于Pt的催化剂的表面组成和结构，以达到所需的催化性能和增强的性能。
