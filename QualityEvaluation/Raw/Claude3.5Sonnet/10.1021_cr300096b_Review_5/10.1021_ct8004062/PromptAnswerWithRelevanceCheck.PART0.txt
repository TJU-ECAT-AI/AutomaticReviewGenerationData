[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."

[4] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition of Pt-based alloys. In many cases, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a "Pt-skin" structure.

2. The formation of this Pt-skin can dramatically enhance catalytic activity. For example, in Pt3Co alloys, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt catalysts.

3. The thermodynamic favorability of surface segregation varies depending on the specific alloy composition. For instance, Au shows a strong tendency to segregate to the surface in PtAu alloys (exothermic process), while Co does not readily segregate in PtCo alloys (endothermic process).

4. Kinetic factors also play a crucial role in surface segregation. Even if segregation is thermodynamically favorable, kinetic barriers may inhibit the process. The model presented in the literature shows that Co segregation to the Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive.

5. The surface structure and composition resulting from these thermodynamic and kinetic factors directly impact the catalyst's performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where the ORR is a critical reaction.

6. Understanding and controlling these factors can lead to the design of more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts, tailored for specific applications by optimizing surface composition and structure.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析在决定基于Pt的合金的表面结构和成分方面起着关键作用。在许多情况下，Pt倾向于偏析到表面，形成"Pt皮层"结构。

2. 这种Pt皮层的形成可以显著提高催化活性。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，氧还原反应（ORR）在Pt皮层表面上具有独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的四倍。

3. 表面偏析的热力学有利性因特定合金成分而异。例如，Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析倾向（放热过程），而Co在PtCo合金中不易偏析（吸热过程）。

4. 动力学因素在表面偏析中也起着关键作用。即使偏析在热力学上是有利的，动力学障碍也可能抑制这个过程。文献中提出的模型表明，Co向Pt(111)表面的偏析在热力学上是不利的，在动力学上也是受阻的。

5. 由这些热力学和动力学因素导致的表面结构和成分直接影响催化剂在各种应用中的性能，特别是在燃料电池技术中，其中ORR是一个关键反应。

6. 理解和控制这些因素可以导致设计更高效和稳定的双金属催化剂，通过优化表面成分和结构，为特定应用量身定制。

[1] "In recent years, Pt-based alloys, composed of Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively investigated (1-7) owing to their enhanced ORR activity. The improvement of catalytic activities can be attributed to the modification of the geometric and electronic properties in the alloys. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process."

[2] "For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. Nevertheless, some details of segregation are not completely understood. Particularly, the kinetics of surface segregation, which is critical to elucidate the driving forces and the process of this phenomenon, has barely been addressed at a molecular level."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, (29, 30) whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. (16, 17)"

[4] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation plays a key role in modifying the geometric and electronic properties of Pt-based alloys, which in turn affects their catalytic activities. The tendency for surface segregation varies among different Pt-based systems. For example, Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, while Co does not tend to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preference for surface segregation is determined by the energy changes associated with the process. In the case of PtAu systems, the segregation of Au to the Pt(111) surface is exothermic, indicating it is thermodynamically favorable. Conversely, for PtCo systems, the process is endothermic, suggesting it is thermodynamically unfavorable.

Kinetic factors also play a crucial role in surface segregation. The energy barriers associated with atomic movements and vacancy formation influence the rate and feasibility of segregation. For instance, Co segregation to the clean Pt(111) surface is not only thermodynamically unfavorable but also kinetically prohibitive due to higher energy barriers.

These thermodynamic and kinetic factors ultimately determine the surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties. The formation of Pt-skin structures in some Pt-based alloys, for example, can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for certain reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications. By manipulating the composition and reaction conditions, it may be possible to control surface segregation and structural configuration to achieve desired catalytic properties and performance.

表面偏析在改变基于Pt的合金的几何和电子性质方面起着关键作用，这反过来又影响了它们的催化活性。不同的基于Pt的系统的表面偏析倾向各不相同。例如，Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析，而Co不倾向于富集PtCo合金表面。

表面偏析的热力学偏好由过程相关的能量变化决定。对于PtAu系统，Au向Pt(111)表面的偏析是放热的，表明它在热力学上是有利的。相反，对于PtCo系统，这个过程是吸热的，表明它在热力学上是不利的。

动力学因素在表面偏析中也起着关键作用。与原子运动和空位形成相关的能量障碍影响偏析的速率和可行性。例如，Co向洁净Pt(111)表面的偏析不仅在热力学上不利，而且由于较高的能量障碍，在动力学上也是被禁止的。

这些热力学和动力学因素最终决定了双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构，进而影响其催化性能。例如，某些基于Pt的合金中Pt-皮层结构的形成可以导致某些反应（如氧还原反应（ORR））的催化活性增强。

理解这些现象对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。通过操控组成和反应条件，可能可以控制表面偏析和结构构型，以实现所需的催化性能。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In Pt-based alloys, surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. For instance, in Pt3Co alloys, Pt tends to segregate to the outermost layer upon annealing, forming a Pt-skin structure. This Pt-skin structure exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt catalyst.

The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements. Au shows a strong tendency for surface segregation in PtAu alloys, which is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. In contrast, Co does not readily segregate to the surface in PtCo alloys. These differences in segregation behavior are attributed to the thermodynamic preferences of the systems.

The energetics of the segregation process also play a crucial role. For example, the segregation of Au to the Pt surface is exothermic, while that of Co is endothermic. This thermodynamic preference explains why Au readily segregates to the surface while Co does not. Furthermore, the energy barriers for atomic movement within the alloy structure influence the kinetics of segregation. In PtCo alloys, the energy barrier for Co to move from the surface to the second layer is lower than for Pt to move in the opposite direction, further inhibiting Co surface segregation.

These segregation behaviors have significant implications for catalytic properties. The formation of a Pt-skin structure in Pt-3d alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for reactions like ORR, which is crucial for fuel cell applications. The surface composition and structure resulting from segregation determine the catalytic sites available for reactions, influencing both activity and selectivity.

Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena are essential for designing stable and efficient bimetallic catalysts. By manipulating the composition, preparation conditions, and reaction environment, it is possible to tailor the surface structure of these catalysts to optimize their performance for specific applications.

在基于Pt的合金中，表面偏析在决定催化活性方面起着关键作用。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，Pt在退火时倾向于偏析到最外层，形成Pt-皮层结构。这种Pt-皮层结构与体相合金和纯Pt催化剂相比，表现出显著增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活性。

不同合金元素的表面偏析趋势各不相同。Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析趋势，这在热力学和动力学上都是有利的。相比之下，Co在PtCo合金中不容易偏析到表面。这些偏析行为的差异归因于系统的热力学偏好。

偏析过程的能量学也起着关键作用。例如，Au向Pt表面的偏析是放热的，而Co的偏析是吸热的。这种热力学偏好解释了为什么Au容易偏析到表面，而Co则不会。此外，合金结构内原子移动的能量障碍影响偏析的动力学。在PtCo合金中，Co从表面移动到第二层的能量障碍比Pt向相反方向移动的能量障碍低，进一步抑制了Co的表面偏析。

这些偏析行为对催化性能有重要影响。Pt-3d合金中Pt-皮层结构的形成可以提高ORR等反应的催化活性，这对燃料电池应用至关重要。由偏析导致的表面组成和结构决定了可用于反应的催化位点，影响活性和选择性。

理解和控制这些偏析现象对设计稳定和高效的双金属催化剂至关重要。通过操纵组成、制备条件和反应环境，可以定制这些催化剂的表面结构，以优化它们在特定应用中的性能。

This Pt-skin structure shows significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt catalysts.

The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements. Gold (Au) shows a strong thermodynamic and kinetic preference for surface segregation in Pt-Au alloys. The process is exothermic and has a low energy barrier, making it highly favorable. In contrast, cobalt (Co) in Pt-Co alloys exhibits a much weaker tendency for surface segregation, with the process being endothermic and having higher energy barriers.

These differences in segregation behavior can lead to distinct surface structures and compositions in bimetallic catalysts. For Pt-Au alloys, the surface is likely to be enriched with Au atoms, while Pt-Co alloys may maintain a more mixed surface composition or form a Pt-rich surface layer.

The surface composition and structure resulting from segregation processes have direct consequences on the catalytic properties of these materials. The formation of Pt-skin structures in some alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, as observed in the ORR for Pt3Co. This enhancement is attributed to the modified geometric and electronic properties of the surface.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in various applications. By manipulating alloy composition, annealing conditions, and other reaction parameters, it may be possible to tailor the surface structure and composition to achieve desired catalytic properties for specific reactions or applications.
