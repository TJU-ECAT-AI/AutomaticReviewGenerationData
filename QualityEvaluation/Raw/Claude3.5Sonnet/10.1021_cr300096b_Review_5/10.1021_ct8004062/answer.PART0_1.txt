[1] "In recent years, Pt-based alloys, composed of Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively investigated (1-7) owing to their enhanced ORR activity. The improvement of catalytic activities can be attributed to the modification of the geometric and electronic properties in the alloys. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process."

[2] "For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. Nevertheless, some details of segregation are not completely understood. Particularly, the kinetics of surface segregation, which is critical to elucidate the driving forces and the process of this phenomenon, has barely been addressed at a molecular level."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, (29, 30) whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. (16, 17)"

[4] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."

[5] "Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation plays a key role in modifying the geometric and electronic properties of Pt-based alloys, which in turn affects their catalytic activities. The tendency for surface segregation varies among different Pt-based systems. For example, Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, while Co does not tend to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preference for surface segregation is determined by the energy changes associated with the process. In the case of PtAu systems, the segregation of Au to the Pt(111) surface is exothermic, indicating it is thermodynamically favorable. Conversely, for PtCo systems, the process is endothermic, suggesting it is thermodynamically unfavorable.

Kinetic factors also play a crucial role in surface segregation. The energy barriers associated with atomic movements and vacancy formation influence the rate and feasibility of segregation. For instance, Co segregation to the clean Pt(111) surface is not only thermodynamically unfavorable but also kinetically prohibitive due to higher energy barriers.

These thermodynamic and kinetic factors ultimately determine the surface composition and structure of the bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties. The formation of Pt-skin structures in some Pt-based alloys, for example, can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for certain reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications. By manipulating the composition and reaction conditions, it may be possible to control surface segregation and structural configuration to achieve desired catalytic properties and performance.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

表面偏析在改变基于Pt的合金的几何和电子性质方面起着关键作用，这反过来又影响了它们的催化活性。不同的基于Pt的系统的表面偏析倾向各不相同。例如，Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析，而Co不倾向于富集PtCo合金表面。

表面偏析的热力学偏好由过程相关的能量变化决定。对于PtAu系统，Au向Pt(111)表面的偏析是放热的，表明它在热力学上是有利的。相反，对于PtCo系统，这个过程是吸热的，表明它在热力学上是不利的。

动力学因素在表面偏析中也起着关键作用。与原子运动和空位形成相关的能量障碍影响偏析的速率和可行性。例如，Co向洁净Pt(111)表面的偏析不仅在热力学上不利，而且由于较高的能量障碍，在动力学上也是被禁止的。

这些热力学和动力学因素最终决定了双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构，进而影响其催化性能。例如，某些基于Pt的合金中Pt-皮层结构的形成可以导致某些反应（如氧还原反应（ORR））的催化活性增强。

理解这些现象对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。通过操控组成和反应条件，可能可以控制表面偏析和结构构型，以实现所需的催化性能。
