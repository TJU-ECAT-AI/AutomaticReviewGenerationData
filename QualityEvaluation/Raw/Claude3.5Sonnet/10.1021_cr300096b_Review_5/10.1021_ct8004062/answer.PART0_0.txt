[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."

[4] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition of Pt-based alloys. In many cases, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a "Pt-skin" structure.

2. The formation of this Pt-skin can dramatically enhance catalytic activity. For example, in Pt3Co alloys, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt catalysts.

3. The thermodynamic favorability of surface segregation varies depending on the specific alloy composition. For instance, Au shows a strong tendency to segregate to the surface in PtAu alloys (exothermic process), while Co does not readily segregate in PtCo alloys (endothermic process).

4. Kinetic factors also play a crucial role in surface segregation. Even if segregation is thermodynamically favorable, kinetic barriers may inhibit the process. The model presented in the literature shows that Co segregation to the Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive.

5. The surface structure and composition resulting from these thermodynamic and kinetic factors directly impact the catalyst's performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where the ORR is a critical reaction.

6. Understanding and controlling these factors can lead to the design of more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts, tailored for specific applications by optimizing surface composition and structure.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析在决定基于Pt的合金的表面结构和成分方面起着关键作用。在许多情况下，Pt倾向于偏析到表面，形成"Pt皮层"结构。

2. 这种Pt皮层的形成可以显著提高催化活性。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，氧还原反应（ORR）在Pt皮层表面上具有独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的四倍。

3. 表面偏析的热力学有利性因特定合金成分而异。例如，Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析倾向（放热过程），而Co在PtCo合金中不易偏析（吸热过程）。

4. 动力学因素在表面偏析中也起着关键作用。即使偏析在热力学上是有利的，动力学障碍也可能抑制这个过程。文献中提出的模型表明，Co向Pt(111)表面的偏析在热力学上是不利的，在动力学上也是受阻的。

5. 由这些热力学和动力学因素导致的表面结构和成分直接影响催化剂在各种应用中的性能，特别是在燃料电池技术中，其中ORR是一个关键反应。

6. 理解和控制这些因素可以导致设计更高效和稳定的双金属催化剂，通过优化表面成分和结构，为特定应用量身定制。
