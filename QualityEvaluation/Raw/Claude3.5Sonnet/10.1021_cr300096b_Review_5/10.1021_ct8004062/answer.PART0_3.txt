[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Our calculations show that Au is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for this migration, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV, indicating a strong surface segregation tendency. The corresponding values for Co, 0.15 eV and 0.48 eV, are much higher than those of Au."

[4] "The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system. This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In Pt-based alloys, surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and composition, which in turn affects catalytic activity. For instance, in Pt3Co alloys, annealing can lead to the formation of a Pt-skin structure on the surface due to Pt segregation. This Pt-skin structure shows significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt catalysts.

The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements. Gold (Au) shows a strong thermodynamic and kinetic preference for surface segregation in Pt-Au alloys. The process is exothermic and has a low energy barrier, making it highly favorable. In contrast, cobalt (Co) in Pt-Co alloys exhibits a much weaker tendency for surface segregation, with the process being endothermic and having higher energy barriers.

These differences in segregation behavior can lead to distinct surface structures and compositions in bimetallic catalysts. For Pt-Au alloys, the surface is likely to be enriched with Au atoms, while Pt-Co alloys may maintain a more mixed surface composition or form a Pt-rich surface layer.

The surface composition and structure resulting from segregation processes have direct consequences on the catalytic properties of these materials. The formation of Pt-skin structures in some alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, as observed in the ORR for Pt3Co. This enhancement is attributed to the modified geometric and electronic properties of the surface.

Understanding and controlling surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in various applications. By manipulating alloy composition, annealing conditions, and other reaction parameters, it may be possible to tailor the surface structure and composition to achieve desired catalytic properties for specific reactions or applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在基于铂的合金中，表面偏析在决定表面结构和组成方面起着关键作用，这反过来又影响催化活性。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，退火可以导致表面形成由于铂偏析而产生的铂皮层结构。这种铂皮层结构显示出显著增强的氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性，反应速率是纯铂催化剂的四倍。

不同合金元素的表面偏析趋势各不相同。在Pt-Au合金中，金（Au）表现出强烈的热力学和动力学表面偏析偏好。这个过程是放热的，并且具有较低的能量障碍，使其非常有利。相比之下，Pt-Co合金中的钴（Co）表现出更弱的表面偏析趋势，过程是吸热的，且具有更高的能量障碍。

这些偏析行为的差异可能导致双金属催化剂中形成不同的表面结构和组成。对于Pt-Au合金，表面可能富含Au原子，而Pt-Co合金可能保持更混合的表面组成或形成富铂表面层。

由偏析过程产生的表面组成和结构对这些材料的催化性能有直接影响。某些合金中铂皮层结构的形成可能导致催化活性增强，如在Pt3Co的ORR中观察到的。这种增强归因于表面几何和电子性质的改变。

理解和控制双金属催化剂中的表面偏析对于优化它们在各种应用中的性能至关重要。通过操纵合金组成、退火条件和其他反应参数，可能可以定制表面结构和组成，以实现特定反应或应用所需的催化性能。
