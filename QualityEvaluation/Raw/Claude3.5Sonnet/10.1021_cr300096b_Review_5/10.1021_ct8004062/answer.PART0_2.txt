[1] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process. For example, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloys and on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating to the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst."

[2] "Some recent studies have revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."

[3] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces."

[4] "The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system. This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."

[5] "For the PtCo alloy, the conversion from 2 to 1 has an energy barrier of 0.63 eV, much lower than that of the competitive step from 3 to 4 (1.15 eV), suggesting the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer compared to the Pt atoms."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In Pt-based alloys, surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. For instance, in Pt3Co alloys, Pt tends to segregate to the outermost layer upon annealing, forming a Pt-skin structure. This Pt-skin structure exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity compared to both the bulk alloy and pure Pt catalyst.

The tendency for surface segregation varies among different alloying elements. Au shows a strong tendency for surface segregation in PtAu alloys, which is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. In contrast, Co does not readily segregate to the surface in PtCo alloys. These differences in segregation behavior are attributed to the thermodynamic preferences of the systems.

The energetics of the segregation process also play a crucial role. For example, the segregation of Au to the Pt surface is exothermic, while that of Co is endothermic. This thermodynamic preference explains why Au readily segregates to the surface while Co does not. Furthermore, the energy barriers for atomic movement within the alloy structure influence the kinetics of segregation. In PtCo alloys, the energy barrier for Co to move from the surface to the second layer is lower than for Pt to move in the opposite direction, further inhibiting Co surface segregation.

These segregation behaviors have significant implications for catalytic properties. The formation of a Pt-skin structure in Pt-3d alloys can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for reactions like ORR, which is crucial for fuel cell applications. The surface composition and structure resulting from segregation determine the catalytic sites available for reactions, influencing both activity and selectivity.

Understanding and controlling these segregation phenomena are essential for designing stable and efficient bimetallic catalysts. By manipulating the composition, preparation conditions, and reaction environment, it is possible to tailor the surface structure of these catalysts to optimize their performance for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在基于Pt的合金中，表面偏析在决定催化活性方面起着关键作用。例如，在Pt3Co合金中，Pt在退火时倾向于偏析到最外层，形成Pt-皮层结构。这种Pt-皮层结构与体相合金和纯Pt催化剂相比，表现出显著增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活性。

不同合金元素的表面偏析趋势各不相同。Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面偏析趋势，这在热力学和动力学上都是有利的。相比之下，Co在PtCo合金中不容易偏析到表面。这些偏析行为的差异归因于系统的热力学偏好。

偏析过程的能量学也起着关键作用。例如，Au向Pt表面的偏析是放热的，而Co的偏析是吸热的。这种热力学偏好解释了为什么Au容易偏析到表面，而Co则不会。此外，合金结构内原子移动的能量障碍影响偏析的动力学。在PtCo合金中，Co从表面移动到第二层的能量障碍比Pt向相反方向移动的能量障碍低，进一步抑制了Co的表面偏析。

这些偏析行为对催化性能有重要影响。Pt-3d合金中Pt-皮层结构的形成可以提高ORR等反应的催化活性，这对燃料电池应用至关重要。由偏析导致的表面组成和结构决定了可用于反应的催化位点，影响活性和选择性。

理解和控制这些偏析现象对设计稳定和高效的双金属催化剂至关重要。通过操纵组成、制备条件和反应环境，可以定制这些催化剂的表面结构，以优化它们在特定应用中的性能。
