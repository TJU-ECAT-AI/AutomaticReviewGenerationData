Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface structure during reactions, which in turn affects their catalytic properties and performance.

In Pt-based bimetallic systems, the surface structure can be modulated between different configurations, such as a Pt-skin surface with the second metal in the subsurface region, or a surface rich in the oxide of the second metal. This structural flexibility is regulated by the redox potential of the reaction environment, allowing for reversible changes between oxidative and reductive conditions.

The ability to switch between different surface structures offers the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts. For instance, in FePt systems, the surface can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. This structural modulation affects properties such as CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

The enhanced catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts is attributed to this structural complexity and flexibility. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region have shown superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their catalytic performance in various applications. The ability to tune the surface structure through reaction conditions provides a powerful tool for tailoring catalyst properties for specific reactions and improving overall catalytic efficiency.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素导致催化剂表面结构在反应过程中发生动态变化，进而影响其催化性能。

在基于Pt的双金属系统中，表面结构可以在不同的构型之间调节，例如表面为Pt皮层而第二种金属位于亚表面区域，或表面富含第二种金属的氧化物。这种结构灵活性由反应环境的氧化还原电位调节，允许在氧化和还原条件之间可逆地变化。

在不同表面结构之间切换的能力为调节双金属催化剂的催化活性和选择性提供了机会。例如，在FePt系统中，表面可以通过循环氧化和还原处理在具有Fe亚表面的Pt皮层表面和富含氧化铁的Pt表面之间可逆地切换。这种结构调节影响了CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力等性能。

与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂增强的催化性能归因于这种结构复杂性和灵活性。具有Pt皮层表面和亚表面3d过渡金属的基于Pt的双金属催化剂在许多反应中表现出比纯Pt表面更优越的催化性能。

这些发现突出了理解和控制双金属催化剂表面结构对优化其在各种应用中的催化性能的重要性。通过反应条件调节表面结构的能力为针对特定反应定制催化剂性能和提高整体催化效率提供了强大的工具。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is more complex than that of monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in different states (metallic or oxidized) and locations (surface, near-surface, or bulk). This complexity allows for a wide range of possible configurations, which can be manipulated to optimize catalytic performance.

For Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region has been shown to enhance catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This demonstrates how the specific arrangement of metals in the catalyst structure can significantly impact its properties.

The dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces during reactions is another important factor. Changes in the gaseous environment, particularly between reductive and oxidative conditions, can lead to reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion. This phenomenon has been observed in both monometallic and bimetallic systems.

In the case of FePt bimetallic catalysts, it has been demonstrated that the surface structure can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their catalytic properties. By manipulating reaction conditions and leveraging thermodynamic preferences, it is possible to create more efficient and selective catalysts for various applications.
