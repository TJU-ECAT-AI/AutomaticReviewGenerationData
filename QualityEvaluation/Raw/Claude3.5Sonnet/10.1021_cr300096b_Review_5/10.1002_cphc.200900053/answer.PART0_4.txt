[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This influence has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is more complex than monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in different states and locations within the catalyst. This structural complexity is critical to the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.

In Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region can lead to superior catalytic performance compared to pure Pt surfaces. This structural configuration is particularly effective in many reactions.

The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is not static but can change dynamically during reactions. These changes are influenced by the reaction environment, particularly the redox potential of reaction gases. For example, in FePt systems, the surface structure can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments.

This reversible structural modulation allows for tunable surface properties, such as CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability. This tunability offers the opportunity to optimize catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions by controlling the reaction conditions.

The ability to modulate the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts through reaction conditions provides a powerful tool for tailoring their catalytic properties. This can lead to improved performance in various applications, potentially surpassing the capabilities of both parent metals and monometallic catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这种影响对它们在各种应用中的催化性能有重要意义。

双金属催化剂的表面结构比单金属催化剂更复杂，第二种金属可能以不同的状态和位置存在于催化剂中。这种结构复杂性对双金属催化剂的催化性能至关重要。

在基于铂的双金属催化剂中，形成铂皮层表面并在亚表面区域含有3d过渡金属可以导致比纯铂表面更优越的催化性能。这种结构构型在许多反应中特别有效。

双金属催化剂的表面结构并非静态，而是可以在反应过程中动态变化。这些变化受反应环境的影响，特别是反应气体的氧化还原电位。例如，在FePt系统中，表面结构可以通过循环氧化和还原处理在铂皮层表面（铁在下面）和富含氧化铁的铂表面之间可逆切换。

这种可逆的结构调节允许调节表面性质，如CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力。这种可调性提供了通过控制反应条件来优化特定反应的催化活性和选择性的机会。

通过反应条件调节双金属催化剂表面结构的能力为定制其催化性能提供了强大的工具。这可以导致各种应用中性能的改善，可能超越两种母金属和单金属催化剂的能力。
