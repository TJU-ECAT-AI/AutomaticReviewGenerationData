[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting—dewetting and sintering—dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is more complex than that of monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in metallic or oxidized states on the surface, near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk. This structural complexity is critical to the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

In Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region leads to superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This structural configuration is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and can be manipulated through reaction conditions.

The dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces during reactions is evident in the reversible surface processes observed in both monometallic and bimetallic systems. These processes, such as wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion, occur in response to changes in the gaseous environment between reductive and oxidative conditions.

In the case of FePt bimetallic catalysts, the surface structure can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

The ability to control and manipulate the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts through thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions has significant implications for optimizing their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. This tunability offers opportunities for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for specific reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素在决定这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能和表现方面起着关键作用。

双金属催化剂的表面结构比单金属催化剂更复杂，第二种金属可能以金属态或氧化态存在于表面、近表面区域或嵌入体相中。这种结构复杂性对双金属系统的催化性能至关重要。

在基于Pt的双金属催化剂中，3d过渡金属位于亚表面区域的Pt皮层表面的形成，导致在许多反应中比纯Pt表面表现出更优异的催化性能。这种结构构型受热力学偏好的影响，并可通过反应条件进行操控。

催化剂表面在反应过程中的动态性质在单金属和双金属系统中观察到的可逆表面过程中得到体现。这些过程，如润湿-去润湿和烧结-分散，是对还原和氧化条件之间气体环境变化的响应。

在FePt双金属催化剂的情况下，表面结构可以在Fe位于下方的Pt皮层表面和富含氧化铁的Pt表面之间可逆切换。这种结构调制通过循环氧化和还原处理进行调节，允许调节表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力。

通过热力学偏好和反应条件控制和操纵双金属催化剂的表面结构的能力，对于优化它们在各种应用中的催化性能和表现具有重要意义。这种可调性为设计更高效和选择性的特定反应催化剂提供了机会。
