[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is more complex than that of monometallic catalysts, with the second metal potentially existing in different states (metallic or oxidized) and locations (surface, near-surface, or bulk). This complexity allows for a wide range of possible configurations, which can be manipulated to optimize catalytic performance.

For Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region has been shown to enhance catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This demonstrates how the specific arrangement of metals in the catalyst structure can significantly impact its properties.

The dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces during reactions is another important factor. Changes in the gaseous environment, particularly between reductive and oxidative conditions, can lead to reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion. This phenomenon has been observed in both monometallic and bimetallic systems.

In the case of FePt bimetallic catalysts, it has been demonstrated that the surface structure can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their catalytic properties. By manipulating reaction conditions and leveraging thermodynamic preferences, it is possible to create more efficient and selective catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素在决定这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能和表现方面起着至关重要的作用。

双金属催化剂的表面结构比单金属催化剂更为复杂，第二种金属可能以不同的状态（金属态或氧化态）和位置（表面、近表面或体相）存在。这种复杂性允许存在多种可能的构型，可以通过操控这些构型来优化催化性能。

对于基于Pt的双金属催化剂，在亚表面区域含有3d过渡金属的Pt皮层表面的形成已被证明能够在许多反应中提高催化性能，相比纯Pt表面更为优越。这表明催化剂结构中金属的特定排列可以显著影响其性能。

催化剂表面在反应过程中的动态性质是另一个重要因素。气相环境的变化，特别是在还原性和氧化性条件之间的转换，可能导致可逆的表面过程，如润湿-去湿和烧结-分散。这种现象在单金属和双金属系统中都有观察到。

在FePt双金属催化剂的情况下，已经证明表面结构可以在Pt皮层表面（Fe在下方）和富铁氧化物的Pt表面之间可逆切换。这种结构调节通过循环氧化和还原处理来调控，允许调节CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力。

这些发现强调了理解和控制双金属催化剂表面结构对优化其催化性能的重要性。通过操纵反应条件和利用热力学偏好，可以为各种应用创造更高效和选择性的催化剂。
