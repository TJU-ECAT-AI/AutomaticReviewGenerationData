[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."

[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."

[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."

[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reductive and oxidative conditions."

[5] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Bimetallic catalysts exhibit more complex surface structures compared to monometallic catalysts. The second metal can be present in different states (metallic or oxidized) and locations (surface, near-surface, or bulk). This structural complexity contributes to their superior catalytic performance.

In Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the formation of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals in the subsurface region leads to enhanced catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. This demonstrates the critical role of surface structure in determining catalytic properties.

The structure of bimetallic catalysts is not static but can change dynamically during reactions. Environmental conditions, such as changes between reductive and oxidative atmospheres, can induce reversible surface processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering-dispersion.

Using FePt(111) systems as an example, it has been shown that the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be reversibly switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This structural modulation, regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, allows for tunable CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their catalytic performance. By manipulating reaction conditions and exploiting thermodynamic preferences, it is possible to tune the surface configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, thereby enhancing their catalytic properties for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂表现出更复杂的表面结构。第二种金属可以以不同的状态（金属态或氧化态）和位置（表面、近表面或体相）存在。这种结构复杂性有助于其优越的催化性能。

在基于Pt的双金属催化剂中，形成表面为Pt皮层、亚表面区域有3d过渡金属的结构，可以在许多反应中表现出比纯Pt表面更优异的催化性能。这表明表面结构对决定催化性能至关重要。

双金属催化剂的结构并非静态，而是可以在反应过程中动态变化。环境条件，如还原性和氧化性氛围之间的变化，可以引起可逆的表面过程，如润湿-去润湿和烧结-分散。

以FePt(111)系统为例，研究表明双金属FePt催化剂的表面结构可以在Pt皮层表面（Fe在下方）和富铁氧化物的Pt表面之间可逆切换。这种结构调制由循环氧化和还原处理调节，允许调节CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力。

这些发现强调了理解和控制双金属催化剂表面结构对优化其催化性能的重要性。通过操纵反应条件和利用热力学偏好，可以调节基于Pt的双金属催化剂的表面构型，从而增强其在特定应用中的催化性能。
