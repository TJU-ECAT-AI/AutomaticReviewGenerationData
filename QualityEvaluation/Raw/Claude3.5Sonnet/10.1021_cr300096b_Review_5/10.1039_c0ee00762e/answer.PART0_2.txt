[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[4] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability is highly dependent on both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. The presence of oxygen significantly facilitates corrosion of alloy metals.

2. Clean alloy surfaces tend to be more stable than pure Pt due to the stabilization of the Pt d-band structure through alloying. This makes surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve.

3. However, under high oxygen coverage conditions, the trend in stability across the periodic table reverses compared to clean surfaces. This suggests that reaction environments play a crucial role in determining catalyst stability.

4. For stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, a lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is crucial.

5. The composition and structure of the catalyst surface can change under reaction conditions, with factors like potential cycling and acidic media influencing long-term stability and performance.

6. Optimizing the ratio of Pt to alloying element is important for balancing stability and activity. For example, in Pt-Mo alloys, around 30% Mo content was found to provide the best combination of stability and ORR activity.

These insights demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, surface structure, and reaction environment in determining the performance of bimetallic catalysts. Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for designing improved catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面稳定性高度依赖于合金元素和氧覆盖度。氧的存在显著促进了合金金属的腐蚀。

2. 由于通过合金化稳定了Pt的d带结构，清洁的合金表面往往比纯Pt更稳定。这使得表面Pt原子更难偏析或溶解。

3. 然而，在高氧覆盖度条件下，周期表中稳定性的趋势与清洁表面相比发生逆转。这表明反应环境在决定催化剂稳定性方面起着关键作用。

4. 对于稳定的氧还原反应（ORR）催化剂，在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下，与纯Pt相比，较低的氧覆盖度至关重要。

5. 催化剂表面的成分和结构可能在反应条件下发生变化，电位循环和酸性介质等因素会影响长期稳定性和性能。

6. 优化Pt与合金元素的比例对平衡稳定性和活性很重要。例如，在Pt-Mo合金中，发现约30%的Mo含量可以提供最佳的稳定性和ORR活性组合。

这些见解表明，催化剂成分、表面结构和反应环境之间存在复杂的相互作用，这决定了双金属催化剂的性能。理解和控制这些因素对于设计改进的催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池技术中。
