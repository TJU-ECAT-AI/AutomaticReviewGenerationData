[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[5] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The following key points highlight these influences and their implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability is highly dependent on oxygen coverage. Under high O coverage conditions, the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated compared to clean surfaces.

2. The trend in stability across the periodic table is opposite for O-covered surfaces compared to clean surfaces. This indicates that the presence of oxygen dramatically alters the thermodynamic landscape of these bimetallic systems.

3. Clean alloy surfaces generally show higher stability than pure Pt(111), but this advantage is lost under high O coverage conditions. This suggests that the catalytic performance of these alloys may degrade in oxygen-rich environments.

4. Alloying leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve on clean surfaces. However, this effect is counteracted by the presence of oxygen.

5. For a stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, a lower O coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is crucial. This highlights the importance of tailoring the alloy composition to achieve the desired balance between stability and activity.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The catalytic activity and stability of Pt-based alloys are intricately linked to their surface composition and structure, which can change dynamically under reaction conditions.

2. The presence of oxygen can significantly alter the surface structure and composition of the catalyst, potentially leading to decreased stability and changes in catalytic activity over time.

3. Designing effective bimetallic catalysts requires careful consideration of both the clean surface properties and the behavior under reaction conditions, particularly in the presence of oxygen.

4. The optimal alloy composition may need to balance competing factors such as d-band stabilization, oxygen affinity, and resistance to surface segregation or corrosion.

5. Understanding and controlling the oxygen coverage on the catalyst surface is crucial for maintaining both stability and activity in applications such as fuel cells where the ORR takes place.

These insights underscore the complexity of designing bimetallic catalysts and highlight the need for in-depth studies of catalyst behavior under realistic reaction conditions to develop more effective and durable catalytic systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以Pt为基础的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。以下关键点突出了这些影响及其对催化性能的影响：

1. 表面稳定性高度依赖于氧覆盖度。在高氧覆盖条件下，合金金属的腐蚀比清洁表面显著加剧。

2. 周期表中稳定性趋势在氧覆盖表面和清洁表面上是相反的。这表明氧的存在显著改变了这些双金属系统的热力学景观。

3. 清洁合金表面通常比纯Pt(111)显示更高的稳定性，但在高氧覆盖条件下这种优势消失。这表明这些合金的催化性能可能在富氧环境中降低。

4. 合金化导致Pt d带稳定化，使表面Pt原子在清洁表面上更难偏析或溶解。然而，这种效果被氧的存在所抵消。

5. 对于稳定的氧还原反应（ORR）催化剂，在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下比纯Pt具有更低的氧覆盖度至关重要。这突出了调整合金成分以实现稳定性和活性之间理想平衡的重要性。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. Pt基合金的催化活性和稳定性与其表面成分和结构密切相关，而这些在反应条件下可能动态变化。

2. 氧的存在可能显著改变催化剂的表面结构和成分，可能导致稳定性降低和催化活性随时间变化。

3. 设计有效的双金属催化剂需要仔细考虑清洁表面性质和反应条件下的行为，特别是在有氧存在的情况下。

4. 最佳合金成分可能需要平衡诸如d带稳定化、氧亲和力以及抗表面偏析或腐蚀等竞争因素。

5. 理解和控制催化剂表面的氧覆盖度对于在燃料电池等进行ORR的应用中维持稳定性和活性至关重要。

这些见解强调了设计双金属催化剂的复杂性，并突出了在实际反应条件下深入研究催化剂行为的必要性，以开发更有效和耐用的催化系统。
