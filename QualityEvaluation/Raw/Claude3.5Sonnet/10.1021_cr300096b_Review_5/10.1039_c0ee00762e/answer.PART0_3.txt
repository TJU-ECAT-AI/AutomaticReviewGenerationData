[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[4] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

[5] "To understand why Pt2Mo has a lower barrier, we first examined the optimized structure for O2adsorption, and the OOH dissociation TS on Pt2Mo and on Pt, as shown in Fig. 4. The key structural parameters are labelled. These identified structures are similar except that there are precovered O atoms near to the adsorbed O2 and OOH TS on Pt."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability is highly dependent on both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. The presence of oxygen generally facilitates corrosion of alloy metals, making stability a critical concern for long-term catalyst performance.

2. Clean alloy surfaces tend to be more stable than pure Pt due to the stabilization of the Pt d-band through alloying. This makes surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution.

3. However, under high oxygen coverage conditions, the stability trend across the periodic table reverses compared to clean surfaces. This highlights the importance of considering reaction conditions when designing catalysts.

4. Lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) is crucial for achieving stable ORR catalysts. Alloys that can maintain lower oxygen coverage than pure Pt at these potentials are more likely to be stable.

5. The structural configuration of the catalyst surface, including the presence of pre-covered oxygen atoms, affects the adsorption and reaction of key intermediates like O2 and OOH. This, in turn, influences the catalytic activity.

6. Optimizing the ratio of Pt to the alloying element is important for balancing stability and activity. For example, in Pt-Mo alloys, a composition of Pt2Mo was found to achieve the best balance.

These findings emphasize the complex interplay between catalyst composition, surface structure, and reaction conditions in determining the overall performance of bimetallic catalysts. Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for designing improved catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素对其催化性能和应用表现有重要影响：

1. 表面稳定性高度依赖于合金元素和氧覆盖度。氧的存在通常会促进合金金属的腐蚀，使稳定性成为长期催化剂性能的关键考虑因素。

2. 由于通过合金化稳定了Pt的d带，清洁的合金表面往往比纯Pt更稳定。这使得表面Pt原子更能抵抗偏析或溶解。

3. 然而，在高氧覆盖度条件下，周期表中的稳定性趋势与清洁表面相比发生逆转。这突显了在设计催化剂时考虑反应条件的重要性。

4. 在相关的电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下保持较低的氧覆盖度对于实现稳定的ORR催化剂至关重要。在这些电位下能够保持比纯Pt更低氧覆盖度的合金更可能保持稳定。

5. 催化剂表面的结构构型，包括预覆盖氧原子的存在，影响关键中间体如O2和OOH的吸附和反应。这反过来又影响催化活性。

6. 优化Pt与合金元素的比例对于平衡稳定性和活性很重要。例如，在Pt-Mo合金中，Pt2Mo的组成被发现能够达到最佳平衡。

这些发现强调了催化剂组成、表面结构和反应条件之间在决定双金属催化剂整体性能方面的复杂相互作用。理解和控制这些因素对于设计改进的催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池技术领域。
