[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces."

[3] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[5] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The following key points highlight these influences and their implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability is highly dependent on oxygen coverage. Under high O coverage conditions, the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated compared to clean surfaces.

2. The trend in stability across the periodic table is opposite for O-covered surfaces compared to clean surfaces. This indicates that the presence of oxygen dramatically alters the thermodynamic landscape of these bimetallic systems.

3. Clean alloy surfaces generally show higher stability than pure Pt(111), but this advantage is lost under high O coverage conditions. This suggests that the catalytic performance of these alloys may degrade in oxygen-rich environments.

4. Alloying leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve on clean surfaces. However, this effect is counteracted by the presence of oxygen.

5. For a stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, a lower O coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is crucial. This highlights the importance of tailoring the alloy composition to achieve the desired balance between stability and activity.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The catalytic activity and stability of Pt-based alloys are intricately linked to their surface composition and structure, which can change dynamically under reaction conditions.

2. The presence of oxygen can significantly alter the surface structure and composition of the catalyst, potentially leading to decreased stability and changes in catalytic activity over time.

3. Designing effective bimetallic catalysts requires careful consideration of both the clean surface properties and the behavior under reaction conditions, particularly in the presence of oxygen.

4. The optimal alloy composition may need to balance competing factors such as d-band stabilization, oxygen affinity, and resistance to surface segregation or corrosion.

5. Understanding and controlling the oxygen coverage on the catalyst surface is crucial for maintaining both stability and activity in applications such as fuel cells where the ORR takes place.

These insights underscore the complexity of designing bimetallic catalysts and highlight the need for in-depth studies of catalyst behavior under realistic reaction conditions to develop more effective and durable catalytic systems.

3. 设计有效的双金属催化剂需要仔细考虑清洁表面性质和反应条件下的行为，特别是在有氧存在的情况下。

4. 最佳合金成分可能需要平衡诸如d带稳定化、氧亲和力以及抗表面偏析或腐蚀等竞争因素。

5. 理解和控制催化剂表面的氧覆盖度对于在燃料电池等进行ORR的应用中维持稳定性和活性至关重要。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability: The presence of oxygen greatly affects the stability of Pt-based alloy surfaces. While clean alloy surfaces tend to be more stable than pure Pt, the introduction of oxygen facilitates corrosion of alloy metals.

2. Surface segregation: Alloying generally stabilizes the Pt d-band structure, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve on clean surfaces. However, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Pt removal is facilitated due to stronger stabilization of surface vacancies by oxygen atoms.

3. Structural configuration: The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. Skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) with various 3d and 4d metals show different stabilities under high oxygen coverage conditions.

4. Catalytic performance: For stable ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) catalysts, a lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is crucial. This requirement affects the choice of alloying elements and their ratios in designing effective catalysts.

5. Influence of reaction conditions: Electrochemical potential and oxygen coverage play critical roles in determining the stability and activity of these bimetallic catalysts. The interplay between these factors must be considered when optimizing catalyst composition for specific applications.

These findings highlight the complex relationship between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the structural and catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Understanding these interactions is crucial for designing stable and efficient catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Oxygen coverage plays a crucial role. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt under the same oxygen coverage in electrochemical conditions. Maintaining low or zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (around 0.9 V) is essential for achieving both high activity and stability.

2. Surface stability varies with oxygen coverage. On clean surfaces, alloys show higher stability than pure Pt. However, at high oxygen coverage (e.g., 0.5 ML), alloys exhibit poorer surface stability compared to Pt.

3. Alloying affects electronic structure. The addition of alloying elements generally stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution on clean surfaces.

4. Oxygen presence facilitates Pt removal. Adsorbed oxygen atoms can more strongly stabilize surface vacancies compared to perfect surfaces, promoting Pt removal in alloys.

5. Alloy composition influences oxygen affinity. The stability of alloys depends on both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. A lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is necessary for a stable ORR catalyst.

These factors collectively determine the surface structure, stability, and catalytic performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Balancing the alloy composition to optimize oxygen coverage, surface stability, and electronic structure is crucial for developing effective catalysts for various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reactions for fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 氧气覆盖率起着关键作用。在电化学条件下，相同氧气覆盖率下，合金通常比纯Pt更不稳定。在工作电位（约0.9 V）下保持低或零氧气覆盖率对于同时实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。

2. 表面稳定性随氧气覆盖率变化。在干净表面上，合金表现出比纯Pt更高的稳定性。然而，在高氧气覆盖率（如0.5 ML）下，合金表现出比Pt更差的表面稳定性。

3. 合金化影响电子结构。合金元素的添加通常会稳定Pt的d带，使表面Pt原子在干净表面上更不易发生偏析或溶解。

4. 氧气存在促进Pt移除。吸附的氧原子比完美表面更能稳定表面空位，促进合金中Pt的移除。

5. 合金成分影响氧气亲和力。合金的稳定性取决于合金元素和氧气覆盖率。在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下，与纯Pt相比，较低的氧气覆盖率是稳定ORR催化剂所必需的。

这些因素共同决定了基于Pt的双金属催化剂的表面结构、稳定性和催化性能。平衡合金成分以优化氧气覆盖率、表面稳定性和电子结构对于开发各种应用（特别是燃料电池中的氧还原反应）的有效催化剂至关重要。
