[1] "We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals."

[2] "Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O."

[3] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[4] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."

[5] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface stability: The presence of oxygen greatly affects the stability of Pt-based alloy surfaces. While clean alloy surfaces tend to be more stable than pure Pt, the introduction of oxygen facilitates corrosion of alloy metals.

2. Surface segregation: Alloying generally stabilizes the Pt d-band structure, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve on clean surfaces. However, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Pt removal is facilitated due to stronger stabilization of surface vacancies by oxygen atoms.

3. Structural configuration: The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. Skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) with various 3d and 4d metals show different stabilities under high oxygen coverage conditions.

4. Catalytic performance: For stable ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) catalysts, a lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is crucial. This requirement affects the choice of alloying elements and their ratios in designing effective catalysts.

5. Influence of reaction conditions: Electrochemical potential and oxygen coverage play critical roles in determining the stability and activity of these bimetallic catalysts. The interplay between these factors must be considered when optimizing catalyst composition for specific applications.

These findings highlight the complex relationship between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the structural and catalytic properties of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Understanding these interactions is crucial for designing stable and efficient catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面稳定性：氧的存在极大地影响了基于Pt的合金表面的稳定性。虽然清洁的合金表面往往比纯Pt更稳定，但氧的引入促进了合金金属的腐蚀。

2. 表面偏析：合金化通常会稳定Pt的d带结构，使表面Pt原子在清洁表面上更难发生偏析或溶解。然而，在吸附氧的存在下，由于氧原子对表面空位的更强稳定作用，Pt的移除被促进。

3. 结构构型：合金的稳定性对合金元素和氧覆盖度都很敏感。具有各种3d和4d金属的皮层合金（由Pt单层覆盖的Pt2M合金）在高氧覆盖条件下显示出不同的稳定性。

4. 催化性能：对于稳定的ORR（氧还原反应）催化剂，在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下，相比纯Pt，较低的氧覆盖度至关重要。这一要求影响了设计有效催化剂时合金元素的选择及其比例。

5. 反应条件的影响：电化学电位和氧覆盖度在决定这些双金属催化剂的稳定性和活性方面起着关键作用。在为特定应用优化催化剂组成时，必须考虑这些因素之间的相互作用。

这些发现突出了基于Pt的双金属催化剂的热力学偏好、反应条件以及结构和催化性能之间的复杂关系。理解这些相互作用对于设计各种应用（尤其是燃料电池技术）中稳定和高效的催化剂至关重要。
