[1] "We show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."

[2] "On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage."

[3] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."

[4] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."

[5] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Oxygen coverage plays a crucial role. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt under the same oxygen coverage in electrochemical conditions. Maintaining low or zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (around 0.9 V) is essential for achieving both high activity and stability.

2. Surface stability varies with oxygen coverage. On clean surfaces, alloys show higher stability than pure Pt. However, at high oxygen coverage (e.g., 0.5 ML), alloys exhibit poorer surface stability compared to Pt.

3. Alloying affects electronic structure. The addition of alloying elements generally stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution on clean surfaces.

4. Oxygen presence facilitates Pt removal. Adsorbed oxygen atoms can more strongly stabilize surface vacancies compared to perfect surfaces, promoting Pt removal in alloys.

5. Alloy composition influences oxygen affinity. The stability of alloys depends on both the alloying element and oxygen coverage. A lower oxygen coverage at relevant electrochemical potentials (0.8-1.2 V) compared to pure Pt is necessary for a stable ORR catalyst.

These factors collectively determine the surface structure, stability, and catalytic performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Balancing the alloy composition to optimize oxygen coverage, surface stability, and electronic structure is crucial for developing effective catalysts for various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reactions for fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 氧气覆盖率起着关键作用。在电化学条件下，相同氧气覆盖率下，合金通常比纯Pt更不稳定。在工作电位（约0.9 V）下保持低或零氧气覆盖率对于同时实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。

2. 表面稳定性随氧气覆盖率变化。在干净表面上，合金表现出比纯Pt更高的稳定性。然而，在高氧气覆盖率（如0.5 ML）下，合金表现出比Pt更差的表面稳定性。

3. 合金化影响电子结构。合金元素的添加通常会稳定Pt的d带，使表面Pt原子在干净表面上更不易发生偏析或溶解。

4. 氧气存在促进Pt移除。吸附的氧原子比完美表面更能稳定表面空位，促进合金中Pt的移除。

5. 合金成分影响氧气亲和力。合金的稳定性取决于合金元素和氧气覆盖率。在相关电化学电位（0.8-1.2 V）下，与纯Pt相比，较低的氧气覆盖率是稳定ORR催化剂所必需的。

这些因素共同决定了基于Pt的双金属催化剂的表面结构、稳定性和催化性能。平衡合金成分以优化氧气覆盖率、表面稳定性和电子结构对于开发各种应用（特别是燃料电池中的氧还原反应）的有效催化剂至关重要。
