          The literature suggests that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The study focuses on the oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt3dPt(111) and Pt3dPt(100) bimetallic structures, indicating that the crystal plane orientation plays a crucial role in determining the stability of subsurface 3d metals in the presence of oxygen.

          The research investigates the stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures when exposed to oxygen, which implies that reaction conditions involving oxygen can affect the structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, the study examines the effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability, suggesting that the specific arrangement of atoms at the surface influences the overall stability and potential for surface segregation in these Pt-based systems.

          These factors have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys in various applications. The stability and surface composition of bimetallic catalysts directly affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. By understanding how thermodynamics and reaction conditions influence the structural configuration of these materials, researchers can better predict and optimize their performance in specific applications, such as fuel cells or other catalytic processes involving oxygen.

          文献表明，热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。该研究重点关注Pt3dPt(111)和Pt3dPt(100)双金属结构中氧气诱导的3d金属偏析，表明晶面取向在决定氧气存在下亚表面3d金属稳定性方面起着关键作用。

          研究调查了PtNiPt和PtCoPt结构暴露于氧气中时的稳定性，这意味着涉及氧气的反应条件可能影响这些双金属催化剂的结构构型。此外，该研究还考察了晶面对亚表面稳定性的影响，表明表面原子的特定排列影响了这些基于Pt系统的整体稳定性和表面偏析的潜力。

          这些因素对Pt-3d合金在各种应用中的催化性能和表现有重要影响。双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面组成直接影响其催化活性和选择性。通过了解热力学和反应条件如何影响这些材料的结构构型，研究人员可以更好地预测和优化它们在特定应用中的性能，如燃料电池或其他涉及氧气的催化过程。
