Density functional theory is used to study oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in
(211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys. It is found that the most energetically
favorable oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation
phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only
one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen
adsorbed.

1. Introduction
One of the most important challenges in low temperature fuel
cell technology is improving the catalytic efficiency, especially at
the electrode-catalyst where molecular oxygen, in a kinetically
slow reaction, is reduced and combines with protons yielding
water. The electrocatalysis process is carried out on nanoparticles
with the goal of employing the smallest amount of material that
is able of maximizing catalytic activity and stability. As an efficient
catalyst, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, as a no-
ble metal, Pt is extremely expensive. Moreover, the relatively slug-
gish ORR kinetics on Pt surfaces considerably limits its catalytic
efficiency [1]. Therefore, it is indispensable to develop new cata-
lysts with lower cost and higher activities.
Near surface alloys (NSAs) are defined as alloys wherein a solute
metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations
different from the bulk (e.g. Pt monolayers on base metals). The
understanding and development of NSAs is a promising area of re-
search in catalyst design [25]. For example, recent studies show
that NSAs of Pt enhance the catalytic properties of pure Pt for H2
activation kinetics, whereas at the same time they bind adsorbates
much weaker than pure Pt [24]. In addition, NSAs represent an
alternative configuration where minimum amounts of Pt are re-
quired. The core-shell structure studied in this work can be visual-
ized as a representation of a NSA. On the other hand, we chose
Pt3M(211) (M = Cr, Ir) alloy systems because these compositions
have been found among the most successful [6].
Although most studies focus on the understanding of the inter-
actions of adsorbates with perfect crystal surfaces, much of the
physics and chemistry that takes place on real materials occurs
at defects [7]. Therefore, investigating the role of defects may im-
prove our knowledge of real systems. In our case of interest, Pt
nanoparticles in the range of 25nm have about 40% (111) facets,
a similar percent of edges and corners whereas the additional 20%
are (100) surfaces [8]. High Miller index surfaces, like (211) sur-
faces, provide useful means to create a range of local atomic envi-
ronments such as steps or terraces [7]. The studied (211) stepped
surface can be classified as a surface with (111) terraces separated
by monatomic (100) steps as shown in Fig. 1.
For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends
dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of
the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface seg-
regation phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to characterize
the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate
the effect of segregation on surface structure. In this work, we
investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in
stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption
of oxygen. Also, we discuss the effect of steps and terraces on the
oxygen adsorption energy as well as their effect on surface segre-
gation in comparison with that on (111) surfaces.

surfaces [4,7,9,1324]. The DFT calculations were performed using
the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [2529]. In VASP
the KohnSham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms.
In order to improve the calculation efficiency, core electrons were
replaced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopoten-
tials [30,31] and the valence electrons were described by plane
wave basis sets. In this work, the plane wave was expanded up
to a cutoff energy of 340 eV.

MonkhorstPack k-point mesh. The exchange-correlation func-
tional was described within the generalized gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) [32].
Spin polarization was taken into account in the calculations and
the MethfesselPaxon method was employed to determine elec-
tron occupancies with a smearing parameter r of 0.2 eV. The con-
vergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent iteration and the
ionic relaxation loop were set to 104 eV and 103 eV, respectively.
The Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys possess close-packed fcc structures
[3335], in which the Pt atoms occupy the face-centered positions
and the M atoms are located at the corners in the unit cell, as
shown in Fig. 2. The (211) stepped surface was created cleaving
the fcc unit cell through the corresponding Miller plane.
Simulation supercells for the Pt3M alloy system and core-shell
structure are shown in Fig. 3, they consist of a 4-layer slab and a
6-layer vacuum space (12 Å). In the core-shell super cell the first
layer is formed by Pt atoms only, whereas the core (the other three
layers) is constituted by either pure Co or Ir (denoted by M atoms
in Fig. 3c). The core was built as pure Co or Ir in fcc arrangements,
bulk calculations provided the lattice constants of 3.520 Å and
3.876 Å, respectively. These lattice constant values compare with
the experimental values of 3.56 Å [36] for fcc Co and 3.84 Å for Ir
[37]. Although Co is hcp in bulk, it has been reported that it adopts
fcc structure in nanoparticles of diameters below 20 nm [38]. In
both surface configurations, Pt3M and core-shell structure, the
atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax to the lowest
energy configuration, while the atoms of the bottom layer were
fixed to their bulk positions.
The (211) surface has (111) terraces separated by monatomic
(100) steps as shown in Fig. 3, where site 1 corresponds to a step site
while sites 2 and 3 are terrace sites. The segregation structures in
the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the
first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites
1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were
the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at
the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]. Segregation structures
were studied with and without the presence of oxygen adsorbed.
For the simulation of oxygen adsorption, as initial configuration
we placed an oxygen atom in a bridge position involving any of the
atoms of sites 1 to 3 and its adjacent atom in the y-direction as
shown in Fig. 4. The oxygen atom was allowed to relax together
with the atoms in the top three layers to its lowest energy config-
uration. We chose a bridge site as initial configuration based in our
calculations of oxygen adsorption on pure Pt(211) discussed in the
next section.
The surface segregation energy, Esegr, is generally defined as the
energy of moving an atom from the interior to the surface of a crys-
tal. In this work, it is characterized as the difference of total energies
of the slab with the segregated structure and that with the non-seg-
regated structure [23]. For the core-shell structures having pure Pt
in their shell we test M segregation to the surface, thus a negative
value of segregation energy indicates that the M atoms are able to
segregate to the surface, while a positive segregation energy sug-
gest no M segregation on the surface. In the case of the Pt3M we test
the segregation of Pt, negative values of surface segregation energy
imply that Pt atoms segregate to surface, whereas positive segrega-
tion energies mean no Pt segregation to the surface. On the other
hand, the adsorption energy, Eads, was evaluated subtracting from
the total energy of the slab with oxygen adsorbed the total energy
of the slab without oxygen and the total energy of the oxygen atom.
In the present study, we will denote with (E0segr)i the segregation
energy calculated in the presence of oxygen bonded to surface
involving adsorption site i, as defined in Fig. 3.
3. Results and discussion
We begin this section discussing the results of oxygen adsorp-
tion on pure Pt(211) surfaces; such results provide information
about the most stable sites for oxygen adsorption. Then, we ana-
lyze the adsorption of oxygen and its effect over surface segrega-
tion on Pt3M(211) and Pt/M (211) core-shell surfaces.
3.1. Oxygen adsorption on pure Pt(211)
First we identify the most stable adsorption sites on pure Pt
(211) surfaces. The adsorption energies corresponding to different
adsorption sites are shown in Fig. 5, sites (a) to (f) are different
