Bonding of Pt/Fe overlayer and its effects on atomic oxygen chemisorption from density functional theory study
Abstract
First principles spin-polarized total energy calculations using density functional theory (DFT) within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were performed to investigate the electronic structure of Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) and the bonding at PtFe and its effect on O atom chemisorption. Layer by layer density of states (DOS) for Pt/Fe(0 0 1) against the reference systems, unreconstructed Pt(0 0 1) and Fe(0 0 1) show a peak of Pt d states at the Fermi level and a spin polarization of Pt dzz states. Charge redistribution at PtFe interface shows charge transfer from the Pt and Fe atom sites towards the PtFe bonds verifying strong bimetallic bonding. Similar charge redistribution is observed for Pt(0 0 1) with increase in charges at surface PtPt bonding sites. Binding energies of adsorbed O on the three high symmetry sites follow the order: top < hollow < bridge. The efficiency of Pt d-electron back donation to adsorbed O on bridge is driven by a more localized bonding of O atom on this site. This mechanism of electron back donation may also be utilized in rationalizing the observed weakened binding of O on Pt/Fe system as compared to clean Pt(0 0 1) along with the d-band center model.
1. Introduction
Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) offers a promising alternative to conventional power generation systems for both stationary and mobile applications because of its high efficiency, low temperature operation, fuel flexibility and zero-emission. It is known that the major drawbacks in PEFC are the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction in the cathode and the high cost of platinum used to catalyze the reaction
[1]
. Tuning Pt surface electronic and chemical properties to achieve high activity and selectivity have therefore become very attractive. To date, Pt-alloy systems such as Pt3M (M = 3d transition metal) have been recognized in terms of their much improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure
[5]
. One non-trivial concern however for Pt3M would be the small reduction in Pt content compared to standard Pt loading as such Pt-based alloy systems are still generally rich in Pt. The goal of significantly lowering Pt content in fuel cell cathode catalyst has attracted researchers to consider adlayer structures on less expensive metal substrates
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Very recently, Pt monolayer on Pd(1 1 1) was found to show increased catalytic activity than Pt bulk and Pt nanoparticles while lowering Pt loading up to 90%
[6]
. The observed favorable catalytic activity is partly ascribed to decreased PtOH formation as a result of changes in the d-band properties of Pt due to its interaction with Pd. Sasaki et al. reported increase in d-band vacancy of the deposited Pt submonolayer on Ru electrocatalyst caused by PtRu interaction
[7]
. Bimetallic systems such as metal overlayers have therefore shown increasing catalytic importance in fuel cell research
[1]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Aside from significantly lowering Pt content, ultra thin bimetallic films exhibit modified surface electronic structure towards favorable catalytic property due to interfacial interactions
[11]
and strain effects
[10]
,
[12]
. However, many details of electrocatalytic behavior of such Pt overlayer systems still remain to be clarified. Theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metalmetal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate
[13]
. Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level
[14]
, and change in d-band occupancy and electronegativity
[15]
. Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points. It has been reported that Pt/Fe(0 0 1) films grow in layer by layer fashion at room temperature and epitaxial growth is ensured up to 5 Pt atomic layers (10 Å) on the basis of low-energy-electron diffraction (LEED) study
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. Our previous spin-polarized density functional theory calculations on atomic structure of Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) referenced to the clean Fe(0 0 1) surface
[19]
, show a very small (0.5%) lattice mismatch between Pt and Fe. This allows focus of changes in Pt electronic surface structure solely on metalmetal interaction. So far, no ab initio study on electronic structure and bonding of Pt/Fe overlayer has been conducted probably due to the fact that most systems considered (even for high-density magnetic storage devices) are Fe/Pt(0 0 1) multilayers
[20]
,
[21]
. Hence, in this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of electronic structure of Pt atomic layer on Fe(0 0 1) with reference to unreconstructed Pt(0 0 1) and Fe(0 0 1) surfaces. Adsorption characteristics of atomic oxygen for Pt/Fe(0 0 1) as compared to Pt(0 0 1) are also explored. In the last sections, we show how the change in Pt electronic structure accounts for atomic oxygen chemisorption properties. It is true that this adsorption model represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, and not to the fuel cell operating conditions. Nevertheless, the paper presents significant information on bimetallic surface oxidation which may form basis for further gas-surface interaction studies.
2. Computational method
Spin-polarized total energy calculations using Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method
[22]
,
[23]
and planewave basis set were performed within density functional theory (DFT) framework using Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP)
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
. The spin-polarized version of the program accounts for the magnetic moment of O and ferromagnetic character of Fe. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) was used for the exchange-correlation functional
[28]
,
[29]
as GGA is known to predict the correct ground state of Fe than local density approximation (LDA)
[30]
,
[31]
. Also, calculations using GGA gave reliable descriptions of total energy for chemisorption systems while LDA calculations tend to exaggerate adsorbate binding
[32]
. The PAW method was used instead of pseudopotential technique because ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USPPs) are known to produce the wrong ordering of magnetic states of bulk Fe
[30]
. Brillouin-zone integrations were performed on a grid of (11 × 11 × 1) MonkhorstPack k-points using MethfesselPaxton smearing
[33]
of σ = 0.2 eV. The substrate is modeled by a five-layer slab in a (1 × 1) unit cell with Pt atom pseudomorphically laid on the Fe substrate and with each slab separated by 12.0 Å of vacuum. For the chemisorption models, we used a (2 × 2) unit cell, large enough to avoid OO interactions while a grid of (4 × 4 × 1) Monkhorst and Pack
[34]
special k-points is used for Brillouin-zone integration to lower computational cost. The Pt, Fe and O PAWPBE potentials were all tested for bulk Pt, Fe and oxygen molecule. The GGA (PBE) calculated lattice parameter for Pt and Fe with 300 eV energy cutoff are 3.980 Å and 2.834 Å respectively, in excellent agreement with other DFTGGA calculations
[25]
,
[35]
. For atomic and molecular oxygen, a 400 eV cutoff energy yields a O2 bond length of 1.235 Å and a dissociation energy of 5.67 eV, also in good agreement with experiment
[36]
and other DFT calculations
[4]
,
[37]
.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Pt overlayer relaxation
The top layer relaxation for unreconstructed Pt(0 0 1) was calculated using four-layer slab in a (1 × 1) unit cell. The Pt atoms from the second to the bottom layers were fixed at their bulk positions. The slabs are separated by 12.0 Å thick of vacuum layer. The optimized structure is shown in
Fig. 1
a. Calculated interlayer distance between the first and second layer is 1.93 Å, in general agreement with other DFT calculation
[37]
. The PtPt bond length in the first interlayer is 2.77 Å. For the Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1), also in a (1 × 1) unit cell, Fe atoms from the 3rd Fe layer (designated by FeIII in
Fig. 1
b) down to the bottom layer are fixed at bulk positions. PtFe bond length is 2.50 Å which gives a significant contraction with respect to the PtPt bond length in Pt(0 0 1). The desorption energy (defined as energy needed for 1 Pt atom vacancy formation) per Pt atom in both systems is

where Eslab is the total energy of the slab, EPt is the total energy of isolated Pt atom and EPt/slab is the total energy of the Pt/slab system with one surface atom vacancy. The results show a marked difference between two systems with Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) greater by 0.18 eV. Such result may contribute significant insights in rational cathode catalyst design under stability arguments.

3.2. Electronic structure
Since total charge density has been the starting point in modern density functional theory for discussing bonding, we used charge density difference obtained by subtracting the valence charge density of the clean Fe substrate from that of Pt adlayer system and the Pt substrate from that of the four-layer Pt(0 0 1) slab for Pt/Fe(0 0 1) and Pt(0 0 1) systems, respectively.
Fig. 2
shows the redistribution of charges at PtPt (left figure) and at PtFe (right figure) regions as depicted by contours on a vertical plane which directly cuts through the surface Pt atom. Such plane is chosen to determine the difference in charge distribution above and around the surface Pt between the two systems. First, we note similar accumulation of charges within the PtPt and PtFe regions and we as well note that the increase in charge is more pronounced at the bonding sites. While in both systems, depletion of charges from vacuum to Pt atom sites is noted (the contours in the vacuum region for Pt on Fe are, however, more flat), a significant accumulation of charge between surface Pt atoms is observed in Pt(0 0 1). This is clearly depicted by the extension of the contour corresponding to increase in charge density (left figure) to the surface which may be attributed to surface PtPt bonding. Pt adhesion on Fe is still stronger owing to a greater charge accumulation in PtFe area. This has been checked using higher isosurface values but not depicted in the contour. One can, however, see that because of the bcc structure of Fe, the plane does not directly cut through Fe but still a significant increase in charge is observed as seen by the light region around the bonding site. The calculated workfunction (taken as energy difference between the Fermi energy and the vacuum level) for Pt/Fe(0 0 1) system is 4.56 eV, significantly lower compared to clean Pt(0 0 1), 5.65 eV which is close to measured result, 5.70 eV
[38]
This decrease in workfunction of the bimetallic system verifies the electron shifting away from Pt nuclei towards the substrate. This may induce charge polarization at PtFe resulting to a potential barrier in the interfacial region which consequently lowers the average potential in the Pt adlayer.

Fig. 2. Charge difference contour plot for Pt (0 0 1) (left figure) and for Pt/Fe(0 0 1) (right figure). Increase in charge is observed along bonding sites and depletion from vacuum to Pt sites. Accumulation of charges is also noted at surface PtPt bond sites in clean Pt(0 0 1).
Next, layer projected DOS of Pt/Fe(0 0 1) is plotted against the reference systems, unreconstructed Pt(0 0 1) and Fe(0 0 1) surfaces (
Fig. 3
a). The DOS curves for FeIII down to FeV give strong resemblance to that of the corresponding layers in five-layer bcc Fe(0 0 1) slab. Also, as expected, the curves approach that of Fe bulk as such interlayer distances have been fixed at bulk value. A moderate downshift in energy is seen for FeI which suggests the transfer of electrons from FeI atom sites to the PtFe bonds. For the Pt atomic layer, we note a peak of density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, we magnified the Pt DOS near the Fermi level (
Fig. 3
b) at energy range used in the spin-resolved inverse photoemission (IPE) spectra of Pt ML/Fe(0 0 1) of Bertacco and Ciccacci
[16]
. Here, the Pt overlayer derived states have been clearly identified following the subtraction of the background and Fe substrate contributions which is appropriate enough for a sitedecomposed DOS comparison. Interestingly, both spin up and spin down states in our Pt DOS plot show marked similarity with that of the IPE spectra. Excellent agreement is noted for the spin down Pt states where both the DOS plot and IPE spectra show peak immediately above the Fermi level (0.1 eV). For the spin up component, Pt DOS plot shows a peak at 1.6 eV above the Fermi level and at 1.3 eV in IPE spectra.

.
Next, local density of states (LDOS) plot for both Pt monolayer with respect to Pt(0 0 1) surface (
Fig. 4
) shows spin polarization of dzz states. For Pt(0 0 1), the up and down spin d states are the same verifying the zero magnetization for clean Pt. The differences in the LDOS for surface Fe in clean Fe(0 0 1) and Fe underlayer in Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) are depicted in
Fig. 5
. Here, the significant broadening of dxz and dyz states as a result of PtFe interaction is noted. In
Fig. 6
, we show the Pt (solid line) and Fe DOS plot to depict bonding states. The peaks for both Pt-5d and Fe-3d at 4.5 eV below the Fermi level are obvious. Detailed analysis of such states using the d-band LDOS for Pt (
Fig. 4
) and for Fe (
Fig. 5
) shows the significant contribution of both Pt dyz states (and to some extent dxz and dxy states) and Fe-dxz (and to some extent, dyz states) to PtFe bonding. At 4.8 eV below the Fermi level, the Pt-dxy and dxx-yy and Fe-dxz are significant in the PtFe bonding.

3.3. Atomic oxygen chemisorption
The oxygen overlayer on the Pt/Fe(0 0 1) corresponds to a coverage of 0.25 ML. The O, Pt and first layer Fe atoms were allowed to relax. The adsorption energy (Eads) of oxygen atom is calculated at three different high symmetry sites (bridge, hollow and top). The Eads is:
(2)
where EO/PtFe is the total energy of OPt Fe system, EO is the total energy of isolated O atom, EPtFe is the total energy of the slab.
Table 1
gives the binding energies, OPt bond length, OPt layer distance and local magnetic moment of O and Pt for each site. The Pt atom used to show Pt local magnetic moment is that which directly binds to O. The results on adsorption energies show that the bridge is the energetically most preferred site, followed by the hollow, then the top. A sharp drop in magnetic moment of O and Pt is, however, observed for the top site. So the role of the peak of d states (specifically due to the contribution of the spin polarization of dzz (the orbital protruding perpendicularly outward the surface) discussed previously, is noted. This highly extending orbital easily took up O spin. In this system, we may think of other crucial factors that govern O chemisorption other than O-adsorbed electron donation to surface Pt atoms. Also, the most energetically preferred site (bridge) is a bit surprising as one would expect O to sit on highly coordinated site (fourfold hollows) on Pt surface. So, first, we show the O-2p and Pt-5d DOS plots (
Fig. 7
) for the three configurations. In all the plots, the broadening Pt d states is more pronounced for the bridge configuration (top panel). The hybridization of O-2p states with Pt-5d states is also more evident for bridge at 6.0 eV below the Fermi level than it is for the hollow sites (middle panel). Next, we note that in the bridge configuration, the OPt bond length is shorter than that for hollow. This suggests a more localized bonding between O on bridge and the bridging Pt atoms. To verify localization of OPt bonding, we calculated charge densities of all sampled Bloch states:
where ib and kj are indices for bands and k-points,
is a Bloch state which we considered as an eigenstate of the periodic system,
is the charge density at the corresponding Bloch state and the double summation runs over all sampled k-points and occupied bands, as an analogy to the process of using molecular orbitals in understanding chemisorption. This procedure has already been used in many chemisorption models
[32]
,
[37]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
. Therefore, we obtained the total charge density by sampling the surface Brillouin-zone and examining the charge densities at all sampled block states to obtain considerable information. We, however, show in
Fig. 8
, isosurface plots of the charge density at Γ-point at some energies below the Fermi level which could sufficiently account for localization of OPt bonding. In
Fig. 8ac
, we show charge density isosurface plot at Γ-point for O chemisorbed on bridge at 4.25 eV, 3.99 eV and 0.53 eV below the Fermi level, respectively. In
Fig. 8
a, we clearly see the pxdzz orbital mixing. At all isosurface values tested, the charge density does not extend to other surface Pt atoms while the OPt bonding is still observed. The O px states are indeed completely localized within the two bridging Pt atoms.
Fig. 8
b shows localization of pz-like orbital where the pz-dxx-yy bonding is clearly illustrated. Also, at all isosurface values, the pz states do not extend beyond the nearest neighbor Pt atoms while OPt bonding is still evident.
Fig. 8
c gives the pydxy antibonding state. For the hollow configuration,
Fig. 8df
gives the charge density isosurface plot at Γ-point at 4.40 eV, 3.82 eV and 0.30 eV below the Fermi level, respectively. Only at an isosurface value less than 0.003 e/Å3 do we observe OPt bonding. This is shown in
Fig. 8
d where the mixing of O pz states with Pt-d states of the four Pt atoms is shown.
Fig. 8
e gives the charge density plot at higher energy where the same scenario as in the previous figure is observed, but this time, the O p(x)y like orbital is involved in the OPt bonding.
Fig. 8
f gives pzdxy antibonding state. Decreasing the isosurface value further disperses the O p states throughout the surface. This is also true for the top configuration. At 3.19 eV below the Fermi level, at 0.002 e/Å3 isosurface value, the pz states begin to disperse to neighboring Pt atoms (
Fig. 8
g) while it is completely localized at top at some isosurface value higher than this. We, thus, see that the differences in the localization of O-2p states play significant role in understanding the differences in the binding energies of O at these high symmetry sites. Obviously, O is strongly localized on the bridge than for the other two configurations. We then suggest that in such localized bonding, the Ptd electrons back donation to the adsorbed O may be seen more efficient. To verify this, we calculated the work function change of the surface upon O adsorption. The Pt surface with O on bridge has 0.25 eV increase in the workfunction (which is 0.08 eV higher than that of Pt surface with O on hollows). Generally, such changes in workfunction of the surface indicate considerable charge transfer to oxygen. Indeed, Bader charge analysis
[42]
,
[43]
,
[44]
of O/Pt/Fe(0 0 1) system gives 0.83e transfer to O on bridge and a 0.78e to O on hollows. It is also in this light that we can rationalize the lesser binding of O on Pt/Fe(0 0 1) as compared to clean Pt(0 0 1). The most stable O adsorption site on Pt(0 0 1) is on bridge with the calculated binding energy of 4.18 eV, in excellent agreement with Deskins et al.
[45]
. This is 0.28 eV more bound to clean Pt than on PtFe bimetallic system. Using Hammer and Nrskovs
[10]
d-band center model which has been useful in analyzing trends in adsorption on transition metal surfaces, this weakened binding in bimetallic system is expected as such systems generally exhibit d-band center downward shift in energy. Here, we specify the down shift of the d-band center of Pt/Fe(0 0 1) (3.07 eV) by 0.43 eV as compared to clean Pt. However, since trends are beyond the scope of this paper, we have included donation and backdonation mechanisms for more detailed understanding of the differences in O adsorption in these two systems. Moreover, Kitchin et al. has showed a good correlation of density of states at the Fermi level and d-band average energy at the calculated Pt/Fe(0 0 1) d-band center
[9]
. Also, the d-band filling of surface Pt atoms upon bimetallic formation is not completely conserved as observed in the marked drop in the surface workfunction. It is known that constant d-band filling should be ensured such that upon bimetallic interaction, the broadened d-band width can move up and down in energy to maintain the d-band occupancy
[46]
. Therefore, inclusion of the role of density states at the Fermi level may also prove helpful in understanding the chemisorption properties of this particular system. The calculated workfunction change of clean Pt(0 0 1) with O on bridge is 0.54 eV. Also, the charge transfer of 0.90 e to O is noted using the same charge transfer analysis as was previously mentioned. In view of cathode catalyst design, this analysis may be extended to a multi-adsorbate environment where for the simplest case, an oxygenated specie such as hydroxyl (OH) binding to Pt monolayer may be significantly lowered giving way for a reduced susceptibility to OH poisoning, a source of major decline in fuel cells efficiency

4. Conclusion
We performed spin-polarized first principles calculations to investigate the detailed electronic structure of Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) and its effect on O chemisorption. Layer by layer DOS curves for Pt monolayer on Fe(0 0 1) referenced to unreconstructed Pt (0 0 1) and Fe(0 0 1) systems shows a peak of d states at the Fermi level and spin polarization of dzz. First layer Fe atom shows moderate downshift in energy indicative of charge transfer from Fe atom site to the PtFe region as verified by the charge redistribution plot. Charge redistribution for Pt(0 0 1) also increase in charges at surface PtPt bonding sites. Binding energies of adsorbed O on the three different high symmetry sites show O atom preference on bridge over the hollow and top sites. The bonding mechanism is attributed to the efficiency of Pt d-electron back donation to adsorbed O which is driven by a more localized bonding in this site. Such mechanism is also utilized in rationalizing the observed lesser binding of O on such bimetallic system as compared to pure Pt(0 0 1) slab.
