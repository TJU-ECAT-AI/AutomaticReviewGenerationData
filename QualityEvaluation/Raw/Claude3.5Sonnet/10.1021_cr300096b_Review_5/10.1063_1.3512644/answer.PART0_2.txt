The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The document appears to focus on a Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic catalyst system, but does not provide details about the specific aspects asked in the question. There is insufficient information in the provided text to adequately address the question about implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications.
