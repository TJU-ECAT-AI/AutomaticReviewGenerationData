[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

[4] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems:

1. Surface segregation is driven by differences in surface energies and optimal nearest-neighbor distances between host and guest metals. For Pt-Ru and Pd-Ru systems, there is a strong tendency for Pt and Pd to segregate to the surface.

2. The stability of surface alloys depends on the balance between segregation energies and the entropic drive for bulk dissolution. PtRu and PdRu surface alloys on Ru(0001) are found to be stable surface configurations, metastable only towards bulk dissolution.

3. Segregation energies, calculated by DFT, are 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd in Ru(0001), indicating a strong thermodynamic preference for surface segregation.

4. Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, affect the equilibrium between surface segregation and bulk dissolution. Higher temperatures increase the probability of bulk dissolution due to entropy effects.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation of Pt or Pd in Ru-based catalysts can lead to Pt- or Pd-rich surfaces, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

2. The stability of surface alloys under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

3. The specific surface composition and structure resulting from segregation effects can influence catalytic selectivity and activity.

4. Understanding and controlling segregation behavior allows for the design of more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型:

1. 表面偏析是由主客金属之间的表面能差异和最佳近邻距离差异驱动的。对于Pt-Ru和Pd-Ru系统,Pt和Pd有强烈的倾向偏析到表面。

2. 表面合金的稳定性取决于偏析能和体相溶解的熵驱动之间的平衡。在Ru(0001)上的PtRu和PdRu表面合金被发现是稳定的表面构型,仅对体相溶解呈亚稳态。

3. 通过DFT计算的偏析能,Pt在Ru(0001)中为0.8 eV,Pd为1.0 eV,表明有强烈的热力学偏好趋向表面偏析。

4. 反应条件,特别是温度,影响表面偏析和体相溶解之间的平衡。较高的温度会由于熵效应增加体相溶解的概率。

这些因素对催化性能有重要影响:

1. Pt或Pd在基于Ru的催化剂中的表面偏析可导致Pt或Pd富集的表面,可能增强某些反应的催化活性。

2. 表面合金在反应条件下的稳定性对于长期保持催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 由偏析效应产生的特定表面组成和结构可影响催化选择性和活性。

4. 理解和控制偏析行为允许设计更高效和稳定的双金属催化剂用于各种应用。
