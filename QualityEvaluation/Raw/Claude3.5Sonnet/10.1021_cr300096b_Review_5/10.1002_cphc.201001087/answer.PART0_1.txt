[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[4] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

[5] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The key factors include:

1. Surface energy differences: Lower surface energy species tend to segregate to the surface. For Pt-Ru systems, Pt has a lower surface energy than Ru, promoting Pt surface segregation.

2. Atomic size mismatch: Larger guest atoms (like Pt) tend to segregate to the surface to relieve strain in the host lattice (like Ru).

3. Segregation energies: DFT calculations show significant segregation energies for Pt and Pd in Ru, favoring their surface segregation.

4. Temperature: Higher temperatures can overcome kinetic barriers and allow the system to reach thermodynamic equilibrium, potentially changing surface composition.

These factors result in Pt (or Pd) preferentially segregating to the surface in Pt-Ru (or Pd-Ru) alloys. This surface enrichment can significantly affect catalytic properties by:

1. Altering the surface electronic structure, potentially modifying adsorption energies of reactants and intermediates.

2. Changing the geometric arrangement of surface atoms, which can affect the availability of active sites.

3. Influencing the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, as surface segregation can continue during catalysis.

4. Potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions due to synergistic effects between surface Pt and subsurface Ru.

Understanding and controlling these phenomena are crucial for designing stable and efficient bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical reactions, and heterogeneous catalysis.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。关键因素包括：

1. 表面能差异：较低表面能的物种倾向于偏析到表面。对于Pt-Ru系统，Pt的表面能低于Ru，促进Pt的表面偏析。

2. 原子尺寸不匹配：较大的客体原子（如Pt）倾向于偏析到表面以缓解主体晶格（如Ru）中的应变。

3. 偏析能：DFT计算显示Pt和Pd在Ru中具有显著的偏析能，有利于它们的表面偏析。

4. 温度：较高的温度可以克服动力学障碍，使系统达到热力学平衡，可能改变表面组成。

这些因素导致Pt（或Pd）在Pt-Ru（或Pd-Ru）合金中优先偏析到表面。这种表面富集可以显著影响催化性能：

1. 改变表面电子结构，可能修改反应物和中间体的吸附能。

2. 改变表面原子的几何排列，这可能影响活性位点的可用性。

3. 影响催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性，因为表面偏析可能在催化过程中持续进行。

4. 由于表面Pt和亚表面Ru之间的协同效应，可能增强某些反应的催化活性。

理解和控制这些现象对于设计稳定和高效的双金属催化剂至关重要，适用于各种应用，如燃料电池、电化学反应和多相催化。
