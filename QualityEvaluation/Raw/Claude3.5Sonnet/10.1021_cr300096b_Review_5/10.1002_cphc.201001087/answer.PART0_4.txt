[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."

[2] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[3] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[4] "Recently, DFT based calculations yielded segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001)."

[5] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The stability of these surface alloys is determined by the interaction energies between the two metal components and their segregation energies. Surface segregation is driven by differences in surface energies and optimal nearest-neighbor distances between the host and guest metals.

For Pt-based systems, particularly Pt-Ru alloys, there is a strong tendency for Pt to segregate to the surface. This is due to the lower surface energy of Pt compared to Ru, as well as the size mismatch between Pt and Ru atoms. The segregation energy for Pt in Ru(0001) is approximately 0.8 eV, which provides a significant driving force for surface segregation.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts is influenced by the preparation conditions and annealing temperatures. Higher annealing temperatures generally lead to more stable and well-defined surface alloy structures. However, these surface alloys are metastable with respect to bulk dissolution at very high temperatures due to entropy effects.

These thermodynamic preferences and structural configurations have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Surface segregation of Pt can lead to Pt-rich surfaces, which may enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions. The stability of these surface alloys ensures that the catalytic properties remain consistent under operating conditions. However, the metastability towards bulk dissolution at very high temperatures may limit the use of these catalysts in extreme temperature applications.

The specific atomic arrangement and composition of the surface layer can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For example, the presence of both Pt and Ru atoms in the surface layer of Pt-Ru alloys can provide unique catalytic sites that combine the properties of both metals, potentially leading to enhanced activity and selectivity for certain reactions.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and structural configurations is crucial for designing effective bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical reactions, and hydrogenation processes. By tailoring the composition, preparation methods, and treatment conditions, researchers can optimize the surface structure and composition to achieve desired catalytic properties for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。这些表面合金的稳定性由两种金属组分之间的相互作用能和它们的偏析能决定。表面偏析由主体金属和客体金属之间的表面能差异和最佳近邻距离差异驱动。

对于基于Pt的系统，特别是Pt-Ru合金，Pt具有强烈的倾向偏析到表面。这是由于Pt相比Ru具有较低的表面能，以及Pt和Ru原子之间的尺寸不匹配。Pt在Ru(0001)中的偏析能约为0.8 eV，这为表面偏析提供了显著的驱动力。

这些双金属催化剂的结构构型受制备条件和退火温度的影响。较高的退火温度通常会导致更稳定和更明确的表面合金结构。然而，由于熵效应，这些表面合金在非常高的温度下相对于体相溶解是亚稳定的。

这些热力学偏好和结构构型对催化性能和性能有重要影响。Pt的表面偏析可能导致富Pt表面，这可能增强某些反应的催化活性。这些表面合金的稳定性确保了催化性能在工作条件下保持一致。然而，在极高温度下对体相溶解的亚稳定性可能限制这些催化剂在极端温度应用中的使用。

表面层的具体原子排列和组成可以显著影响催化性能。例如，Pt-Ru合金表面层中Pt和Ru原子的同时存在可以提供结合两种金属性质的独特催化位点，可能导致某些反应的活性和选择性增强。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好和结构构型对于设计各种应用的有效双金属催化剂至关重要，如燃料电池、电化学反应和加氢过程。通过调整组成、制备方法和处理条件，研究人员可以优化表面结构和组成，以实现特定应用所需的催化性能。
