[1] "Surface alloys, with a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have attracted increasing interest as model systems for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-defined structure."

[2] "If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys."

[3] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."

[4] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."

[5] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems:

1. Surface energy differences between metals drive surface segregation. Lower surface energy metals like Pt and Pd tend to segregate to the surface when alloyed with higher surface energy metals like Ru.

2. Atomic size mismatch also promotes surface segregation. Larger guest atoms (e.g. Pt, Pd) in a host lattice of smaller atoms (e.g. Ru) experience tensile stress, favoring their segregation to the surface.

3. Annealing temperature affects the degree of surface segregation and alloy formation. Higher temperatures allow for more atomic mobility and can lead to more complete surface segregation of the lower surface energy component.

4. The initial composition and preparation method influence the final surface structure. Different deposition amounts and sequences can result in varied surface alloy configurations.

5. These factors combine to create well-defined surface alloy structures with specific compositions and distributions of metal atoms at the surface.

The resulting surface structures and compositions directly impact catalytic properties:

1. Surface segregation can create active sites with specific electronic and geometric properties.

2. The distribution of metal atoms at the surface (random vs clustered) affects adsorption and reaction energetics.

3. Strain effects from lattice mismatch can modify the d-band center and reactivity of surface atoms.

4. The stability of the surface structure under reaction conditions will influence catalyst lifetime and performance.

5. The ability to control surface composition through preparation methods allows for tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences enables the design of bimetallic catalysts with optimized surface structures for specific catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以铂为基础的系统中：

1. 金属间的表面能差异驱动表面偏析。当与表面能较高的金属（如钌）合金时，表面能较低的金属（如铂和钯）倾向于偏析到表面。

2. 原子尺寸不匹配也促进表面偏析。在较小原子（如钌）的主体晶格中，较大的客体原子（如铂、钯）会经历拉伸应力，有利于它们偏析到表面。

3. 退火温度影响表面偏析和合金形成的程度。较高的温度允许更多的原子移动性，可以导致表面能较低的组分更完全地偏析到表面。

4. 初始组成和制备方法影响最终的表面结构。不同的沉积量和顺序可能导致不同的表面合金构型。

5. 这些因素结合起来，创造出具有特定组成和表面金属原子分布的明确定义的表面合金结构。

由此产生的表面结构和组成直接影响催化性能：

1. 表面偏析可以创造具有特定电子和几何性质的活性位点。

2. 表面金属原子的分布（随机或聚集）影响吸附和反应能量学。

3. 晶格不匹配引起的应变效应可以修改表面原子的d带中心和反应活性。

4. 反应条件下表面结构的稳定性将影响催化剂寿命和性能。

5. 通过制备方法控制表面组成的能力允许调节催化活性和选择性。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好使得可以设计出表面结构优化的双金属催化剂，以用于特定的催化应用。
