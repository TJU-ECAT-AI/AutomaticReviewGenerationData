[1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of Ag-Pt, several factors come into play:

1. Stress in adlayers: This can promote surface alloying even for elements that are immiscible in bulk.

2. Surface confinement: The AgPt alloy tends to be confined to the topmost layer due to a positive exchange energy, which favors AgAg bonds.

3. Strain minimization: This favors the dissolution of Ag in the surface layer of Pt.

4. Temperature effects: At low temperatures, Ag and Pt can undergo place exchange in the first and second layers, quickly adjusting to a new equilibrium composition.

These factors result in a complex interplay that determines the surface structure and composition. The tendency for Ag to remain at the surface due to its lower surface energy competes with the entropy-driven mixing at higher temperatures. This balance affects the catalytic properties by influencing the distribution and availability of active sites on the surface.

The confinement of the alloy to the surface layer can lead to unique catalytic properties, as it creates a distinct chemical environment different from either pure metal. The nanophasic structure observed in Ag-Pt systems can provide a high density of interface sites, which are often associated with enhanced catalytic activity.

Temperature-dependent structural changes, such as the reversible diffusion of Ag into and out of the surface layer, suggest that the catalytic properties of these systems can be tuned by controlling the reaction temperature. This offers the possibility of creating dynamic catalysts whose surface composition and structure can be adjusted in situ to optimize performance for specific reactions or reaction conditions.

These insights into the behavior of Ag-Pt systems can be extended to other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, highlighting the importance of considering surface energies, lattice mismatch, and temperature effects when designing and optimizing catalytic systems for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。以Ag-Pt为例，有几个因素起作用：

1. 吸附层的应力：这可以促进表面合金化，即使是在体相中不互溶的元素。

2. 表面限制：由于正的交换能，AgPt合金倾向于局限于最外层，这有利于AgAg键的形成。

3. 应变最小化：这有利于Ag在Pt表面层的溶解。

4. 温度效应：在低温下，Ag和Pt可以在第一层和第二层之间进行位置交换，迅速调整到新的平衡组成。

这些因素之间的复杂相互作用决定了表面结构和组成。Ag由于其较低的表面能而倾向于留在表面，与高温下熵驱动的混合相竞争。这种平衡通过影响表面活性位的分布和可用性来影响催化性能。

合金限制在表面层可以导致独特的催化性能，因为它创造了一个不同于纯金属的独特化学环境。在Ag-Pt系统中观察到的纳米相结构可以提供高密度的界面位点，这通常与增强的催化活性相关。

温度依赖的结构变化，如Ag在表面层的可逆扩散，表明这些系统的催化性能可以通过控制反应温度来调节。这提供了创建动态催化剂的可能性，其表面组成和结构可以原位调整，以优化特定反应或反应条件的性能。

这些关于Ag-Pt系统行为的见解可以推广到其他基于Pt的双金属催化剂，强调在设计和优化各种应用的催化系统时考虑表面能、晶格失配和温度效应的重要性。
