[1] "Deposition of submonolayer amounts of silver and subsequent annealing to above 620 K forms an intermixed AgPt surface with nanometer-sized silver agglomerates embedded in a Pt matrix, or vice versa, depending on the Ag coverage"

[2] "It was proposed that alloying of Ag with Pt reduces stress in pseudomorphic Ag layers and thus alloy formation is a means for reducing the free energy of the system."

[3] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy"

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. In Ag-Pt systems:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role. Annealing above 620 K leads to the formation of an intermixed AgPt surface with nanometer-sized agglomerates.

2. Alloying reduces stress in pseudomorphic layers, minimizing the system's free energy.

3. The intermixed alloy tends to be confined to the topmost layer due to a positive exchange energy, which favors clustering of Ag and Pt in the surface layer.

4. At lower temperatures, Ag and Pt can undergo place exchange in the first and second layers, quickly adjusting to a new equilibrium composition.

These factors affect the catalytic properties by influencing the surface composition and structure. The nanometer-sized agglomerates and the confinement of the alloy to the topmost layer can create unique active sites for catalysis. The ability of the surface to adjust its composition with temperature changes may also lead to dynamic catalytic behavior under different reaction conditions.

The implications for catalytic performance include:

1. Tunable surface composition and structure through temperature control.
2. Potential for creating highly active and selective catalytic sites through controlled alloying and segregation.
3. Possibility of dynamic catalytic behavior responsive to reaction conditions.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on structure can guide the design of more efficient and stable Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂（如基于Pt的系统）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。在Ag-Pt系统中：

1. 温度起着关键作用。在620 K以上退火会导致形成纳米级聚集体的混合AgPt表面。

2. 合金化减少了赝晶层的应力，最小化系统的自由能。

3. 由于正的交换能，混合合金倾向于局限于最表层，这有利于Ag和Pt在表面层的聚集。

4. 在较低温度下，Ag和Pt可以在第一层和第二层之间进行位置交换，迅速调整到新的平衡组成。

这些因素通过影响表面组成和结构来影响催化性能。纳米级聚集体和合金局限于最表层可以创造独特的催化活性位点。表面随温度变化调整组成的能力也可能导致在不同反应条件下的动态催化行为。

对催化性能的影响包括：

1. 通过温度控制可调节的表面组成和结构。
2. 通过控制合金化和偏析创造高活性和高选择性催化位点的潜力。
3. 对反应条件响应的动态催化行为的可能性。

理解这些热力学偏好及其对结构的影响可以指导设计更高效和稳定的基于Pt的双金属催化剂，用于各种应用。
