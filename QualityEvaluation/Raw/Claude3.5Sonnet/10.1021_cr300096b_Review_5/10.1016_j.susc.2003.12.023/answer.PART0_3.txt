[1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "Intermixing of Ag and Pt appears to be unfavorable because it was previously claimed that Ag and Pt possesses a positive exchange energy and Ag has a lower surface energy. However, the entropic contribution to the free energy may drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In the case of Ag-Pt, several factors come into play:

1. Stress in adlayers: This can promote surface alloying even for elements that are immiscible in bulk.

2. Positive exchange energy: This favors clustering of like atoms (e.g., Ag-Ag bonds) in the surface layer.

3. Strain minimization: This promotes the dissolution of Ag in the surface layer of Pt.

4. Surface energy differences: Ag has a lower surface energy than Pt, which tends to favor Ag segregation to the surface.

5. Entropic contributions: At higher temperatures, entropy can drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface, even when it appears thermodynamically unfavorable.

These factors result in a complex interplay that determines the final structure and composition of the bimetallic surface. For Ag-Pt, this leads to a surface-confined alloy with a tendency for Ag clustering in the topmost layer.

The implications for catalytic properties and performance are significant. The surface composition and structure directly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. The confinement of the alloy to the surface layer can lead to unique electronic and geometric effects that may enhance catalytic performance. The clustering tendency can create specific active sites at the interfaces between Ag and Pt domains. Additionally, the temperature-dependent mixing behavior suggests that the catalyst structure and performance may be tunable by controlling the reaction temperature.

These insights into the thermodynamic behavior of Pt-based bimetallic systems can guide the design and optimization of catalysts for various applications, allowing for the tailoring of surface compositions and structures to achieve desired catalytic properties.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。以Ag-Pt为例，有几个因素起作用：

1. 吸附层的应力：这可以促进即使在体相不互溶的元素之间也能发生表面合金化。

2. 正交换能：这有利于表面层中同类原子（如Ag-Ag键）的聚集。

3. 应变最小化：这促进了Ag在Pt表面层的溶解。

4. 表面能差异：Ag的表面能低于Pt，这倾向于促进Ag向表面偏析。

5. 熵的贡献：在较高温度下，熵可以驱动表面的有限混合和无序化，即使这在热力学上看似不利。

这些因素相互作用，共同决定了双金属表面的最终结构和组成。对于Ag-Pt，这导致了一个局限于表面的合金，其中Ag在最表层有聚集的倾向。

这对催化性能和表现有重要影响。表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。合金局限于表面层可以产生独特的电子和几何效应，可能增强催化性能。聚集趋势可以在Ag和Pt域之间的界面创造特定的活性位点。此外，温度依赖的混合行为表明，可以通过控制反应温度来调节催化剂结构和性能。

这些关于基于Pt的双金属系统热力学行为的见解可以指导各种应用中催化剂的设计和优化，允许通过调整表面组成和结构来实现所需的催化性能。
