[1] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

[2] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."

[3] "Intermixing of Ag and Pt appears to be unfavorable because it was previously claimed that Ag and Pt possesses a positive exchange energy and Ag has a lower surface energy. However, the entropic contribution to the free energy may drive limited mixing and disordering of the surface."

[4] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are influenced by a complex interplay of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In the case of Ag-Pt systems:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the surface composition and structure. At lower temperatures, Ag tends to remain segregated at the surface due to its lower surface energy. However, as temperature increases, entropy-driven mixing becomes more favorable, leading to limited alloying and disordering of the surface.

2. The formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy is observed at temperatures above 600 K. This alloy formation begins at the edges of Ag adislands and spreads across the surface through an exchange process between Ag and Pt atoms.

3. Despite the positive exchange energy between Ag and Pt, which would typically discourage mixing, the entropic contribution to free energy at higher temperatures can overcome this barrier and drive limited mixing and surface disordering.

4. The alloy formation is primarily confined to the surface layer, but prolonged heating at elevated temperatures can result in limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt.

5. The system exhibits a dynamic equilibrium, with fast place exchange between Ag and Pt atoms in the first and second layers at relatively low temperatures. This allows the surface to quickly adjust to new equilibrium compositions as temperature changes.

These thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The formation of a nanophasic surface alloy can create unique active sites that may enhance catalytic activity or selectivity for certain reactions.

2. The temperature-dependent surface composition allows for tunable catalytic properties, as the ratio of Ag to Pt at the surface can be controlled by adjusting the temperature.

3. The confinement of the alloy primarily to the surface layer maintains a high concentration of active metals at the surface, which is beneficial for catalysis.

4. The dynamic nature of the surface composition at elevated temperatures may lead to increased stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, as the surface can continuously readjust to maintain an optimal configuration.

5. The limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt at very high temperatures could potentially impact long-term stability and performance of the catalyst.

Understanding these thermodynamic and kinetic factors allows for the rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance for specific applications, by carefully controlling composition, temperature, and reaction conditions.

铂基双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的复杂相互作用影响。在Ag-Pt系统中：

1. 温度在决定表面组成和结构方面起着至关重要的作用。在较低温度下，由于银的表面能较低，倾向于在表面偏析。然而，随着温度升高，熵驱动的混合变得更有利，导致表面的有限合金化和无序化。

2. 在600 K以上的温度下观察到纳米相AgPt合金的形成。这种合金形成始于Ag岛状结构的边缘，并通过Ag和Pt原子之间的交换过程在表面扩散。

3. 尽管Ag和Pt之间存在正的交换能，这通常会阻碍混合，但在高温下自由能的熵贡献可以克服这一障碍，驱动有限的混合和表面无序化。

4. 合金形成主要局限于表面层，但在高温下长时间加热可导致Ag有限地溶解到Pt体相中。

5. 该系统表现出动态平衡，在相对较低的温度下，Ag和Pt原子在第一层和第二层之间快速交换位置。这使得表面能够随温度变化快速调整到新的平衡组成。

这些热力学偏好和反应条件对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 纳米相表面合金的形成可以创造独特的活性位点，可能增强某些反应的催化活性或选择性。

2. 温度依赖的表面组成允许可调的催化性能，因为表面Ag与Pt的比例可以通过调节温度来控制。

3. 合金主要局限于表面层维持了表面高浓度的活性金属，这对催化反应有利。

4. 在高温下表面组成的动态性质可能会导致催化剂在反应条件下稳定性增加，因为表面可以持续重新调整以保持最佳构型。

5. 在非常高的温度下Ag向Pt体相的有限溶解可能会影响催化剂的长期稳定性和性能。

理解这些热力学和动力学因素允许通过仔细控制组成、温度和反应条件，为特定应用理性设计具有优化性能的铂基双金属催化剂。
