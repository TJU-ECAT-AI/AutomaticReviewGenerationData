[1] "Tersoff [19] generalized the importance of stress in adlayers to explain surface alloying of elements that are immiscible in the bulk."

[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal. This and the clustering of Ag and Pt in the intermixed surface layer was explained by a positive exchange energy (with negative ε values)."

[3] "Thus, the observed structure of Ag clusters in a Pt matrix is a result of strain minimization that favors dissolution of Ag in the surface layer and a positive exchange energy that favors AgAg bonds."

[4] "We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant."

[5] "Annealing to higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K) allows for diffusion deeper into the bulk or accelerates it to a measurable value. This is a slower process with a higher activation barrier."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. For Pt-Ag alloys:

1. Stress in adlayers plays a crucial role in surface alloying, even for elements immiscible in bulk.

2. Surface segregation is observed, with the alloy confined to the topmost layer due to a positive exchange energy.

3. The structure formation is driven by strain minimization (favoring Ag dissolution in the surface layer) and positive exchange energy (promoting Ag-Ag bonding).

4. Temperature affects the alloy configuration:
   - At lower temperatures, Ag and Pt can quickly exchange places between the first and second layers.
   - At higher temperatures (e.g., 800 K), slower bulk diffusion occurs.

5. The balance between entropy and surface energy influences the alloy structure:
   - Higher temperatures increase configurational disorder through mixing.
   - Upon cooling, Ag tends to segregate to the surface to lower the system's free energy.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The surface composition and structure can be tuned by controlling temperature and initial composition.
2. The confinement of alloying to the surface layer may preserve bulk properties while modifying surface reactivity.
3. The ability to create nanophasic structures through annealing can potentially enhance catalytic activity and selectivity.
4. The reversible nature of surface segregation with temperature changes allows for dynamic control of catalyst surface composition during reactions.

Understanding these thermodynamic and kinetic factors enables the design of more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。对于Pt-Ag合金：

1. 吸附层中的应力在表面合金化中起着至关重要的作用，即使是体相不互溶的元素也是如此。

2. 由于正的交换能，观察到表面偏析现象，合金仅限于最表层。

3. 结构形成由应变最小化（有利于Ag在表面层溶解）和正交换能（促进Ag-Ag键合）驱动。

4. 温度影响合金构型：
   - 在较低温度下，Ag和Pt可以在第一层和第二层之间快速交换位置。
   - 在较高温度（如800 K）下，发生较慢的体扩散。

5. 熵和表面能之间的平衡影响合金结构：
   - 较高温度通过混合增加构型无序度。
   - 冷却时，Ag倾向于偏析到表面以降低系统的自由能。

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 可以通过控制温度和初始成分来调节表面组成和结构。
2. 合金化限制在表面层可能保留体相性质，同时改变表面反应活性。
3. 通过退火创建纳米相结构的能力可能增强催化活性和选择性。
4. 温度变化导致的表面偏析的可逆性允许在反应过程中动态控制催化剂表面组成。

理解这些热力学和动力学因素使得能够设计出更高效、更稳定的双金属催化剂，适用于各种应用。
