          [1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

[5] "Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

[6] "Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This influence has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electrocatalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing efficient and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.
2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.
3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the extent of surface segregation in Pt-based alloys. The addition of a third component can significantly alter surface segregation behavior. For instance, in Pt3Ni alloys, replacing Ni with certain transition metals (V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, Ir) enhances Pt surface segregation, while others (Ag, Au, Pd) can completely suppress it. The atomic size of the third component relative to Pt also plays a role, with smaller atoms better maintaining Pt surface segregation.

The resulting surface structures, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in specific layers, can significantly affect the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the catalyst. This allows for fine-tuning of catalyst properties through careful selection of alloying elements and synthesis conditions.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on surface segregation enables the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By optimizing surface composition and structure, it's possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这种影响对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要意义。

表面偏析，即表面成分与体相不同的现象，是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。对于Pt合金电催化剂，Pt的表面偏析对提高氧还原反应(ORR)动力学至关重要，使其成为开发高效和经济的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池(PEMFCs)催化剂的重要考虑因素。

三种主要的物理机制支配二元合金中的表面偏析：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。
2. 应变效应：当原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常会偏析到表面以减少应变能。
3. 溶解热效应：负溶解热促进多数组分在表面富集，以最大化体相中的混合。

这些效应共同决定了基于Pt的合金中表面偏析的程度。第三组分的添加可以显著改变表面偏析行为。例如，在Pt3Ni合金中，用某些过渡金属（V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os、Ir）替代Ni可以增强Pt的表面偏析，而其他金属（Ag、Au、Pd）则可以完全抑制它。第三组分相对于Pt的原子尺寸也起着重要作用，较小的原子更能维持Pt的表面偏析。

由此产生的表面结构，特别是某些元素在特定层中的富集，可以显著影响催化剂的电子结构和催化行为。这允许通过仔细选择合金元素和合成条件来微调催化剂性质。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好及其对表面偏析的影响，使得设计更高效和耐久的催化剂成为可能。通过优化表面成分和结构，可以增强各种应用（包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程）的催化活性、选择性和稳定性。
