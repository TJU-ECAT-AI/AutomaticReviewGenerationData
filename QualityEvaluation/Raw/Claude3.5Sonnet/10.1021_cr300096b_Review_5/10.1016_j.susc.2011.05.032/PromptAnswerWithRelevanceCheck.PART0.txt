[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the chemical composition at the surface differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalytic properties. For Pt alloy electro-catalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, which is important for developing efficient catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component typically segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.

3. Heat of solution effect: If the heat of solution is negative, the majority component enriches the surface to maximize mixing in the bulk.

For Pt-based alloys like Pt3Ni, these effects collectively determine the extent of Pt surface segregation. The relative Pt surface segregation energy (surface energy effect), lattice mismatch (strain effect), and heat of solution all play roles in determining the final surface composition and structure.

Understanding and controlling these factors allows for tailoring the surface electronic structure and composition of Pt-based alloys. This, in turn, affects their catalytic properties and performance in applications such as fuel cells. By manipulating these thermodynamic preferences through alloying or reaction conditions, researchers can develop more efficient and cost-effective catalysts with enhanced activity and stability.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

表面偏析，即表面化学成分与体相不同的现象，是影响催化性能的关键因素。对于铂合金电催化剂，铂表面偏析对改善氧还原反应（ORR）动力学至关重要，这对开发高效的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）催化剂很重要。

三个主要的物理机制支配二元合金中的表面偏析：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。

2. 应变效应：当原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常偏析到表面以减少应变能。

3. 溶解热效应：如果溶解热为负，主要组分会富集到表面以最大化体相中的混合。

对于基于铂的合金如Pt3Ni，这些效应共同决定了铂表面偏析的程度。相对铂表面偏析能（表面能效应）、晶格失配（应变效应）和溶解热都在决定最终表面成分和结构中发挥作用。

理解和控制这些因素允许调整基于铂的合金的表面电子结构和成分。这反过来影响它们在燃料电池等应用中的催化性能。通过合金化或反应条件操纵这些热力学偏好，研究人员可以开发出更高效和更具成本效益的催化剂，具有增强的活性和稳定性。

It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

[4] "Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

The addition of a third metal induces tensile strain, driving the largest component atoms to the outermost surface layer. Transition metals smaller than Pt better maintain Pt surface segregation.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Surface segregation affects various material properties, including catalysis, oxidation, and surface adsorption. By controlling the composition and structure of the catalyst surface through selective segregation, it's possible to tailor the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of Pt ternary alloys. This understanding can guide the development of low-cost, high-performance, and durable Pt ternary alloy catalysts for applications such as fuel cells.

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响。表面偏析影响各种材料性质，包括催化、氧化和表面吸附。通过选择性偏析控制催化剂表面的成分和结构，可以调整Pt三元合金的电子结构和催化行为。这种理解可以指导开发低成本、高性能和耐用的Pt三元合金催化剂，用于燃料电池等应用。

These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, plays a crucial role in determining catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electro-catalysts, Pt surface segregation is known to improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing effective and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

The extent and nature of surface segregation are governed by three main physical mechanisms:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When there is a significant size difference between components, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.

3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the final surface composition and structure. For example, in Pt75Ni25 alloys, surface segregation results in 100% Pt in the outermost layer and 50% Pt in the sub-layer of the (111) surface.

The addition of a third component can further modify surface segregation behavior, either promoting or suppressing it based on its preference for surface or bulk regions and its interactions with the other components. This allows for fine-tuning of catalyst properties through careful selection of alloying elements.

The resulting surface structures, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in subsurface layers, can significantly affect the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the outermost layer. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for tailoring the properties of Pt-based catalysts for specific applications.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on surface segregation enables the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By optimizing surface composition and structure, it's possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

这些效应共同决定了最终的表面成分和结构。例如，在Pt75Ni25合金中，表面偏析导致(111)表面的最外层为100%的Pt，而次表层为50%的Pt。

第三组分的添加可以进一步修改表面偏析行为，根据其对表面或体相区域的偏好以及与其他组分的相互作用，可以促进或抑制偏析。这允许通过仔细选择合金元素来微调催化剂性质。

由此产生的表面结构，特别是某些元素在次表面层的富集，可以显著影响最外层的电子结构和催化行为。这一现象对于调整基于Pt的催化剂的特定应用性能特别相关。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好及其对表面偏析的影响，使得设计更高效和耐久的催化剂成为可能。通过优化表面成分和结构，可以增强各种应用（包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程）的催化活性、选择性和稳定性。
