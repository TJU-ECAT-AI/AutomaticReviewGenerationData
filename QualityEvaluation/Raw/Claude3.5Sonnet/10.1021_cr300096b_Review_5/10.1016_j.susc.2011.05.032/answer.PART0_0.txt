[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the chemical composition at the surface differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalytic properties. For Pt alloy electro-catalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, which is important for developing efficient catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component typically segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.

3. Heat of solution effect: If the heat of solution is negative, the majority component enriches the surface to maximize mixing in the bulk.

For Pt-based alloys like Pt3Ni, these effects collectively determine the extent of Pt surface segregation. The relative Pt surface segregation energy (surface energy effect), lattice mismatch (strain effect), and heat of solution all play roles in determining the final surface composition and structure.

Understanding and controlling these factors allows for tailoring the surface electronic structure and composition of Pt-based alloys. This, in turn, affects their catalytic properties and performance in applications such as fuel cells. By manipulating these thermodynamic preferences through alloying or reaction conditions, researchers can develop more efficient and cost-effective catalysts with enhanced activity and stability.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

表面偏析，即表面化学成分与体相不同的现象，是影响催化性能的关键因素。对于铂合金电催化剂，铂表面偏析对改善氧还原反应（ORR）动力学至关重要，这对开发高效的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）催化剂很重要。

三个主要的物理机制支配二元合金中的表面偏析：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。

2. 应变效应：当原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常偏析到表面以减少应变能。

3. 溶解热效应：如果溶解热为负，主要组分会富集到表面以最大化体相中的混合。

对于基于铂的合金如Pt3Ni，这些效应共同决定了铂表面偏析的程度。相对铂表面偏析能（表面能效应）、晶格失配（应变效应）和溶解热都在决定最终表面成分和结构中发挥作用。

理解和控制这些因素允许调整基于铂的合金的表面电子结构和成分。这反过来影响它们在燃料电池等应用中的催化性能。通过合金化或反应条件操纵这些热力学偏好，研究人员可以开发出更高效和更具成本效益的催化剂，具有增强的活性和稳定性。
