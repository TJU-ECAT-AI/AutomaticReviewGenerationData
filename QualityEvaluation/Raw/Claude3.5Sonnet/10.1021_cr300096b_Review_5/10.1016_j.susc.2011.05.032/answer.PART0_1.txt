[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[3] "Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

[4] "Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. Three main mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component typically segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.

3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution causes the majority component to enrich the surface, maximizing bulk mixing.

For Pt-based systems, adding a third transition metal can significantly alter Pt surface segregation. Some metals (V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, Ir) enhance Pt segregation, while others (Ag, Au, Pd) inhibit it. The addition of a third metal induces tensile strain, driving the largest component atoms to the outermost surface layer. Transition metals smaller than Pt better maintain Pt surface segregation.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Surface segregation affects various material properties, including catalysis, oxidation, and surface adsorption. By controlling the composition and structure of the catalyst surface through selective segregation, it's possible to tailor the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of Pt ternary alloys. This understanding can guide the development of low-cost, high-performance, and durable Pt ternary alloy catalysts for applications such as fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。三种主要机制控制二元合金中的表面偏析：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。

2. 应变效应：当原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常会偏析到表面以减少应变能。

3. 溶解热效应：负溶解热导致主要组分富集表面，最大化体相混合。

对于基于Pt的系统，添加第三种过渡金属可以显著改变Pt的表面偏析。某些金属（V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os、Ir）增强Pt偏析，而其他金属（Ag、Au、Pd）则抑制偏析。添加第三种金属会引起拉伸应变，驱使最大组分原子向最外层表面迁移。原子尺寸小于Pt的过渡金属能更好地维持Pt的表面偏析。

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响。表面偏析影响各种材料性质，包括催化、氧化和表面吸附。通过选择性偏析控制催化剂表面的成分和结构，可以调整Pt三元合金的电子结构和催化行为。这种理解可以指导开发低成本、高性能和耐用的Pt三元合金催化剂，用于燃料电池等应用。
