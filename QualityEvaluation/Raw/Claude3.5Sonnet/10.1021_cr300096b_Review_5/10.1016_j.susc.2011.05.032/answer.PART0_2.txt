[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For instance, it was found that due to surface segregation there would be 100% Pt in the outermost layer but only 50% Pt (namely, 50% Ni) in the sub-layer of the (111) surface of Pt75Ni25 alloy."

[4] "Generally speaking, a third component may promote or suppress the surface segregation in the based binary alloys, depending on its preference to stay in the surface or bulk regions and its strength of interaction with the other two component metals"

[5] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, plays a crucial role in determining catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electro-catalysts, Pt surface segregation is known to improve oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing effective and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

The extent and nature of surface segregation are governed by three main physical mechanisms:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When there is a significant size difference between components, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.

3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the final surface composition and structure. For example, in Pt75Ni25 alloys, surface segregation results in 100% Pt in the outermost layer and 50% Pt in the sub-layer of the (111) surface.

The addition of a third component can further modify surface segregation behavior, either promoting or suppressing it based on its preference for surface or bulk regions and its interactions with the other components. This allows for fine-tuning of catalyst properties through careful selection of alloying elements.

The resulting surface structures, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in subsurface layers, can significantly affect the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the outermost layer. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for tailoring the properties of Pt-based catalysts for specific applications.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and their effects on surface segregation enables the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By optimizing surface composition and structure, it's possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, including fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

表面偏析（即表面成分与体相不同）在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。对于Pt合金电催化剂，Pt表面偏析已知可以改善氧还原反应（ORR）动力学，这在开发高效和经济的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）催化剂时是一个重要考虑因素。

表面偏析的程度和性质主要由三种物理机制支配：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。

2. 应变效应：当组分之间存在显著的尺寸差异时，较大的组分通常会偏析到表面以减少应变能。

3. 溶解热效应：负溶解热促进多数组分在表面富集，以最大化体相中的混合。

这些效应共同决定了最终的表面成分和结构。例如，在Pt75Ni25合金中，表面偏析导致(111)表面的最外层为100%的Pt，而次表层为50%的Pt。

第三组分的添加可以进一步修改表面偏析行为，根据其对表面或体相区域的偏好以及与其他组分的相互作用，可以促进或抑制偏析。这允许通过仔细选择合金元素来微调催化剂性质。

由此产生的表面结构，特别是某些元素在次表面层的富集，可以显著影响最外层的电子结构和催化行为。这一现象对于调整基于Pt的催化剂的特定应用性能特别相关。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好及其对表面偏析的影响，使得设计更高效和耐久的催化剂成为可能。通过优化表面成分和结构，可以增强各种应用（包括燃料电池和其他电化学过程）的催化活性、选择性和稳定性。
