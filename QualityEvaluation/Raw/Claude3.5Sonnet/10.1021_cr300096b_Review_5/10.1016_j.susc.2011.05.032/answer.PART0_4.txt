[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. This influence has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Surface segregation, where the surface composition differs from the bulk, is a key phenomenon affecting catalyst properties. For Pt alloy electrocatalysts, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing efficient and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Three main physical mechanisms govern surface segregation in binary alloys:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.
2. Strain effect: When atomic sizes differ significantly, the larger component often segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy.
3. Heat of solution effect: A negative heat of solution promotes surface enrichment of the majority component to maximize mixing in the bulk.

In Pt-based systems, these effects can be manipulated by introducing a third component. For instance, in Pt3Ni alloys, replacing Ni with certain transition metals (V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, Ir) enhances Pt surface segregation, while others (Ag, Au, Pd) can completely suppress it. This ability to tune surface composition through alloying offers a powerful tool for optimizing catalyst performance.

The implications of these thermodynamic preferences and structural configurations are significant for catalytic properties and performance. By controlling surface composition and structure, researchers can tailor electronic properties, active site distributions, and stability of catalysts. This allows for the development of more efficient, durable, and cost-effective catalysts for applications such as fuel cells, where optimized surface properties are crucial for enhancing reaction kinetics and overall performance.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这种影响对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要意义。

表面偏析，即表面成分与体相不同的现象，是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。对于Pt合金电催化剂，Pt的表面偏析对提高氧还原反应(ORR)动力学至关重要，使其成为开发高效和经济的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池(PEMFCs)催化剂的重要考虑因素。

三种主要的物理机制支配二元合金中的表面偏析：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。
2. 应变效应：当原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常会偏析到表面以减少应变能。
3. 溶解热效应：负溶解热促进多数组分在表面富集，以最大化体相中的混合。

在基于Pt的系统中，这些效应可以通过引入第三组分来操纵。例如，在Pt3Ni合金中，用某些过渡金属（V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os、Ir）替代Ni可以增强Pt的表面偏析，而其他金属（Ag、Au、Pd）则可以完全抑制它。这种通过合金化调节表面成分的能力为优化催化剂性能提供了强大的工具。

这些热力学偏好和结构构型对催化性能的影响是显著的。通过控制表面成分和结构，研究人员可以调整催化剂的电子性质、活性位分布和稳定性。这允许开发更高效、更耐用和更具成本效益的催化剂，用于燃料电池等应用，其中优化的表面性质对提高反应动力学和整体性能至关重要。
