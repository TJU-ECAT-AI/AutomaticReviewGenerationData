[1] "Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption"

[2] "Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC."

[3] "For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process[39]. (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk."

[4] "As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. This influence is governed by three main mechanisms:

1. Surface energy effect: The component with lower surface energy tends to segregate to the alloy surface.

2. Strain effect: When there is a significant difference in atomic sizes between components, the larger component typically segregates to the surface to reduce strain energy in the alloy.

3. Heat of solution effect: If the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize mixing of components in the bulk.

These effects collectively determine the extent of surface segregation, which in turn impacts the catalytic properties and performance of the alloys. For Pt-based systems, Pt surface segregation is crucial for improving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, making it an important consideration in developing effective and economical catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

The structural configuration of the catalyst surface, particularly the enrichment of certain elements in specific layers, can be tailored to optimize the electronic structure and catalytic behavior. This is especially important in ternary alloy systems, where the addition of a third element can further modify surface segregation tendencies and catalytic properties.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences allows for the design of more efficient and durable catalysts. By manipulating surface composition and structure through careful selection of alloying elements and synthesis conditions, researchers can develop catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technology and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。这种影响主要由三种机制控制：

1. 表面能效应：表面能较低的组分倾向于偏析到合金表面。

2. 应变效应：当组分之间的原子尺寸差异显著时，较大的组分通常会偏析到表面以减少合金中的应变能。

3. 溶解热效应：如果溶解热为负，合金的主要组分会富集到表面，以最大化体相中组分的混合。

这些效应共同决定了表面偏析的程度，进而影响合金的催化性能。对于Pt基系统，Pt表面偏析对提高氧还原反应（ORR）动力学至关重要，这是开发高效和经济的聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）催化剂的重要考虑因素。

催化剂表面的结构构型，特别是特定元素在特定层中的富集，可以被调整以优化电子结构和催化行为。这在三元合金系统中尤为重要，因为第三种元素的添加可以进一步修改表面偏析趋势和催化性能。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好允许设计更高效和耐久的催化剂。通过仔细选择合金元素和合成条件来操纵表面组成和结构，研究人员可以开发出具有增强活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂，用于各种应用，尤其是燃料电池技术和其他电化学过程。
