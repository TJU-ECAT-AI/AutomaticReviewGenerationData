It is well known that the unique chemical properties of transition metal alloys depend on the configuration of metal atoms of the bimetallic surfaces. Using density functional theory calculations, the thermodynamic potential for segregation of an admetal from the subsurface to surface configuration is shown to correlate linearly with the difference in occupied
d
-band center,
Δ
ε
d
⁠, between these two configurations for a wide range of bimetallic systems. The thermodynamic potential for segregation is also shown to increase with the Pauling electronegativity for several adsorbates, including atomic H, O, C, N, S, and Se. A generalized equation is provided to predict the stable surface configuration for the bimetallic systems with different adsorbates.

I. INTRODUCTION
Bimetallic surfaces have been characterized by unique chemical and physical properties that are different from their pure metal counterparts in many applications. They are particularly important in controlling chemical reactions, including selective hydrogentation,1 reforming of biomass-derived molecules,2 and the anodic3 and cathodic4 reactions in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). When considering bimetallic surfaces, the novel chemical properties are related to the element compositional profile in the first few atomic layers, which can often be significantly different from the bulk composition.
The general phenomenon of surface segregation of bimetallic alloys has been shown to occur by many research groups from fundamental model surfaces to full scale nanoparticles. Beginning with the concept of a single solute alloy atom on the surface of a host metal, Ruban et al.5 tabulated the segregation or antisegregation of that solute atom in vacuum (or without adsorbates) for a number of bimetallic combinations. Previous studies by our research group and others have expanded this to full monolayers both experimentally and theoretically on single crystal surfaces and polycrystalline thin metal foils.6–8 Adding to the complexity of the overall concept, Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena studied the segregation process as affected by the inclusion of step edges.9 Finally, additional research groups have studied full bulk nanoparticle bimetallic alloys that have been shown to exhibit similar segregation profiles. Using Monte Carlo simulations, Wang et al.10 studied the effect of the particle shape and composition on segregation energies. Fowler et al.11 studied nanoparticles in situ for electrochemical processes and shown that the segregation of metals takes place for bulk alloys.
Given the general nature of metal segregation, the current study will focus on monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBSs) in order to systematically approach the interchanging of alloyed metals in the presence of adsorbates. MBS are defined as a surface where one monolayer of an admetal is present within the first few atomic layers of a host metal,
H
(
h
k
l
)
⁠, where
(
h
k
l
)
is the Miller index of the crystal plane. This is to reasonably limit the number of theoretical configurations to an efficient ensemble to represent a first approximation to determine the thermodynamics of segregation. The scope of this paper is to formulate a general trend over a wide range of bimetallic alloys for the purpose of being able to predict the thermodynamically stable surface structure in the presence of a particular atomic adsorbate.
The standard industrial catalysts for a number of applications are too complex to be completely captured at the theoretical level. Industrial catalysts are often supported nanoparticles of varying shapes and sizes. It is beyond the scope of this paper to capture all the various interplays of various parts of supported catalyst, such as support effects, bulk alloy composition, particle size, etc. Therefore, two assumptions will be used to formulate the model system, which should be applicable to the dominant facet faces of the nanoparticle as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). First, it is assumed that the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle is dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers and the bulk composition can be replaced by a pure host metal. Second, it is assumed that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for a fcc nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single crystal surfaces. Previous research by this group and others have shown that the chemical trends predicted and experimentally probed on MBS model systems are similar to those of the bulk bimetallic nanoparticle chemical trends.8 Therefore, while MBS may not capture all the aspects of a complex industrial catalyst, this convenient model system will allow for the study of the segregation process and formalize a first approximation to predict the trends in the thermodynamic potential for segregation. In addition, the trends determined for monolayer bimetallic surfaces should potentially be able to be extrapolated to the trends in nanoparticle alloys. Although the absolute thermodynamic values may change due to the added complexity and environmental variables, the general trends in these values is expected to be valid.

(a) Model assumptions for using monolayer bimetallic surfaces along with the (b) top and (c) side views for representative adsorbate slab configuration for the 0.5 ML O/Pt–Co–Pt(111) system.
In this regard, monolayer bimetallic surfaces can have three ideal configurations: a surface
M
-
H
-
H
(

)
configuration, where the admetal layer
(
M

resides epitaxially on the surface of the host metal
(

⁠; an intermixed configuration, where the admetal resides in the first two layers to some varying degree; and the unique subsurface
H
-
M
-
H
(
h
k
l
)
configuration, where the first layer is comprised of the host metal atoms and the second layer is occupied with the admetal.
The chemical properties of these three configurations can vary significantly for a single admetal/host metal pair. For example, it is proposed that Pt–Ni, Pt–Co, and Pt–Fe bimetallic systems exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode of a PEMFC since the subsurface
Pt-
3
d
-Pt
(
111
)
configuration binds oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111).12,13 However, it has been shown that in an oxygen environment, the
3
d
group transition metals tend to segregate to the surface, resulting in a
3
d
-Pt-Pt
(
111
)
surface that binds oxygen much more strongly than pure Pt,6 leading to potential poisoning of the bimetallic surface due to strongly adsorbed atomic oxygen or even admetal dissolution from the surface. Therefore, while a given bimetallic configuration may exhibit a desired binding energy, it is important to understand whether that particular configuration is stable under the operating environment for a specific application. One of the primary degradation mechanisms would be the diffusion and adsorbate-induced segregation of alloy metals, which has been predicted and demonstrated to occur for a number of bimetallic systems.5–8,10,14–22
In the current study, a general equation for predicting the thermodynamic potential for segregation, both in vacuum and with various adsorbed atoms, will be presented for 33 bimetallic systems. In addition, the effect of the adsorbed species will be discussed in connection with the Pauling electronegativity. This study will explore the general trend in the thermodynamic potential for admetal segregation in bimetallic surfaces upon adsorption of simple adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium. These simple atomic adsorbates have been selected in the current study primarily for two reasons: (1) they are present on the surface of the catalysts in many industrial reactions and (2) they offer a varying degree of binding strength with the surfaces. It is emphasized that the primary focus of this study is for the interchanging of the surface atoms after the adsorption of representative adsorbates rather than the combined process of adsorption and segregation, therefore the environmental effects, such as pressure and temperature on adsorbate coverage and the formation of complex surfaces such as oxides, are beyond the scope of this paper. The general application of this equation for fcc(111) bimetallic surfaces will be demonstrated by examining the effect of switching the admetal between the
3
d
⁠,
4
d
⁠, and
5
d
group transition metals. Finally, the effect of the host metal will be compared by switching in a similar fashion between Pt, Pd, and Ni.
II. METHODS
The ab initio calculations were preformed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) version 4.6.23–25 The monolayer bimetallic systems were for the closed-packed fcc(111) surface with the host metal being either Ni, Pd, or Pt. The PW91 functional26 was used for the exchange-correlation energy approximation utilized within the generalized gradient approximation.27 The basis set consisted of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 396 eV. The bimetallic systems were modeled using a periodic

unit cell with four layers of metal and six equivalent layers of vacuum separating each layer in the epitaxial direction. The surface

configuration was modeled by substituting the entire first layer with the admetal, with the remaining three layers composed of the host metal. The subsurface
H

configuration was composed of the host metal in the first, third, and fourth layers while the second layer was completely substituted with the admetal. The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk host metal distance of 2.49 Å for Ni, 2.82 Å for Pd, or 2.83 Å for Pt, as previously determined for the PW91 exchange/correlation functional.28 A

k
-point mesh29 was used, resulting in five irreducible
k
-points in the first Brillouin zone. This has been shown to be sufficient for the current study as previous studies have shown negligible change in the results for higher
k
-point meshes.7 For the convergence criteria of the energy minimization, the calculations were iterated until the total energy change between ionic steps was less than 0.0001 eV. The
d
-band center of mass was calculated by projecting the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The
d
-band center of mass for this paper is defined as the first moment of only the
d
-orbital bands that have some degree of electron occupation for the four surface atoms using a Gaussian smearing method between
k
-points and a short cutoff radius of 1.5 Å. The coverage of adsorbed species was based on the percentage of adsorption on the four threefold hollow sites for the (111) plane within the
2

unit cell. A representative slab is shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Coverage dependence
As illustrated in previous studies, the binding energies for many adsorbates follow a roughly linear relationship with the surface
d
-band center of the bimetallic systems.6,7,30,31 As compared in Fig. 2 for the Co/Pt(111) bimetallic systems, the surface Co–Pt–Pt(111) configuration is predicted to bind atomic oxygen more strongly than either of the parent metals because the d-band center is closer the Fermi level than the parent metals, indicative of a narrow, localized
d
-band. The subsurface Pt–Co–Pt(111) configuration binds to oxygen more weakly than either of the parent metals. The intermixed configurations exhibit a
d
-band center value that falls between the parent metals and roughly follows the weighted sum of the binding energy for the bonding configurations of the surface and subsurface structures. As shown in Fig. 2, the binding energy of oxygen can vary significantly between different bimetallic configurations, with a value of 24 and 166 kcal/mol for Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111), respectively. The large difference in binding energy could provide the thermodynamic potential for the interchange between the subsurface and surface configurations, leading to drastically different chemical properties.

⁠. In summary, the thermodynamic potential for the segregation of the admetal from the subsurface to surface for a given adsorbate A is related to the potential for segregation in vacuum plus the difference in binding energy between the surface and subsurface configurations.
The full
d
-band center, which contains
d
-bands that are both occupied and unoccupied, has been found to be an important descriptor of electronic properties for predicting trends of binding energies on many monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces.8 In the case of adsorbate-induced segregation, which involves the interchange of metal atoms after the adsorbate has already become bonded to the surface, it will be shown that the difference in the occupied
d
-band center values can also be correlated with the thermodynamic potential for segregation. Figure 3(a) shows the correlation of the thermodynamic potential for segregation in vacuum, 0.5 ML H and 0.5 ML O for

surfaces using the standard full
d
-band center. The full
d
-band center is defined as the first moment of the
d
-band density of states using all
d
-orbital bands, both occupied and unoccupied. Figure 3(a) shows that there is a nonlinear trend with the difference in full
d
-band center,
Δ
ε
d
⁠. However, when only the
d
-orbitals that have some degree of electron occupation are considered, the nonlinearity is alleviated as shown in Fig. 3(b), which illustrates that using the
d
-band centers of only the occupied
d
-orbital bands results in a nearly linear correlation for a wide range of bimetallic alloys. One of the reasons for this change in correlation may be due to the fact that the process of adsorbate adsorption requires the use of occupied and unoccupied orbitals, where donation and backdonation with the surface may occur through the use of unoccupied orbitals. However, for the interchanging of surface atoms after the adsorbate is already bonded to the surface, this conceptually may involve primarily the lowering of the surface energy of the electron density near the surface. Therefore, the comparison in Fig. 3 suggests that the unoccupied orbital bands may be removed in the correlation between
d
-band center and thermodynamic potential for the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures with simple atomic adsorbates. More systematic studies are clearly needed to confirm whether such observation can be extended to other adsorbates.

d
-band center. The thermodynamic potential for segregation for vacuum and increasing coverages of (c) atomic oxygen and (d) atomic hydrogen vs the difference in
d
-band center. The labels for the surface considered are on the top axis where A-B-C is defined as A is the top layer, B is the second layer, and C is the host metal.
The fact that the all the coverages converge at zero and have an incremental change that is nearly constant leads to another assumption that is important for predicting the thermodynamic potential for segregation. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show that the difference in binding energy is nearly constant for oxygen and hydrogen for the coverage range considered. The explanation for the small deviation of
Δ
BDE
A
with coverage is that while an individual binding energy can shift due to interaction between adsorbates,
Δ
BDE
A
can be approximated as a constant as long as the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction effect is similar on both surface and subsurface configurations.
The nature of this general trend is demonstrated for fcc(111) bimetallic surfaces in Fig. 5 by considering 33 different bimetallic combinations for the host metals of Ni, Pd, and Pt. For all the systems, the subsurface is predicted to be thermodynamically preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, whereas the surface configuration is preferred for 0.5 ML O. The effect of switching the admetal between
3
d
⁠,
4
d
⁠, or
5
d
transition metals or the host between Ni, Pd, or Pt is to change
Δ
ε
d
and in turn adjust the absolute value of potential for segregation. The correlation with
Δ
ε
d
allows for an intuitive prediction of the behavior of bimetallic alloys. As an example, Pt and Ti, which have significantly different
d
-orbital density of states (DOS), have one of the largest
Δ
ε
d
considered, which leads to one of the largest potentials for retaining the subsurface Pt–Ti–Pt(111) structure in vacuum and atomic hydrogen and one of the largest potentials for segregation of subsurface Ti in oxygen. Alternatively, Pt and Pd, which have very similar electronic structures, have a
Δ
ε
d
of approximately zero, suggesting that there should be a negligible thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration in any of the environments considered. Using this linear correlation, the thermodynamic potential for the bimetallic systems in Fig. 5 can be predicted after the determination of one bimetallic system at one adsorbate coverage using the following equation:

Therefore, a first approximation for the thermodynamic potential for interchange with hydrogen or oxygen can be predicted for a new bimetallic system by simply calculating the difference in
d
-band center for the clean slab configurations and using either Eq. (6) and (7).
B. Effect of electronegativity of adsorbate species
In Sec. III A, hydrogen and oxygen were used as two extremes of simple adsorbates; hydrogen being a weakly binding adsorbate and oxygen being a well known strong adsorbate. It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider complex adsorbates with multiple functional groups. Instead, additional atomic adsorbates will be discussed to illustrate how the thermodynamic potential for segregation will vary with adsorbate binding strength. The effect of different adsorbate species on the values of
Δ
BDE
A
is shown in Fig. 6. For all of the species studied, the surface configuration is predicted to bind adsorbates more strongly due to the narrow, localized nature of the
d
-orbital DOS that will overlap more effectively with the adsorbate orbitals.32 Due to this trend,
Δ
BDE
A
⁠, which is a negative number by convention, subtracts from the initial potential in vacuum for the subsurface configuration. With an adsorbate such as hydrogen, which has a small Pauling electronegativity of 2.20, the difference in binding energy between the two configurations is small in comparison to the initial value in vacuum. Atomic C, Se, and S, which have a Pauling electronegativity of 2.55, 2.55, and 2.58, respectively, exhibit a larger difference in binding energy. Finally, N and O, which have a Pauling electronegativity of 3.04 and 3.44, respectively, shift the potential for segregation even further. Therefore, the potential for segregation qualitatively follows the trend with the Pauling electronegativity. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity binds weakly with both configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. An adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations; at high enough coverage, this potential will outweigh the initial potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum and segregation could occur.

While many industrial reactions will involve more complex adsorbates, the relative strength with respect to each other can be evaluated and it is expected the same concept can be applied once a reference point is established. Using the scaling relationships of Jones et al.,33 one might expect that hydroxyls bound on the surface would probably affect the thermodynamic potential for segregation more than a bound methane molecule given the relationship between O and C established in Fig. 6.
It is important to point out that the correlations discussed in the current paper apply to bimetallic systems that prefer either the surface or subsurface bimetallic structures, such as the
Pt-
3
d
bimetallic system.34 More detailed theoretical and experimental investigations are needed to determine whether these trends also apply to bimetallic systems that prefer intermixed surface layers. In addition, the current study has focused only on fcc host metals due primarily to the breadth of literature available for these bimetallic systems. Since the general process of segregation was found to occur for the basic solute case by Ruban et al.5 regardless of the host crystal facet, it is expected the segregation trend outlined in this paper should apply for other crystal structures. However, further studies are needed to determine what changes might occur when switching to body center cubic (bcc) host metals, such as W, Mo, and Cr.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the thermodynamically preferred bimetallic configuration is directly related to the difference in the values of the occupied
d
-band centers for the surface and subsurface configurations,
Δ
ε
d
⁠. As the value of
|
Δ
ε
d
|
increases the absolute value of thermodynamic potential for segregation,
|
Δ
E
seg
A
|
⁠, also increases. Using Eq. (4), the thermodynamic potential for segregation, in the presence of an adsorbate
A
n
⁠, can be estimated for the entire bimetallic series presented here. Similar to previous observations that the
d
-band center is a very useful tool for predicting the binding energies of a wide range of metal surfaces, the
Δ
ε
d
value can also be used for the prediction of thermodynamic stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic configurations. Finally, the effect of the adsorbate species can be predicted qualitatively in comparison to another adsorbate by a measure of the Pauling electronegativity. This trend allows for the intuitive comparison of potential bimetallic alloys based upon the
d
-band center differences of the host metals.
The results from the current study can be used as a first approximation for screening and understanding the general segregation process on the surface of bulk alloy surfaces that produce subsurface and surface structures, such as the “Pt-skin” system in cathode electrocatalysts. As described by Nørskov et al.,12 promising alloy system with enhanced activity can be potentially identified through the use of the correlation between the full
d
-band and the binding energies of atomic oxygen and hydroxyl group. The occupied difference in
d
-band center, as described in the current study, can then be used to predict the relative thermodynamic stability between the surface and subsurface structures. In addition, the current study has dealt only with the thermodynamic potential for segregation; the kinetic barrier for segregation also needs to be considered. Therefore, while all of the systems described above were shown to prefer the surface configuration thermodynamically with 0.5 ML O, the subsurface configuration will exist in a metastable state until the kinetic barrier is also overcome. An example of such a combined theoretical and experimental study has been performed for the Pt–Ni and Pt–Co systems and the segregation energy has been correlated with the activation barrier using a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship.7
