Abstract
Over Ni–Pt(111) model catalysts, changes in the surface structure were observed during alternating reduction and oxidation (redox) treatments at variable temperatures (VTs). Pt skin with subsurface Ni and NiO on Pt(111) form upon high-temperature reduction and high-temperature oxidation, respectively. Both Ni and Pt atoms are present on the surface with the low-temperature redox treatments. The similar surface structures can be constructed at supported Pt–Ni nanoparticles through the VT redox treatments. Both the surface structure and the CO oxidation performance of the supported Pt–Ni catalysts showed well-defined oscillations with the treatment temperature and the redox potential. The demonstrated treatment–structure–reactivity relationship at the PtNi catalysts aids in the design of advanced bimetallic catalysts.

Introduction
In heterogeneous catalysis, it has long been recognized that catalyst preparation, including synthesis methods and treatment processes, strongly influences catalytic performance. (1-11) To date, however, construction of catalytic materials is still based on experience or trial-and-error methods. There is often a call to transform the art of catalyst preparation into a science. In the past decades, much attention has been paid to catalyst synthesis methods and their effect on catalysis. The nature of the effect of catalyst treatment on the catalytic properties remains less explored and needs to be studied in more depth.
Among many treatment methods, reduction and oxidation are the simplest but most frequently applied processes for treating practical catalysts. Redox treatments can affect the catalytic properties significantly, which is particularly true for multicomponent catalysts, such as bimetallic catalysts. (12-17) Therein, not only the morphology and size of the catalysts can change, but also interdiffusion between the various components can take place. (12-21) Consequently, the surface composition, structure, chemical state, and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts depend sensitively on the treatment conditions. Some recent works have nicely demonstrated that the surface structures of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe, (12) RhPd, (14, 15) and PtNi, (13, 16) can be reversibly modulated by redox treatments. (12-16) Thus, it is expected that the catalytic performance of the catalysts should be reversibly regulated by the same treatment processes as well.
In a previous work, the surface structure of Pt–Ni catalysts and their reactivity in CO oxidation were studied as a function of the treatment temperature. We found that a sandwich structure containing both surface Ni and subsurface Ni species at the Pt surface can be established upon reduction in H2 at an intermediate temperature and demonstrates the highest activity in CO oxidation. (22) Although the effect of the reduction treatment has been clearly illustrated, how the oxidation treatment affects the catalysis remains unclear. Herein, using both Ni–Pt(111) model surfaces and supported Pt–Ni nanoparticles (NPs), we show that the surface structure of the PtNi catalysts can be reversibly modulated by variable-temperature (VT) reduction–oxidation (redox) treatments and, more interestingly, the reactivity of the catalysts in CO oxidation shows a similar reversible dependence on the VT redox treatments. The role of the chemical potential of the treatment atmosphere and the treatment temperature in the surface structure and reactivity has been elucidated. The demonstrated well-defined treatment–structure–reactivity relationship of the bimetallic catalysts permits rational preparation of highly efficient practical catalysts.
Experimental Section
Ni–Pt(111) Model Catalysts
All experiments with the model catalysts were carried out in an Omicron multiprobe ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) system that consisted of three main chambers. A detailed description of this system and the preparation of the Ni–Pt(111) surfaces can be found elsewhere. (23) The reduction treatments of the Ni–Pt(111) surfaces were performed under the conditions of 5.2 × 10–7 mbar H2 at elevated temperatures for 5 min. The oxidation was done under 5.2 × 10–7 mbar O2 at the set temperatures for 5 min. The titration experiments were carried out on various Ni–Pt(111) surfaces upon sequential exposure of 100 Langmuir (L) of O2 and 10 L of CO at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired between the adsorption processes using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images were acquired at room temperature with a W tip.
Supported PtNi Nanoparticles
PtNi NPs supported on carbon black (PtNi/CB) were prepared by the coimpregnation method, using H2PtCl6 and Ni(NO3)2 as precursors. Through aging and overnight drying, fresh PtNi/CB catalysts were produced, in which the loadings of Pt and Ni were controlled at 4 and 1.2 wt %, respectively. The reduction pretreatments were carried out in flowing H2 gas (20%, 30 mL/min) at 573 or 473 K for 2 h. The oxidation was performed under flowing O2 (100%, 30 mL/min) atmosphere and at 573 or 473 K for 2 h. Then, 50 mg of as-prepared and treated PtNi/CB catalysts was washed in 25 mL of dilute HNO3 solution (5 × 10–4 mol/L). The concentrations of Pt and Ni ions in the leached solutions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Shimadzu ICPS-8100). CO oxidation was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor with a gas composition of 1% CO and 20% O2 in He balance and at a temperature of 348 K, keeping the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at 30000 mL g–1 h–1. The tail gas was analyzed online by gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent 6890N). Before reaction, the catalysts were treated by the various pretreatment processes.
Experimental Methods
The surface structure of the supported PtNi catalysts during the alternating VT redox treatments was investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku C/MAX-2500/PC, λ = 1.5406 Å) and in situ Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements [BL14W1 beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF)]. The treatments of the catalysts were performed in an in situ reaction cell (Anton Paar, XRK900). The Pt–Ni/CB catalysts were characterized by Ni K-edge XANES spectroscopy in fluorescence mode.
Results and Discussion
To prepare the catalysts, 1.3 monolayer (ML) of Ni was deposited on a clean Pt(111) surface under UHV conditions and at room temperature and was then annealed under UHV at 800 K for 5 min. Both STM and XPS measurements provide clear evidence for the inward diffusion of the surface Ni into the subsurface regions and the formation of a Pt-skin structure after UHV annealing. First, the XPS Ni 2p peak intensity decreased by 62% as a result of the attenuation of the Ni 2p signals by the surface Pt layer (Figure 1), which has also been observed upon UHV annealing of other transition metal (TM)–Pt(111) systems. (12, 22, 24) Second, the STM images show white lines on flat terraces, which are the characteristic structure of Pt-skin surfaces containing subsurface 3d TM atoms (Figure 2a). (12, 25)

The obtained Pt-skin structure, Pt/Ni/Pt(111), was oxidized in 5.2 × 10–7 mbar O2 and at 700 K [denoted as low-temperature oxidation (LTO)]. The XPS binding energy (BE) of the Ni 2p3/2 peak shifted from 852.7 to 853.1 eV after the oxidation, which indicates the formation of oxidized Ni species. Meanwhile, the ratio of the Ni 2p to the Pt 4f peak intensity increased from 0.41 to 0.74 (Figure 1). Upon further oxidation under the conditions of 5.2 × 10–7 mbar O2 and 800 K [denoted as high-temperature oxidation (HTO)], the Ni 2p BE remained almost unchanged, but the Ni 2p/Pt 4f ratio increased to 0.90 (Figure 1). The increase in the Ni 2p/Pt 4f ratio can be attributed to the outward diffusion of the subsurface Ni species to the topmost surface caused by the oxidation. The higher oxidation temperature resulted in the stronger outward diffusion of Ni. At the same time, STM investigation showed that the surface was decorated by networks of one-dimensional structures that resembled the one-dimensional Ni–O structures with (7 × 1) reconstruction (26) and three-dimensional NiO islands (Figure 2b). Both the XPS and STM results thus suggest that the oxidation drives the surface segregation of Ni, forming the NiO surface structure.
From the NiO/Pt(111) surface, reduction in 5.2 × 10–7 mbar H2 at 500 K [denoted as low-temperature reduction (LTR)] was carried out. The BE of the Ni 2p3/2 peak shifted back to 852.7 eV, and the Ni 2p/Pt 4f intensity ratio deceased by 25%. The STM image recorded from the surface shows the appearance of discontinuous surface structures on the Pt(111) surface, which is due to the breakage of the surface NiO layer (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The following high-temperature reduction (HTR, 5.2 × 10–7 mbar H2 and 800 K) resulted in the further decrease of the Ni 2p/Pt 4f value by 48% (Figure 1). Meanwhile, the surface resumed the same character as the Pt-skin structure (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The observed decrease in the Ni 2p/Pt 4f ratio and formation of the Pt-skin structure should originate from the reduction-induced inward diffusion of surface Ni. The reduction treatment of the Ni–O/Pt(111) surface in H2 is similar to UHV annealing of the 1.3 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, (22) which both cause the diffusion of surface Ni into the near-surface region and surface segregation of Pt.
The enrichment of Pt at the Pt–TM catalyst surfaces in H2 or vacuum atmosphere has been observed in other systems, (27-30) and it is believed that this process is driven by the larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 Å) compared to those of the TM metals, such as Ni (1.24 Å). (13) In oxidative atmosphere, however, the formation of the surface NiO structures should be attributed to the strong interaction of Ni with O and the lower surface energy of nickel oxide compared to that of platinum. (13) The interdiffusion between Pt and Ni and the structural switch between the surface NiO and the Pt-skin surface through the alternating reduction and oxidation treatments can be repeated many times, which indicates that the dynamic changes in the Ni–Pt(111) surface structure are fully reversible in response to the redox treatments (Figure 1).
To further probe the surface structure of the Ni–Pt(111) model catalysts that had been treated differently, sequential saturation adsorption of CO and O2 at room temperature combined with XPS O 1s measurements were carried out on the surfaces. The presence of surface metallic Ni results in dissociative adsorption of O2, whereas the bare Pt surface adsorbs CO. O 1s signals from O–Ni and O–C bonds can be well distinguished by XPS measurements (Figure 2c).
CO adsorbs on the Pt(111) surface at bridge and top sites, with the corresponding O 1s peaks at 531.3 and 533.0 eV, respectively. (31) CO adsorption becomes weaker on the Pt-skin surfaces because of the downward shift of the d-band center of the surface Pt induced by the subsurface TM atoms. (3, 32, 33) Indeed, we observed a much weaker O 1s signal from the CO-saturated Pt-skin surface (Figure 2c). Particularly, CO adsorption at the bridge site was largely suppressed, which is consistent with CO adsorption on the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface. (12) No O–Ni signal was observed upon O2 adsorption on the surface, confirming the complete diffusion of the surface Ni atoms into the subsurface regions during the HTR process. After the LTO treatment of the previous HTR surface, less CO was detected than the Pt-skin surface. At the same time, a strong O 1s signal from O–Ni bonding is present that peaks at 529.7 eV. However, on the HTO-treated surface, no signals from CO were observed, and the O 1s spectrum was mainly dominated by the O–Ni signal, which suggests that the Pt(111) surface was fully covered by a NiO layer after the HTO process. The subsequent LTR treatment of this NiO/Pt(111) surface resulted in the reappearance of the CO signal on the CO-saturated surface (Figure 2c). Furthermore, the O 1s signal from the Ni–O structure was observed after the saturation adsorption of O2 on the surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The data indicate that both Ni and Pt atoms were present on surface after the LTR process.
The surface science experiments demonstrate that the surface architecture of the Ni–Pt(111) catalyst can be well controlled by the VT redox treatments. Specifically, the HTR and HTO processes produce the Pt-skin surface and the NiO-covered surface, respectively, whereas a surface structure consisting of both Pt and Ni (or NiO) species forms upon the LTR and LTO treatments (as shown by insets in Figure 1).
The basic understanding derived from the well-defined model systems can be used to control the surface structure of PtNi practical catalysts. However, the materials gap should be kept in mind. It is known that the interdiffusion between Pt and Ni at the catalyst surfaces is a thermally activated process. NPs have more open surfaces and defect sites, which facilitate the surface diffusion processes at lower temperatures. (13, 34) For example, the fully reversible structural changes at PtNi NPs supported on highly orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces occur at much lower temperature (data not shown here) than they do at the Ni–Pt(111) surface, specifically, 573 versus 800 K. Accordingly, modulation of the surface structure of supported PtNi catalysts was attempted by annealing in flowing H2 and O2 gases at a relatively high temperature of 573 K (HTR and HTO) and a lower temperature of 473 K (LTR and LTO).
Practical PtNi catalysts were supported on carbon black (CB) or silica at loadings of 4 wt % Pt and 1.2 wt % Ni. First, the structure of the PtNi catalyst in response to the alternating HTO and HTR processes was studied by in situ XRD (Figure 3a). After each HTO process, the XRD pattern had a main peak at 2θ = 39.9° corresponding to the (111) plane of Pt. (35) However, each HTR step always resulted in the shift of the main peak position to 40.6°, which is from the PtNi alloy phase. (36) In situ XANES spectroscopy was applied to study the chemical state of Ni in the PtNi samples treated under the same HTO and HTR conditions (Figure 3b). In the HTO-treated sample, a strong white line at 8351 eV was observed in the Ni K-edge structure, similar to the spectrum recorded from the reference NiO NPs. After the HTR process, the intensity of the white line decreased. Fourier transform analysis of the spectrum suggests that the Ni–Ni interaction becomes more dominant in the Ni chemical environment (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Both in situ XRD and XANES investigations confirmed that the oxidation induces outward diffusion of Ni to form a NiO-rich surface whereas the reduction drives inward diffusion of Ni, thus producing a Pt-rich surface.

Acid leaching combined with ICP measurements has been shown to be an effective method of determining the surface composition of Pt-3d TM NPs. The 3d TM outside the Pt nanoparticles can be removed in acid solutions, whereas those inside the NPs remain unchanged. (22) In the present work, the distribution of Ni at the PtNi NP surfaces was investigated by this method (Table 1). The data show that most of the Ni was leached away in the oxidized samples. The higher the oxidation temperature, the more Ni that could be washed away. On the other hand, only a small part of the Ni was removed from the reduced catalysts by the washing process. The higher the reduction temperature, the lower the amount of Ni that could be leached. The ICP results well support the proposed NiO-rich and Pt-rich surface configurations at the high-temperature oxidized and reduced catalysts. For the low-temperature treatments (both LTO and LTR), the surface diffusion becomes kinetically limited, and thus, only part of the Ni remains on the surface.

aFresh PtNi/CB catalyst without reduction (AP) was washed in the acid solution as a reference.
The PtNi/CB catalysts treated differently were then tested for CO oxidation (1% CO, 20% O2, He balance). First, the catalyst was subjected to the cycled HTR and HTO treatments. After each treatment, the CO oxidation was carried out at 348 K. It was found that the CO conversion over the HTR-treated catalyst was around 50%, but that over the HTO-treated sample remained below 10% (Figure 4). The CO conversion showed a nice reversible dependence on the HTO and HTR treatments. As discussed above, the HTR process produces a Pt-rich surface with subsurface Ni species. Previous research results have indicated that the Pt-skin surface presents only moderate reactivity in CO oxidation because the activation of O2 is still limited on the surface. (22, 37) Therefore, it is not unexpected that the HTR-treated sample does not present a high activity in the reaction. At the HTO-treated catalyst surfaces, the formed NiO structure encapsulates most of surface Pt sites and, thus, significantly lowers the surface reactivity.
Figure 4
Figure 4. CO conversion during CO oxidation at 348 K over PtNi/CB catalyst treated by various redox processes.
Starting from the HTO-treated sample, we carried out the LTR process. Two cycles of HTO and LTR treatments were performed, and the same CO oxidation reaction was carried out after each treatment. It is interesting to see that the CO conversion was above 90% over the LTR-treated sample. A large oscillation of the CO conversion ranging from below 10% to above 90% was observed with the alternating HTO and LTR processes (Figure 4).
Following the HTR step, the catalyst was treated by the LTO process, and the catalyst presented a CO conversion as high as 100%. A treatment cycle of HTO, HTR, and LTO was performed twice. Again, a nice oscillation of the CO conversion was observed, which shows that the LTO-treated sample had the highest reactivity compared to the HTR- and HTO-treated samples (Figure 4).
The results from the model Ni–Pt(111) surfaces and practical PtNi/CB catalysts indicate that the low-temperature reduction drives part of the surface Ni into the near-surface region. From the NiO-rich surfaces, the LTR treatment makes the encapsulating NiO surface layers reduced and discontinuous. On the other hand, the low-temperature oxidation of the Pt-rich surfaces can promote the surface segregation of part of the subsurface Ni atoms. Again, highly dispersed NiO structures form on Pt at the LTO-treated samples. Therefore, a unique surface configuration consisting of surface Ni (NiO), surface Pt, and subsurface Ni species forms after the LTR or LTO treatments. Under CO oxidation conditions, the formed “NiO-on-Pt” structure with subsurface Ni catalyzes the CO oxidation efficiently by making use of the bifunctional catalytic role of the Pt and Ni surface sites (37) and the synergetic effect of surface and subsurface Ni species, (22) which contribute to the observed extraordinary reactivity.
Up to now, three surface architectures have been created at the PtNi catalysts: the Pt-skin or Pt-rich surface with subsurface Ni, the NiO-rich surface or Pt@NiO core–shell structure, and the Pt surface decorated with NiO or Ni patches (NiO-on-Pt or Ni-on-Pt). Our results show that reversible switching among the three surfaces can be simply established by the VT redox treatments (Scheme 1). The Pt-rich surface and Pt@NiO core–shell structures can be reversibly controlled through the HTR and HTO processes. The Pt-rich surface and NiO-on-Pt structures were reversibly controlled by the HTR and LTO steps. Finally, the dynamic changes between the Pt@NiO core–shell structure and the Ni(O)-on-Pt structure were modulated by the HTO and LTR treatments. With the reversible modulation of the surface structure, the reactivity in the CO oxidation presents similar dynamic changes as the surface structures and the treatment processes.

Conclusions
For the preparation of practical catalysts, redox treatments are frequently applied, such as activation in reductive atmospheres and sintering in air. The nature of the effects of treatment on the catalytic performance is often ignored. In the present study, we have demonstrated how sensitively the surface structure and chemical reactivity of the bimetallic catalysts depends on the treatment conditions. The highest reactivity for the CO oxidation was obtained at the PtNi catalysts subjected to low-temperature reduction or low-temperature oxidation because of the formation of the highly active NiO-on-Pt surface structure, whereas complete deactivation and moderate reactivity were seen for the catalysts treated by high-temperature oxidation and high-temperature reduction, respectively. The established treatment–structure–reactivity relationship for the PtNi bimetallic catalysts illustrates the science of catalyst preparation.
