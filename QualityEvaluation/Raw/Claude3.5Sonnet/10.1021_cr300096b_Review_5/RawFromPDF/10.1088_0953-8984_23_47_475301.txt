Monte Carlo simulation of surface segregation phenomena in extended and nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys
The surface segregation phenomena in the extended and nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys have been studied using the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method and the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials developed for Pt–Pd alloys. The MEAM potentials were fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the lattice parameters, cohesive energies and surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as the density functional theory calculation results of the lattice parameters and heat of formation of L12 Pt3Pd, L10 PtPd and L12 PtPd3 crystal. Using the MC method and the developed MEAM potentials, we calculated the Pt concentrations in the outermost three layers of the equilibrium (111), (100) and (110) extended surfaces as well as the outermost surfaces of the equilibrium cubo-octahedral nanoparticles of Pt–Pd alloys. Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the Pt–Pd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets.

Abstract
The surface segregation phenomena in the extended and nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys have been studied using the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method and the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials developed for Pt–Pd alloys. The MEAM potentials were fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the lattice parameters, cohesive energies and surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as the density functional theory calculation results of the lattice parameters and heat of formation of L12 Pt3Pd, L10 PtPd and L12 PtPd3 crystal. Using the MC method and the developed MEAM potentials, we calculated the Pt concentrations in the outermost three layers of the equilibrium (111), (100) and (110) extended surfaces as well as the outermost surfaces of the equilibrium cubo-octahedral nanoparticles of Pt–Pd alloys. Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the Pt–Pd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets.

1. Introduction
Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon in which the surface composition of alloy materials differs from their bulk composition at thermodynamic equilibrium conditions [1, 2]. The surface segregation process could affect many important physical and chemical properties (such as adsorption, wetting, oxidation, thermionic emission, corrosion, electrical contact, friction and wear, crystal growth and catalysis) of alloy materials [3]. In particular, the surface region is the active part of alloy catalysts in promoting various chemical reactions. Consequently, we can take advantage of the surface segregation process to optimize the performance of the alloy catalysts. For example, it was predicted that, due to the surface segregation process, there would be 100% Pt in the outermost layer but only 50% Pt (50% Ni) in the sub-surface layer of the annealed (111) surface of the Pt75Ni25 alloy [4]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that in such a segregated surface structure the Ni atoms beneath the Pt monolayer could shift the d-electron band of the surface Pt downwards relative to that of pure Pt [5]. Experimental measurements found out that the annealed (111)-oriented Pt75Ni25 alloy with Pt segregated surfaces would have significantly enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions than pure Pt, although the content of precious Pt had been reduced by 25 at.% [6]. Therefore, it is very helpful in designing novel alloy catalysts to know what chemical component would segregate to the surface layers as well as to what extent the surface segregation could be.
Bimetallic Pt–Pd nanoclusters have been extensively studied due to their catalytic applications in promoting oxygen reduction reaction [7], methanol decomposition [8] and hydrogenation of aromatics [9]. Thus, it is of great interest to gain knowledge of the structural arrangement of the Pt and Pd atoms in the surface of the Pt–Pd alloy catalysts. Both experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations had indicated that the Pd atoms would favor segregating to the outermost surface layer of the Pt–Pd nanoclusters [10, 11]. As summarized in [12], there are three major physical mechanisms causing surface segregation phenomena in disordered binary alloys (or binary solid solutions): (1) if the heat of the solution is quite negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk; (2) when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, the larger component will segregate to the surface to reduce strain energy in the alloys; and (3) the component (in its pure element form) with a lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface. Hence, the surface segregation process in disordered alloys is always exothermic and accompanies a decrease in system configurational entropy. For Pt–Pd alloys, mechanisms (1) and (2) for surface segregation can be neglected because the heat of solution of Pt–Pd alloys is quite small as well as the Pt and Pd atoms having very similar sizes. Insomuch, surface energy difference (pure Pd has lower surface energy than Pt) is the main driving force of segregating Pd to the surfaces.
To gain knowledge on surface composition profiles, the surface segregation process in Pt–Pd alloys has been simulated at the atomistic scale using various different atomic interaction potentials such as effective medium theory [13], analytic modified embedded-atom method potential [14], Gupta potential [15], bond order simulation model [16] and Sutton–Chen potential [17]. Although these potentials yielded the predictions (segregation of Pd to the surface) qualitatively agreeing with experiments, few of them were thoroughly evaluated in order to quantitatively simulate the surface segregation extent in the different surfaces of the Pt–Pd alloys. In this work, we have developed the parameters of the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials for the Pt–Pd alloys and particularly examined the capability of the developed MEAM potentials in predicting the surface segregation composition profiles in the low-index extended surfaces [(111), (100) and (110)] and the cubo-octahedral nanoparticle surfaces of the Pt–Pd alloys.
Moreover, the development of novel catalysts has more and more focused on controlling the surface composition and geometric structures of multi-component (beyond binary) alloy nanostructures [18–20]. As a result, it is desired to construct a set of consistent atomic interaction potentials which have a similar formula and hence could be directly combined to simulate the surface segregation process in complex multi-component alloy nanostructures. We chose MEAM as the theoretical model for our alloy potentials in this work. This is because MEAM has included many-body effects, angular-dependent terms and even the second-nearest-neighbor contribution in its formula and thus is capable of describing the atomic interaction for transition metals in many types of crystals (for example, face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal lattice) [21–23]. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the MEAM potentials could be employed to accurately model the surface segregation phenomena in Pt–Re [24], Pt–Ni [4], Pt–Mo [25] and Pt–Ti [26] binary alloys. Therefore, in this work, we added a well-tested Pt–Pd atomic interaction potential into the library of the MEAM potentials particularly developed for accurate simulation of surface segregation in transition metal alloys.
2. Simulation method
2.1. Modified embedded-atom method (MEAM)
With the MEAM atomic interaction potentials [21, 22], the total energy of a metallic system is calculated as . In the equation, the first term is the embedding energy of atom i which is embedded into the electron density and the second term is the core–core pair interaction between atoms i and j separated by a distance Rij. Here, is the background electron density at the center of atom i obtained by superposing the electronic densities from its surrounding atoms. To compute , we chose an fcc lattice as the reference structure of pure Pt–Pt (and Pd–Pd) potentials and an L12 lattice of Pt3Pd crystal (in which one Pd atom occupies the corner and three Pt atoms lie at the face centers of an fcc lattice) as the reference structure for Pt–Pd cross-potentials. The detailed formula of the MEAM potentials could be found in [21, 24, 27].
2.2. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method
The MC simulation method employed in this work was developed based on the Metropolis algorithm [28], in which successive configurations were generated in proportion to the probabilities of a configuration occurring in the equilibrium ensemble. Starting from a given atomistic structure of the alloy system, we continuously tried out the configuration transformations of the system to reach the thermodynamically equilibrium ensembles. At each MC step, the energy difference ΔE associated with a configuration change of the system was evaluated using our developed MEAM potentials. If ΔE < 0 (energy-decreasing process), the new configuration would always be retained, while if ΔE > 0 (energy-increasing process), the new configuration would be accepted with the probability . Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
To accomplish compositional relaxation in the Pt–Pd alloy surfaces, one kind of the configuration transformations in our MC method was to exchange the positions of two randomly selected atoms with different element types. In this way, we circumvented the slow diffusion processes in our simulations and thus were able to quickly drive the surfaces into their thermodynamically equilibrium ensembles. The chemical composition of each surface layer could be computed by averaging over those values of the generated configurations in the equilibrium part of the MC simulations. In addition, we modeled the structural relaxation processes in the Pt–Pd surface systems in this work through imposing displacements (in random directions) to randomly selected atoms as a type of configuration transformation in the MC simulations. The magnitude of the displacements was restricted to within 0.02 Å.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Develop MEAM potentials for Pt–Pd alloys
In this work, the employed MEAM potentials for pure Pt and Pd metals were similar to those published in [21], with some renormalized scaling factors in the atomic charge densities. We mainly developed the cross-potential between Pt and Pd in the alloy systems based on our density functional theory (DFT) results. We gave the parameters for the Pt–Pd MEAM potentials in table 1 and the angular screening parameters [29] for the potentials in table 2.
Table 1.  Parameters of the developed MEAM potentials for Pt–Pd alloys. The parameters are the cohesive energy Ec (eV), the equilibrium nearest-neighbor distance re (Å), the exponential decay factor for the universal energy function α, the scaling factor for the embedding energy A, the four exponential decay factors for the atomic densities β(i), the four weighting factors for the atomic densities t(i) and the density scaling factor ρ0. The detailed formula of the MEAM potentials could be found in [21, 24, 27].

Among all the material properties, the size of the Pt and Pd atoms, the surface energies of the Pt and Pd crystal, and the heat of solution of the Pt–Pd solid solutions are most relevant to the surface segregation process in the Pt–Pd alloys [12]. In this work, the lattice parameters were exactly reproduced to be the experimental values of 3.92 Å for fcc Pt and 3.89 Å for fcc Pd by the developed MEAM potentials. In table 3, we reported the calculated surface energies with the developed MEAM potentials for the three low-index surfaces [(111), (100) and (110)] of the pure Pt and Pd fcc crystals. It is noticeable that the calculated surface energies with our MEAM potentials were about 600 mJ m−2 lower than the previous results from DFT calculations [30] for the same surfaces and from experimental measurements [31, 32] for polycrystalline surfaces. It has been recognized that it is a shortcoming of most atomic potential models in predicting lower surface energies than experimental results [21, 22]. However, it is also worth mentioning that the experimentally measured surface energy is the average value of various surfaces (including high-index, high-energy surfaces). This may partially explain the discrepancy in surface energy between the prediction of atomic potential models and experimental data. Shown in table 3, both DFT and MEAM predicted that single-crystal Pd would have a lower surface energy in all the three low-index surfaces than single-crystal Pt. Therefore, the two theoretical approaches agree on the point that the difference in surface energy between the Pt and Pd crystals could drive the Pd atoms to segregate to the surface of the Pt–Pd alloys.

Furthermore, we fitted the MEAM cross-potentials between Pt and Pd with the first-principles DFT calculation results about the lattice parameter and heat of formation of Pt3Pd crystal (with an L12 crystal structure), PtPd crystal (with an L10 crystal structure) and PtPd3 crystal (with an L12 crystal structure). The heat of formation (in units of eV/atom) of the Pt–Pd crystals was computed as the energy of the intermetallic crystals relative to those of the equilibrium fcc Pt and fcc Pd. Table 4 compares the properties of the three Pt–Pd intermetallic crystals calculated with our MEAM potentials and DFT methods, showing that the developed MEAM potentials closely reproduce the DFT results. Moreover, our MEAM potentials as well as DFT calculations predicted the negative but fairly small heats of formation for all three Pt–Pd crystals. This implies that the Pt and Pd atoms would not have a pronounced mixing tendency in their solid solutions.

aGGA–DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). In these DFT calculations, the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential approach and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PW91 functional were used. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to be 600 eV in all the calculations. A 16 × 16 × 16 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for Brillouin zone integration.
As discussed above, our developed MEAM potentials for the Pt–Pd alloy are capable of accurately describing the atomic size effect, surface energy effect and heat of solution effect which are the major factors in determining the surface segregation process in the alloy. Besides these quantities, we can estimate the segregating tendency of the Pt and Pd atoms to the alloy surfaces by calculating their surface segregation energy in the dilute limit. As suggested in [33], the surface segregation energy in extended surfaces is defined as the energy difference between the total energy of the systems with a substitutional impurity atom in the outermost surface layer and in the bulk. In table 5, we gave the calculated surface segregation energies for a Pt atom in the (111), (110) and (100) surfaces of Pd crystals and a Pd atom in the (111), (110) and (100) surfaces of Pt crystals using the MEAM potentials. As shown in table 5, the predicted surface segregation energies with our MEAM potentials are in very good quantitative agreement with the previous LMTO–DFT calculation results. Both the LMTO–DFT and MEAM methods agree in that the Pt atoms would not prefer segregating to the surfaces of the Pd single crystal while the Pd atoms would segregate to the surfaces of the Pt single crystals. It should also be noted that both the LMTO–DFT and our MEAM methods predicted that the surface segregation energies of the Pd impurity in the Pt surfaces will decrease following the order of (111), (110) and (100).

3.2. Simulate surface segregation in the extended surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys
Using the developed MEAM potentials and the MC simulation method, we simulated the surface segregation process in the three low-index surfaces of the Pt–Pd alloys. In this work, we set the MC simulation temperature at 1200 K to be consistent with the annealing temperature in experimental measurements [34, 35]. First, we performed the MC simulations for the three-dimensional periodic cubic simulation cells containing in total 500 randomly distributed Pt and Pd atoms at 1200 K to find the lattice constants for the Pt–Pd bulk alloys. The whole MC simulation took 2 × 106 MC steps. We only averaged the pressure of the simulation cells in the last 1 × 106 MC steps to eliminate the influence from the original structure. Thus, the lattice constant of the Pt–Pd alloys with a given bulk Pt concentration was determined from the dimensions of the simulation cell that led to zero average pressure from the MC simulations. Figure 1 plots the calculated equilibrium lattice constants at 1200 K, displaying a linear relation between the lattice constant and the Pt concentration of the Pt–Pd alloys. Our theoretical predictions of the lattice constants of the Pt–Pd alloys were found to be within 1.5% deviation from the experimental data [36].
Furthermore, we carried out the MC simulations to quantitatively predict the Pt concentrations in the outermost three surface layers of the (111), (100) and (110) surface of the Pt–Pd alloys. We modeled these three low-index extended surfaces using surface slab cells, which have periodic boundaries in the two directions parallel to the surface and a free boundary in the direction normal to the surface. Hence, there are two surfaces in each slab simulation cell. The dimensions of these surface slab cells were determined from the lattice constants (in figure 1) of the bulk Pt–Pd alloy with the same composition. For the (111) surface, the simulation cells have 15 surface layers and 48 atoms in each layer; for the (100) surface, the simulation cells have 17 surface layers and 50 atoms in each layer; and for the (110) surface, the simulation cells have 23 surface layers and 48 atoms at each layer. Thus, the modeled surface slabs were about 30 Å thick for all three low-index extended surfaces of the Pt–Pd alloys.

Starting from the initial surface structures with randomly distributed Pt and Pd atoms, the MC simulations could generate the thermodynamically equilibrium surface structures at T = 1200 K after millions of MC steps. In the MC simulations, we included both the compositional relaxation and structural relaxation of the extended surfaces, conducted 10 × 106 MC steps in total, and sampled the composition profile every 1000 steps in the last 5 × 106 MC steps. Due to surface segregation and the finite size of our simulation cells, the composition at the center of the simulation cell will deviate from the assumed bulk composition at the equilibrium stage of our MC simulations. To rectify this error, we have done a series of MC simulations for each extended surface with various overall compositions to re-establish the bulk composition at the center of the simulation cells.
We plotted the variation of the calculated Pt concentrations at the outermost three surface layers as a function of the Pt bulk concentration in  figure 2 for the (111), (100) and (110) surfaces of the PtxPd100−x alloys. Here, x varies from 5 to 95 with a separation of 5. Our results from the MC simulations revealed that Pd would enrich the outermost layer of all three low-index surfaces for all compositions of the Pt–Pd alloys. This result is consistent with the simple thermodynamic model prediction [12], previous atomistic modeling results [13–17] and experimental observations [34, 35]. Further analysis on the equilibrium structures from the MC simulations revealed that the (110) surface would tend to reconstruct at the high Pt concentration regime of the Pt–Pd alloys if the atoms were allowed to relax to the lowest-energy configurations. The surface reconstruction phenomena in the (110) surface of the Pt94Pd6 alloys had been observed in experiments [35]. Hence, our MC simulations suggested that the surface reconstruction might cause Pt to slightly enrich the second sub-surface layer of the (110) surface of the Pt–Pd alloys.

Moreover, our results in figure 2 pointed out that the surface Pt concentrations would be the lowest at the outermost layer and gradually increase deep into the bulk region. At the third sub-layer of the surfaces, the surface Pt concentrations are nearly equal to the bulk Pt concentrations of the PtxPd100−x alloys. Such a monotonically increasing segregation profile of the surface Pt concentrations had also been found in previous simulation work using the adapted EMT potentials for the Pt–Pd alloy [13]. Furthermore, our MC simulation results in figure 2 showed that the extent of the Pd segregation to the outermost layer of the extended surfaces generally followed the sequence of (110), (100) and (111): the strongest segregation to the (110) surface and the weakest segregation to the (111) surface. For example, the Pt surface concentrations in the outermost layer of the Pt50Pd50 alloy were found to be 9.9 at.% in the (110) surface, 11.8 at.% in the (100) surface and 29.0 at.% in the (111) surface from our MC simulations. Our theoretical result about the sequence of segregation extent in different extended surfaces agrees with that from experimental measurements [34, 35].
The Pt surface concentrations were measured in [10] to be about 50 at.% and 5 at.% in the Pt80Pd20 and Pt20Pd80 polycrystalline surfaces annealed at 800  °C under ultrahigh vacuum, respectively. In comparison, our calculated Pt surface concentrations in this work were 69.4 at.% in the (111) surface (figure 2(a)), 41.7 at.% in the (100) surface (figure 2(b)) and 46.1 at.% in the (110) surface (figure 2(c)) of the Pt80Pd20 alloy; and 7.1 at.% in the (111) surface (figure 2(a)), 2.5 at.% in the (100) surface (figure 2(b)) and 1.7 at.% in the (110) surface (figure 2(c)) of the Pt20Pd80 alloy. Simply averaging the values in the three surfaces, we obtained the Pt surface concentration of 52.4 at.% and 3.8 at.% in the outermost surface layer of the Pt80Pd20 and Pt20Pd80 polycrystalline surfaces annealed at 1200 K, respectively. Thus, our theoretical predictions based on the MC simulations with the developed MEAM potentials are in excellent agreement with the data obtained from the low-energy ion scattering technique [10].
3.3. Simulate surface segregation in the nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys
Surface segregation phenomena in nanoparticle surfaces could be quite different from those in extended surfaces. In the extended surface, there are sufficient segregated species in the system so that the composition of the interior regions would not be altered by the surface segregation process. However, the number of atoms in a nanoparticle is normally limited. Consequently, the segregation of some species to the nanoparticle surface would appreciably change the chemical compositions both in the surface and in the interior region of the nanoparticle. Moreover, all the surface atoms in the three extended low-index surfaces [(111), (100) and (110)] are equivalent. In contrast, the surface atoms in the nanoparticle surface have different numbers of nearest neighbors as shown in figure 3 for an fcc cubo-octahedral nanoparticle. This inhomogeneity could cause preferable segregation phenomena (segregated species would be more likely ro occupy some sites than others) in the outermost surface of the nanoparticles.

The surface atoms have nine nearest neighbors (9 nn) at (111) facets, eight nearest neighbors (8 nn) at (100) facets, seven nearest neighbors (7 nn) at edges and six nearest neighbors (6 nn) at vertices.

Studying the surface segregation phenomena in the nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys, we have performed the MC simulations to obtain the equilibrium Pt concentrations in the surface of cubo-octahedral Pt25Pd75, Pt50Pd50 and Pt75Pd25 nanoparticles. Figure 3 shows the atomistic structure of a cubo-octahedral nanoparticle constructed from fcc bulk crystals. In this work, we modeled four different sized cubo-octahedral nanoparticles which contain 586, 1289, 2406 and 4033 atoms and correspondingly have a diameter of 2.6 nm, 3.5 nm, 4.4 nm and 5.3 nm, respectively. We distributed randomly the Pt and Pd atoms in the initial structure of the nanoparticles and then drove these nanoparticles to their thermodynamic equilibrium configurations by carrying out 20 × 106 steps of MC simulations at temperatures of T = 600 K. It notes that 600 K is close to the employed reduction temperature in the alloy particle fabrication process [8]. Hence, our simulation results at T = 600 K would generate the representative structures of the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticles comparable to experimental samples. For the equilibrium nanoparticles, we sampled the Pt concentrations in the surface, core and different surface sites every 1000 steps in the last 10 × 106 MC steps.
In figure 4, we showed snapshots of the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticles attained from our MC simulations. It can be seen in these figures that the equilibrium nanoparticles have rounded up around their vertices and have more Pd atoms in their outermost surface than their overall composition. In addition, the Pt atoms (gray circles) mostly appear at the (111) facets in the equilibrium nanoparticle surfaces. Quantifying these observations, we plotted in figure 5 the variation of the calculated average Pt concentrations at the shell (outermost surface layer), core (interior region beneath the shell), (111) facets and (100) facets of the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticles as a function of the diameter of the nanoparticles.

Our results in figures 5(a), (c) and (e) indicated that, as compared to the overall composition of the nanoparticles, the Pt concentrations in the shell were about 15–20 at.% lower while the Pt concentration in the core region were about 10–30 at.% higher. Hence, we predicted that the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticle would have a Pd-enriched shell and a Pt-enriched core. Our results in figures 5(b), (d) and (f) showed that the Pt concentrations were not equal at the (111) and (100) facets of the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticle surface. For all the simulated Pt–Pd nanoparticles, the Pt concentrations at the (111) facets were found to be much higher than those at the (100) facets. It was inferred that the Pd atoms would prefer segregating to the (100) facets than the (111) facets in the shell of the Pt–Pd nanoparticles. This is consistent with the results in table 5 and figure 2 that the extent of Pd segregation to the (100) extended surface would be much stronger than that to the (111) extended surface.
Our results in figure 5 also revealed that the size of nanoparticles affected the surface segregation phenomena in the Pt–Pd nanoparticles. It was noticed in figures 5(a), (c) and (e) that the extent of Pd segregation to the nanoparticle surface increased with the increase of nanoparticle diameter (in the range from 2 to 6 nm), implying that the Pd surface segregation was suppressed in the small Pt–Pd nanoparticles. Moreover, we observed in figures 5(b), (d) and (f) that the Pt concentration at the (100) facets was very low and did not vary much with the nanoparticle size. In contrast, the Pt concentration at the (111) facets of the nanoparticles would change dramatically with nanoparticle size. More interestingly, our MC simulations predicted that the Pt concentrations at the (111) facets were higher than the overall Pt concentration in the Pt50Pd50 nanoparticle containing 586 atoms and the four Pt75Pd25 nanoparticles in this study although the Pt concentrations at the shell were lower than the overall Pt concentration of these nanoparticles. Pt has better catalytic activity than Pd for many applications. Therefore the Pt-enriched (111) facets in the Pt–Pd nanoparticles are desired in catalyst design.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we have first developed a set of parameters within the MEAM framework for Pt–Pd alloys based on experiment data and first-principles calculation results. Furthermore, we used our developed MEAM potentials and the MC simulation method to investigate the surface segregation phenomena in the extended and nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys. Our MC simulation results (in figure 2) indicated that the Pd atoms would always segregate to, and hence enrich, the outermost layer of the extended surfaces for all the compositions of the PtxPd100−x alloys. In addition, it was found that, among the three low-index extended surfaces, the extent of the Pd surface segregation was strongest in the open (110) surface and weakest in the closely packed (111) surface. Moreover, we predicted from our MC simulations that the equilibrium Pt–Pd nanoparticle would have a Pd-enriched shell and a Pt-enriched core. In the Pd-enriched shell of the cubo-octahedral Pt–Pd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms would primarily occupy the (100) facet surface sites while the Pt atoms would mainly sit on the (111) facet surface sites.
Therefore, we have developed the MEAM potentials that could accurately describe the surface segregation process in the extended and nanoparticle surfaces of Pt–Pd alloys. This work enables us to quantitatively predict the surface composition of various Pt–Pd bimetallic nanostructures, and reliably simulate the surface segregation phenomena in the multi-component alloy systems containing Pt and Pd components in future studies.
