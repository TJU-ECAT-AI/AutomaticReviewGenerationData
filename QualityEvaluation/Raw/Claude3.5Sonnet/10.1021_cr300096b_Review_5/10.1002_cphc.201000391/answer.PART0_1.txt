[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "For T850 K, these morphological changes are accompanied by exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms, that is, the onset of surface alloy formation."

[4] "On Ru(0001), blocking of island or step-edge growth by locally alloyed regions lying in front of the step edge might also play a role in the surface morphology after annealing to T>850 K."

[5] "The modified chemical and catalytic properties of bimetallic (catalyst) surfaces are mostly discussed in terms of a few fundamental concepts, namely the geometric ensemble effect, the electronic ligand effect and the electronic strain effect."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and distribution of components in bimetallic systems. As shown in the Pt-Ru system, annealing at different temperatures leads to various structural configurations, from dendritic islands to compact shapes, and eventually to surface alloy formation.

2. Surface alloy formation begins at higher temperatures (around 850 K for Pt-Ru), involving exchange processes between the two metals. This process can significantly alter the catalytic properties of the surface.

3. The distribution of components in the surface layer is influenced by thermodynamic preferences. For instance, in the Pt-Ru system, Pt and Ru atoms prefer to be supported on specific sites, which affects the growth and morphology of islands and step decorations.

4. The catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces are affected by three main effects: geometric ensemble effect, electronic ligand effect, and electronic strain effect. These effects are directly related to the structural configuration and distribution of components in the surface layer.

5. Surface segregation and local alloying can influence the growth of islands and step edges, further affecting the overall surface morphology and, consequently, the catalytic properties.

6. The use of probe molecules like CO and D2 in adsorption studies reveals how the chemical properties of the surface change with different structural configurations, providing insights into the catalytic behavior of these bimetallic systems.

These factors collectively determine the stability, structure, and catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, making it crucial to understand and control these aspects for optimizing their performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂（特别是基于铂的系统，如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置有显著影响。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 温度在决定双金属系统的表面结构和成分分布方面起着关键作用。如在Pt-Ru系统中所示，在不同温度下退火会导致各种结构配置，从树枝状岛到紧凑形状，最终形成表面合金。

2. 表面合金形成始于较高温度（Pt-Ru约850 K），涉及两种金属之间的交换过程。这个过程可以显著改变表面的催化性能。

3. 表面层中成分的分布受热力学偏好的影响。例如，在Pt-Ru系统中，Pt和Ru原子倾向于在特定位点上支撑，这影响了岛屿和台阶装饰的生长和形态。

4. 双金属表面的催化性能受三个主要效应影响：几何集合效应、电子配体效应和电子应变效应。这些效应直接与表面层中成分的结构配置和分布相关。

5. 表面偏析和局部合金化可以影响岛屿和台阶边缘的生长，进而影响整体表面形态，从而影响催化性能。

6. 在吸附研究中使用CO和D2等探针分子，揭示了表面化学性质如何随不同结构配置而变化，为了解这些双金属系统的催化行为提供了见解。

这些因素共同决定了双金属催化剂的稳定性、结构和催化性能，因此理解和控制这些方面对于优化它们在各种应用中的性能至关重要。
