The literature discusses how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly for the Pt-Ru system:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure and distribution of components in bimetallic catalysts. For the Pt-Ru system, deposition of Pt at room temperature followed by heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a wide range of distributions for both components in the topmost layer.

2. Surface alloy formation is temperature-dependent. In the Pt-Ru system, the onset of surface alloy formation begins at around 850 K at the edges of vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films. Complete surface alloy formation occurs after annealing to 1300 K.

3. The structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts significantly affects their catalytic properties. Structurally well-defined planar bimetallic surfaces serve as excellent model systems for correlating chemical and catalytic properties to relevant structural properties.

4. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to access the structural parameters of the surface layer. When combined with adsorption/catalysis studies on these well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide ideal test cases for understanding the physical origins of modified chemical and catalytic surface properties.

5. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit superior activity and/or selectivity compared to their pure component counterparts. This observation has driven extensive research efforts to understand the physical origins of these improved catalytic properties.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss Pt-3d alloys, the insights gained from the Pt-Ru system suggest that similar principles of temperature-dependent surface segregation, alloy formation, and structural configuration likely apply to other Pt-based bimetallic systems. These factors would consequently influence the catalytic properties and performance of such systems in various applications.

该文献讨论了热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是对于Pt-Ru系统：

1. 温度在决定双金属催化剂的表面结构和成分分布方面起着关键作用。对于Pt-Ru系统，在室温下沉积Pt并随后加热到不同温度（最高1300 K）会导致顶层两种成分的分布出现广泛变化。

2. 表面合金的形成取决于温度。在Pt-Ru系统中，表面合金形成的开始温度约为850 K，发生在Pt单层薄膜空位岛的边缘。在退火到1300 K后，表面合金形成完全。

3. 双金属催化剂的结构构型显著影响其催化性能。结构明确的平面双金属表面是将化学和催化性能与相关结构性能相关联的优秀模型系统。

4. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）用于获取表面层的结构参数。当与这些结构明确的表面上的吸附/催化研究结合时，这些模型系统为理解改性化学和催化表面性能的物理起源提供了理想的测试案例。

5. 双金属催化剂通常表现出比纯组分更优越的活性和/或选择性。这一观察结果推动了大量研究，以理解这些改进的催化性能的物理起源。

虽然文献没有具体讨论Pt-3d合金，但从Pt-Ru系统获得的见解表明，类似的温度依赖性表面偏析、合金形成和结构构型原理可能适用于其他基于Pt的双金属系统。这些因素随后会影响此类系统在各种应用中的催化性能。
