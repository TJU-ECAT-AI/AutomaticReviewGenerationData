[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "For T≥850 K, these morphological changes are accompanied by exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms, that is, the onset of surface alloy formation."

[4] "After annealing to 1300 K, Pt and Ru surface atoms are finally homogeneously distributed in the resulting surface alloy."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the surface structure. At room temperature, Pt forms islands on the Ru surface. As the temperature increases, the distribution of Pt and Ru in the topmost layer varies widely.

2. Surface alloy formation begins at around 850 K, involving exchange processes between Pt adatoms and embedded Ru surface atoms. This process is driven by thermodynamic preferences for mixing at higher temperatures.

3. Complete homogeneous distribution of Pt and Ru surface atoms in the alloy is achieved after annealing to 1300 K, indicating that this temperature provides sufficient energy to overcome segregation tendencies and achieve a thermodynamically stable mixed configuration.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties:

1. The transition from Pt islands to a mixed alloy alters the available adsorption sites and ensemble effects, which can dramatically change catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The gradual mixing process allows for tuning of the surface composition and thus the catalytic properties by controlling the annealing temperature.

3. The homogeneous distribution at high temperatures creates a well-defined surface that can serve as an ideal model system for studying the relationship between structure and catalytic properties in bimetallic systems.

These findings highlight the importance of carefully controlling preparation conditions to achieve desired surface structures in bimetallic catalysts, which directly impacts their performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于Pt-Ru双金属催化剂：

1. 温度在决定表面结构方面起着关键作用。在室温下，Pt在Ru表面形成岛状结构。随着温度升高，Pt和Ru在最外层的分布变化很大。

2. 表面合金形成始于850 K左右，涉及Pt吸附原子和嵌入的Ru表面原子之间的交换过程。这个过程是由高温下混合的热力学偏好驱动的。

3. 在退火到1300 K后，Pt和Ru表面原子在合金中实现完全均匀分布，表明这个温度提供了足够的能量来克服偏析趋势，达到热力学稳定的混合构型。

这些结构变化对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 从Pt岛到混合合金的转变改变了可用的吸附位点和集合效应，这可能会显著改变催化活性和选择性。

2. 渐进的混合过程允许通过控制退火温度来调节表面组成，从而调节催化性能。

3. 高温下的均匀分布创造了一个明确定义的表面，可以作为研究双金属系统中结构与催化性能关系的理想模型系统。

这些发现强调了在双金属催化剂中仔细控制制备条件以实现所需表面结构的重要性，这直接影响了它们在各种应用中的性能。
