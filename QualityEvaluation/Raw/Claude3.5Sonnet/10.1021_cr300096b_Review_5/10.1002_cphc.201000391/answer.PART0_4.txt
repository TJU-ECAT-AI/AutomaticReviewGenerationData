[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "Pt deposition at room temperature (300 K) and subsequent heating to different temperatures (up to 1300 K) leads to a broad variation of the distribution of both components in the topmost layer."

[3] "The surface confinement of the alloy layer is largely due to a higher energy barrier for diffusion of Pt into the bulk than for intermixing in the outermost layer."

[4] "On the atomic scale, this means that Pt and Ru atoms in the outermost layer prefer to be supported on Ru3 sites rather than on Ru2Pt, RuPt2, or Pt3 sites. This can be rationalized by the stronger binding to Ru compared to Pt, which in a simplified picture means an increase of the pairwise bond strength in the order PtPt, PtRu, RuRu."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by several thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions:

1. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of components in the topmost layer. Heating to different temperatures leads to variations in surface composition and structure.

2. Energy barriers for diffusion affect the confinement of alloy layers. A higher energy barrier for Pt diffusion into the bulk compared to surface intermixing promotes surface alloy formation.

3. Binding strength preferences influence atomic arrangements. Atoms tend to be supported on sites that offer stronger binding, following the order Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3 for Pt-Ru systems.

4. Pairwise bond strengths affect stability, with RuRu > PtRu > PtPt in Pt-Ru systems.

These factors have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The distribution of components in the surface layer affects the availability and nature of active sites.

2. Surface confinement of the alloy layer can maintain a high concentration of active components at the surface.

3. Preferential binding arrangements can create specific ensemble effects that influence catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. The variation in bond strengths can affect the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

Understanding and controlling these thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions allows for the tuning of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, optimizing their catalytic performance and stability.

双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受到几个热力学偏好和反应条件的影响：

1. 温度在决定最外层组分分布中起着关键作用。加热到不同温度会导致表面成分和结构的变化。

2. 扩散能垒影响合金层的局限性。与表面混合相比，铂向体相扩散的能垒较高，这促进了表面合金的形成。

3. 结合强度偏好影响原子排列。原子倾向于支持在提供更强结合的位点上，对于Pt-Ru系统，遵循Ru3 > Ru2Pt > RuPt2 > Pt3的顺序。

4. 成对键强度影响稳定性，在Pt-Ru系统中，RuRu > PtRu > PtPt。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 表面层中组分的分布影响活性位点的可用性和性质。

2. 合金层的表面局限性可以在表面维持高浓度的活性组分。

3. 优先结合排列可以创造影响催化活性和选择性的特定集合效应。

4. 键强度的变化可能影响催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。

理解和控制这些热力学偏好和反应条件允许针对特定应用调整双金属催化剂，优化其催化性能和稳定性。
