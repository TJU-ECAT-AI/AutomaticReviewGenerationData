[1] "The structural parameters of the surface layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In combination with adsorption/catalysis studies on these structurally well-defined surfaces, such model systems provide an ideal test case for different effects discussed as physical origin for the modified chemical and catalytic surface properties."

[2] "For a pseudomorphic Pt layer on the Ru substrate, the lattice mismatch between the two components of the bimetallic sample (Pt: 2.77 Å, Ru: 2.70 Å) results in electronic strain effects. Furthermore, the interaction between the Ru(0001) substrate and the Pt cover layer also modifies the electronic structure and hence the chemical properties of the Pt cover layer (vertical electronic ligand effect)."

[3] "The onset of alloy formation by exchange of Pt and Ru surface atoms is observed after heating to 850 K. The small degree of surface alloy formation at this point leads to small and barely noticeable changes in the TPD spectra and hence of the chemical properties of the surface. Annealing to higher temperatures leads to stronger (but still incomplete) intermixing, which also induces pronounced changes of the CO and D adsorption behavior."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-based systems. For Pt-Ru catalysts, increasing temperature leads to structural changes that affect catalytic properties:

1. At lower temperatures, Pt forms islands on the Ru surface, with lattice mismatch causing strain effects and electronic interactions modifying the Pt layer's properties.

2. Heating to 850 K initiates surface alloying through Pt-Ru atom exchange, with minimal changes to chemical properties.

3. Further heating increases intermixing, leading to pronounced changes in CO and D adsorption behavior.

4. Annealing to 1300 K results in a fully intermixed surface alloy with random distribution of components, significantly altering adsorption properties.

These structural changes impact catalytic performance through:

1. Modification of electronic properties due to strain and ligand effects
2. Changes in adsorption site availability and strength
3. Formation of mixed metal ensembles with unique catalytic properties

The degree of alloying and surface composition can be controlled by temperature, allowing for tuning of catalytic properties for specific applications. This temperature-dependent structural evolution demonstrates the importance of preparation conditions in determining the final catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂(如基于Pt的系统)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。对于Pt-Ru催化剂,温度升高会导致影响催化性能的结构变化:

1. 在较低温度下,Pt在Ru表面形成岛状结构,晶格失配造成应变效应,电子相互作用改变Pt层的性质。

2. 加热到850 K时,通过Pt-Ru原子交换开始表面合金化,化学性质变化很小。

3. 进一步加热增加了混合程度,导致CO和D吸附行为发生明显变化。

4. 退火至1300 K形成完全混合的表面合金,组分随机分布,显著改变吸附性质。

这些结构变化通过以下方式影响催化性能:

1. 由于应变和配体效应导致的电子性质改变
2. 吸附位可用性和强度的变化
3. 形成具有独特催化性质的混合金属集合体

合金化程度和表面成分可以通过温度控制,从而可以针对特定应用调整催化性质。这种依赖于温度的结构演变表明,制备条件对确定双金属系统的最终催化性质至关重要。
