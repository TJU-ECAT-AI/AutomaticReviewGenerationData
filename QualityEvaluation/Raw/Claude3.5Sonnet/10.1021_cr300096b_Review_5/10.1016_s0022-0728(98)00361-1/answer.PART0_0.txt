[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures"

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions:

1. Thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, but rapid preparation methods like sputtering can produce metastable structures with systematic lattice parameter changes.

2. Under electrochemical conditions, surface segregation occurs, forming a Pt-rich skin layer on the alloy surface. This segregation is driven by the different electrochemical stabilities of Pt and Fe in acidic environments.

3. The thickness of the Pt skin layer is crucial for maintaining the enhanced catalytic properties. A thin Pt skin allows the electronic structure to be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, while thicker skin layers may reduce this effect.

4. The structural configuration of the catalyst surface can change during reactions, with the formation of the Pt skin layer potentially altering the surface composition without significantly changing the bulk structure.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is modified by the underlying alloy, which can enhance catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction.

2. The stability and performance of the catalyst depend on maintaining an optimal balance between surface segregation and bulk composition.

3. The thickness of the Pt skin layer needs to be controlled to preserve the enhanced catalytic properties while providing sufficient stability.

4. The preparation method and reaction conditions can significantly affect the final structure and performance of the catalyst, necessitating careful optimization for specific applications.

Pt基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的显著影响：

1. Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3，但快速制备方法（如溅射）可以产生具有系统性晶格参数变化的亚稳结构。

2. 在电化学条件下，表面会发生偏析，在合金表面形成富Pt的皮层。这种偏析是由Pt和Fe在酸性环境中不同的电化学稳定性驱动的。

3. Pt皮层的厚度对保持增强的催化性能至关重要。薄的Pt皮层允许电子结构被下层的块体合金修饰，而较厚的皮层可能会减弱这种效果。

4. 催化剂表面的结构构型可能在反应过程中发生变化，Pt皮层的形成可能会改变表面组成，但不会显著改变块体结构。

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 表面Pt原子的电子结构被下层合金修饰，这可以增强对氧还原等反应的催化活性。

2. 催化剂的稳定性和性能取决于表面偏析和块体组成之间的最佳平衡。

3. 需要控制Pt皮层的厚度，以保持增强的催化性能，同时提供足够的稳定性。

4. 制备方法和反应条件可以显著影响催化剂的最终结构和性能，需要针对特定应用进行仔细优化。
