[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures"

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions:

1. Thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, but rapid preparation methods like sputtering can produce metastable structures with systematic lattice parameter changes.

2. Under electrochemical conditions, surface segregation occurs, forming a Pt-rich skin layer on the alloy surface. This segregation is driven by the different electrochemical stabilities of Pt and Fe in acidic environments.

3. The thickness of the Pt skin layer is crucial for maintaining the enhanced catalytic properties. A thin Pt skin allows the electronic structure to be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, while thicker skin layers may reduce this effect.

4. The structural configuration of the catalyst surface can change during reactions, with the formation of the Pt skin layer potentially altering the surface composition without significantly changing the bulk structure.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is modified by the underlying alloy, which can enhance catalytic activity for reactions like oxygen reduction.

2. The stability and performance of the catalyst depend on maintaining an optimal balance between surface segregation and bulk composition.

3. The thickness of the Pt skin layer needs to be controlled to preserve the enhanced catalytic properties while providing sufficient stability.

4. The preparation method and reaction conditions can significantly affect the final structure and performance of the catalyst, necessitating careful optimization for specific applications.

Pt基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的显著影响：

1. Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3，但快速制备方法（如溅射）可以产生具有系统性晶格参数变化的亚稳结构。

2. 在电化学条件下，表面会发生偏析，在合金表面形成富Pt的皮层。这种偏析是由Pt和Fe在酸性环境中不同的电化学稳定性驱动的。

3. Pt皮层的厚度对保持增强的催化性能至关重要。薄的Pt皮层允许电子结构被下层的块体合金修饰，而较厚的皮层可能会减弱这种效果。

4. 催化剂表面的结构构型可能在反应过程中发生变化，Pt皮层的形成可能会改变表面组成，但不会显著改变块体结构。

这些因素对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 表面Pt原子的电子结构被下层合金修饰，这可以增强对氧还原等反应的催化活性。

2. 催化剂的稳定性和性能取决于表面偏析和块体组成之间的最佳平衡。

3. 需要控制Pt皮层的厚度，以保持增强的催化性能，同时提供足够的稳定性。

4. 制备方法和反应条件可以显著影响催化剂的最终结构和性能，需要针对特定应用进行仔细优化。

[2] "We have found that a fine Pt alloy catalyst is covered with a pure Pt skin under the practical operation conditions in PAFCs [8].

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. 

In the case of PtFe alloys, the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures. However, when prepared by sputtering at room temperature, these alloys exhibit only a face-centered cubic structure with lattice parameters changing systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe.

Under electrochemical conditions, even mild ones, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a pure Pt skin layer. This surface segregation occurs despite the bulk composition remaining unchanged, as evidenced by EDX measurements. The thickness of this Pt skin layer is crucial for the catalytic properties of the alloy.

The catalytic enhancement observed in these systems appears to be dramatically affected by the thickness of the Pt skin. When the skin is thin enough, the electronic structure of the surface Pt can be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, leading to significant enhancement of catalytic activity. However, as the skin layer thickens, this modification diminishes, potentially explaining the controversial enhancement effects reported in various studies.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance in various applications. The ability to control the surface composition and electronic structure through alloying and reaction conditions offers a pathway to tune catalytic properties. However, the dynamic nature of these systems under reaction conditions, particularly the formation and evolution of the Pt skin layer, presents both challenges and opportunities for catalyst design and optimization.

热力学偏好和反应条件对基于Pt的双金属催化剂（尤其是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。

对于PtFe合金，热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3或它们的混合物。然而，当在室温下通过溅射制备时，这些合金仅表现出面心立方结构，其晶格参数在纯Pt和Fe之间系统地变化。

在电化学条件下，即使是温和的条件，Pt也倾向于偏析到表面，形成纯Pt皮层。尽管体相成分保持不变（通过EDX测量证实），这种表面偏析仍然发生。这个Pt皮层的厚度对合金的催化性能至关重要。

这些系统中观察到的催化增强效应似乎受Pt皮层厚度的显著影响。当皮层足够薄时，表面Pt的电子结构可以被下层的体相合金修饰，导致催化活性显著增强。然而，随着皮层变厚，这种修饰效应减弱，这可能解释了各种研究中报道的有争议的增强效应。

这些发现对各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。通过合金化和反应条件控制表面成分和电子结构的能力为调整催化性能提供了途径。然而，这些系统在反应条件下的动态特性，特别是Pt皮层的形成和演变，为催化剂设计和优化带来了挑战和机遇。

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts:

1. Thermodynamic stability: The thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures. However, the preparation method (sputtering at room temperature) resulted in a face-centered cubic structure for all Pt-Fe compositions studied, deviating from the thermodynamically preferred phases.

2. Surface segregation: Under electrochemical conditions, the alloy surfaces become covered with a thin layer of pure Pt (Pt skin), indicating surface segregation of Pt atoms. This Pt skin formation occurs even in mild acidic conditions.

3. Structural configuration: The Pt skin layer is very thin, approximately 1 nm thick. Despite this surface segregation, the bulk composition of the alloys remains unchanged, as confirmed by EDX measurements.

4. Catalytic properties: The presence of the Pt skin does not negate the enhanced catalytic activity of the alloys. In fact, a significant enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is observed despite the Pt skin formation.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance:

1. The preparation method can override thermodynamic preferences, allowing for the creation of metastable structures with potentially unique catalytic properties.

2. Surface segregation under reaction conditions does not necessarily diminish the beneficial effects of alloying, as the underlying alloy can still influence the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms.

3. The thin nature of the Pt skin allows for electronic modification by the underlying alloy, which is crucial for maintaining enhanced catalytic activity.

4. The stability of the alloy structure under reaction conditions is an important consideration for practical applications, especially when considering highly dispersed catalyst systems where corrosion effects may be more pronounced.

文献为我们提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响Pt-Fe双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的见解：

1. 热力学稳定性：Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3或它们的混合物。然而，制备方法（室温下溅射）导致所有研究的Pt-Fe成分都呈现面心立方结构，偏离了热力学上更倾向的相。

2. 表面偏析：在电化学条件下，合金表面会形成一层薄薄的纯Pt层（Pt皮层），表明Pt原子发生了表面偏析。即使在温和的酸性条件下也会发生这种Pt皮层形成。

3. 结构构型：Pt皮层非常薄，大约1纳米厚。尽管发生了表面偏析，但合金的体相成分保持不变，这一点通过EDX测量得到了证实。

4. 催化性能：Pt皮层的存在并不会抵消合金的增强催化活性。事实上，尽管形成了Pt皮层，仍然观察到氧还原反应（ORR）活性显著增强。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 制备方法可以超越热力学偏好，允许创造具有潜在独特催化性能的亚稳定结构。

2. 反应条件下的表面偏析不一定会减弱合金化的有益效果，因为底层合金仍然可以影响表面Pt原子的电子结构。

3. Pt皮层的薄性质允许底层合金对其进行电子修饰，这对于维持增强的催化活性至关重要。

4. 反应条件下合金结构的稳定性是实际应用中的一个重要考虑因素，特别是在考虑高度分散的催化剂系统时，腐蚀效应可能更加显著。

The literature provides insights into how reaction conditions influence the stability and surface configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts:

1. While thermodynamically stable phases of Pt-Fe alloys include Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, the preparation method (sputtering at room temperature) resulted in a face-centered cubic structure across all compositions studied.

2. Under electrochemical conditions, a thin Pt skin layer (approximately 1 nm thick) forms on the alloy surface, regardless of the bulk composition.

3. Despite surface segregation of Pt, the bulk composition remains stable, as evidenced by EDX measurements matching the original electrode compositions.

4. The presence of this Pt skin does not negate the enhanced catalytic activity of the alloys, suggesting that the electronic structure of the bulk alloy still influences the surface properties.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties:

1. The surface composition differs from the bulk, which can affect reactivity.
2. The thin Pt skin allows for electronic modification by the underlying alloy, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity.
3. The stability of the bulk composition suggests these catalysts may maintain their performance over time, though long-term stability studies would be needed to confirm this.

Overall, the study demonstrates that reaction conditions significantly influence surface segregation in Pt-Fe alloys, creating a complex interplay between surface and bulk properties that ultimately determines catalytic performance.

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence Pt-based bimetallic catalysts:

1. Preparation method affects structure: Sputtering at room temperature produced a face-centered cubic structure for Pt-Fe alloys across compositions, despite thermodynamically stable phases being Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3.

2. Surface segregation occurs: Electrochemical measurements led to the formation of Pt-rich surface layers on the alloys, demonstrating surface segregation under reaction conditions.

3. Thin Pt skin forms: The Pt-rich surface layer was estimated to be very thin, around 1 nm thick, based on XPS analysis.

4. Bulk composition maintained: Despite surface segregation, the overall bulk composition of the alloys remained unchanged after electrochemical testing.

5. Enhanced catalytic activity: The Pt-Fe alloys exhibited significantly improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction compared to pure Pt, even with the Pt-rich surface layer.

These findings suggest that while thermodynamic preferences may favor certain bulk structures, reaction conditions can induce surface segregation in Pt-based alloys.
