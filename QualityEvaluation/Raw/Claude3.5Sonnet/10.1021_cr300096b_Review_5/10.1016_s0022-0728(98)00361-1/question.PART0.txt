Abstract
The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymerelectrolyte fuel cells, which are now attracting
enormous interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles. We have discovered a significant enhancement of
electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe, and found a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which results in 25 times
higher activity than pure Pt activity. It was confirmed experimentally at PtFe bulk alloys that the alloy catalyst surface consists
of a pure Pt skin-layer (B1 nm in thickness) that is modified in the electronic structure by that of the bulk alloy. The
enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the
surfaces.  1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The mechanism of the electrochemical oxygen reduc-
tion reaction (orr) on Pt and Pt alloys has been investi-
gated extensively due to the importance of the catalyst
design for fuel cells [15]. Jalan and Taylor studied the
orr at Pt alloys supported on carbon black in phospho-
ric acid fuel cells (PAFC) and claimed that the enhance-
ment of Pt catalytic activity for the reaction results
from the shortening of PtPt interatomic distances by
alloying [1]. A volcano type behavior was demonstrated
by Appleby in the relationship between the electrocata-
lytic activity and the adsorbate bond length [5]. It is
shown that the lattice contractions due to alloying
resulted in a more favorable PtPt distance for the
dissociative adsorption of O2, while maintaining the
favorable electronic property of Pt. Mukerjee and Srini-
vasan supported the view of favorable PtPt distances,
but found no electronic structure change [6], on the
basis of the results with XRD and XPS at supported Pt
binary alloys in PEFCs. The same research group [7]
rationalized the enhanced electrocatalysis later with in
situ XANES and EXAFS on the basis of the interplay
between the electronic (Pt d-vacancy) and geometric
factors (Pt coordination number) on the one hand, and
their effect on the chemisorption behavior of OH spe-
cies from the electrolyte. Glass et al. [2] found no
activity enhancement for the orr on bulk PtCr alloys in
hot H3PO4 and suggested the possibility of differences
in electrochemical properties of bulk versus supported
fine particles. On the other hand, Paffett et al. [3]
attributed higher activities for the orr on bulk PtCr
alloys in H3PO4 to surface roughening, and hence in-
creased Pt surface area, caused by the dissolution of the
non-precious metal Cr. A study on supported PtCo
alloys in hot H3PO4 by Beard and Ross revealed the
possibility that particle termination, particularly at the
100 vicinal planes in the catalysts, is the reason for
the enhanced electrocatalysis [4]. On the other hand, a
recent study on the catalytic activity and stability of
supported PtCo alloys with well-defined structures by

Watanabe et al. [8] demonstrated that both Co and Pt
dissolve out preferentially from small-size alloy parti-
cles and Pt re-deposits on the surfaces of large-size ones
in hot H3PO4. As for the result, the alloy with a
disordered crystallite structure, which is more corro-
sion-resistant than an ordered one, maintains higher
electrocatalytic activity for a longer time due to the
active alloy surfaces with a relatively large surface area.
As seen above, the role of the morphology or crystallo-
graphic changes and of the electronic structure change
brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the
orr still remains elusive.
PEFCs will be operated under much easier condi-
tions compared with those in PAFCs. Therefore, there
is an opportunity to develop more active cathode cata-
lysts and hence to reduce further the amount of pre-
cious metals used without losing performance from that
of the present level. From this viewpoint, it is essential
to review the role of alloying or the mechanism of the
enhancement of activity. Here, we report a discovery of
a significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity
depending on PtFe alloy compositions, which is
brought about by the modified electronic structure of
thin Pt surface layers covering the bulk alloys.
2. Experimental
PtFe alloy electrodes (ca. 60 nm in thickness) were
prepared on cleaned Pyrex glass disks (0.8 cm in diame-
ter, with a Pt wire lead to the back side through a
pin-hole) by Ar-sputtering pure Pt and Fe targets
simultaneously at room temperature (r.t.) at a con-
trolled rate (calibrated gravimetrically) and positioning
of the disks in an RF-magnetron sputtering apparatus
(ANERVA SPF-332H). The resulting alloy composi-
tion was confirmed expediently with a fluorescent X-ray
analysis (EDX, Horiba XGT-2000V). The values esti-
mated by gravimetry and determined by the analysis
coincided within the experimental error (Bseveral per-
cent). Pure Pt and Fe electrodes were prepared in a
similar way. Titanium thin films of ca. 200 nm in
thickness were sputtered to improve the adhesion be-
tween the disk and the above electrodes. A rotating
disk electrode with a gas-tight Pyrex cell (RED-1,
Nikko Keisoku) was used for the examination of the
electrocatalytic activity of electrodes at r.t. in purified
0.1 M HClO4 solution saturated with pure O2 in the
same manner as our previous work [9]. A reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the same solution was
used as a reference electrode. All the potentials in this
paper are referred to the RHE. Before the measurement
of electrocatalytic activity, fast potential pulses (10 V
s1) between 0.05 and 1.10 V were applied to the
electrodes for surface cleaning and to obtain an active
electrochemical surface. The surface area (ECSA) was
calculated using the charge required for hydrogen des-
orption from the electrode surface in a potential pulse.
The current density, j, is the ratio of an observed
current,
I,
to
the
ECSA.
Hydrodynamic
voltam-
mograms on rotating disk electrodes (v=10002750
rpm) for the orr were recorded with the potential
scanning (10 mV s1) between 1.1 and 0.4 V. The
kinetically controlled current Ik was obtained from the
LevichKoutecky plots [10], i.e. plots of I1 (inverse of
observed current values) versus v1, by extrapolating
the regression lines on the plots to the y-intercept. The
crystallographic structures of the electrodes were exam-
ined with grazing angle XRD (u=1, MAC Science).
Changes of the electronic structures or surface composi-
tions of alloys were examined with XPS (Shimazu
ESCA-750S) before and after the electrochemical exper-
iments. Calibration of spectra was accomplished using
the C1S level (=285 eV) of a carbon source remaining
in the vacuum chamber. The surface composition was
evaluated on the basis of the following equation [11],
NM8IM/(sMlM)
(1)
where NM, IM, sM, and lM represent the concentration,
XPS peak intensity, photoionization cross-section [12]
and mean free path of a photoelectron [13] of metal M,
respectively. The XPS data on 4d5/2 for Pt and 2p3/2 for
Fe were used in the calculation of each metal content.
3. Results and discussion
All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%)
exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the
lattice parameters changed systematically between those
of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering
at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases
are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures [14].
Therefore, it is considered that both Pt and Fe atoms
are uniformly mixed at least in each alloy bulk. Not
only on the fresh Pt and Pt(100x)Fex, but also on those
after measurements of the electrocatalytic activity for
the orr, there were no noticeable changes in the rough-
ness factors of the electrode surfaces, which lay in the
range 4.07.7 independent of the composition. The
effect of the roughness factor differences among elec-
trodes was eliminated in the evaluation of an enhance-
ment factor for the orr by using a normalized current
density, j, defined above.
Fig. 1 shows an example of polarization curves on
Pt82Fe18 and Pt51Fe49 in comparison with that of pure
Pt. It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpo-
tential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e.
ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,
which was maintained after all the electrochemical mea-
surements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as
that shown in the inset in Fig. 2. The alloys examined

different from each other. HMRDs used in these papers
had relatively small electrode sizes in diameter and did
not have smooth circular shape, which might lead to
such a difference and perhaps an increased over-all
current density ascribed to a meniscus current at the
outer part of the electrode by the perturbation of
hydrodynamic electrolyte flow. At the present polycrys-
talline Pt film electrode, the predominant plane exposed
is (111) as described later, but there is no trend of the
particular increase of the (110) plane at a Pt skin,
formed on alloy surfaces as described later, accompany-
ing the alloying. The reproducibility of the data and a
negligibly small hysteresis in the evaluation of the en-
hancement were observed on every electrode in the
cyclic voltammograms. Moreover, the activity changed
systematically by increasing the non-precious metal
content, as shown below. Therefore, we concluded that
a valid evaluation of the enhancement effect by alloying
was available as long as electrodes similar with respect
to the surface morphology and structure were used
under the same experimental conditions.
Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the kinetic current
density, jk=Ik/(ECSA), on the electrode composition.
The jk was determined for each electrode at constant
potential in the manner described in the experimental
section. A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe
content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25
over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant
at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was
sufficient. Such a significant enhancement and the max-
imum have not been reported so far. Previously, an
enhancement on fine Pt alloy particles in gas-diffusion
electrodes was reported under PEFC operation condi-
tions, but the factors were all small; for example,
noticeable values among them were 1.4 and 2.6 for
PtFe and PtCr alloys, respectively [7].
A question is raised as to whether the enhancement
was really a unique specificity for finely divided alloy
catalysts as suggested by the previous work [2,6] or
common for both bulky and dispersed alloys. As de-
scribed in the introduction, the conclusion of previous
investigations with bulk alloys is that there was no
essential enhancement strictly ascribed to alloying but
an enhancement might be attributed to a special struc-
tural change at the alloys supported on substrates or
loaded in gas-diffusion electrodes [2] or attributed to a
simple surface roughening brought about by the en-
hanced corrosion [3]. The significant enhancement dis-
covered in the present study disagrees with those
previous results. We have found that a fine Pt alloy
catalyst is covered with a pure Pt skin under the
practical operation conditions in PAFCs [8]. Although
the present experimental conditions are much milder
than those in PAFCs, the formation of a similar Pt skin
layer could be predicted on PtFe alloys even under the
present experimental conditions. If it is true, the previ-
showed the Tafel slope of ca. 0.12 V decade1 for
the orr similar to that of Pt in the potential region
B0.8 V, indicating no difference of the rate determin-
ing step (rds) of the reaction process. The I/(IdI)
value at a constant potential on the pure Pt is relatively
small compared with those on hanging meniscus rotat-
ing disk electrodes (HMRD) of Pt single crystals with
low index planes [15,16]. The dependence of the activity
for the orr on the crystal plane has been demonstrated
in these papers, which changed in the sequence (110)\
(111)\(100). However, the individual activities were

tion method of surface composition is reliable at least
for the present alloy system. It is clear that all of the
alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the
electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their com-
positions determined with EDX, which can detect ele-
ments existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively
than XPS, coincided well with those of the original
electrodes. Additionally, no difference in the diffraction
peaks was observed by grazing angle XRD at the
samples before and after electrochemical experiments.
These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer
should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be
evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis
[11], i.e. B1 nm.
We must emphasize that the extremely large enhance-
ment is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the
presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface. Positive
chemical shifts of 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 from those of pure Pt
indicated by dotted lines were observed, as shown in
Fig. 3. Such positive chemical shifts of Pt atoms were
observed at all of the alloys examined regardless of the
composition, although the shifts decreased after the
experiment. Similar positive shifts were also observed
for other binding energies. These chemical shifts of the
core orbitals such as 4d3/2 and 4d5/2, which we observe
here, show that the electronic structure changes in the
skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and
strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an
increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy. These
results are inconsistent with previous work [6], in which
Mukerjee and Srinivasan found no chemical shift on
supported alloy catalysts. However, the consideration
on the d-vacancy agrees with the observation by Muk-
erjee et al. using XANES and EXAFS [7]. The role of
the geometric factor, which they rationalized in the
enhancement mechanism, is not accepted because the
present bulk alloys and probably the dispersed alloys
used in PEFCs are all covered with a Pt skin and the
interatomic distance of the surface should be the same
as that of pure Pt. We can presumably explain the
controversial enhancement effects reported by others in
the following: the enhancement appears to be dramati-
cally similar to the present work when the Pt skin is
thin enough so that the electronic structure can be
modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of
the modification to the electrode surface may be low-
ered by the presence of thicker skin-layers. The en-
hancement must be negligibly small when the thickness
exceeds the effective distance, which may be the reason
for the lack of enhancement sometimes found previ-
ously for the bulky alloys. On the other hand, we
obtained no evidence of a preferential exposure of
200 vicinal planes, which are in equivalent relation-
ship with 100, on the PtFe alloy surfaces with the
grazing angle XRD (u=1) compared with that of pure
Pt, i.e. the peak ratios of 111/200of the surface Pt
ously proposed mechanism [1,6] ascribing the enhance-
ment to the PtPt interatomic distance may not be
acceptable for the mechanism of the significant en-
hancement discovered in this work. Consequently, it is
very interesting to examine the electronicstructure
change of alloy surfaces as a possible factor for the
enhancement
in
combination
with
the
surface
composition.
An example of XPS data (4d3/2, 4d5/2 at Pt atom and
2p3/2 at Fe atom) before and after the electrochemical
experiment is shown in Fig. 3. The 2p3/2 peak of Fe
atom disappears almost completely after the experiment
but those of 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 of the Pt atom keep the
intensity almost constant. This is clear evidence that the
alloy catalyst easily forms a Pt skin layer by exposing
the surface to a potential up to 1.1 V even in dilute acid
solution. The surface compositions of various alloys
before and after the electrochemical experiment are
shown in Table 1, evaluated with Eq. (1) based on these
XPS data. The compositions of the alloys before the
electrochemical experiment agree well with that deter-
mined gravimetrically or with EDX. Thus, the evalua-

after the electrochemical measurement were 4.1, 3.9,
4.2, 6.9 on Pt(100x)Fex (x=18, 39, 49, 64 at.%) alloys
and 3.1 on pure Pt, respectively. Therefore, the vicinal
plane mechanism [4] for the enhancement is also
unlikely.
Mechanisms for the orr on pure Pt have been pro-
posed but still remain elusive. As one of the possible
mechanisms, Yeager et al. considered that the rds for
the orr on a Pt catalyst surface in acid electrolytes is the
adsorption step of an O2 molecule, as side-on or
bridged type accompanied, with an electron transfer
[17]. Adopting this mechanism for convenience, let us
consider the enhancement mechanism on the alloy cata-
lysts, found in the present work.
O2(solution)+eO2
(adsorbed) rds
(2)
This adsorption type involves a lateral interaction of
the p-orbitals of the O2 with empty dz
2 orbitals of a
surface Pt atom or with empty dxz and dyz orbitals of
dual Pt atoms, respectively, with back bonding from
the partially filled orbitals of the Pt to the p* orbitals of
the O2. The increased d-vacancy of the Pt in the elec-
trode surface, brought about by alloying, must bring
about a strong metaloxygen interaction. Such a strong
interaction will cause an increase of O2
(adsorbed), a
weakening of the OO bond and an increase in its
length, resulting in fast bond scission and/or a new
bond formation between the O atom and H+ in the
electrolyte. Thus, the enhanced catalysis by alloying,
found in the present work, can be well explained in this
mechanism. The rds of the orr is not changed by the
alloying because Pt and the alloys exhibit the same
Tafel slope, as described above. Beyond the Fe content
at the maximum enhancement, a back-donation of elec-
trons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might
be not enough due to too much d-vacancy, resulting in
the slowdown of the orr.
On the other hand, supported binary or ternary alloy
catalysts are still adopted in practical PAFCs as
cathode catalysts in spite of the presence of dealloying,
since the dispersion of such catalyst particles is believed
to be kept higher than that of pure Pt for a long period
although no clear evidence has been published. It may
be true that the stabilization of fine catalyst particles
can be achieved compared with that of pure Pt if the
electronic structure of bulk alloy affects the Pt skin
layers to reduce the surface energy with their increased
d-vacancy.
In conclusion, we could find significant electrocataly-
sis for the orr at PtFe alloys covered with Pt layers,
which depends on alloy compositions, and revealed the
principal role of the electronic structure of Pt and Pt
alloys for the orr. We find a similar enhancement on
PtNi alloys [18] and others. All of the alloys exhibited
constant, enhanced performances under the conditions
examined here before and after various electrochemical
measurements. Since the stability of these alloys is
essential for the application to practical PEFCs, this
must be examined in the highly dispersed state, which is
a more corrosive condition for the alloys than for the
bulk samples. Under such conditions, the thickness of
Pt skin layer must be increased, resulting in the reduced
enhancement. Therefore, the effect of the thickness on
the orr is now being studied in more detail with various
possible approaches. The details will be published else-
where soon.
