[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures [14]."

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[4] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts:

1. Thermodynamic stability: The thermodynamically stable phases for Pt-Fe alloys are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures. However, the preparation method (sputtering at room temperature) resulted in a face-centered cubic structure for all Pt-Fe compositions studied, deviating from the thermodynamically preferred phases.

2. Surface segregation: Under electrochemical conditions, the alloy surfaces become covered with a thin layer of pure Pt (Pt skin), indicating surface segregation of Pt atoms. This Pt skin formation occurs even in mild acidic conditions.

3. Structural configuration: The Pt skin layer is very thin, approximately 1 nm thick. Despite this surface segregation, the bulk composition of the alloys remains unchanged, as confirmed by EDX measurements.

4. Catalytic properties: The presence of the Pt skin does not negate the enhanced catalytic activity of the alloys. In fact, a significant enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is observed despite the Pt skin formation.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance:

1. The preparation method can override thermodynamic preferences, allowing for the creation of metastable structures with potentially unique catalytic properties.

2. Surface segregation under reaction conditions does not necessarily diminish the beneficial effects of alloying, as the underlying alloy can still influence the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms.

3. The thin nature of the Pt skin allows for electronic modification by the underlying alloy, which is crucial for maintaining enhanced catalytic activity.

4. The stability of the alloy structure under reaction conditions is an important consideration for practical applications, especially when considering highly dispersed catalyst systems where corrosion effects may be more pronounced.

文献为我们提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响Pt-Fe双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的见解：

1. 热力学稳定性：Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3或它们的混合物。然而，制备方法（室温下溅射）导致所有研究的Pt-Fe成分都呈现面心立方结构，偏离了热力学上更倾向的相。

2. 表面偏析：在电化学条件下，合金表面会形成一层薄薄的纯Pt层（Pt皮层），表明Pt原子发生了表面偏析。即使在温和的酸性条件下也会发生这种Pt皮层形成。

3. 结构构型：Pt皮层非常薄，大约1纳米厚。尽管发生了表面偏析，但合金的体相成分保持不变，这一点通过EDX测量得到了证实。

4. 催化性能：Pt皮层的存在并不会抵消合金的增强催化活性。事实上，尽管形成了Pt皮层，仍然观察到氧还原反应（ORR）活性显著增强。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 制备方法可以超越热力学偏好，允许创造具有潜在独特催化性能的亚稳定结构。

2. 反应条件下的表面偏析不一定会减弱合金化的有益效果，因为底层合金仍然可以影响表面Pt原子的电子结构。

3. Pt皮层的薄性质允许底层合金对其进行电子修饰，这对于维持增强的催化活性至关重要。

4. 反应条件下合金结构的稳定性是实际应用中的一个重要考虑因素，特别是在考虑高度分散的催化剂系统时，腐蚀效应可能更加显著。
