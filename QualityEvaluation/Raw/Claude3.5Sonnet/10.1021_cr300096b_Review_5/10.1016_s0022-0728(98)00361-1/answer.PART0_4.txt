[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures [14]."

[2] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[3] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[4] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence Pt-based bimetallic catalysts:

1. Preparation method affects structure: Sputtering at room temperature produced a face-centered cubic structure for Pt-Fe alloys across compositions, despite thermodynamically stable phases being Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3.

2. Surface segregation occurs: Electrochemical measurements led to the formation of Pt-rich surface layers on the alloys, demonstrating surface segregation under reaction conditions.

3. Thin Pt skin forms: The Pt-rich surface layer was estimated to be very thin, around 1 nm thick, based on XPS analysis.

4. Bulk composition maintained: Despite surface segregation, the overall bulk composition of the alloys remained unchanged after electrochemical testing.

5. Enhanced catalytic activity: The Pt-Fe alloys exhibited significantly improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction compared to pure Pt, even with the Pt-rich surface layer.

These findings suggest that while thermodynamic preferences may favor certain bulk structures, reaction conditions can induce surface segregation in Pt-based alloys. The resulting thin Pt-rich surface layer, influenced by the underlying alloy, can lead to enhanced catalytic properties. This highlights the importance of considering both bulk and surface structures when designing and evaluating bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

该文献提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响基于铂的双金属催化剂的见解：

1. 制备方法影响结构：在室温下进行溅射产生了铂-铁合金在不同成分下的面心立方结构，尽管热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3。

2. 表面偏析发生：电化学测量导致合金表面形成富铂层，表明在反应条件下发生了表面偏析。

3. 形成薄铂皮层：基于XPS分析，估计富铂表面层非常薄，约1纳米厚。

4. 保持整体成分：尽管发生表面偏析，但合金的整体体相成分在电化学测试后保持不变。

5. 增强的催化活性：即使有富铂表面层，铂-铁合金相比纯铂表现出显著提高的氧还原反应催化活性。

这些发现表明，虽然热力学偏好可能有利于某些体相结构，但反应条件可以在基于铂的合金中诱导表面偏析。由底层合金影响的薄富铂表面层可导致增强的催化性能。这强调了在设计和评估用于各种应用的双金属催化剂时，考虑体相和表面结构的重要性。
