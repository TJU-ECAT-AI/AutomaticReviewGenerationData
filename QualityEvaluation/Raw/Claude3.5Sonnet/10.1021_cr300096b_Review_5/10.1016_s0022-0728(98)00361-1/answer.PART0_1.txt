[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures [14]."

[2] "We have found that a fine Pt alloy catalyst is covered with a pure Pt skin under the practical operation conditions in PAFCs [8]. Although the present experimental conditions are much milder than those in PAFCs, the formation of a similar Pt skin layer could be predicted on PtFe alloys even under the present experimental conditions."

[3] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[4] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. 

In the case of PtFe alloys, the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures. However, when prepared by sputtering at room temperature, these alloys exhibit only a face-centered cubic structure with lattice parameters changing systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe.

Under electrochemical conditions, even mild ones, Pt tends to segregate to the surface, forming a pure Pt skin layer. This surface segregation occurs despite the bulk composition remaining unchanged, as evidenced by EDX measurements. The thickness of this Pt skin layer is crucial for the catalytic properties of the alloy.

The catalytic enhancement observed in these systems appears to be dramatically affected by the thickness of the Pt skin. When the skin is thin enough, the electronic structure of the surface Pt can be modified by the underlying bulk alloy, leading to significant enhancement of catalytic activity. However, as the skin layer thickens, this modification diminishes, potentially explaining the controversial enhancement effects reported in various studies.

These findings have important implications for catalytic performance in various applications. The ability to control the surface composition and electronic structure through alloying and reaction conditions offers a pathway to tune catalytic properties. However, the dynamic nature of these systems under reaction conditions, particularly the formation and evolution of the Pt skin layer, presents both challenges and opportunities for catalyst design and optimization.

热力学偏好和反应条件对基于Pt的双金属催化剂（尤其是Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。

对于PtFe合金，热力学稳定相是Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3或它们的混合物。然而，当在室温下通过溅射制备时，这些合金仅表现出面心立方结构，其晶格参数在纯Pt和Fe之间系统地变化。

在电化学条件下，即使是温和的条件，Pt也倾向于偏析到表面，形成纯Pt皮层。尽管体相成分保持不变（通过EDX测量证实），这种表面偏析仍然发生。这个Pt皮层的厚度对合金的催化性能至关重要。

这些系统中观察到的催化增强效应似乎受Pt皮层厚度的显著影响。当皮层足够薄时，表面Pt的电子结构可以被下层的体相合金修饰，导致催化活性显著增强。然而，随着皮层变厚，这种修饰效应减弱，这可能解释了各种研究中报道的有争议的增强效应。

这些发现对各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。通过合金化和反应条件控制表面成分和电子结构的能力为调整催化性能提供了途径。然而，这些系统在反应条件下的动态特性，特别是Pt皮层的形成和演变，为催化剂设计和优化带来了挑战和机遇。
