[1] "All five samples of Pt(100x)Fex (x=1875 at.%) exhibited only a face centered cubic structure and the lattice parameters changed systematically between those of pure Pt and Fe due to the preparation by sputtering at r.t., although the thermodynamically stable phases are Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3 or their mixtures [14]."

[2] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."

[3] "It is clear that all of the alloy surfaces were covered with Pt layers after the electrochemical measurement. Nevertheless, their compositions determined with EDX, which can detect elements existing in the bulk of alloys more sensitively than XPS, coincided well with those of the original electrodes."

[4] "These results indicate that the thickness of the Pt layer should be very thin. Actually, the thickness could be evaluated roughly based on a theory of XPS analysis [11], i.e. B1 nm."

The literature provides insights into how reaction conditions influence the stability and surface configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts:

1. While thermodynamically stable phases of Pt-Fe alloys include Pt3Fe, PtFe, and PtFe3, the preparation method (sputtering at room temperature) resulted in a face-centered cubic structure across all compositions studied.

2. Under electrochemical conditions, a thin Pt skin layer (approximately 1 nm thick) forms on the alloy surface, regardless of the bulk composition.

3. Despite surface segregation of Pt, the bulk composition remains stable, as evidenced by EDX measurements matching the original electrode compositions.

4. The presence of this Pt skin does not negate the enhanced catalytic activity of the alloys, suggesting that the electronic structure of the bulk alloy still influences the surface properties.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties:

1. The surface composition differs from the bulk, which can affect reactivity.
2. The thin Pt skin allows for electronic modification by the underlying alloy, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity.
3. The stability of the bulk composition suggests these catalysts may maintain their performance over time, though long-term stability studies would be needed to confirm this.

Overall, the study demonstrates that reaction conditions significantly influence surface segregation in Pt-Fe alloys, creating a complex interplay between surface and bulk properties that ultimately determines catalytic performance.

该文献提供了关于反应条件如何影响Pt-Fe双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面构型的见解：

1. 虽然Pt-Fe合金的热力学稳定相包括Pt3Fe、PtFe和PtFe3，但制备方法（室温下溅射）导致所有研究的成分都呈面心立方结构。

2. 在电化学条件下，无论体相成分如何，合金表面都会形成一层薄的Pt皮层（厚度约1纳米）。

3. 尽管Pt在表面发生偏析，但体相成分保持稳定，这一点由EDX测量与原始电极成分相匹配得到证实。

4. 这种Pt皮层的存在并不会抵消合金的增强催化活性，表明体相合金的电子结构仍然影响着表面性质。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 表面成分与体相不同，这可能会影响反应活性。
2. 薄的Pt皮层允许底层合金对其进行电子修饰，从而贡献于增强的催化活性。
3. 体相成分的稳定性表明这些催化剂可能会随时间保持其性能，尽管需要进行长期稳定性研究来确认这一点。

总的来说，该研究表明反应条件显著影响Pt-Fe合金中的表面偏析，在表面和体相性质之间创造了一种复杂的相互作用，最终决定了催化性能。
