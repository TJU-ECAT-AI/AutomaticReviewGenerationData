[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Figure 5 shows the characteristic spectra for Pt(111), 1 ML PtCoPt(111), 1 ML CoPtPt(111), and thick Co film on Pt(111) [>10 ML] exposed to 200 L O2. ... This qualitatively verifies the DFT prediction that the surface CoPtPt(111) configuration is preferred with adsorbed oxygen."

[3] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data as shown in Figs. 6b and 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is determined to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Fig. 2), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

[4] "Comparing these bimetallic systems, all the Pt3dPt(100) structures are predicted to have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. For the Pt3d, the PtNiPt system is predicted to be the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, having the highest activation barriers for the (111) and (100) crystal facets."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is highly dependent on the environment they are exposed to.

In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface configuration (PtMPt) is thermodynamically preferred for Pt-3d alloys. However, when exposed to oxygen, the surface configuration (MPtPt) becomes more stable. This adsorbate-induced segregation has been both predicted by DFT calculations and experimentally verified.

The activation barriers for this oxygen-induced segregation vary among different Pt-3d systems. For example, the activation barrier for Co segregation is lower than that for Ni, indicating that PtNiPt is more resistant to oxygen-induced segregation than PtCoPt. Additionally, the crystal facet plays a role, with Pt3dPt(100) structures generally having higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to Pt3dPt(111) structures.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The subsurface configuration often exhibits enhanced catalytic activity for certain reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. However, the tendency for surface segregation in oxygen-rich environments can lead to changes in surface composition and potentially affect catalyst performance over time.

The stability and segregation behavior of these bimetallic catalysts are crucial factors in their practical applications. Understanding these phenomena allows for the rational design of more stable and efficient catalysts for specific reaction environments. For instance, catalysts that resist surface segregation in oxygen-rich environments may maintain their enhanced activity for longer periods in fuel cell applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些催化剂的稳定性高度依赖于它们所处的环境。

在真空和吸附氢的条件下，Pt-3d合金的亚表面构型（PtMPt）在热力学上是优选的。然而，当暴露在氧气中时，表面构型（MPtPt）变得更加稳定。这种吸附剂诱导的偏析已经通过DFT计算预测并通过实验验证。

这种氧诱导偏析的活化能在不同的Pt-3d系统中有所不同。例如，Co的偏析活化能比Ni低，表明PtNiPt比PtCoPt更能抵抗氧诱导偏析。此外，晶面也起着作用，Pt3dPt(100)结构的氧诱导偏析活化能通常比Pt3dPt(111)结构高。

这些结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。亚表面构型通常对某些反应（如燃料电池中的氧还原反应）表现出增强的催化活性。然而，在富氧环境中表面偏析的倾向可能导致表面成分的变化，并可能随时间影响催化剂性能。

这些双金属催化剂的稳定性和偏析行为是其实际应用中的关键因素。理解这些现象可以为特定反应环境设计更稳定、更高效的催化剂提供理论基础。例如，在富氧环境中能够抵抗表面偏析的催化剂可能在燃料电池应用中保持较长时间的增强活性。
